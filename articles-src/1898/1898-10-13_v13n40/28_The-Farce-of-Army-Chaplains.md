*"The Independent," New York.*

The Regular Army has been increased about two and a half times. The staff corps have had large additions. For example, the medical corps, which embraced nearly two hundred surgeons before the war began, has been largely increased, and the same is true as to all other branches of the regulars, save the chaplains. Everything has been done, or at least attempted, to add to the facilities of all these departments of the army.

But the chaplains, only thirty-four in number—a number very small even in the light of conditions existing through all the past years—have not had a single addition to their number. If we can judge from the service papers there does not seem to have been a suggestion made by the War Department or Congress looking to such increase, or recognizing any special need of chaplains with the troops. Except the four regimental chaplains of the colored regiments, who would, of course, accompany their regiments the same as any other regimental officer, only about five or six of the remaining thirty have been ordered to accompany troops to the front. And these were sent only on their urgent request, and, with one exception, a month or so after the troops were ordered toward Cuba. And these have been furnished no forage allowance to enable them to keep a horse, although all the other staff corps and even the volunteer chaplains have been paid and provided for as mounted officers; nor have they been provided with any special facilities in any way for their work. The rest of the thirty—some twenty-four of them—have been left at posts where nearly all of the troops have been ordered away, with possibly one or two exceptions. One of them, at a nearly abandoned post, has been commissary officer, another quartermaster, etc. No one in authority seemed to think they were needed to do any religious work with troops in the field.

All this corroborates the statement of General Sherman, based upon their fewness of numbers compared with the number of army posts, along with his general knowledge of the entire situation, that the Regular Army chaplaincy "is a farce," and was "intended to be such from the beginning." In addition to this, it is apparent that the main part of the efficient religious work done for troops in the field, and especially for the regulars, has been by the workers of the Army and Navy Christian Commission. It is true a few of the regular chaplains have shown a heroic spirit with troops in the field, and helped them all they could. It is also true that more of the volunteer chaplains, fresh from the home churches, and with men in part fresh from the home churches and the homes of the people, and with the moral and religious spirit and enthusiasm of both chaplains and men not as yet browbeaten and largely crushed by the spirit that dominates Regular Army life, have accomplished a good work. But it is a certainty that little would have been heard of any considerable positive and distinct evangelizing or other religious work being done had it not been for what has been accomplished by General Howard, Mr. Moody and their co-workers. And this seems to support the contention of some shrewd observers that the army chaplaincy as an evangelizing agency is a failure, and that it had better be laid aside, and the work to be done left to the voluntary effort of the churches.
