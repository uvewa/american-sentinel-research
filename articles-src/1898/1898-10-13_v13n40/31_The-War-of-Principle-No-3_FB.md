"Well, to come back to our discussion, Aleck, it seems to me I have found a very good example of the disunion caused by the proclamation of Christian principles. You remember the experience of the apostles with the Ephesians?"

"Yes, certainly, Cecil. But I cannot see that their experience gives you any reason for prohibiting the principles."

"Well, you remember they worshiped Diana, a very harmless goddess. In fact, it says that not only all Asia worshiped her; but the whole world. Because of this worship the silversmiths had a good trade in images. Everything was running on in harmony, when Paul, Gaius, and Aristarchus began to preach the doctrines of Christianity. Now what happens?—In the first place a great stir; in the second place a convention of workingmen, fearful of losing their trade, and thereby their living; then a whole city thrown into confusion. Then the disturbers of the peace rushed before magistrates. And there for hours they gave vent to their reverence for the goddess. Now it seems to me that is a sample of what follows the preaching of distinctive principles."

"But, Cecil, that was not the end of the matter. When you drop yeast into the flour, of course, there is a stir, and every particle is converted; but the end of the leavening process is not merely fermentation, but bread. In the first place, the disciples had not decried Diana."

"Not directly, of course; but in principle they had. As soon as they taught men of one true God, the Creator of all; they did virtually decry Diana. And it's the same thing in all ages. Those who teach men to confess to God alone, decry the confessional of the Catholic Church. Those who teach that the seventh day is the Sabbath, decry Sunday observance. Diana stood for the religion of the Ephesians, and when Paul preached the religion of Christ, he did undermine Diana."

"Well, certainly, looking at it in that way; but in doing this Paul said he declared to them 'the whole counsel of God.'"

"It seems a pity that the counsel of God seems to strike across the very things we have been taught to revere from our babyhood. Now I really pity the Ephesians, and do not wonder that they shouted themselves hoarse over Diana. Human nature, you know, is conservative, and when our cherished customs and traditions are attacked, it rouses all there is in us."

"And yet, my friend, there were many of the Ephesians, who felt that they had come out of gross darkness into marvelous light. There were those who had been dissatisfied with Diana, and longed for God, and their cherished customs went for naught. They had a vision of the divine and eternal, and set their affection on things above."

"There it is again, Aleck. The religion of the so-called heathen people, does not separate them from the world. But Christianity seems irrational and unreasonable. Why should you set aside the world, and begin straightway to live as if it were doomed to destruction. Should we follow the Christian religion, what would become of literature, art, invention, and progress? The very bottom principle of it sends us back to the most primitive simplicity. Besides, it has cut the brotherhood of man into sects and scisms."

"I do not agree with your conclusions, Cecil. While it is true that Christianity centers one's thoughts above, it does not unfit us for the very highest sphere of usefulness here. It was in ages when the light of Christianity died out that men retrograded toward barbarism, while the greatest revival of letters, art, and invention has followed the light of the Reformation. The liberty of the gospel gives to every man the right of private judgment, and this is at the very basis of progress. Your principle of letting all things remain as they are, is at the basis of retrogression. It is a human principle; for everywhere one finds stakes set to limit thought, faith, and action. Every creed is a man-made stake. But in spite of yourself and your principle, you are an Athenian."

"No, sir. I do not desire some new thing. Our age is too busy as it is. What we need now is every Janusgate closed. We have our educational system, we have our military, we have our state policy, we have our religions. We are beginning to develop toward union and brotherhood. A disturbance in religious thought is a disturbance of everything, so I'll cry down any new theory or doctrine that promises irritation."

"How far would you carry out your 'cry'?" asked Aleck.

"Just as far as I had power. I sympathize heartily with the emperors of Rome. When they found their institutions attacked by the aggressive sect, who did not come to join on to what had already been attained, they brought upon them the force of existing laws. Why did they not conform, and wherever they went, become good citizens?"

"They did conform to every just and reasonable law. They were good citizens in the best sense of the word; for they carried out the principle of love to God and man. Christianity, as a writer says, 'Is not a creed, but a life;' not a body of doctrines, formulated by men; but the expression of a divine character. This is the difference between the faith of Christ and the creeds of men. Rome had a creed enforced by law. Christians could not recognize the creed, or respect the law. Both were outside the functions of state."

"I know Christians claim that they were persecuted," said Cecil, "but if I read history right, they suffered for non-conformity to law."

"So they did," said Aleck, "and they were right in claiming they were persecuted. Human law is not the ultimatum. The Christians had a God to whom they owed allegiance, and any human law that contravened that obligation was rightfully disregarded by them. God demands this kind of loyalty." F. B.
