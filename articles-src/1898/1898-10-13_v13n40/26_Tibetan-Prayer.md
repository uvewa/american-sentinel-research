The value of formal prayer—of the letter without the spirit—is illustrated in the lives of the inhabitants of Thibet. "The Tibetans," says *The Missionary Alliance*, are the most preeminent praying people on the face of the earth. They have praying-stones, praying-pyramids, praying-flags flying over every house, praying-wheels, praying mills, and the universal prayer, 'Om mani pad me haun,' is never out of their mouths. A German writer on Lamaism says of this sentence, which literally means, 'Oh, God! the jewel in the lotus,' that these six syllables are, of all the prayers on earth, the one which is most frequently repeated, written, printed, and conveniently offered up by mechanical means. They constitute the only power which the common Mongols and Tibetans know; they are the first words which the stammering children learn, and are the last sighs of the dying."
