A sect which calls itself the "Church of America," and seems to be of rather recent origin, presents a striking illustration of the tendency of the times to combine religion with politics and with whatever stands for respectability in worldliness. The "primate and first bishop" of the church, whose portrait appears in the *Fraternal Monitor*, "is a member of the Independent Order of Mechanics, Improved Order of Red Men, Ancient Order of Druids, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons;" and also "deputy grand representative," of "the Royal Masonic Rite in the thirty-third and ninety-fifth degrees, grand representative of A. and P. Rite of Memphis," and "a member of three Masonic bodies in Brooklyn in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite," etc. The *Monitor* mentions that "the first mission church will be opened for public worship"—whereabouts not stated—"about October 30;" that President McKinley has been invited to attend the opening service. "A young lady will sprinkle holy water around the church building, which will be called St. Paul Mission." Its bishop is certainly well qualified as a ceremonialist.
