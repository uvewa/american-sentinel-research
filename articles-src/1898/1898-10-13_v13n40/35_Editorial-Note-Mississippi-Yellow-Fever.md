The State of Mississippi has appealed to the Federal Government for help to cope with yellow fever, which is spreading in a number of cities and towns. Strict quarantine regulations which are enforced against the infected district have caused much distress within the state, and thousands are threatened with starvation. This is one of the latest fruits of the war.
