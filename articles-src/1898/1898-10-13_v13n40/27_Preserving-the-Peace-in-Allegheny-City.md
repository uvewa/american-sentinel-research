The good people of Allegheny City, Pa., entertain peculiar views on the question of what is necessary to preserve the public peace. In the view of a number of the city clergymen, the peace of the city is being disturbed by the preaching of religious doctrines contrary to the generally-accepted beliefs, on the part of two men who are conducting meetings in a tent. One of the latter writes concerning these clergymen that they "are counseling together (Protestants and Catholics in union), and have informed us that they are circulating a petition to compel us to leave the city, because we molested the peace of the different churches."

And while this is going on, it is announced that "Police Superintendent Muth, of Allegheny, says that Corbett and McCoy can spar here during the week of the Knights Templars conclave"—though not to a finish—and that "the city will be open to all kinds of legitimate sport for the entertainment of the visitors." It is a very peculiar kind of peace which is not disturbed by the presence of the class which always gathers at the ringside of a meeting between noted pugilists, but cannot tolerate two men who are conducting peaceful gospel services in a tent. However, we do not expect the petition of the clergymen to succeed.
