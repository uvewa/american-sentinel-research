By Bishop Hoadly.

It is the greatest and most irreconcilable enemy to truth and argument that this world ever furnished. All the sophistry, all the color of plausibility, all the artifice and cunning of the subtlest disputer in the world may be laid open and turned to the advantage of that very truth which they are designed to hide; but against authority there is no defense. It was authority which crushed the noble sentiments of Socrates and others; by authority the Jews and heathen combatted the truth of the gospel; and when Christians increased into a majority and came to think the same method to be the only proper one for the advantage of their cause, which had been their enemy and destroyer of it, then it was the authority of Christians which, by degrees, not only laid waste the honor of Christianity, but well nigh extinguished it among men. It was authority which would have prevented all reformation where it is, and which has put a barrier against it wherever it is not.
