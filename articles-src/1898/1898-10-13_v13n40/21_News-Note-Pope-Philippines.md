An Associated Press dispatch mentions an interview had by Mr. W. T. Stead, the English journalist, with a prominent statesman of Belgium, a Catholic, who had just returned from Rome, where he had been in consultation with the pope and the papal secretary of state, Cardinal Rampolla. To the question whether the pope favored religious liberty for the Philippines, the statesman made the honest reply that the pope could not so express himself "without repudiating doctrines affirmed by his predecessors." To declare himself in favor of such liberty now would also raise the query why he did not favor it before the islands passed from the control of Spain.
