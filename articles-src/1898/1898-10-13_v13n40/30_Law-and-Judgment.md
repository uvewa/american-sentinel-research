However forgetful men may be of law and judgment, neither law nor judgment will be forgetful of them. If these are not taken into account by men, men will be taken into account by them. Law is over them, and about them on all sides, and at all times, and judgment follows after, so keen-scented that it never loses track of those it seeks. One can no more get away from them than he can get away from his shadow in the sunshine. The demands of law are continual, and no deafness or disregard will suppress them. They are eternal, and will never lose their grip.—The Examiner.
