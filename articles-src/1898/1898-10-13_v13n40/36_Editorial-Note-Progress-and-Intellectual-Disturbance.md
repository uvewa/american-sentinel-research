Life means progress, and progress means the frequent shocking of old ideas and traditions by new doctrines. Such intellectual commotions should be welcomed, and not sought to be suppressed, as is so frequently done. China furnishes the world today an illustration of the effect of long continuance in the old ruts of thought and custom. There has been no disturbance of the intellectual repose of China for hundreds of years, and as a consequence, there has been no progress, and the great empire finds itself at last without strength, and an easy prey to the aggressive nations around it.
