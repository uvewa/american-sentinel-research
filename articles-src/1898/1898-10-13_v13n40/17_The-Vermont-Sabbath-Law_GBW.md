BY GEO. B. WHEELER.

In the Declaration of Rights, in the constitution of Vermont, article 3, it is declared, "All men have a natural an inalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences and understandings, as in their opinion shall be regulated by the Word of God." . . . "No authority can, or ought to be vested in, or assumed by, any power whatever, that shall in any case interfere with, or in any manner control the rights of conscience, in the free exercise of religious worship."

It is plainly stated here, that every man's right to regulate his worship of God, in accordance with his opinion of the requirements of the Word of God, is a natural and inalienable one. That is, a right that no power is justified in taking away from him. And this is further emphasized by denying that any authority or power whatever has any right to interfere with or control it.

Yet, notwithstanding this clear statement of the Declaration of Rights of the State of Vermont, there is on the statute books of the State a Sabbath law, which, under the head of "An Act in Relation to Sabbath-breaking," prohibits all citizens of the State from engaging in any business or employment, excepting works of necessity or charity, or engaging in any game, sport, play, or amusement upon Sunday, the first day of the week.

This decides a controverted point as to which day is the Sabbath, and denies to the people of the State a right that is declared by its constitution to be "a natural and inalienable" one,—to follow the dictates of their own consciences, and their own opinion of what the Word of God teaches as to which day is the Sabbath.

While the constitution declares that "every sect or denomination of Christians ought to observe the Sabbath or Lord's day," it does not designate which day is the Sabbath or Lord's day, nor does it lay the obligation upon any but Christians.

It is true that a large majority of the Christian people of the State regard the first day of the week as the Sabbath or the Lord's day. It is also true that it was through their influence that the Sabbath laws of the State were made, and it is through their influence that they are at the present time supported. This action on their part recognizes it as just and right, for that part of the religious community that has the greatest influence in the State, to put their interpretation upon one of God's commandments, and then go to the legislature and get power to compel all others regardless of belief, wishes, or interests to conform to it. All persecuting governments in the past have done nothing more than to carry out this principle, and if it is correct, they are justified in their persecutions.

There are in the State of Vermont nearly six hundred Christian people, who have the reputation of being earnest and consistent, who read the Word of God that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God" instead of the first. They also believe that the Word of God teaches that it is wrong to give to any other day than the Sabbath, the sacred character of the Sabbath, by abstaining from both labor and amusements. They also believe that it is wrong to pay fines for exercising their right of opinion, instead of conforming to the opinions of others as to which day is the Sabbath or Lord's day.

The Sabbath laws of Vermont if enforced would place every one of these six hundred Christian people in prison as criminals, for doing what the Declaration of Rights in the constitution of the State declares they have "a natural and inalienable right" to do, in regulating their worship of God in accordance with their own opinion of his requirements.

The Declaration of Rights and the Sabbath law of Vermont directly antagonize each other. If the position of one is true the other is absolutely false, and consistency would demand that either one or the other be abolished.

An examination of the civil reasons that are used to justify Sunday laws will show their fallacy. It is declared that it is for the individual's physical, moral, and social good to rest upon Sunday. Many arguments are used to prove this.

To compel an individual to rest Sunday for his own good, is to take away his right of private judgment in a matter that pertains to his own good, which right lies at the very basis of civil liberty. If it is right to invade that right in one instance, it is right to invade it in others, and so on, until absolutely nothing is left to the individual's own judgment, and all of his rights are taken away.

Ordinary labor and harmless amusements are certainly not criminal in themselves therefore every citizen has the right in accordance with the great principle of liberty upon which this nation was founded, to engage in them whenever it may in his judgment contribute most to his own happiness.

Another reason given for Sunday laws, which compel a cessation from both labor and amusement, is, the claim of those who regard Sunday as a sacred day, to what they term their "right to an undisturbed use of the day for worship."

The fact that on the day these people believe to be sacred other people are engaged in labor or amusements, is not a disturbance of their worship, unless they are disturbed when engaged in the act of worshiping; and as all worshiping congregations are protected by law from disturbance upon all days of the week, it follows that their disturbance is only a mental one that comes from seeing others refusing to conform to their views of the sacred character of the day. This reason is not a valid one unless it is recognized that the Government has the right to protect individuals from a religious mental disturbance, which comes from seeing others refusing to conform to their religious belief. Conformity to religious belief was all that was ever asked for by persecuting governments.

Chief Justice Ruffin, of the Supreme Court of North Carolina (State vs. Williams, Iredell, 403), officially acknowledges this, thereby proving the truth of this statement. He says: "The truth is, that it [Sunday labor or amusements] offends us not so much because it disturbs us in practising for ourselves the religious duties, or enjoying the salutary repose or recreation, of that day, as that it is in itself a breach of God's law, and a violation of the party's own religious duty."—American State Papers, p. 61.

Moreover, in accordance with the great principle of equal rights, the majority, however large, have no right to claim rights and privileges which they would refuse to the minority; and the fact that they do not recognize that the minority, who keep another day than Sunday as sacred, have any such right as to demand that all the people in the entire State be compelled to cease from both labor and amusements, so that they may not be disturbed in their worship upon the day that they believe to be sacred, shows that it is something that they have no right to demand for themselves.

Another reason that is given largely for the compulsory cessation of both labor and amusements on Sunday is "the right of the workingman to his day of rest." There must be laws "to prevent Sunday slavery by preventing employers from compelling unwilling employés to labor on Sunday against their will."

The fact is, Sunday laws furnish more than the "right of the workingmen to his day of rest," they take away his civil rights by compelling him to rest whether he wants to or not. If the object was simply to furnish a weekly day of rest for the workingman, and to prevent him from being forced to labor every day in the week for fear of losing his job if he refuses, a simple law would be advocated compelling all employers to give their employés simply a release (not an enforced cessation) from labor, on every seventh day following six days of consecutive labor. This would accomplish the purpose far more effectually than the present Sunday laws, as it would give a day of rest to that great army of employés who are obliged to labor seven days in the week at works of necessity.

Laws that go beyond furnishing the citizen an opportunity to rest, and that make cessation from labor compulsory, are tyrannical in their character, and are a violation of the great American principle of liberty.

The true ground upon which all Sunday legislation rests is not civil, but religious. This is evident to any who will look over the literature upon the subject. The burden of the argument of Sunday law advocates is, that the day is sacred, and therefore ought not to be desecrated. It will be seen from this that the spirit that supports Sunday legislation is the spirit of intolerance; because its advocates cannot tolerate a course of action in others that is not in conformity with their own idea of how a particular day of the week, which they believe to be sacred, ought to be kept.

If it is true, as many claim, that the welfare of the nation depends upon the keeping of Sunday as a sacred day, secured by the power of the state, then the welfare of the nation depends upon an act of intolerance, and the only logic of it is, that other acts of intolerance will be urged upon the nation to further strengthen it; which, indeed, is already being done, and soon we shall be back to the intolerance of the Dark Ages.

The true object of the state so far as religion is concerned, is to protect all persons in all of their religious observances so far as they do not infringe upon the equal rights of their neighbors, and never to uphold the observance of a religious institution, nor the acknowledgement of any religious doctrine.
