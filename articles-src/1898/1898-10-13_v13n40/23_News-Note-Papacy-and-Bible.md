The following item from the Catholic Times, of London, Eng., sets forth the attitude of the papacy towards the Bible, which is seen to be quite the same as it was in the Dark Ages. Speaking of the slaughter of the Khalifa's troops by the English in the Soudan, the Times says:—

"How was it, we may ask, that these sons of the desert, who must have seen that they were fighting for a hopeless cause, threw away their lives so prodigally and seemed positively to court death? Well, many men have been known to prefer death to a fate that was even worse. And there was a worse fate than death in store for the Dervish warriors. The Rev. R. H. Weakley, so we learn from one of our contemporaries, had in store for the 2,000 prisoners of war, after the battle of Atbara, a consignment of Scripture in the vernacular. Luckily, when he came to look for the recipients of his Scriptures, he found that no Baggara had been taken prisoners. They had neither given nor taken quarter."
