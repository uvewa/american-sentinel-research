Taking a look at the prospects for war or peace, the candid observer is compelled to admit that the prospects for general war the whole world over are greater than those for the hoped-for universal peace. The unstable condition of the peace of Europe and Asia is well known; and it is apparent that there may be a resumption of hostilities between America and Spain. And upon investigation it appears that an outbreak of war between Chile and Argentina, which is expected, is likely to be as fatal to the peace of the South American states as would war between two nations of Europe be to the peace on that continent. The peace equilibrium of South America is as unstable as that of Europe. On this subject a leading New York weekly says:—

"In case there should be war growing out of the boundary dispute between Chile and Argentina, what would be the probable result in South America? In the first place, the two natural enemies of Argentina, which is now the most prosperous state in that continent, are Chile and Brazil. Both are naturally jealous of Argentina's prosperity; Chile on account of the boundary dispute, and Brazil because of the hereditary political enmity between the Portuguese and Spaniards, and her attitude toward the commercial development of the River Plate. Little Uruguay is also a thorn in Brazil's side. In her territory many of the insurrections in Brazil are hatched, and Brazil is prevented only by Argentina from crushing these in the nest.

"Paraguay's position is neutral, but Peru and Bolivia will be in sympathy with Argentina, for the reason that they both were defeated by Chile in the war of 1881. It has been the dream of Peru ever since to get back the conquered provinces of Tacna and Arica, whose nitrate mines have since yielded Chile $300,000,000; while Bolivia, with equal zeal, has striven to regain the outlet to the ocean which was taken away from her. Uruguay would have to take part, willing or unwilling, in any general war, on account of the strategic situation of Montevideo. Nowhere else nearer than Rio del Janeiro could the combined fleets of Chile and Brazil refit, and it is the only base from which could be maintained a blockade of the River Plate.

"As Argentina would doubtless seize Montevideo first, we might see a coalition of Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, and Bolivia, while every effort would be made, possibly with success, to bring Brazil to the side of Chile. Such an alliance would undoubtedly win, because of the superiority of their fleets and the fact that they could throw their armies upon Argentina from both east and west. Of course the probabilities are that there will be no such universal conflagration; and yet, now that the ball of war has been set rolling in the Western Hemisphere, nobody knows what it will hit.

"It should be added that Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador have no special preferences toward either side. Their interests are bound up rather with the Central American States."
