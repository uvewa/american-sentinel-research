The pope has sprung a surprise upon the promoters of the czar's universal peace congress. Two Italian journals published in Rome, speaking for the Vatican, have pronounced as follows:—

"Disarmament implies peace; but how can continued peace in Europe be guaranteed so long as the question of the pope's temporal power is left open?"

Sure enough! How could it be expected that the pope would consent to continue a "prisoner" in the Vatican just for the sake of universal peace? Statesmen should have thought of this before. The pope must be restored to temporal power or there will be no peace.

The light in which the pope by this act has placed himself is indicated by the *Tribuna*, in calling attention to the "dreadful fact," that "while all the powers of Europe are dreaming of universal peace, the chief of the Catholic Church, who claims to represent Christ on earth, alone preaches war."
