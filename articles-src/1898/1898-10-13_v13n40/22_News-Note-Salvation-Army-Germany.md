SENSATIONALISM in religious work is never wise, either from a religious or a business point of view. A London (Eng.) paper relates an incident of Salvation Army work in Neustadt, Germany, which illustrates the point. The Army had advertised an approaching meeting at which, it was stated, they would expose "the greatest liar in Neustadt." The Army referred to the devil; but the police of Neustadt, not fathoming the intended meaning of the words, decided that the language might be aimed at some of the citizens, or that at least some of the citizens might feel that it was, and accordingly the editor of the paper and the captain of the Army were each fined twenty marks—or in default ten days' imprisonment—on the charge of doing what was calculated to create a disturbance.
