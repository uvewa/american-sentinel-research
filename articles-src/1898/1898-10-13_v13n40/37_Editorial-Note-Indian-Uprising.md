A serious Indian uprising in the Northwest has been suppressed by the troops after considerable bloodshed and loss of life. The trouble, it is stated, is due to the scant curtesy with which the Indians are treated by the authorities of the Government. In the present case they feared that they would be removed from their lands without compensation for their labor in building homes and adding other improvements on their farms; and this fear appears to have been well grounded. As a daily of this city observes, "Such an injustice would not have been the first wrong of the kind inflicted upon Indian tribes by our authorities. More than one bloody war has sprung from this very cause." "To pick them up and move them on whenever white speculators covet their lands is a wrong like those that have brought retribution upon Spain."
