An appeal for relief has been made by Cuban soldiers, who are in a condition similar to that of the reconcentrados when the war began. Being bound by the terms of peace not to take food from the Spanish towns by force, and the Spanish authorities refusing either to sell food to them or barter with them, they have become reduced to the last extremity, and without relief must soon perish from starvation.
