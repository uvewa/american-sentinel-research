The trouble with the liberty question is, as with a coat that has been pieced out over a figure for which it was never intended, either in measurement or style. Of course, there is no fit to it.

The "great majority" has childishly appropriated this coat, and is trying to struggle into it while it is perfectly plain that it can only "set well" on the individual man for whom it was originally constructed.

An elephant might wear his keeper's jacket with the same grace with which the "people" can put on liberty. We often hear it said that "personal rights" are limited by "popular liberty." "The greatest good for the greatest number," has become a sort of war cry, when, per contra, there can be no "popular liberty" until personal rights have been secured; no good to any two until the good of the one has been secured. Just as long as it is possible for the liberty of one man, and he the weakest of them all, to be curtailed in any degree by law or in spite of law, then there is a point at which any, every and all other "liberties" are endangered. A man may forfeit his liberty, but never his right to it.

Liberty cannot be made plural in principle or application. It is liberty pure and simple; it cannot be added, subtracted, multiplied, nor yet divided. It cannot be shared; it is as personal as love, as sacred as salvation, and as individual as life.

"Give me liberty or give me death," was no oratorical climax; it was the cry of a soul, and it finds an echo in every other soul that ever breathed.

We know that the conditions of human life in the days upon which we have fallen are such that the "inalienable" rights of man will be alienated more and more at every point which can be reached by iron-handed selfishness wearing the mask of love for "the people." The man will be made subservient to the mass in all the concerns with which human greed and ambition are identified, until the end of time. The individual will be so covered up by the populace that it will take the eye in which is all light, to find the ones when they have been merged into the many; and to every soul, many of them true but bewildered, the greatest surprise of a life time will be the discovery that each was its self alone, and not a part of the great over-mastering whole.

This has already happened. It is nothing strange to see a strong man break down when a personal interest has been manifested in his individual case; while he has cried out: "What! for me, just me?" He had not thought of himself as "just me" separated even in his hunger, loneliness, sinning, and need of salvation from the "rest of 'em" with whom he has struggled for "their rights," or with whom he had tramped and huddled in; with whom he had slept in a five cent lodging, or out in the field, or over on the "Lake Front."

We know that the world is massing for the final shock. "United we stand, divided we fall" is the truth to which the nations have pinned their faith. This old notion expresses a truth, which is a truth in the right place; but out of the right place it is grievous error.

"O my soul, come not thou unto their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor be not thou united; for in their anger they slew a Man." Gen. 49:6.

"The unity of the spirit" with the "bond of peace" (Eph. 4:3) is the only combination which is safe among men.

"United with Christ" we stand, divided from him "we fall;" every separate individual for himself, and not another.

We cannot hope to make the unbelieving world comprehend what liberty means to us, but there is one thing that we should be able to do; to preserve it as a doctrine of truth in all our dealings with others, and as a blessed experience in our own lives.

The more closely we come to the days when the mouth that "boasteth great things" shall proclaim "liberty" for the many, without reference to the one here and another there, with whom the many are in controversy because of truth; the more important, the more blessed will it be for each one to know for himself what liberty is, that liberty with which Christ has made us free; and to have it (with our life and all our other treasures) "hid with Christ in God." Col. 3:3.

There is no such thing as national Christianity. Christianity cannot be national; it cannot partake of any characteristics of earthly powers. There cannot be American Christianity and German Christianity, English, French, or Russian Christianity. Christianity changes that which it touches, but is not at all changed itself. It is the same everywhere, is altogether divine, and altogether what it was in the life of Jesus of Nazareth.
