As almost everybody hereabouts knows, a state of serious dissension has arisen in one of the most prominent churches in this city, which has for a long period been under the pastorate of Dr. John Hall. We are informed that at a recent meeting of the church, the pastor "remarked that frequently people had said to him that they would like to attend his service regularly, but were unable to do so because they could not afford it;" and that "he took occasion to correct the impression that seats in the church cost hundreds of dollars, and pointed out that in the gallery they can be obtained for five dollars a year."

And what is the difference in that church between a five-dollar gallery member and a fifty-dollar front-pew member? What is the difference in the feelings of two such individuals as regards Christianity and the church? What is the difference in the view of the church? And what is the difference in the view of the world? And lastly but not least, what is the difference in the sight of God?

Can it be seriously expected that a church so conducted will be held together in the bonds of Christian unity?
