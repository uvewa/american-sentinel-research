This recent decision, of which we made mention last week, is one of no small importance in its bearing upon the subject of state aid to sectarianism, of which there have been and are still, numerous examples in this country. The following extracts cover the leading points of the decision:—

"Whatever authority the Commissioners of the District of Columbia possessed with reference to the subject, they could only have acquired from Congress, which of course could communicate to them no powers it did not constitutionally possess. Whatever acts were forbidden by the Constitution to Congress with respect to the assistance of religious establishments, were of course forbidden to its agents the Commissioners.

"The statute undoubtedly authorized the isolating buildings to be constructed in the discretion of the Commissioners either on the grounds of two hospitals; or perhaps on other lands not belonging to any hospital. By the contract the Commissioners agreed they would erect the building on the grounds of Providence Hospital, to be paid for out of the designated appropriations, and would turn it over when completed to the officers of the hospital, on condition that two thirds of its entire capacity should be reserved for the poor patients the Commissioners might send there.

"It is conceded by the demurrer that Providence Hospital is a corporation composed of members of a monastic order or sisterhood of the Roman Catholic Church, and that the title to its property is vested in the Sisters of Charity of Emmettsburg, a non-resident corporation.

"One who erects buildings on the land of another has no right to remove them against the will of the land owner. Whatever title the United States might claim in a building constructed by it upon the grounds of Providence Hospital, would be a species of continuing joint ownership or co-partnership between the Government on the one part, and a sectarian corporation having its habitat in the State of Maryland, on the other. In furtherance of such a joint enterprise the Government, as one of the associators, might reasonably be expected to make further contribution, if the sum already given should prove inadequate, or the building be injured or destroyed; with perhaps a moral responsibility to any patient receiving injury because of faulty construction. . . .

"Mr. Madison, in the message vetoing the Alexandria church bill, after noticing that it enacts into law a number of rules relative to the organization and polity of the church, adds: 'This particular church, therefore, would so far be a religious establishment by law; a legal force and sanction being given to certain articles in its constitution and administration.'

"In like manner I conceive the agreement before me undertakes in behalf of the public authorities to give 'legal force and sanction' to articles in the administration of the hospital which 'so far, would be a religious establishment by law,' and for that reason illegal. It is also worthy of remark that the Commissioners agree to pay at a designated rate for the patients they may send there, 'subject to annual appropriations by Congress;' while Section 81 of the Revised Statutes of the District (which, by the Act of 1879, is applicable to the Commissioners) declares the Commissioners 'shall have no power to make contracts to bind the District except in pursuance of appropriations made by law, and not until such appropriation shall have been made.'

"Besides, in the words of the provision before quoted, 'it is hereby enacted, that from and after the 30th day of June, 1898, no money appropriated for charitable purposes in the District of Columbia shall be paid to any church or religious denomination or to any institution or society which is under sectarian or ecclesiastical control'—which would render this obligation assumed by the Commissioners in the agreement incapable of performance after the date named.

"However incongruous such a joint ownership may be where the other party is non-sectarian in its character, I conceive it would also be an unlawful one, as against the spirit and purpose of the First Amendment, when such contracting party is a sectarian sisterhood of order under the auspices of a church or religious society."

"For the reasons given, I shall pass an order for an injunction against the treasurer as prayed in the bill with reference to the agreement of the 16th of August, 1897."
