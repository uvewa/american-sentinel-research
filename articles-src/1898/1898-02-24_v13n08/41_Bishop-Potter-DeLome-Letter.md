BISHOP POTTER is quoted as having expressed the following as his sentiments in reference to the incident of the DeLome letter, which has lately engaged the attention of this Government and of Spain:—

"I happen to know the gentleman. He is courteous and agreeable, but he has made a grievous mistake, and there is but one course for either country to pursue. The head of the government has been criticised, and there must be some public acknowledgment or apology by Spain. That letter was a terrible mistake, and De Lome's resignation does not release Spain from an apology nor this country from demanding one. It is not now a question of individuals, but of governments."

Is Bishop Potter aware that "this is a Christian nation"? or does he believe that it is good Christian conduct to demand satisfaction for slighted dignity?
