A "GRAND ARMY" commander at Oil City, Pa., writes us in regard to our issue of February 3, taking exception to what he calls our "attack on the teaching of patriotism in the public schools." That the flag salute teaches war, he says, "is not true, and you know it." "But," he adds, "I will tell you one thing: that the boys who made it possible for you to live under it [the flag], will also make it possible for your sect to respect it." In just what way this is to be done it is left to our imagination to depict.

We do not take exception to the flag salute on the ground that it teaches war, but on the ground that it requires a confession of belief in God. We thought we had made this plain in all our references to the subject. It is a fact however that the "patriotism" which in these days is being taught to the children in the schools does embody the war spirit. It is a fact that this teaching is training them for war. The ideals which it sets before the children are military ideals. They are trained to be "patriots" in "boys' brigades" with guns in their hands and the tactics of military drill in their heads. And not even the kindergarten is exempt from the inculcation of this military "patriotism."

It is perfectly natural, however, that it should be so, even in this land where militarism is not deemed a political necessity; for it is only human nature to glorify war. It is human nature to glorify a triumph of physical force. The successful military commander is a hero always. The Bible says that "Greater is he that ruleth his own spirit than he that taketh a city;" but the human ideal—the man who gets the glory—is always the one who takes the city. Human nature ascribes no particular credit to the man who can rule his own spirit; yet it is undoubtedly true that such a man is qualified above all others to serve his country.
