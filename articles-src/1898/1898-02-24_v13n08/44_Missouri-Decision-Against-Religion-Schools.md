A PRESS dispatch from Jefferson City, Mo., dated the 13th inst., states the following:—

"Attorney-General Crow has rendered an opinion to the State Superintendent of Public Schools which holds it unlawful for a teacher to require pupils to repeat the Lord's Prayer as a part of the opening exercises in the public schools of the State.

"It also holds that the reading of the Bible by the teachers as a part of the school exercises is contrary to the laws.

"The attorney general holds that these exercises are a form of religious worship and cannot be enforced upon the students under the State and Federal Constitutions."
