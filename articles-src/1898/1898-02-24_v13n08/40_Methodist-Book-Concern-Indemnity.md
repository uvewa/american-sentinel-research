A BILL is before Congress, and has already passed the House, to pay $288,000 indemnity to the agents of the Methodist Book Concern of Nashville, Tenn., for damages occasioned by the occupancy of their buildings by the Federal troops during the war. It is not denied that the buildings had previously been used by the Confederate authorities for the manufacture of arms and for printing literature to further the cause of secession. The "Methodist Church South," it is well known, was in sympathy with the South during the war. Hence the claim that seems now likely to be honored by Congress rests solely upon the ground that the Concern was a religious institution. Congress is asked to do for such an institution what it would not do for a secular institution. It is a perfectly plain case of state aid to sectarianism; but unfortunately the minds of many legislators are so befogged by precedents which overstep the dividing line between church and state, that they are slow to see and follow right principles in such cases.
