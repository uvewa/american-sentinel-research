CARDINAL GIBBONS, in the *Catholic Mirror*, Jan. 8, 1898, reports 1,500,000 as being educated in the Catholic schools of the United States at the present time; that "Missionary Bands" are carrying on work among non-Catholics in seventeen different dioceses, and that "30,000 persons are annually received into the Catholic Church in the United States" through conversion; 1,105 conversions have taken place in the archdiocese of Baltimore within the year. Surely that is a good showing for the future of Catholicism in the United States. And yet there are people who say, "There is no Catholic question in this country; Catholicism is dying out." A system which has fifteen hundred years of successful history back of it, and a million and a half of children under tutilage, in this country alone, is not yet ready to order its funeral appliances.
