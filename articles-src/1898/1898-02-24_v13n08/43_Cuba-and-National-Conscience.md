RECENTLY the Spanish minister to this Government made an uncomplimentary reference by letter to the President and people of the United States, and the country was greatly stirred by its discovery. Following this came the news of the blowing up of the warship "Maine" in Havana harbor, presumably by an enemy; and immediately there was great excitement everywhere and a loud call for decisive action by the Government against Spain. But for months the country has been almost an eyewitness of the spectacle of people dying of starvation by the hundred thousand on the shores of Cuba, and nothing that would compare with the present stir and excitement has been occasioned, although scarcely any one doubts that decisive action by this Government would put a speedy end to the Cuban horrors. This may be all consistent and proper from a political and diplomatic standpoint; but there is something curious about a situation where an uncomplimentary letter and the loss of a fine warship with two hundred and fifty-three men, terrible as this is, outweighs the slow and painful death of hundreds of thousands of human beings, including helpless women and children.
