The inconsistency and inexpediency of trying to base the temperance issue upon the Sunday issue, is being illustrated in Passaic, N. J. The situation is told in the following press dispatch, under date of February 14:

"A mighty wave of reform has swept over Passaic, N. J.

"Yesterday the newsdealers there were not permitted to sell the New York newspapers after ten o'clock in the morning. This was in obedience to an order issued by Chief of Police Henry last week.

"The Chief of Police issued his order in the hope that the newsdealers would close their stores. Immense pressure was brought to bear on him by the saloon-keepers. The Board of Excise of Passaic lately put out a mandate ordering the saloons to close on Sunday.

"Twelve saloon-keepers, who have been fined $15 each for violating this order, brought their influence, it is said, to bear upon Chief Henry, and he promptly commanded all stores to close on Sunday, except drug shops, cigar stores, and candy stores.

"They say, 'It's rum or nothing' on Sundays."
