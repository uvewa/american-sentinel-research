A MAN to whom some one has been sending the SENTINEL writes in quite a hostile strain from Petaluma, Cal. "I am sorry," he says, "if any of my friends have so far mistaken my character for loyalty to my country and my purpose to encourage patriotism and good citizenship as to think that I could tolerate or encourage a paper of the character of the AMERICAN SENTINEL. I care not what a man's religion may be as long as he does his duty as a citizen and a man; and I cannot think that in these enlightened times and in a republic like our own, a man's religion ought to impair his usefulness as a citizen. A man who complains of unjust laws and at the same time refuses to remedy those laws by his influence and his vote, is to say the least very inconsistent."

There are doubtless many others who take this view. It is getting to be a prevailing idea that a person's usefulness in this country is largely measured by his vote. This is due in part to the great importance which is attached to the ballot as an instrument of reform. The two ideas go together. People who are planning reforms in these days ("moral" reforms of course—nobody advocates any other kind) base their calculations upon the power they can expect to exert at the polls. The man who does not vote is looked upon as nearly if not quite useless in any way having to do with reform or the service of his country.

Now as a matter of fact, how much has really been accomplished by the ballot in the direction of reform? How much has been accomplished in the direction of better government and better conditions of life? Any person who keeps the run of current events can answer this question for himself. For example, here in New York City the effort has long been made to free the city from the control of "Tammany." But after years upon years of balloting, it remains a fact that Tammany was never more securely in control of the city than just now. For years the majority of the people have been dissatisfied with the government. They have wanted more prosperity. They have been convinced that the party in power has become corrupt. So they have gone to the polls and turned one party out and put in the other. They have kept on doing this for years; and to day what is the result? The same cry of "hard times," the same reduction of wages and consequent strikes, the same cry of the unemployed, the same charges of veniality in high places, and of political corruption, are seen and heard now as have made themselves familiar in the past.

For years the workingmen have struggled to maintain what they view as their rights against the encroachments of the money power. They have put their tickets in the field and their votes in the ballot box time after time; and yet the conditions remain essentially the same now as they were before. The advantage, if any, remains on the side of wealth. The one fact which is becoming more and more prominent, in other lands as in this, is that commercialism is the "time-spirit" of the age; that it is money, above all other things, that rules.

And still the "reformers" have not lost faith in the ballot as the proper instrument for their ends, but cling to it more fatuously than ever. The people, they say, are "going to" do something pretty soon. When the party in power manifests that it has "betrayed the people's confidence"—as it is regularly charged with doing nowadays—these reformers say, Wait; there is retribution in store for them; there is another election coming. And the country is still waiting for that great election when the people will at last see and do their "duty" just as the reformers see it, and overturn all political corruption and establish justice, honesty, and virtue upon the throne of government. This bright vision is the *ignis fatuus* of modern would-be reformers.

It is an old saying that the proper way to fight the devil is "with fire." Supposing fire to be the devil's weapon, this is saying that the devil must be attacked with his own weapons. And this is the plan upon which well-intentioned people have very often conducted their attempts at reform. But no genuine reform was ever accomplished in this way. The devil simply laughs at all such efforts. Let the weapons be such as he can use, and he will win the battle every time. God himself could not successfully fight the devil with his own weapons.

And this applies, in a way, to the ballot; for it is a fact that any evil-minded man or combination of men can make as much use of the ballot as could the most righteous person that ever lived. The very means which good people would use to accomplish the purposed reform, is used by evil-minded persons to defeat it. And by fraud, and the various resources known to the "ward politician" and the political "boss," they can and do make more effective use of this weapon than can be made by those who are honest.

The weapons God has provided for use in the contest with evil are such as the enemy cannot use. God fights sin with grace; he fights error with truth, and darkness with light. And to us he has said, "Overcome evil with good." In our hands he has placed "the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God," and which "is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword." Armed with these spiritual weapons, can the Christian exert any influence in the shaping of events? Can he make an impression for good upon those around him, and serve the interests of the country in which he lives? Let the mighty reformations which have from time to time swept through the land, overthrowing the strongholds of error and turning men from lives of sin and strife to the ways of righteousness and peace, answer the question. All great and lasting reforms from evil, have come by the Word of God.

Reforms, great and genuine, have come through the proclamation of the truth; but no such reform ever came through the ballot, nor can it come in that way. "The power of a moral idea" set going in the field of publicity,—the power of truth, the truth of God, proclaimed in the ears of the people, the power of public sentiment, which the ballot may reflect but can never create—this is the power upon which the Christian depends to serve his fellow men, the land of his birth, and all the world. Upon this power the SENTINEL relies to accomplish its work. "Ye are the salt of the earth"—such is the divine word spoken to all genuine Christians. And this statement is the unimpeachable truth.
