In days of yore, ere science had advanced to its present high state of perfection, there were drunkards among us. Fie! How awful! Worse, there were regular "boozers"! Fie! How still more awful! To-day no such persons are to be found. We have, indeed, some people among us who are suffering from dipsomania. But that sounds very different. Moreover, such "boozers" used to be possessed of all sorts of nasty qualities and outward signs of their state. Such a fellow, for instance, would, in his disgusting state, see things double. That does not occur in our days. The most that can be said is that there are people suffering from amblyopia. But that sounds much better. On the morning after his dissipation a drunkard used to have all sorts of aches and pains. "His ears tingled," or he had "a head as big as a bass drum." "His hair hurt him," he had the "shakes," and the doctors brutally termed it "seediness." Suffering humanity does not know these things to-day. It happens occasionally that a man has an attack of tinnitus aurium, that his hair is subject to paresthesia, that his frame is slightly convulsed by chorea. Such little ailments do not exclude us from society. The disgusting fraternity of "boozers" would also "be as blue as blue can be" when they sobered up and had not the wherewithal to have another bout. Science has left us to-day only people who suffer from "nervous attacks."

There were once upon a time a certain class of people called "smutty" (Schweinigel). They are dead and gone. There are, indeed, some people left who delight in telling nasty stories in decent society; but we call them erotomaniacs.

But the greatest gratitude we owe science is for its almost complete extirpation of crime. How thankful we feel when we remember that the thieves which formerly invested our cities are gone, and that only a few sufferers from chronic kleptomania are left! Those who do not appreciate sufficiently how little harm, comparatively, is done by pyromaniacs should talk to the few old people still living who saw the day when "firebugs" were dangerous to the community. Nor should we forget that to-day murder is solely due to hypnotism or any other old thing with a learned name.
