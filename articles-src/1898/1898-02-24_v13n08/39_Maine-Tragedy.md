For the loss of two hundred and fifty-three brave lives, and the dark tragedy which has cast its shadow over the nation and pierced with a darker sorrow many family circles, every patriotic heart now beats in sadness and sympathy. The shadow of war is dark enough, even in time of peace. Let us hope that its horrors may not be extended further.
