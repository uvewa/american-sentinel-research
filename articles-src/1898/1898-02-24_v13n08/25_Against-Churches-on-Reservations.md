WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.—The House Committee on Military Affairs to-day voted, 10 to 3, against Representative Odell's bill giving power to the Secretary of War to authorize the erection of a building for religious worship by any denomination, sect, or religion on any military reservation in the United States. The bill, it was freely understood, was intended to settle the controversy which has raged for some months over the application of the Catholic Church authorities for permission to erect a chapel at West Point, where services were to be conducted under the auspices of that church. The desired permission was granted by Secretary Alger, a Protestant, and revoked upon the decision by Attorney-General McKenna, a Catholic, that it was illegal.

The bill was advocated by Mr. Mahany, and the opposition, led by Mr. Lentz, of Ohio, was based on the broad ground that the United States desired no places of worship on any of its reservations not under the control of its officers. It developed in the course of the discussion that several applications for similar privilege on other reservations are pending before the Secretary of War, made by Protestant bodies, and the buildings are already in existence on several military reservations. The bill received but three votes. After the committee adjourned Mahany introduced a bill directing the Secretary of War to order the removal at once of all religious edifices of any description whatsoever from the military reservations of the United States.
