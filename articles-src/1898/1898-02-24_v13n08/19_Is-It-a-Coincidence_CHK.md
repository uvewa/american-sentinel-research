It is a significant fact that those who are laboring so zealously to have Sunday enforced by law in this country speak of it as being "a seal," "a sign," "a mark," etc.

Thus: Mrs. J. C. Bateham, a prominent member of the W. C. T. U., in her Sabbath leaflet, No. 33, speaking of Sunday, says, "The Sabbath is the cornerstone of Christ's kingdom. Let us recognize each recurring Sabbath as the *sign* of God's covenant. By this *sign* the world largely judges the depth of our Christian character, and by this sign God judges us."

Also at a large National Reform Assembly at Saratoga Springs, Rev. Joseph Smith, Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly (1894), presented the following resolution:—

"Resolved, That the fundamental principles of the National Reform Association . . . are true and scriptural principles, and that these principles must control our national life, or we shall perish.

"Resolved, That the Sabbath [Sunday] is a *sign* between God and man, and its *reverent* observance a *mark of the nation* whose God is Jehovah."

Again: Rev. Dr. Burrell, at the convention of the Christian Endeavor Society at Paterson, N. J., in October, 1897, said: "God made a covenant with his people, and the Sabbath [Sunday] was the *seal*."

The careful student of the Bible will recall that in the Book of Revelation are found similar expressions (see Rev. 13:11–18), suggesting to his mind the possibility of the power brought to view therein and spoken of as causing all to receive a "mark" in their foreheads, etc., being none other than the United States.

Without deciding at first that this is so, he will feel that, if nothing more, it is a striking coincidence. But as he continues to ponder the symbols he will inevitably be led to conclude that it is after all not a mere coincidence, but a veritable fact that the one is the fulfillment of the other; that the prophet, under the symbol of the "beast" with "two horns like a lamb," is giving in outline a history of the United States.

Every student of the Bible, especially of the prophecies, knows that beasts, in symbols, represent earthly governments. Thus, the four beasts in Daniel 7 are distinctly said to symbolize four kingdoms. See verses 15, 24. Hence the two-horned beast in Rev. 13 is a symbol of some earthly government.

Reading the statements concerning this government carefully, the chief reason why it is given a place in prophecy will be apparent; it will use its power in the enforcing of a certain "mark," thus causing the people under its control to worship another power to whom this mark belongs. Hence the mark is a prominent feature.

As the enforcing of this mark involves worship, none can fail to see that whatever the mark may be, it must be something that pertains to religion.

Now it must be evident that whatever government is symbolized by the two-horned beast, and whatever may be the mark it is to enforce in fulfilling this prophecy, it will set forth something which is purely religious in character, and in the very nature of things much will be said concerning it as being the mark, sign, etc.

Moreover, it will be something which the beast, having the deadly wound that is healed, and in the presence of which the two-horned beast works (Rev. 13:1-10), claims as its mark. Of this there can possibly be no contradiction.

Now is it possible that the United States is the government symbolized by the two-horned beast?

It is a fact, as every student of the Bible knows, that all the great nations of earth, from the days of Egypt and Babylon down to our own times, have been subjects of prophecy, and it must be acknowledged that there is, apparently, no reason why there should be an exception in the case of the United States—a nation that is, from every standpoint, equal at least to the greatest of them.

Now scanning the whole field of prophecy we shall find that while all other nations of earth, from Egypt and Babylon down, have found a place in prophecy, the United States is excluded, unless indeed it is symbolized by the two-horned beast. Yet there is no nation in existence that is making prominent a religious institution which is called a "mark," etc., and which too is claimed by the power which received the deadly wound and was healed, unless indeed it is the United States. And yet again: there is no nation that answers to the description of the two-horned beast unless indeed it is the United States.

That being so we find an astonishing anomaly: that of a government foretold in prophecy which cannot be found in history; and of a nation that has no place in prophecy, yet doing the very work which this particular prophecy makes prominent, viz., of enforcing that which is called a "mark," and which is claimed by the power that received the deadly wound and was healed, as its mark.

But if on the other hand we find the prophet describing a government, as already set forth in this article, and we find too that this is the only nation that is doing a work similar to that specified in the prophecy, the conviction grows upon us until we become absolutely certain that the United States and the two-horned beast are one, and the same power.

It is said that when the Emperor of Germany visits Palestine, the Sultan will present him with a piece of ground which is the traditional site of the Last Supper. Much as we should rejoice to know that the sacred spot was in Christian hands, when we remember how the German emperor betrayed the Christian Greeks into the hands of the Turks during the late war, such a gift seems almost a mockery.—Christian Endeavor World.

The whole thing is a mockery.
