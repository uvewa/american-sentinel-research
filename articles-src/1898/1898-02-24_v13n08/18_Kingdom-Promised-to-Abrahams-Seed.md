When God said to Abraham, as in Gen. 13:15, "All the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever," he did not mean to limit that gift to the land of Palestine. The apostle Paul said that the promise to Abraham included the whole world. Rom. 4:13. In this grant God bestowed upon the father of the faithful all the territory of his kingdom, which he first gave to Adam, but which had been usurped by Satan. As Adam was placed in Eden and commanded to replenish the earth, beginning at that point, so Abraham's immediate seed were to be settled in Palestine, that from that section they might also spread and fill all the earth.

But Abraham's seed were not to be limited to his lineal descendants. "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He [God] said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ." Gal. 3:16. Christ was the seed, then, upon whom this usurped territory was to be bestowed. It was his by right of creation, and as this was also to be included in his redemption, he, too, as the "seed" of Abraham, must be born in the land promised to Abraham, that his children might, from that point, multiply and fill the entire territory given to him. So, then, whoever gives himself to Christ becomes by that act the seed of Abraham, and an heir to the territory promised to his seed.

But, as in every other purpose of God, Satan attempted to thwart that promise, and on the ground that the territory being acquired by him from Adam, to whom it was first given, it was his to dispose of as he desired, without let or hindrance. Luke 4:6. God, who knows the end from the beginning, foresaw this attempt of Satan to make void his word, and so made known to Abraham something of what his people would meet before entering upon their promised possession. Appearing to the patriarch in vision one evening as the sun was sinking in the west, the Lord said to him: "Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years."

This picture of the patriarch's seed being a nation of slaves in a strange land was not pleasing, but the assurance was also given that in the fourth generation they should return to their own land, and that they should then displace, as the emissaries of Satan, all the nations which would be found there. Gen. 15:12–21.

It proved as God had said about Abraham's people becoming enslaved by another nation. A severe famine throughout Palestine induced them to go down to Egypt for help, where they were reduced to slavery. Beginning to multiply and spread out over the country, the king became alarmed, and took counsel to repress them, lest they become so numerous and strong as to effect their liberty. Rigorous legal measures were therefore adopted by which their burdens would be increased. But this did not hinder their growth in numbers, so public orders were given to the midwives to destroy every male child born, in order to destroy the seed of that nation. The girls were permitted to live, because they might be readily assimilated with the Egyptians by marriage, and so add to the strength of that people, while the Hebrew nation would be constantly diminishing." Ex. 1:7–22.

Thus the power of a nation's decrees were brought to bear against the promise of God, that his people should return to occupy the territory assigned them. Had the strong measures prevailed which were proposed by the Egyptian government, the promise to Abraham would have been a failure, and God's word would have been broken. But this was not to be. By God's infinite power these people were redeemed from their bondage and planted again in their own land, making it appropriate for God to keep before them the saying, "I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." Ex. 20:2.

This was the first time that the power of a whole nation was brought to bear against God's people, and for obvious reasons. Until it was made known that the territory usurped by Satan was to be conferred on the seed of Abraham, he stirred up no national effort against God's people, preferring to move against them singly. But when the oath of God was pledged to secure to some particular seed that to which Satan laid claim, he adopted tactics by which, if possible, to entirely blot out the descendants of Abraham, and so destroy the prospect of the "promised seed." Or, failing in this, the same purpose would be served by causing the literal seed of Abraham to be absorbed into other nations, in order to destroy the identity of the "seed" who was to inherit the promised possession.

But these devices of Satan were destined to fail; for the very introduction of the New Testament traces the lineage of Christ, the "promised seed," from Abraham to David, through fourteen generations, then from David to the Babylonian captivity, fourteen generations, and from that point to Christ, fourteen generations more, thus establishing him as the true seed of Abraham. Matt. 1:1-17.

Satan, however, could not foresee his own failure. Were not the nations of earth his servants? Could he not inspire them to work against the promise of God under one pretext or another? The work of the Egyptian nation to destroy the Hebrews was, therefore, his first organized effort in that direction. If not successful, in that attempt, he might still follow after to divide, abstract them, even to the opposition of their own national strength against the consummation of the oath of God, so that they would, in a frenzied way, call for the crucifixion of the "seed," in order to rid the earth of his presence.

But of the steps in national persecution upon the seed of Abraham, which led up to the rejection of the One upon whom the promise was to be fulfilled, must be reserved for future consideration.
