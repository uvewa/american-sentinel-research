MERCHANTS MADE TO COVER THEIR WARES DURING CHURCH HOURS.

The German police regulations for the outward sanctification of Sunday require that all articles offered for sale, if not removed from their customary places, shall be covered during the "church hour." Photographers who exhibit specimens of their art in frames outside their rooms provide the frame with a blind, which is drawn down during the time in which exposure to the public gaze is unlawful.

The Berlin police authorities have lately given notice that the prohibition extends to the newspapers in the various trinkhallen. As a trinkhalle rarely contains any article which can be used as a veil or curtain, the women who sell the newspapers make use of old newspapers to conceal the copies of the latest editions. Hence the newspapers which are for sale lie hidden for a while underneath the unsaleable newspapers. The police regulations for the sanctification of the Sunday are thus sufficiently complied with, as the police authorities have graciously conceded that yesterday's or last week's journal is not considered by them to be an "article for sale."
