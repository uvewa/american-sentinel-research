People who clothe the state with divine attributes have not all lived in the musty ages of the past, but some of them have come down to our time, and not a few of them have drifted from the monarchies of the old world—where kings ruled by divine right—into this fair land, where the government is by the people. But a feeling of lonesomeness comes over them; so they set themselves about to remodel the government of our land, after the old order, when rulers enforced divine decrees.

Rev. Dr. McAllister, before the House Judiciary Committee of Congress, used the following language in advocating the God-in-the-Constitution resolution, which fully justifies the above statement:—

"I say it comes to this: This matter of conscience is one that goes back to the moral sense of the people. It is not simply an individual conscience. It may be a Mohammedan conscience—there may be an infidel or atheist conscience—I hardly know what that would be, but whatever it may be, he has it. Concede that he has it. Here is the nation which gives its decision according to its sense of right and wrong. That is the national conscience, and when the nation thus gives its decision, individuals whose conscientious views may conflict—like a Mormon who believes in polygamy, or any man who stood up for slavery after the question was settled, or any man in a prohibition state to traffic in liquor—in such cases the individual conscience must yield to the conscience of the whole people, which is over him, and should be over him in order to enforce what is right, but which can be over him only by recognizing the Lord's supreme authority over the nation."

It is difficult to believe that men with the Bible in their hands and living in a land of comparative religious freedom, could not be satisfied to enjoy religious liberty. The absurdity of the state attempting to regulate religious matters is forcibly expressed by Rev. Minot J. Savage, in *The Forum*. He says:—

"One of the most needed, as it is one of the most difficult, of all reforms, is that which aims at having the state mind its own business. This includes two things, letting alone what is not its business, and really minding what is. In the light of legal history, one of the most curious things is the still-surviving popular faith in mere laws as a means of preventing evil and accomplishing good. The statute books of even our young country are chiefly old lumber rooms. But, beyond this, and more mischievous still, is the fact that the state is continually legislating concerning things that are beyond the limits not only of its rightful, but even of its possible, jurisdiction. Many of its attempts are as impracticable as would be a legal interference with the force of gravity. Should Congress enact laws concerning things in India, all the world would smile. But not our country only, nearly all countries, are still passing laws that imply a claim of jurisdiction over other worlds and other states of existence. They are passing laws that attempt to deal with inner conditions of consciousness—with metaphysical subtleties, over which philosophers and ecclesiastics are still wrangling. People want laws passed not only for the protection of life and property and securing good conduct now and then, but they want laws the causes of which are supposed to come from other worlds and for ends which issue only in other worlds. In brief, they are continually confounding the functions of the priest, the preacher, the philosopher, or the metaphysician with those of the legislator. . . .

"We are slowly reaching a point at last where the most civilized people are beginning to see, with at least partial clearness, that the functions of the state should be limited to the practical matters of conduct in this life, and to their bearing on the liberties and rights of men as citizens. The philosophers may reason of ethical origins and principles, and of supersensual sanctions. The metaphysicians may speculate as to transcendental causes and results. Theologians may theorize as to what was 'in the mind of God,' of which actual facts are only a partial expression. For my present purpose, I question neither the right nor the wisdom of these things. But the point I wish to make is this, that, whether false or true, these things simply do not concern the state as such. . . . And the only interest of the state, as state, is that all the rights and duties involved in a civil contract shall be maintained, to the end of public order. The moment that it attempts anything beyond this, it is a trespasser on personal rights, and works only mischief. It is hardly matter for dispute that those who have claimed to be acting for God, in political matters, have been authors of cruelty and injustice. Mr. Gladstone, pietistic though he sometimes is, claims only to be working for the good of man. Civilization tends both to modesty and kindliness."

Although this language was used with reference to another divine institution, it is just as applicable to the Sabbath institution and Sabbath laws. The apostle Paul says of the divine law of the Sabbath that it is spiritual. Then the Sabbath institution belongs in the spiritual realm, and when the state enacts laws to regulate the observance of the Sabbath, it goes outside of that for which it was instituted, and instead of exerting its power to make men civil—which is its only function—it assumes the attribute of the Deity, and attempts to make men spiritual and to enforce upon them spiritual institutions. "God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth," that is to say, worship him in the observance of those things that are spiritual—as the Sabbath, the Lord's supper, baptism, prayers, etc. The state has no more right to invade this realm than the United States has to enact laws for China.

It would be much more reasonable for one state to enact laws for another and seek to enforce them, than for an earthly government to legislate for the spiritual, for, in the first instance, both belong to the same sphere, but in the latter the functions are entirely diverse; and if in the case of one state legislating for another such effort would be repelled, much more when civil government attempts to rule in matters spiritual, should it meet with resistance—not of brute force—but of the "weapons that are not carnal, but mighty through God."
