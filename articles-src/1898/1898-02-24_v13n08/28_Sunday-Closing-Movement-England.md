MEETINGS and "demonstrations" in favor of the Sunday closing of public-houses are now the order of the day, the bishops and clergy no less than the Nonconformist ministers taking an active part in them. A regular campaign has been started. A correspondent sends us a report of one which he attended a few days ago, where the object of the movement was very plainly set forth. The chief speaker, a Wesleyan minister, after saying that "the public-house is the worst enemy the church has," declared, "If once we get the public-houses closed on Sunday, we shall go a step further and"—what? shut them up every day in the week? That is what one would naturally suppose, but no; it is not the purpose at all. Here it is "When once we get the public houses closed on Sunday, we shall go a step further, and stop all Sunday trade." That is the object, and the only object, of the Sunday-closing movement. Everybody has a right to engage in it who wishes to, but all should know that it is in no sense a temperance movement. It should be understood that it is but a step towards enforced Sunday observance.

But is it not going a little too far to say that enforced Sunday observance is the only object of this movement for the Sunday closing of public-houses? May not the diminution of the liquor traffic be also anticipated?—No; and the proof of this is found in the fact that it is constantly urged that the publicans themselves are in favor of Sunday closing. But no publican who proposed to continue in the business, was ever in favor of diminution in the sale of liquor.

Further proof that this Sunday-closing crusade is a compromise with the liquor traffic, by which the liquor dealers are to help "protect" Sunday in return for having their business protected, is furnished by so eminent a temperance worker as the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Daily Mail gives the following from a speech by him at a "temperance meeting" in St. Andrew's Hall, Bethnalgreen, a few days ago; in which "he urged temperance people to concentrate their efforts on Sunday closing":—

"Even drinkers, he said, admitted that the closing of the 'houses' on Sunday would be an advantage, and he entirely disregarded the statements which had been made that beer served on the Saturday—that was, assuming Sunday closing was in operation—could not be drunk on the Sunday.

"That had nothing to do with the question, and was a side argument to throw them off the track. On the contrary, he predicted that if Sunday closing were in operation there would spring up a bottled beer trade which would insure fresh beer for those who desired it."

What could be plainer? To all drinkers he said in substance: "Don't be afraid that you will not be able to get your beer on Sunday. Join in with us to get the public-houses closed on Sunday, and if the beer that you buy on Saturday night does not last well over Sunday, be assured that a bottled beer trade will immediately spring up which will insure you all the fresh beer you wish."

It would please us much to see the liquor traffic stopped entirely. If only one-half the present amount were consumed, it would be a great gain. But when a given amount of beer is to be sold and drank in a week, it makes no difference when it is done. We marvel much at the blindness that has seized all these good temperance people. So strongly has the Sunday mania seized them, that they really think they are working for the cause of temperance, while deliberately planning for the undiminished consumption of liquor. Could there be a more striking illustration of the intoxicating nature of the wine of Romanism?
