The practical importance of the subject of Christian citizenship, as discussed in the columns of the SENTINEL, is evidenced by communications like the following which is printed in The Outlook, of February 12, under the heading, "Shall Missionaries be Protected by Government?":

"To the Editors of the Outlook:

"The frequent occurrence of international trouble in Asia, growing out of attacks on missionaries or the destruction of mission property, must present to the Christian mind and conscience a painful anomaly. Missionaries in China, for instance, know that their presence is exciting violent animosity in a fanatical sect, but instead of retiring, they remain, and riot, incendiarism, and bloodshed follow. A European government steps in and demands redress. A number of heads are cut off—probably not those of the actual culprits.

"Again, some German Roman Catholic missionaries are killed, and their death is made the pretext for seizing and holding an important Chinese port. Or missionary school property is destroyed in Armenia, and threats are made to enforce redress and restitution at the cannon's mouth.

"None of these methods are such as the Master would have approved of. That, I think, every Christian denomination or missionary will admit. And these were not the methods in vogue centuries ago, when, it is allowed, the Roman Catholic missionaries in the Far East won more converts to Christianity than have since been enrolled as members by all the Christian denominations taken together. The inconsistencies between the teaching of Christian missionaries and the practice of Christian governments must be fatal to the spread of Christianity. The missionaries go out ostensibly with their lives in their hands, and profess to be as willing to be martyrs as were the apostles of old. But when they suffer for their principles, the Christian government steps in and insists on the infliction of punishment on somebody. The missionary preaches the doctrine of forgiveness; the missionary's government practices the doctrine of revenge. As long as the missionary is a citizen, his government cannot but resent and demand redress for injury to its citizen and breach of treaty rights. The missionary himself and the society he represents may be averse to such measures of violence as the civil government, regardless of the sufferer's wishes, feels compelled to take in vindication of its national rights. Yet, in the eyes of the heathen or the Mohammedan, the missionary must be regarded as the instigator of the punishment.

"The situation is painful from every point of view, especially to the Christian citizens of this country who disavow all connection between church and state.

"One can see no other remedy than voluntary relinquishment of citizenship by every missionary as soon as he enters on his mission work, and the disavowal by every missionary society of any relation to any civil government and right of protection. If such a course could be pursued, with the concurrence of all Christian governments, and without detriment to the commercial rights of their citizens or the security of secular property, Christianity would be relieved of one of the most flagrant hindrances to its spread in non-Christian lands, and Christian missionaries would be looked up to with much more admiration than they now excite in Christian lands; for, when serious international complications arise, especially if they have been occasioned by the indiscretion or overzeal of male or female missionaries, the world at large does not make charitable allowances for all the circumstances.

This illustrates the very truths that have been pointed out in the SENTINEL respecting the Christian's relation to earthly governments. Of course, when a person professes Christianity—the heavenly citizenship—and at the same time wants to hold on to the state, as being a citizen of it, thus forming in himself a union of religion with the state, there must arise "painful anomalies" and "painful situations" such as the writer has described. And they cannot but be "especially" painful "to the Christian citizens of this country who disavow all connection between church and state."

The situation would be much less painful and perplexing if "Christians" would really believe what they profess, and then would act in harmony with their belief.
