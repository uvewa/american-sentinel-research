READ, on another page, "The Sad Story of Spain," and remember as you read that Spain has been of all nations the most faithful ally of the papal church; and also that Pope Leo XIII. has stated that "what the church has done for other lands, she will do for the United States." Then ask yourself whether you are in favor of giving her a chance to do it.
