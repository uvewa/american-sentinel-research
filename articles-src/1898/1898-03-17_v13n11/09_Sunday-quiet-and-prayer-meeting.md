It is very strange that a prayer-meeting or other religious service can be held in the church on any "week-day" evening without being at all disturbed by work and traffic, but cannot be held on Sunday without "great disturbance," if there happens to be any work or traffic in the vicinity. One would think it was not possible to be religious except in the midst of absolute quiet.
