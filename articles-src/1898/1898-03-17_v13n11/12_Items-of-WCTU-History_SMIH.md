The call to W. C. T. U. work was the most wonderful part of its history. It was to the on-looker only an unaccountable popular uprising, but to those who were in it, it was upon the part of each woman a personal answer to a personal call of God. There were, of course, some women who simply joined the crusading crowd, and soon fell away; but those who stood by during the reaction-days, when crusade enthusiasm was succeeded by calm deliberation, and the routine of organization, did so because they had heard and understood the voice of God. That voice had broken in like a sudden shower of rain upon those souls everywhere that lived with their windows open toward the skies, and produced the same quickening in each.

"Bear ye one another's burdens," were the words set to the music of that rain. "I have promised that I would not leave the world comfortless," chided the voice which we knew and loved. "Wherefore, then, is it so nearly comfortless under the shadow of a great curse. Arise, ye daughters that are at ease, and help me to heal the hurt of the children of my people."

I must draw from actual experiences to give a true color to this history; experiences which were almost as universal as they were personal.

First of all was the experience of ignorance in the things of the world out of which we had all had a similar awakening.

Woman had been shut in through all the generations. Fathers, lovers, and husbands had thought that because the world was so very evil, it must needs be that the home maker should be kept ignorant of it. They had not as yet conceived of the truth that ignorance is not purity. They felt that the home must be kept pure at all hazards. The growing boy must have the memory of a childhood amid holy surroundings to take with him when he made his inevitable plunge into the life that awaited him as a man; the secrets of which no pure woman must dream of, since she could not share them and live. Such was the reasoning of the world, and as a result we were in a much more literal sense, than I am sure Christ ever intended, "in the world and yet not of it."

There was, as age came on, for almost every thoughtful woman, a rude awakening to the fact that men "turned out so different from what boyhood had promised." Boys were as sweet as girls up to a certain age; then, as a rule, they naturally(?) became rough, and later on barely escaped brutality. The mother could not forget her love for her boy, and by that love was crucified in almost every son she bore. An incident of a generation ago will make my meaning plain. The young mother of an eighteen months old boy had in her home a venerable guest. One morning as she was in a frolic with him on the carpet, looking up into the face of the elder woman expecting to find in it a reflection of her own delight in the child, she found sadness, almost bitterness instead. She could not understand; and smiled a questioning smile out of her ignorant happiness, which brought from the trembling, aged lips a sigh which took form in words:

"O take all the comfort you can with your boy now while you can."

"Certainly," came the wondering reply. "I expect to do that; but why do you speak to me in that doleful strain? Why imply that there will ever be a time that I will not take comfort in my boy?"

"O but he is growing up to be a man."

"I certainly hope so," replied the young mother almost defiantly. "I expect he will grow up to be a man:— but why should that not make me glad; what makes you so grave about it: why do you talk to me like that?"

"O you dear innocent; you do not know:—but there are things out in the great world that spoil boys for their mothers."

How could that young mother with her beautiful boy in her arms understand this sorrowful wisdom? Comprehension had to come through revelation, by an altogether unexpected means. The shell of the world that had shut mothers in to a secluded sacred inner chamber alone with love, with God and his Word, had to be broken before they could see and understand, and be fully equipped for their legitimate home-work.

It was the shock of the civil war that broke down the walls and thrust woman out into the world; and opened it to her view just as it was; unable to even attempt to cover up its evils from the eyes that it had been supposed could not look upon them and remain pure. When we found ourselves a nation of widows, fatherless children, and invalid soldiers; and woman was obliged, all inexperienced as she was, to become the bread-winner; meeting the conditions of the business world just as man had created them for himself alone; she found how far the race had gone astray from the principles to which she had anchored her faith, and which she had taught the child, only, as she now saw, to have them repudiated by the man. She found that truth was blasphemed by every condition of society, business, and government; and that it was not held as very sacred, even in the work-a-day-world part of the church.

Then she discovered the mysteries of the sorrows of aged womanhood;—the saloon, and the house of sin, those traps for body and soul, those holes of the pit, that "Wicked sitting in the lurking places of the villages to murder the innocent, to catch the poor; that doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net." Ps. 10.

The women who had been personally wounded by this enemy of all purity, the wives and mothers of drunkards, were by their sorrows rendered unequal to a war against the evil. Many of them had lost all hope and faith; had ceased to believe in God. Their agonies, however, appealed to heaven for them, and God by his Spirit, laid their burdens upon the hearts of those who as yet did not know vice as a personal enemy. Women whose homes were secure should certainly be able to respond bravely to such a call as that mysterious voice had sounded in the soul of womanhood. And so the uprising of the crusade became the most remarkable manifestation of Christlike love and care for others woes which the world has ever witnessed.
