The world is rapidly approaching a condition of things in which the only people in it who will retain the blessings of peace, will be Christians. The Christian is, above all others, a man of peace; he is a follower of the Prince of Peace, and a partaker of the divine nature, which is peace-loving. The Christian—and he alone—always has peace; not a figurative, imaginary peace either, but a literal peace. He knows that he has it, because he realizes its presence in his soul. And never does he realize it more fully than when in the midst of external strife and commotion.

In the case of the Christian—and of him alone—there is an impenetrable barrier between the spirit of that without him, and the spirit within him. The spirit without him is the spirit of the world; but he is "not of this world." If he were of this world, then the spirit of the world—the spirit of strife and unrest—would find a responsive chord in his heart, and he would feel and be actuated by the same spirit. He who is of the world must partake of the spirit of the world; and at a time like the present he cannot but be moved by the spirit of unrest, of strife, of covetousness, of revenge, which is creating universal turmoil throughout the earth.

It is a time to call to mind the words of the psalm- st: "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty." Ps. 91:1. In the time of confusion and conflict to which everything earthly is now tending, it will be of inestimable value to dwell in the "secret place," shut out from the world, where is the abiding presence of peace. But first there must be in the heart a repetition of that miracle upon the Galileean Lake where the voice of the Son of God said to the tempest, "Peace! be still!" And these are always the first words spoken by Him when the heart is opened for his admission.
