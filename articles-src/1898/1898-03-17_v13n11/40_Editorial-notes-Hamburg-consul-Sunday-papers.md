A WASHINGTON, D. C., dispatch states that "a queer question of Sunday observance has been raised at the State Department by the Hamburg-American Steamship Company. The American consul at Hamburg, who was a Pittsburg newspaper man, has refused to furnish papers to vessels clearing that port on Sunday, and there is a heavy penalty for vessels sailing without the necessary papers. Sunday is one of the regular sailing days for the Hamburg line. It has been customary, it is said, to permit passengers to land in this country on Sunday."
