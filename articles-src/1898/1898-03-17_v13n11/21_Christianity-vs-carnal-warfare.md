It would be useless to think of engaging in war without partaking of the spirit of war. And the spirit of Christianity is not the spirit of war, when the war is to be fought with carnal weapons. Not that Christianity does not stand for justice and the relief of the oppressed. It does this, and to the very fullest extent. But it operates not through the agency of carnal weapons, but by the power and the sword of the Spirit. The giving of supplies of food to the starving Cubans is the expression of the spirit of Christianity; but as much could not be said for the killing of Spanish soldiers, in which work many "Christians" are now expecting to engage. "The Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them."

It cannot be said that justice and mercy have been more promoted in this world by the sword than by the spirit of Christ. All history testifies to the contrary. "The pen is mightier than the sword;" the voice of truth mightier than the roar of the cannon. The "still small voice" heard by the listening prophet upon Horob, was the expression of a mightier power than was represented in whirlwind and earthquake and fire. Christianity stands to-day, as it has ever stood, for the promotion of justice and of judgment, of prosperity and of peace, in the earth, by the use of the most powerful and effective agency that has ever promoted these blessings since the world began.
