Up to the time of Christ's first advent, the persecution of God's chosen people had ever been by the united interests of civil and religious power. Each of the six nations which had sought the destruction of the seed of Abraham, were those having a national religion, and that religion was uniformly sun worship in some of its various forms. But when Christ appeared in the midst of the Jewish nation, as the true seed of Abraham, the literal descendants of that patriarch—the Jews themselves—in unison with the Roman government under which they lived, began a systematic persecution upon him, which finally carried him to his death on Calvary's cross.

When the dispersion of the Jewish nation was effected by the Romans, that dominant power next turned its attention to the Christians whom it hated as strongly as it had the Jews, and for the one great reason: these people, being counted of God as the seed of Abraham, and heirs according to the promise (Gal. 3:29), were opposed to Rome's national system of sun-worship and refused to recognize it, choosing death rather than to dishonor their Master. The Roman law forbade anyone having a religion of his own, and the penalty for such an offense was death to the plebeian, or common subject, while any patrician, or nobleman, offending in the same, was subject to be degraded, and transported to some isolated spot, away from the enjoyment of civil privileges.

But notwithstanding this rigorous law, Christianity spread and strengthened, until it became an influential factor in national affairs. But when it sought earthly honors, its standard of purity was lowered, and its tone of piety was moderated to accommodate itself to surrounding circumstances. Mosheim says that when the second century dawned, it found the church so far yielded to the mysteries of paganism as to imitate its forms, even to turning the face toward the sun in worship.—Eccl. Hist., cent. 2, part 2, chap. 4, par. 5, 7.

Nor was this all. In the fourth century, "The rites and institutions, by which the Greeks, Romans, and other nations had formerly testified their religious veneration for fictitious deities, were now adopted, with some slight alterations, by Christian bishops, and employed in the service of the true God." This was carried so far, indeed, as the historian adds, that "the religion of the Greeks and Romans differed very little in its appearance from that of the Christians." And all this was done because "these fervent heralds of the gospel, whose zeal outran their candor and integrity, imagined that the nations would receive Christianity with more facility when they saw the rites and ceremonies to which they were accustomed adopted in the church, and the same worship paid to Christ and his martyrs which they had formerly offered to their idol deities."—Ibid., cent. 4, part 2, chap. 14, par. 1.

Alas for the deceitful power of Satan. It has ever been his policy to blind the spiritual sight of God's people, by getting them to unite their interests with civil government, in order to hasten the conversion of those outside the pale of the church. Fatal delusion, indeed. The only wonder is, that with such a course as the historian records, any vestige of the Christian faith remained. As it was, the complexion of the church became so changed that its services differed little from those of the heathen round about. It did not take long for this Pago-Christianity to become the dominating influence in the church, which in turn demanded from all the acknowledgment of its sway, just as the unalloyed paganism had formerly done. It is therefore but natural to find the historian recording that the Emperor Constantine "assumed to himself" the "external administration of the church," thus placing himself where he could settle all matters of church discipline according to his own idea." Ibid., cent. 4, part 2, chap. 2, par. 4.

It was not long before he took the next step in this assumed sway. Some of the Christians of that time did not readily yield to the prevailing influence, and so stood aloof from the pagan rites and ceremonies adopted by the church. Especially were they not willing to honor the day of the sun, which the greater portion of the church had appropriated in imitation of the pagans. The controversy created by this state of things became so marked that the emperor interfered, and in the year 321 issued the following edict:—

"Let all the judges and townspeople, and the occupation of all trades rest on the venerable day of the sun; but let those who are situated in the country, freely and at full liberty attend to the business of agriculture, because it often happens that no other day is so fit for sowing corn and planting vines; lest, the critical moment being let slip, men should lose the commodities granted by Heaven."

Two things about this edict of Constantine are worthy of attention. First, it calls the day to be observed "the venerable day of the sun," thus retaining its pagan name and character. There is not a single hint that the emperor sought to enforce it as a Christian institution. It was simply the old reverend day of the sun. From all that appears, the pagan sentiment alone was all the edict sought to instil. Second, it assumed the right of the emperor to exempt some from the observance of the day, while holding others rigidly to it, thus showing that the law had its origin in the decree of the empire alone. In other words, it was the assumed authority of a secular ruler to control the consciences of his subjects in any way that suited him.

Four years later, having in the meantime nominally connected himself with Christianity, the emperor convened the Council of Nice, which was made entirely subservient to his will. Two questions were to be settled; one relating to the Arian controversy, and the other respecting the proper day on which to celebrate Easter. The latter question was one of the principle reasons for calling the council. It seems that the eastern churches up to that time had kept that ordinance on the fourteenth day of the moon, without regard to the day of the week, just as the Jews had always done in observing the passover. Those churches, however, which had fallen under the influence of Rome, were determined to have that festival fall on Sunday.—Boyle's Hist. of the Council of Nice, p. 22.

This important question, like others, was settled by the emperor, who had before "assumed to himself the external administration of the church." In a letter to the churches, in which he directs all to yield to the decrees of the council, he says that when the question came up, "it seemed to everyone a most unworthy thing that we should follow the custom of the Jews in the celebration of this most holy solemnity." He then assumes the responsibility to call the Jews "polluted wretches," and exhorts all to "have nothing in common with the most hostile rabble of the Jews."—Ibid., p. 52. The letter closes with the following solemn assurance that the decree of the council is the will of God: "This being the case, receive with cheerfulness the heavenly and true divine command. For whatever is transacted in the holy councils of the bishops, is to be referred to the divine will. Wherefore, having announced to our beloved brethren what has been already written, it is your duty to receive and establish the arguments already stated, and the observance of the most holy day."—Page 54.

The adoption of Christianity in theory by Constantine, while still maintaining the forms of paganism, was but to blend the two systems into one, and so produce the papacy. The Council of Nice forged the implements of persecution which were destined to prove greater than any the "seed of the woman" had hitherto endured. Matt. 24:21. By the bishops of the church voting in that council voting to make the decrees of the emperor the creed of the church, the union of the church and state, under the papacy, was permanently effected, and power was given the civil government to enforce religious dogmas of pagan origin upon its subjects.
