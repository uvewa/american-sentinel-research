New York "World," March 10.

The graphic picture of the territorial decline of the colonial empire of Spain in the Western Hemisphere published in the World last Monday has been supplemented by the record of its losses from year to year as told in our news columns of yesterday.

Not since the downfall of the Roman Empire has there been such a story of the rise to greatness and the fall to helplessness of a great power. It is one of the striking coincidences of history that if Spain to-day finds itself menaced with the loss of its last American possessions through a conflict with the greatest of American republics, the beginning of the power of Spain may be dated from the year 1492, in which the discovery of Columbus led to the ultimate establishment of the United States.

The year which gave the Western Hemisphere to Spain witnessed the expulsion of the Moors from Grenada and made the peninsula one united country. Its first king, Ferdinand of Aragon, whose marriage with Isabella of Castile in 1469 marked the beginning of a real Spanish kingdom, was also the last Spanish king, for at his death, in 1516, the succession passed into the line of the Hapsburgs, with sad and melancholy consequences for the civilized world.

During the four hundred years of its rise and fall its invariable record has been one of cruelty, of persecution, of bigotry, of hostility to every sentiment of human freedom, common justice, and enlightenment. The slavery to which it doomed its subjects in the Western Hemisphere was not more cruel than its oppression of the people of Holland, or its tyranny over its own people at home. The bigotry, the fanaticism, the intolerance, and the gloomy superstition of its tone of mind is unrelieved by one single gleam of recognition of human rights, just as the disgraceful record of its decay and downfall is unrelieved by one single triumph of genius in statesmanship or of prowess in battle against an armed enemy.

One by one Spain's possessions have fallen away, like bricks from a mouldering wall, until to-day it stands alone and isolated, bankrupt in resources, helpless and exhausted, but still clinging to that policy of cruelty, of oppression and extermination which has been its only known method of dealing with Morisco and Aztec and Inca and Hollander—and Cuban—and which after four hundred years has finally forced it to confront the republic of freedom, of equality, of justice, of humanity, of civilization.

It is not accident or chance which has brought about the present situation. It is inexorable destiny which decrees that the last of Spain's illgotten possessions in this hemisphere should be lifted to freedom by the one republic which represents everything that Spain has antagonized during her whole history.
