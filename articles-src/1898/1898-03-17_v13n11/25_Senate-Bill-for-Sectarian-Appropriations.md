The District Appropriations Bill, which provides for the maintenance of various charitable institutions in the District of Columbia, and was reported to the Senate of the United States, March 3, contains the following specifications (pp. 53, 54):—

"For the Church Orphanage Association of St. John's Parish, maintenance, one thousand eight hundred dollars.

"For Saint Ann's Infant Asylum, maintenance, five thousand four hundred dollars.

"For Association for Works of Mercy, maintenance, one thousand eight hundred dollars.

"For House of the Good Shepherd, maintenance, two thousand seven hundred dollars.

"For the Saint Rose Industrial School, maintenance, four thousand five hundred dollars.

"For Saint Joseph's Asylum, maintenance, one thousand eight hundred dollars.

"For Young Woman's Christian Home, one thousand dollars."

The first-named of these institutions belongs to the Episcopal Church. The rest, excepting the last, are the property of the Roman Catholic Church.

This bill proposes the repeal of the Act of March 3, 1897, which provided that no contract for appropriations to private institutions "shall extend beyond the thirtieth day of June, 1899, and that no payment shall be made under any such contract except for service actually rendered." This provision is crossed out in the bill now under the Senate's consideration.

This, therefore, is nothing else than a deliberate attempt to reinstate the principle of sectarian appropriations, which by the Act of March 3, 1897, had been practically discarded.

The influence behind this part of the Appropriations Bill is of course that of the churches whose institutions receive the benefit of the proposed grants. It is said by one who has an inside view of affairs at the Capitol that the Methodist and Catholic churches are in league to secure the passage of this sectarian measure by Congress; that the Methodists will help the Catholics in the Senate, and the Catholics the Methodists in the House.

The money appropriated by the Government to sectarian institutions is raised by taxation. The people therefore are taxed to support an institution of the church; and this is contrary to free government. For the people never proposed to establish a church; the people are adherents of various churches or of no church. They could not possibly be united in support of any one church, or any two. What they did propose, and what they accomplished, was the establishment of a civil, Republican, government; and all money raised by taxation from the people is to maintain that government and for nothing else. To appropriate it for other purposes is to misappropriate it, and incur the guilt of dishonesty.

These sectarian institutions are wholly under the control of the churches to which they belong. The people who are taxed to support them have, in many cases at least, no voice whatever in their management. To tax the people for their support is therefore a direct violation of the principle, "no taxation without representation," for which our forefathers fought the Revolutionary War.

But we have reached a day when, in the affairs of government, principle seems to be largely outweighed by policy. But this Government must stand upon principle, and not policy, if it stands at all.
