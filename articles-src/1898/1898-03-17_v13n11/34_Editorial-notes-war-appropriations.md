FIFTY millions for war appropriated by the United States Government, $120,000,000 for warships by Great Britain, 90,000,000 roubles by Russia for a like purpose—what a "pretty penny" it costs these "Christian nations" to live at peace with each other! What a saving of money it would be if they could really be Christian enough to let each other alone!
