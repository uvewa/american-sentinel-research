We have not a word to say against civil government or politics, as regards their necessity for this world, or against the propriety of one who is of this world engaging in them. Civil government must be in this world, and there can be no possible way of administering its affairs better than by officials chosen by popular ballot. We only say that a Christian—one who has been called out from the world—cannot consistently engage in politics. He cannot be of the world and not of the world at the same time. For he is under a different government than any on the earth—a government of God, which is the kingdom of God within him. As Jesus said to his disciples, "The kingdom of heaven is within you." This is a literal fact; this kingdom and government are literal, just as much so as an earthly government is literal.

"The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king." Isa. 33:22. And if all people on the earth were Christians, then there would be here a government of God, just as there will be when all on the earth who are not Christians shall have been blotted from its face. The conduct of the Christian—in business as well as in religion—is controlled by the kingdom of God within him and not by any earthly government under which he lives. He is subject to the rules of earthly government for "conscience' sake" (Rom. 13:5), or because he is under God's government. He is the most useful of all men on the earth because his citizenship is in heaven.
