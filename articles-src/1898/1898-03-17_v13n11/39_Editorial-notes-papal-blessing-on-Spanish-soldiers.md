It is stated upon good authority that the pope's blessing has repeatedly been bestowed upon the Spanish soldiers and arms in Cuba; and as the Spanish army celebrates mass in the field as faithfully as though it were a part of military tactics, and the soldiers are faithful Catholics, there can be no reason why the papal blessing should be withheld, and no reason for doubting the truth of the statement. Nor is any doubt cast upon its reliability by the results which have followed the efforts of the Spanish arms in the island.
