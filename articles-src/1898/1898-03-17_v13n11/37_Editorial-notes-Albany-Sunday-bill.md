A HEARING is soon to be given at Albany on the Assembly Bill introduced by Mr. Weekes, for "permitting non-professional games and sports on Sunday after one o'clock in the afternoon in cities of the first class." If legislators would get down to principles, and not waste time and efforts on questions of mere selfish expediency, they might do much more than is being done to clear up the situation and benefit the country.
