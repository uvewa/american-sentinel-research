NEVER in the history of civilization, probably, was there a time when the sound of war so reverberated throughout the world as it does to-day. No great war is actually in progress; but everywhere there are hurried preparations for a war which, when it does come, will be greater than any which has darkened the pages of human history.

* * *

There is war in Cuba, and war in prospect between Spain and the United States. The great powers of Europe are growling at each other over the division of Chinese spoils. Japan has addressed a warlike note to Russia, and the latter government is straining every nerve to hurry troops to her Pacific Coast. England is fighting the Mahdi in Central Africa and the rebellious tribes in Northern India. In South America, Argentina is getting ready for a conflict with Chile. In Crete, affairs between the Moslems and the "Christians" are anything but quiet; and the spirit of apprehension and preparation for impending strife has invaded every civilized country on the globe.
