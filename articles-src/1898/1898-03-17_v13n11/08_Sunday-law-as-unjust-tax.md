A SUNDAY law is a tax, demanding one seventh of all an individual's time. And this time is money to the individual, but cannot possibly be such to the government which demands it. It is of all taxes the most absurd, useless, unwarranted, and unjust. God alone has the right to require one seventh of a person's time, and he alone has a wise purpose in requiring it.
