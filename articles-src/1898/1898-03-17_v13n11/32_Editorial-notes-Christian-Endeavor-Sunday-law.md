THE Christian Endeavor Society of Syracuse, N. Y., in recent session passed a number of resolutions for presentation to congressmen from their district, among which was one "To enact a Sabbath law for the national capital." We are sorry to note that this seems to represent a general sentiment among the members of this great organization.
