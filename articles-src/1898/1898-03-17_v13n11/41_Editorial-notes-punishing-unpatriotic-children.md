THINK of the absurdity—to say nothing of the wickedness—of punishing a child in the public schools for not being "patriotic"! and punishing him severely, too. (We refer to the incident in the Brooklyn school, mentioned in our last issue.) The most unreasonable demands are generally accompanied by the severest punishments in case of refusal. Think of a school teacher assuming to know when a child is patriotic and when he is not! What constitutes the highest, truest patriotism? Who has authority to settle the question for everybody else, or for anyone else? Who has authority to set up a standard of patriotism in the public schools and compel anybody else to conform to it? Even if patriotism were a thing as well defined and understood as the multiplication table, who has a right to compel anyone else—child or adult—to be patriotic? What court would enforce such a claim, or listen to it for a moment? The children have a right to be protected against such teachers.
