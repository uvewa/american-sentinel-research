In a Roman Catholic church in Pueblo, Mexico, there was recently posted the following notice, which was seen and read by Rev. Francis S. Borton, a Protestant missionary, who sent a transcript of the same to the Christian Endeavor World:—

"Raffle for Souls. At the last Raffle for Souls the following numbers obtained the prize, and the lucky holders may be assured that their loved ones are forever released from the flames of Purgatory:—

"Ticket 841. The soul of the lawyer, James Vasquez, is released from Purgatory and ushered into heavenly joys.

"Ticket 41. The soul of Madame Calderon is made happy forever.

"Ticket 762. The soul of the aged widow, Francisca de Parras, is forever released from the flames of Purgatory.

"Another raffle for souls will be held at this same blessed Church of the Redeemer on January 1st, at which four bleeding and tortured souls will be released from Purgatory to Heaven, according to the four highest tickets in this most holy lottery. Tickets, one dollar. To be had of the Father in charge. Will you, for the poor sum of one dollar, leave your loved ones to burn in Purgatory for ages?"

This is Romanism "at home," where her true nature is most clearly seen. What the Roman religion is in Mexico, and in South America, that it is in its real nature here in the United States. Of this there can be no question whatever. And it is evident that it is the same now as it was when the monk Tetzel went through Germany peddling his "indulgences," which roused the indignation of Luther and started him upon the work of the Reformation.
