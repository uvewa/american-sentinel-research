"MAMA, this Sabbath question bothers one ever so much. Sometimes I feel provoked to think the pope has cheated one into Sunday keeping, and then again I feel almost mad at God to think he let me go on in darkness, and do tell me, mama, why it was. There are just thousands and thousands of people who are serving God who never heard that Sunday wasn't the Sabbath. What will become of them? Yes, and of all the good people who died without knowing it?"

"Well, Charlie, you've asked me question upon question, which shall I answer first? The last I think, and that by a story I heard a minister tell a few nights ago when I asked him the same questions.

"He said, 'Suppose a man has a counterfeit bill; but has no idea it is counterfeit. He goes to a store and offers it in payment for goods. The store-keeper detects its spurious character and returns it, saying, "I know you did not know it was counterfeit, and therefore I cannot justly charge you with dishonesty." This is the way many offer Sunday to God. They think it genuine. He knows their honesty and accepts their sincerity. But suppose the man after fully knowing the character of his bill goes to offer it to another store-keeper. Ah, then, Charlie, he cannot stand as an upright man. And as to this Sunday worship, God alone can tell when people know it to be a spurious day of rest. The reason we have so long been ignorant of this matter, I will try to tell you. The varying feelings you experience will soon pass away like troubled waters from a fountain of peace. The Sabbath truth is one of the most profound rest, and when it gets in, you will find Jesus more fully than ever before. What does the word Sabbath mean?"

"Rest," said Charlie.

"To whom are we invited to come to find rest?"

"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest, . . . and ye shall find rest unto your souls," repeated Charlie.

"Now, why is it possible for Jesus to give us rest?"

"Because he has it to give."

"Where did he get it?"

"From his father, I suppose."

"Why can the Father give rest?"

"O mama, you do ask the queerest questions. Because—why because—"

"That won't do, Charlie. 'Because' is a woman's reason, they say. I'll ask you another question, What is God?"

"God is love."

"Do you have a sense of rest when you are in the presence of those who love you?"

"Yes, mama."

"Then if God is love, and love gives rest, the reason why God can give rest is very plain. Now, when God had finished the heavens and the earth, what did he do?"

"He rested and was refreshed."

"Does God get weary?"

"Fainteth not, neither is weary," said Charlie.

"No; it was not physical weakness that called for this rest. What is expressed in God's works? Please read Rom. 1:20."

"The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead."

"Then God's works in nature tell us of his character, his love. The psalmist says, 'The heavens declare the glory of God.' When God looked upon nature he looked on the expression of his love and rested in love. He gave us the Sabbath as a sign of our rest in his love. Resting in his love we have an anchor both sure and steadfast entering into that which is within the vail, that is fostering unto the throne of God himself. In keeping the seventh day holy, we acknowledge God as our Creator, and as it will take nothing short of creative power to redeem us, we also acknowledge him as our Redeemer, and so, Charlie, what a glorious rest we experience in more fully comprehending the power of him who has loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto God!"

"O, mama, it is really beautiful. There is plenty of power behind the true Sabbath, and I can see it would never be necessary for the state to back it up with its puny force."

"That is so, my boy. It is the utter weakness of Sunday, for which there can be found no 'Thus saith the Lord' that sends men to the state for its enforcement.

"Now for your first question. Why have we not found the Sabbath before? Please turn to Dan. 7:25, once more. How long were the saints, the law, and the times to be given into the hands of the papacy?"

"'Until a time, times, and the dividing of times,'" read Charlie.

"Yes; but, mama, that's all Greek to me."

"It was to me until I patiently studied the Scriptures. Please keep your place in Daniel and turn to Rev. 12:14. Here the symbol of a pure woman is taken to represent the pure church. How long was she to flee from the force of persecution?"

Charlie read, "And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time, times and half a time from the face of the serpent."

"How long was she to flee?"

"For a time, times, and a half a time."

"Very well, that is exactly the time spoken of in Daniel when the papacy was to wear out the saints, and to think to change God's law and Sabbath. Now read the sixth verse, and see what this time, times, and half a time is equivalent to."

"And the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there, a thousand two hundred and threescore days."

"Now do you see, Charlie, how a time, times, and dividing of time is interpreted?"

"Yes it is clear enough. But I can't see yet how it explains the fact that we are ignorant to-day. Why, 1,260 days wouldn't be very long for the papacy to keep us ignorant."

"That's so, Charlie. I forgot that you did not know that each day represents a year. You may find this for yourself after we are through with our study by comparing Eze. 4:6 and Num. 14:34."

"So really then this period of time, times and dividing of time covers 1,260 years?"

"Yes, dear. This is not a new interpretation. Adam Clark and other accepted commentators take the same position. But we need nothing but the Bible truth."

"Well now, mama, when did this time begin?"

"Do you not remember when the tiara was given to the bishop of the church of Rome?"

"Yes; in 538 A. D."

"Now, reckoning from that time 1,260 years, we are brought down to 1798, when the pope was taken prisoner by Berthier, a French general sent to overthrow the papal power. The pope was brought to France and died in exile. Since then the pope has been called the 'prisoner of the Vatican,' and these great truths have been coming to light. Persecution has not generally troubled the world since then. The law and the Sabbath are coming out of his hand, and we are receiving advance light. O Charlie, let us no longer look on the Dark Ages side of this question. The Light of the world seems walking just before us, saying, 'If any man will come after me, let him deny himself (self), and take up his cross and follow me.'"

"Yes, mama. How sweet it seems to think we are getting rays of light from Jesus, and there is another verse that does me good; for if we follow him then this will come true, too, 'That where I am, there ye may be also.'"
