The following from the Denver (Col.) News, of March 1, gives the latest information that has come to us regarding the situation raised by the flag salute in Boulder:—

"Boulder, Colo., Feb. 28.—The flag salute controversy was heard before County Superintendent Harding this afternoon. Dr. Reed represented the Seventh-day Adventists and Chairman E. J. Temple the school board. After reviewing the case Superintendent Harding decided that the flag salute, as it now stands, is a religious test and ordered that all students expelled for non-compliance with the salute order be reinstated at once. As Chairman Temple left the office he announced that the school board would have a flag salute enforced in the schools next Monday morning so modified from the present form that it could not be disqualified on religious principles."
