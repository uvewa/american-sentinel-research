WHILE science and civilization have done much to ameliorate the condition of the race, it is evident from the situation to day that they have not kept pace with the power of human greed and selfishness to plunge the race into misery and woe. Selfishness finds some way to "get around" science and civilization every time. Never was there such need of the spirit of brotherly love.
