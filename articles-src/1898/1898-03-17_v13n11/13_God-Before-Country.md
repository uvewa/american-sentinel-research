*The "Independent" (N. Y.), March 10.*

A REPRESENTATIVE Catholic paper, published in Chicago, makes the following extravagant declaration of the loyalty of Catholics to the flag in case of war with Spain:—

"If once war were declared between this country and Spain, the sentiment of Catholics, as of those of other creeds, would be accurately summarized in those famous words of Stephen Decatur: 'Our country: in her intercourse with foreign nations, may she always be in the right; but, our country, right or wrong.' So say not we. We boast not that kind of loyalty. We believe in putting God before country always; religion before patriotism, if the two—which God forbid—should ever clash. John Quincy Adams once rebuked that sentiment of Stephen Decatur's:—

"And say not thou, 'My country right or wrong,' Nor shed thy blood in an unhallowed cause. . . . If then thy country trample on the right, Furl up her banner, and avert thy sight."
