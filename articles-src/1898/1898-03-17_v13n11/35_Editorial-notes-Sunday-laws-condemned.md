A FORCIBLE condemnation of Sunday laws is contained in the following words spoken at the Christian Endeavor convention at San Francisco, by Rev. Robert Johnston:—

"Idleness is not holiness; cessation from toil and pleasure-seeking is not Sabbath keeping. Separation to a special purpose is the root idea of holiness, and the day that is separated unto God is the true Sabbath."
