IN making note of the death of the well-known newspaper writer, Mr. Harold Frederic, after having been treated by "Christian Science," the Independent, of this city, adds this appropriate comment:—

"Harold Frederic died of Christian science. It is a most curious question why this silly delusion has such a vogue, even among men, and especially women, of fair culture. The name partly explains it. It pretends to be science. Everybody nowadays believes in science, puts faith in it; but comparatively few people have any real scientific training or are competent to tell science from charlatanry. Here we might find an argument for much more careful training in science. We do not hesitate to say that neither Harold Frederic nor any other of the dupes of this delusion has ever taken a real course in any science, chemistry, physics, biology, which required a careful consideration of what constitutes the proof of a proposition. They have never learned to ask Nature questions and await her answer."

To which it might be added that they are also in ignorance of the real science of Christianity.
