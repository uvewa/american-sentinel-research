One of the unmistakable movements of the day amongst ecclesiastical bodies is that toward Christian unity. It has long been looked upon by these religious bodies as something so very desirable that it ought by some means to be attained. Cardinal Gibbons, in a sermon at St. Patrick's Church, in this city, recently voiced this sentiment. He said: "A yearning cry for Christian unity has gone forth. It is echoed from every portion of the Christian world. All of us share in this holy desire. We would be willing to surrender all that is dear to us, even life itself, for this happy consummation. If Americans enjoyed united Christian belief as they possess commercial and political unity, then, indeed, the universal reign of Jesus Christ on earth would be accelerated. But there is one basis of this unity, and that is the basis established by Christ and his apostles."

It is evident that the only true basis of Christian unity is harmony of belief and purpose, in accordance with the Word of God; and as this can only be brought about by the Spirit of God in the hearts of the unbelievers, it follows that any external pressure applied to the multitude of conflicting creeds of Christendom would be futile. An appearance of unity might be attained under the pressure of fear, but it would be only concealed hypocrisy; the disunion would all be there.

The strife in the efforts to attain Christian unity will be seen in the fact that each sect of Christians will desire to have all other Christian sects unite on its own belief. This of course is natural, as each one believes it is right. At the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of America, recently held in this city, a church unity amendment was discussed in which some of the speakers expressed the opinion that Protestant denominations of the country will ultimately unite one and all as the church of the American people. Cardinal Gibbons, in the sermon referred to before, said: "Now where shall we find that unity and concord which Christ so earnestly demands? We shall find it only in the Catholic Church. The Church of God contains about 250,000,000 adherents, scattered throughout the globe. They have all one Lord, one baptism, one faith, one creed. They receive the same sacraments, they worship at the same altar, they pay allegiance to the same spiritual head. No matter how learned or popular a man may be, as soon as he contumaciously denies a single article of faith, or withdraws from the union of his legitimate pastor, he is cut off like a withered branch from the vine of the church." And that church has always used the power of the state, whenever she has had the power, to keep her people from doing so wicked a thing as that.

It is evident that the religious bodies who are so earnestly seeking unity, are not doing it by seeking the power of the Spirit of God to bring them into harmony, but by seeking the power of the state to compel religious conformity by law. And the common ground upon which they are working now is the observance of Sunday enforced by law. This recognizes the principle as right, and the only logical outcome of it will be a state church with no tolerance for heretics.
