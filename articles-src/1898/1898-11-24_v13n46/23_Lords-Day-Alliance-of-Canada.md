THE "Lord's Day Alliance" of Canada reports that it has in progress a number of lawsuits instituted to enforce Sunday observance upon corporations and individuals, and is waiting for a final decision to be given by the courts which will serve as a rule for such cases. It has succeeded in drawing from the attorney-general the statement that in the opinion of the government "the Lord's day should be preserved inviolate from labor." It is expected, further, that the Ontario government will submit a special case to the Court of Appeal for the purpose of ascertaining the real meaning of the Lord's Day Act. All this reveals the present activity of these Sunday organizations.
