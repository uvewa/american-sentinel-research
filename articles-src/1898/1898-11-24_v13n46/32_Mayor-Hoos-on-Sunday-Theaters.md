MAYOR HOOS, of Jersey City, has declared himself in favor of open theaters on Sunday. He does not believe in giving the sanction of law to Puritanical ideas of religion. On this point he has expressed himself thus: "God made the rose to give out its perfume on Sundays as well as week days, and there is no reason why man should not get all the legitimate enjoyment there is in life on Sundays as well as on week days. Open theaters on Sundays would keep many young men from going to haunts of vice in New York, and would benefit Jersey City. I shall do all I can to have the theaters opened on the Sabbath, and to make Sunday performances permissible."

Sunday is not the Sabbath; but if a person prefers going to the theater on the Sabbath, it is of no benefit either to him or to others to prohibit him from going by law.
