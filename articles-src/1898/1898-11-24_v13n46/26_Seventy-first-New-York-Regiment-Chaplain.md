THE Seventy-first New York Regiment, over which much ado has been made in this city, were mustered out of the service on the 15th inst., and took occasion on their release from army discipline to express their opinion of army chaplains, with special reference to the chaplain of the Seventy-first Regiment. Him they represented by a straw-stuffed effigy, which they pelted with old shoes, bits of wood, and other missiles; afterwards, it is said, greeting the chaplain himself with a shower of pie pans and various culinary articles. The men declared that the chaplain had performed only three services between June 23 and August 8; that he had failed to attend to their mail after having undertaken to do it; and that he had kept the best food and delicacies for himself and the other officers of the command. There may have been good grounds for these complaints, and on the other hand, the chaplain may have done the best he could under the circumstances. But in either case a very discreditable reflection is cast upon the office as regards its usefulness in promoting piety among the troops.
