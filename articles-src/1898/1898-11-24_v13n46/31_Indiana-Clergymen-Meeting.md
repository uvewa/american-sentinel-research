A general meeting of Indiana clergymen is announced, says the Louisville Courier-Journal, for November 27, 28, at which various topics relating to public morals will be considered. The subject of denominational union, also, will be made prominent. On this point the Courier-Journal says:—

"An effort will be made to combine all Protestant churches in one great church. This is the first step in the Central States in this direction. All the churches will retain their denominational character; cooperation in parish work will be provided; the minister of one church will preach for another and assist in evangelistic work, even though the churches be of different denominations; a division of territory for canvass as to church tendencies and for spiritual work will be made, and for many other things new to Protestant churches."

Church confederation is quite possible for the sundered Protestant sects; but that is another and very different thing from Christian union.
