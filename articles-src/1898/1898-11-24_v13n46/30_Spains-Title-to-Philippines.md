THE Rev. Edward Everitt Hale, a well-known clergyman of Boston, says that the Philippine archipelago should not be restored to Spain, for the reason, among others, that Spain never had any title to their possession. All the claim Spain ever had on them was by virtue of the pope's bull issued some centuries ago dividing up all the undiscovered earth between Spain and Portugal; Spain taking all that portion lying west of a line of longitude drawn near the Azores. When Magellan discovered the islands he supposed that they were to the west of the pope's line; but as they actually lie to the eastward of it, in the domain given by the pope's bull to Portugal, they are really the property of that country and never belonged to Spain, if that authority which Spain has so long and faithfully recognized amounts to anything.
