THE reform-by-law experiment is being tried in Streator, Ill. The Times-Herald (Chicago) reports that a "good citizenship" league, with a roll of nearly a thousand voters, has been organized, and that "many merchants who hitherto have kept their places of business open on Sunday, have promised to close them. "Prosecution," it is added, "will be commenced at once against all who refuse to obey the law." It is further stated that "This uprising for civic purity is the chief result of one of the most wonderful revivals and reform meetings ever held in Streator."
