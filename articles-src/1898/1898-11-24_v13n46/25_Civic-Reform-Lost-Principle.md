THE fundamental principle of government laid down in the Declaration of Independence, is that governments are instituted to preserve the unalienable rights of the individual; but this principle is lost sight of in almost every instance of "civic reform." A revival which leads people to go beyond this and attempt to suppress immorality as such by the civil law, is certain to work more harm than good.
