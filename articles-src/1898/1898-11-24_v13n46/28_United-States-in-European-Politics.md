THE statesmen of Europe, says the London Spectator, "universally fear the advent of the United States in European politics." And the particular thing which they fear about it is the prospective Anglo-Saxon Alliance. The "line of cleavage" which is showing itself through the civilized peoples of the earth, puts the Anglo-Saxon nations against the Latin nations, and makes an Anglo-Saxon alliance in some form almost inevitable.
