THE New York Sun tells this story illustrating how Christianity is shorn of its independence and degraded to the level of subjection to human authority, under the system of state maintenance of religion. It is this system which provides the army chaplains. The Sun refers to the incident as an example of "clerical intolerance," though the real intolerance was all on the other side:—

"The occasion was the memorable ceremony which took place at Khartoum when the triumphant Anglo-Egyptian army crowned their campaign of vengeance by celebrating the rights of Gordon's funeral. By common consent the various chaplains attached to Kitchener's forces—Anglican, Methodist, Romanist, and so forth—had agreed, with one exception, to recite a specially compiled prayer during the service at the tomb. The one exception was a strangely obstinate cleric. Kitchener, hearing that the reverend gentleman in question had refused to join in reciting the prayer, promptly sent for him and asked if the rumor which had reached him were true. 'Certainly,' was the cleric's uncompromising reply. 'Very well, then,' said Lord Kitchener, taking out his watch, 'I give you just five minutes to consider whether you will join in reciting this prayer or not, and if you don't I shall march you down to Cairo under arrest.' Before the five minutes were up, the Rev. Mr. —— had decided that to obey was better than sacrifice, when a man like the Sirdar was concerned, and it is satisfactory to know that at Gordon's tomb, at all events, the representatives of normally warring sects were absolutely unanimous in their petitions to heaven."
