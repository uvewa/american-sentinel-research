Professor Eaton, well known in Methodist circles of the West, created a sensation at the Layman's Congress of the M. E. Church at Philadelphia, the 16th inst., by declaring that the churches had largely become old-fogy organizations, which instead of pulling in the contest for the supremacy of truth and righteousness in the earth, were dragged along by the force of moral sentiment which was working in the world without; that the church to-day does not exist for the people, but seems to imagine that the people exist for it. Whether Professor Eaton's charges are warranted in whole or only in part, it is significant that they are made at a time when the church is manifesting much activity in the arena of politics.
