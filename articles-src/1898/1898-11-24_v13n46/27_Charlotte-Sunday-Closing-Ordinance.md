MINISTERS of Charlotte, Mich., have prevailed upon the town council to pass a Sunday-closing ordinance, and are making a vigorous effort to have it enforced. One clergyman of the place advocated a boycott against every place of business which should be kept open on Sundays thereafter. A boycott and a Sunday law go well together.
