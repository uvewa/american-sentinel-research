According to statistics, Christianity is declining in the earth at the rate of about one per cent. of the population every seven years; that is, an additional one per cent. of the inhabitants become non-Christians in that period. This of course is mainly due to the increase of population in heathen lands. It should be borne in mind that only nominal Christianity can be measured by statistics.
