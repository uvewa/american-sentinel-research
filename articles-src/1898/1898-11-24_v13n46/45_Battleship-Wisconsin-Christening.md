An effort was made by Milwaukee brewers to have the new battleship "Wisconsin" christened with a bottle of beer instead of wine, the brewers offering to have a special bottle blown for the occasion and inclosed in a gold and silver net, on which was to be a plate engraved with a picture of the ship and a portrait of the young lady who was to do the christening. Let us talk softly about the foolish ceremonies of the heathen in other lands, in view of such heathen folly at home.
