If this is a Christian nation—

How is it that the number of the poor increase annually, while the rich double their wealth in the same period?

The Bible says the primitive Christians shared their wealth with the poor. Acts 4:34, 35; Acts 2:45; 1 John 3:17.

How is it that thousands of preachers absolutely deny that Jesus is the Son of God?

The Bible says such as do this are "antichrists." 1 John 2:22.

How is it that the great army of drunkards augments yearly?

The Bible says "drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Gal. 5:21.

How is it that the whole nation is energetically seeking for worldly pleasure, in preference to the power of God?

The Bible says they who do this have a form of godliness, but deny its power. 2 Tim. 3:4, 5.

How is it that the whole nation is so lukewarm in following Jesus?

The Bible says that the Saviour will spue such out of his mouth. Rev. 3:16.

How is it that the missionary societies are impeded from extending their evangelistic operations through lack of financial support?

The Bible says a tenth of all received should be given to support the house of God. Mal. 3:7-12.

How is it that the pastors complain so bitterly of the poor church attendance?

The Bible says the true Christian loves to go to God's house. Psa. 122:1.

How is it that the spirit of hatred enters into even the sacred precincts of the church?

The Bible says, he that says he loves God and hates his brother, is a liar. 1 John 4:20. And liars cannot enter the kingdom of God. Rev. 21:8.

How is it that some aspire to regenerate our land by legislation?

The Bible says the blood of Jesus Christ alone can cleanse from sin. Zech. 13:1; 1 John 1:7.

How is it that National Reformers would employ force to compel others who dissent from them to embrace their opinions?

The Bible says, "God is love;" Christ draws, but never compels. Songs of Solomon 2:4; Hosea 11:4; John 12:32.

Now if this state of things exists, and no honest man can deny that it does, how can our friends who pose as National Reformers, still persist in denominating this a Christian nation? To be a Christian one has to experience in his own life the regenerating influence of the Spirit of God. And when that Spirit is in the man it will soon demonstrate itself and prove the person possessing it to be a new creature in Christ Jesus; since the fruits of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance—will reveal themselves in lives of good Christians.

It is a great error to think God will save a nation collectively. Only as the individuals composing that nation call upon the name of the Lord can they hope to be saved; and not until every individual in the country has personally applied to Jesus for pardon can the nation be classified as Christian.

If we call the United States a Christian nation do we not stigmatize with the most lasting reproach the name of Christ? Compare our own Christian nation with any so-called heathen nations and you will find in a great many respects the balance is in favor of the heathen, as against the "Christians." They steal not, neither participate in "sharp" commercial enterprises or speculation, neither do they blaspheme, nor use alcoholic drinks; and not only this, but they are ten times as fervent in following their religion as are the vast, vast majority of "Christians" in pursuing theirs.

When we seek to change and regenerate our nation by human laws, do we not seek to convert people by human righteousness? When we seek to uproot evil by any other means than the preaching of Jesus Christ, it is because we are ignorant of God's righteousness, and we go about to establish our own righteousness, having not submitted ourselves to the righteousness of God. Rom. 10:3. And since we know that "our righteousness" is as "filthy rags," valueless; so, too, we know that any legislative effort to change the lives of men is not only valueless, but opprobrious and repugnant to all men of ordinary intelligence and understanding.

May we then receive the divine righteousness into our hearts, and show what it is to be Christians in truth, since only then shall we be able to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, and in this present generation "to be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, to shine as lights in the world." In this way only can God be glorified, and the reproach taken away from his cause.
