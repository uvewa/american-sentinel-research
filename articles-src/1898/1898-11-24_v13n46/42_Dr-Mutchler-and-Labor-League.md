The Rev. Dr. Mutchler, who is secretary of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association (the Philadelphia association for Sunday enforcement) is stirring things up along that line in Pennsylvania. Recently, says the Philadelphia Inquirer, he appeared at the session of the United Labor League of that State, and urged upon the representatives of labor that they should urge upon the legislature the necessity of looking more closely after the enforcement of Sunday rest. The league, it is stated, "heartily applauded the address of the secretary of the Sabbath Association, and the delegate from the Barbers' Union stated that they were reaching a point in their preparations where they were about ready to begin the Sunday-closing movement by vigorous action."

For years the clergy represented in the Sunday-law movement have been urging the labor organizations to urge the necessity of Sunday rest by law; and their efforts are beginning to bear fruit. But there is something strange about a physical necessity that is not felt by the ones deprived of it until it is pointed out to them by a body of clergymen.
