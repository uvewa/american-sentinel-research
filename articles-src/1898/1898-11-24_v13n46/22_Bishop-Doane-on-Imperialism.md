BISHOP DOANE, of the Episcopal Church, has added his voice to the many that have already spoken for American ecclesiasticism in favor of imperialism. In his annual address to the priests of his diocese, recently, he said:—

"I am not frightened by the alarming sound of this new-coined word 'imperialism,' which may mean much of good or much of evil. The brave and honest, and it seems to me the sensible and the only attitude is that of waiting upon God, to learn and get from him the wisdom and the grace to work out his will, which has carved out with sword and cannon and musket, by fleets and armies, a new place for this people among the nations of the world. We have won, not a victory over a brave but feeble foe, but we have won unity among ourselves, the knitting together of the English-speaking race, the deliverance of an oppressed people, an open way among the nations for a purer faith, a truer liberty, a finer civilization."

This expresses that "enchantment to the view" which is lent by distance. When we get closer to the actual facts and circumstances of that life and government with which the American nation is to bless subjected races, we see little indeed of "a purer faith, a truer liberty, a finer civilization." Republican government has become corrupted at its fountain head; faith is dying out of the churches; and liberty is becoming lost amidst the upheavals in social and industrial life. Yet now, as ever, Christianity stands as the sure refuge of individual freedom.
