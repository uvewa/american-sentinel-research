In vain, then, do Mr. Burke and Mr. Gladstone appeal on behalf of the principle of establishments to the general practice of mankind. That general practice, pagan and papal but not Christian, has ever been employed to sustain tyranny and priestcraft, to crush liberty and to repress truth; and can ill be pleaded on behalf of a principle which it illustrates only to brand with eternal infamy.

Throughout the preceding sketch of church history we see the state churches, like the imperial harlot in the seventeenth chapter of the Apocalypse, committing fornication with the kings of the earth, by disloyally transferring to them Christ's right of governing his churches, receiving from them their golden hire in return; and the free churches, like the woman of the twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse, persecuted by the dragon, and driven into the desert.

We see the state churches, like the harlot, clothed with purple, and adorned with gems, Rev. 17:4; and the free churches, like the woman clothed with the sun, radiant with the glory of divine grace, Rev. 12:1.

We see the state churches, like the harlot who was seated on the symbolic beast, sustained by superstitious and ungodly majorities, Rev. 17:3; and the free churches, like the sun-bright woman, who was solitary in the wilderness, long deserted and proscribed by them, Rev. 12:6.

We see the state churches, like the harlot, persecuting the saints of God, Rev. 17:6; and the free churches, like the sun-bright woman, sustained by God under persecution, Rev. 12:6.

We see the state churches, like the harlot, exulting in their numerous adherents, power, and wealth, and exclaiming, "I sit a queen, and shall see no sorrow," Rev. 18:7; and the free churches, at length helped by the earth, because at length the world began to favor entire liberty of conscience, and respect justice between man and man, Rev. 12:16.

In the state churches we see too much approximation to the great apostasy; and in the free churches no less conformity to the predicted condition of the church of Christ.

All history proclaims that the union, tried through long centuries of misrule, and found everywhere to be only potent for evil, should at length give place to Christ's own law of spiritual liberty, through which alone his churches can accomplish their beneficial mission, to bring the nations of the earth into the service of the Redeemer, and to make all intellects and all hearts tributary to his glory.
