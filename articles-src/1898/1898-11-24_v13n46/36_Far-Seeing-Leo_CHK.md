In order that the scheme of the papacy shall not be recognized in its true light, it is necessary for the pope to appear as though he was in perfect accord with the United States with reference to the question of religious liberty.

Consequently, Archbishop Chapelle hastened to tell the correspondent of the New York paper from which we quoted last week, that the "pope was absolutely in accord with the conditions of religious liberty existing in the United States, and would heartily welcome the same relation of church and state in Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines should events establish our flag there permanently. . . . He believes in religious liberty before all things."

How is this? How does it happen that the pope is "absolutely in accord with the conditions of religious liberty" as it exists in this country? Is this the "absolute" truth? Or is "His Holiness" lying—doing evil that good may come? Or have the conditions of religious liberty in this country so changed that there is in this respect perfect agreement between this Government and the papacy? For it is certain that the papacy is opposed to religious liberty—other than that which is based upon a "right conscience" (as Cardinal Gibbons artfully expresses it),—the only "right conscience" being the Catholic conscience. Only a few weeks ago there was published in a New York paper an interview had by W. T. Stead with a Belgian statesman of prominence, of pronounced liberal views, with direct reference to the question of religious liberty in the Philippines. Asked if the pope shared his views on the question, the answer was: "You cannot expect the pope to make any declaration in that sense. He could not do so without repudiating doctrines affirmed by his predecessors. . . . As a matter of principle, no pope can declare in favor of any refusal to enforce religious uniformity."

But the principles of religious liberty that were adopted by the founders of this Government, and which are supposed to exist here to-day, were in direct opposition to the papacy. And the papacy knows it.

Thus a Catholic organ—the *Catholic World*—no longer ago than 1871 said: "Speaking of the Constitution: As it is interpreted by the liberal and sectarian journals that are doing their best to revolutionize it, and is beginning to be interpreted by no small portion of the American people, or is interpreted by the Protestant principle so widely diffused among us, . . . we do not accept it, or hold it to be any government at all, or as capable of performing any of the proper functions of government; and if it continues to be interpreted by the revolutionary principles of Protestantism, it is sure to fail. . . . Hence it is we so often say that if the American republic is to be sustained and preserved at all, it must be by the rejection of the principle of the Reformation, and the acceptance of the Catholic principle by the American people."

It therefore follows that when the pope expresses himself as being "absolutely in accord with the conditions of religious liberty existing in the United States" we are left to conclude that either the pope is lying or that he has "repudiated the doctrines affirmed by his predecessors" (in which case he will have ceased to be a Catholic, and therefore, in common fairness to the Catholic people, ought to vacate the pontifical chair); or that the "conditions of religious liberty existing in the United States" to-day are entirely different to what they were formerly.

And far-seeing Leo knows perfectly well that this last is true; while at the same time the American people are ignorant of it. And this very ignorance will enable the pope to more effectually "pull the wool" over the eyes of the American people.

Leo XIII. knows perfectly well what he is about; would that the American people—and especially those at the head of the Government—knew it too.
