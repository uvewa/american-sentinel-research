Another arrest has been made in connection with the effort to "preserve the sanctity of the American Sabbath" at Ford's Store, Md. The victim in this case is Mr. Neal, he being like the others an observer of the seventh day. The charge against him was that of keeping open store on Sunday. The arrest was made on the day Mr. Neal observes as the Sabbath. He was however released after being kept a short time in custody; for what reason we have not yet learned.
