MARTINELLI, the "apostolic delegate" of the pope to this country, has received two decrees from Rome to be enforced upon the Catholic Church in the United States, one of which places under the ban a book entitled "Monks and Their Decline," written by a priest of Buffalo, N. Y. The book has been placed upon the "Index," and all the "faithful" are forbidden to read it. The book attributes the decadence of Spain and all Latin countries to the influence and power of the monks, and intimates that the United States would do well to suppress all orders of monks in its newly-acquired possessions.
