It is the fate of the SENTINEL, as, we suppose, of most other journals, to be the subject of occasional criticism. This is proper—the SENTINEL doesn't hold itself above criticism—only we notice that the majority of these come from people who don't read it. We want to profit by these criticisms, but we hardly know how to profit by criticisms of the SENTINEL from people who don't read it.
