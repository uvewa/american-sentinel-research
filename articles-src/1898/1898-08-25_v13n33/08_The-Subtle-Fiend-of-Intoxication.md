The startling, increased, and general consumption of substitutes for alcoholic beverages, and the vast market found for cheap and drugged spirits, raises again the pertinent question whether the restriction placed upon the sale of absolutely pure products does not work harm rather than good; whether the enforcement of laws insuring purity will not better serve the cause of temperance. Possibly acts that will combine the two measures will produce the best results. It is known that, since the embargo of home-brewed ales has been in force, the consumption of spirits has greatly increased in Great Britain, and far beyond any ratio of increase of population; that more public houses are in existence; cologne drinking, chloral and cocaine taking, ether tippling, and the consumption of narcotic drugs generally, are in common vogue and daily, almost hourly, assuming enlarged proportions. Here is one of the greatest problems of our sociology, one that is, apparently, as far from solution as it was a century ago. The outward appearance as regards consumption is more seemly, but the surreptitious consumption of narcotics is in no way mitigated, but rather the contrary. The thanks and honors of the world await the individual who can formulate a scheme of reform that will be alike practicable and effective.
