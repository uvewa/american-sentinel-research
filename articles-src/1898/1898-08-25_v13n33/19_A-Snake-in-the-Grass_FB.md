"My country 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty,
Of thee I slug.
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills,
My heart with rapture thrills,
Like that above."

Tom Brown was singing "America" at the top of his voice, as he hoed away in the garden, and was thinking a great deal more about his country than of the potatoes. He paused after he finished the last verse not only to wipe the sweat off his brow, but something from his eyes. He looked around Rose Farm, then away off to the Alleghany Mountains. He could hear the splash of the river amid the rustle of trees and the pipe of the robin. The blue sky floated a white ship of cloud here and there, and peeping through the trees he could see the old farm house.

"Hurrah for America," shouted Tom. "Hurrah for Rose Wood Farm," and "snakes," yelled the boy as he gave a jump, and brought his hoe down on a long snake that was trailing through the field. "Whew," said Tom, excitedly, "There are some things that have got to be killed, even in the land of the free and the home of the brave."

Tom walked slowly to the house, thinking. "Spose its the saloons and the things that are crawling around in the dark and under foot as it were, to poison the folks and to take away liberty like they used to in the Dark Ages. Grandpa says there's a going to be a time like there was long ago. I wonder——" Tom stopped to listen.

It was grandpa humming some old Methodist hymn. Tom caught the words,

"I'm but a stranger here, heaven is my home.
Earth is but dark and drear, heaven is my home."

"Grandpa," said Tom, "what makes you sing, earth is but dark and drear. It doesn't seem dark and drear to me. And as for heaven, who wants anything better than to-day? Hurrah for 'my country 'tis of thee."

Grandpa took out his spectacles to look at Tom. He laughed as Tom threw the hoe on the ground and turned three or four hands springs to work off his superfluous energy.

"Well, my 'boy,'" said grandpa, slowly wiping his spectacles to clear them of two kinds of tears. "I bless the Lord for the earth. It belongs to him, though as the poet says, 'the trail of the serpent is over us all.' But it's only the preparatory school after all. Like old Abraham, I'm a looking for a better country, for a city that hath foundations whose builder and maker is God. But la, child, I can remember that I once felt jest as you do. I think when folks are young and full of health and spirits, that they sorter mix a good deal of heaven into the earth anyway. They feel as if they was going to live forever or as long as Methuselah did anyhow, and that life holds only good. They don't know anything yet of the cold treacherous world; but the time 'll come, my lad, when earth won't seem so bright, and when you'll long for something better."

"Now tell me about it," said Tom. "You say you used to feel as I do, and then you found out your good feelings were all a delusion. What made you, grandpa?"

"Well, Tom. What was it you used to be singing so much last winter about things not bein' always what they seemed?"

"I know," said Tom, beginning to sing,

"Things are seldom what they seem,
Skim milk masquerades as cream,
Highilows pass for patent leathers,
Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers."

"That's it, Tom. It's the insincerity of things that sicken the heart, and take the colors of beauty from the earth, and make one sing, 'earth is but dark and drear, heaven is my home.' The world as a world is good enough, provided one has health, hope, and love within. There are good people in it, too. But Oh, Tom, there are snakes. The trail of the serpent is over us all. But there is a world from which the serpent was cast out forever, and He who is to bruise the serpent, has told us to look up, where He is preparing mansions for us, and that presently He'll come and take us to Himself."

"And does this world just seem to you like a stopping place, grandpa?"

"Yes, Tom; my citizenship is yonder. You know Tom, when an ambassador is sent here from a foreign country to stay a few years in the interest of his country, he don't build him a fine mansion, take out citizen papers here, and forget that his business is simply the business of a representative of another country. That's the way it is with the Christian. He's here to represent the divine government for a season; but he expects to be called home."

"But grandpa, they are going to kill out all the snakes. I heard them talking it all over at the Christian Citizenship League the other evening. When we young folks grow up, we are going to vote down all the saloons, all the evils, all the oppression, and really make America over. We are going to make folks do right, and then this world will be almost as good as heaven. Mr. Allen said that then we might expect that Christ would reign on the earth, and that the will of God would be done on earth as it is in heaven."

"O Tom, Tom, how true it is that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. What has the good Lord himself said about his kingdom? He said, 'My kingdom is not of this world.' He said, if it was, then would my servants fight. Don't you think there would have to be some force employed to make people do right? Do you think you can compel the world to do the will of God? Do you think that law will make the world a kingdom of the God of love? The law of God is spiritual, and reaches to the intents and purposes of the heart."

"I don't know, grandpa. It seemed that it could be done when I was listening to the leaguers, and that God really expected the good people to make the bad ones come to terms."

"That scheme has been tried in the past; but it resulted in the persecution of the truly good, who were spiritually minded, and who really kept the commandments of God; and in turning the bad into the worst of hypocrites and knaves."

"Why, how, grandpa?"

"Well, first, they were going to have only Christian men in office."

"Yes, that's what they want now, and I think that's a fine thing."

"Tom, men will be anything to get into office, especially if there is a good salary behind it, or a way of obtaining money or power. Who is going to be the judge as to who is Christian?"

"Oh, I see; then you think people would pretend to be Christians to get into positions? Hum. I didn't think of that before."

"Yes; I'm sure that we should presently have officials of the type of Laud and Bonner. 'But except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.'"

"Well, grandpa, how would it affect good laws to have bad executioners?"

"Oh, we have often had that kind of government. But would the kind of laws the league wants to enforce be good laws for civil government?"

"Why, they'd be the laws of God. Where would you find better laws?"

"The law of God deals with the heart, Tom, and what would men have to enforce such laws?"

"Power to read the heart," said Tom, slowly.

"Yes, and in the Dark Ages just this kind of legislation instigated the Inquisition, in order to wrest from men the secrets of the heart by torture."

"O well, grandpa, they do not think of, carrying things to such an extent as that, but to make men act good on the outside."

"That would be proper to the extent of controlling those who would do violence to men's lives, virtue, property, or liberty; but beyond the line of civility, it would be to make men hypocrites and knaves, and to endanger and even strangle the sweet liberty we now enjoy."

"Hum," said Tom, picking his teeth thoughtfully.

"But I can't see how it would do the good people any harm?"

"Well, I can," said grandpa. "In the first place, if I live to see such a thing in a way to succeed, I would raise my voice against it as a Christian. I would protest vigorously, and the leaguers would look upon me as an enemy, and would think me a traitor to good order and an enemy to good government and to the interests of humanity, and if the law was on their side, you would have the privilege of visiting grandpa in jail, unless you would be afraid to come."

"Not much," said Tom.

"Besides, I would probably have ideas of what was right to do, that the leaguers would think were heretical, or if I did not, some one else undoubtedly would, and then men would be persecuted for their opinion, and the innocent suffer as malefactors. That's what happened when the Puritans tried this very scheme. Roger Williams was banished, Quakers were whipped, witches drowned, and doves stoned for cooing on the Sabbath."

"O grandpa, you are too ridiculous."

"No, indeed, I'm in dead earnest."

"Well, well, well! The leaguers talked a great deal about Sabbath desecration, and about enforcing the old Blue Laws."

"That's it," said grandpa. "It's the old scheme up again."

"There's a snake in the grass!" shouted Tom, rushing for his hoe. "This kind of mild weather brings them out."

"Jes so," said grandpa. "And this kind of milk and water gospel is thawing out the old dragon. Give it to him, Tom."

As Tom came back to the house, he heard two sweet quavering voices singing together—

"In the Christian's home in glory,
There remains a land of rest;
For my Saviour's gone before me,
To fulfill my soul's request.
There is rest for the weary."

"Grandpa," said Tom, "if the kingdom's come, and the will of God done on earth anywhere, I think it's in hearts like yours and grandma's."

"Yes. The kingdom of God is within you; and some day, Tom, when Jesus comes to weed out and burn up the tares, he will gather the wheat into his garner. Then he'll renew the earth, and repeople it with the righteous, and the kingdoms of this world will belong to our Jesus, and he shall rule. For 'unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion.' But it will never be made the kingdom of Christ through the enforcement of law. We are to persuade, beseech, entreat, as God's ambassadors. He'll see to the execution of judgment. By and by, Tom, the earth will blossom as a rose, and there won't be any snakes to look out for."

"Hurrah!" shouted Tom. "Then it will be 'my country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty."
