"AND it shall come to pass in the last days," speaks the prophetic Word, "that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh." How then will the Spirit be manifested by those who receive it? Jesus Christ said, "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;" and as the Spirit was manifested in him, so will it be in his followers. The Spirit has been poured out, and when it is received—when the church is ready to receive it—the world will resound with the proclamation of religious liberty in Christ.
