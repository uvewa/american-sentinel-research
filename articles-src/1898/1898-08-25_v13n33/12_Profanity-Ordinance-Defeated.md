The proposed city ordinance against profane swearing, which has been the topic of much discussion here for some time past, was voted down at a recent meeting of the board of aldermen. The author of the measure, however, is not discouraged, and says that he will continue the crusade against profanity by similar means. Meanwhile the spirit of the crusade seems to have spread to other places, and from as far west as Colorado, we hear of an agitation to suppress this form of immorality by law.

The suppression of public indecency is certainly a proper exercise of the civil power. When, however, "indecency" means only something which offends the religious sentiment of a class of the people, legal measures are out of place. Unfortunately, religious sentiment is prone to be very easily offended, and to stir up individuals to deeds which reflect anything but a Christian spirit. Christianity—love—"is not easily provoked;" but much that passes for Christianity is always quick to resent a fancied insult, and to take advantage of the law to gain some advantage over opposing religions. The superiority of the power of love as a force against evil is seen in that it stirs up no animosity and promotes no religious controversy. And love is a mighty power; it is the greatest power in the world; for love is God, and God is all powerful. Let the church have enough of God, and she will seek no further for power to combat with evil.
