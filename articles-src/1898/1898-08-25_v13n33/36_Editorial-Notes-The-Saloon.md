The saloon is a natural enemy of society; therefore we have always advocated that it be dealt with by the law of the land as such. There is not one right of mankind which the saloon respects; not one upon which it has not ruthlessly trampled. Strong drink hurls reason from its throne, and puts in its place only the instincts and intelligence of a beast. Why, then, should the saloon merit protection from those to whom it is a deadly foe? Why should a viper complain because some one does not warm it in his bosom? How many murders has the saloon committed? —think of it! In what other case does civilization throw the protection of law around a murderer with such a record? We say this is wrong; and we believe that in saying it we are right. The "moderate" drinker cuts no figure in this question. The saloon must be judged not by the moderate drinkers, but by its finished products, the drunkards.
