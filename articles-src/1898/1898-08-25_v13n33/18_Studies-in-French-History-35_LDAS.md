"I would like to join your class in the study of French History," said Fred Green, bowing respectfully to Professor Carman, "and this is my friend, Bert Mathews,—he wants to come, too, if you don't mind."

"Indeed I shall be very glad to welcome you. Now that Charlie and Robert have gone away for a time, I shall be pleased for you to take their places, and then you see our class will not suffer in membership."

"Well, you see, professor, the boys left us their vacant chairs, or I'm afraid we wouldn't have dared to ask to join you, after so long, but we knew the studies must be quite interesting, or they would not be kept right up during vacation."

"History is something, my boys, which we must take as we find it, whether interesting or otherwise; but to me, at least, French history has a peculiar interest, from the fact that I think I can trace a likeness in it to our own past history and probable future. I am glad to say the interest in our class has never seemed better than at present."

The next Tuesday afternoon the two boys, Fred and Bert, were on hand, joining the other members of the class in the cheerful room where they usually assembled.

"Who can tell me what century we have now reached in our studies?" asked Professor Carman.

"The fourteenth!" exclaimed Florence Ray.

"Is this correct? I notice Harry's hand is raised. Do you object to this date, Harry?"

"We must have reached about the middle of the fifteenth century, or a little beyond; for last week you mentioned the birth and something of the life of Columbus."

"You are in the right of it, Harry; we have reached about to the year 1495. That very wicked pope, Alexander VI., anointed King Charles VIII. with holy oil, to ensure him a prosperous war, though I much doubt if this was the least particle of help to him; for indeed the king and the pope could not agree with each other hardly long enough for the anointing to take place.

"When the king and his army arrived in Naples, they found that the king of Naples, who was a vilely bad man, was as great a coward as he was a villain. He did not wait to meet the French king and defend his country,—he simply ran."

"I wonder if the Italians were not almost glad to welcome King Charles,—he surely was not so bad a ruler as their own," remarked Will Palmeter.

"You have judged very correctly, Will; in fact they made great demonstrations of joy at his arrival. Of course this pleased the foolish, romantic young king, who wrote letters back home, stating that an earthly paradise had been found, and that he was the lucky Frenchman who had found it."

"O professor! do tell us if he succeeded in holding his conquered possessions. It seems as if it was too good luck for him to be very lasting," exclaimed Milly Brown, with sparkling eyes. "Just think of it! the silly king to run away without a word, and leave his kingdom to Charles!"

"Lasting?—O no. His enemies set traps for him into which he readily fell, and at last he was obliged to fight his way back home to France as best he could."

"Then I suppose the king of Naples came back, didn't he?" asked Fred Green, who was already becoming deeply interested.

"O no, he died; but his son and successor, who was more worthy of the name of king than he, came back to Naples, and with the help of a great captain, drove the French invaders out of their country in short order."

"Well," said Joe Palmeter, "I imagine Charles must have thought by this time that the pope's blessing didn't amount to much."

"I have no doubt he did not overestimate it then, if he did before; but he was yet young and vain; so he decided he would now try a life of revelry and foolish pleasures, which thing he did. But at last, however, he decided to reform and try to imitate the example of his illustrious namesake, Saint Louis. So he found a tree for himself,—in strict imitation of him,—and there he administered justice to the people. But he did not live long after this; he met with an accident, hitting his head against a low door through which he was passing, and this is supposed to have caused his death."

"It must have been a very low door," said Edna Phillips; "for I remember you said last week that King Charles VIII. was almost a dwarf."

"You would surely catch me, Edna," smiled Professor Carman, "with that good memory of yours, if I were not very careful to tell the exact truth. Yes, it was a very low door opening from a gallery through which he was passing. But foolish as he had been until just before his death, he was sincerely mourned by many."

"It seems to me," sagely remarked Florence Ray, "that it would have been a pretty poor king who couldn't have made friends with those loyal people,—seems as if they were just anxious to find a ruler whom they could love."

"A true observation," answered Professor Carman.

"Nearly the whole of the fifteenth century had now passed, and a remarkable century it had been. We look back to it from this distance, and it appears to us like the first hours of the morning, just before the sun appears in dazzling brightness above the horizon. With the sixteenth century came the invention of printing,—for books were all simply written before this,—which in itself was sufficient to create a great upheaval in the world. Then, too, the Old World was rubbing her eyes in astonishment, as it were, at the discovery of the New.

"In fact, from now on," added Professor Carman, "we may consider that we are 'fairly launched upon the sea of modern history.'"
