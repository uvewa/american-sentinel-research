Life with most people is a struggle to get to the top. But not all people have the same top in view. There are various tops towards which the multitudes are struggling, and various kinds of effort are required in the endeavor to reach them. Some are to be reached by selfish effort,—effort which tends rather to the injury than the benefit of the human race.

* * *

A vast number, sad to say, are struggling up the sides of the hill of mammon. That is the top they have in view, and they are striving to reach it by climbing up over the heads of their fellows. They are satisfied to pull others down, if by so doing they can pull themselves up. That is the natural method of getting to the top of this eminence. This is the kind of effort that has been put forth by the vast majority, though not all, who have been elevated by mammon above their fellows.

* * *

Human nature turns naturally toward this elevation as the one that will best reward the effort put forth upon it,—the one that will confer the greatest happiness and satisfaction in life. But what is there in reality at the top of it? Imagination sees everything there that is to be desired; but occasionally we get a very somber and prosaic glimpse of the reality. We do not naturally pay as much attention to the truth disclosed by these glimpses as to the pictures outlined by fancy; but we ought to heed them a good deal more.

* * *

Occasionally "society" gives the rest of the world a glimpse of this kind. The other day some of the aristocracy of wealth in this city got together to devise something for their amusement. These people have to be amused, as do others, to keep life from becoming a burden; but they have to seek further for their amusement, since it has to be something uncommon. The result in this instance was that the common people were startled by reports in the next day's papers of how "high" society has held a dance in which the participants wore wings and halos. Not long after this the same "society" were found seeking their entertainment by copying some of the wild and vulgar amusements characteristic of life on the outskirts of civilization. These glimpses of life on the top of the hill of mammon are very instructive, and they tell the exact truth.

It is perfectly plain from these and many other evidences that the true top to be sought in life is not that of wealth. Wealth adds many burdens, but gives no one a greater capacity for enjoyment. It confers many new cares upon its possessor, but no new faculties. It brings no new development to the higher faculties. From all it can confer, men turn again to the frivolous amusements which are characteristic of life upon its lowest plane.

Jesus Christ said, "He that will be great among you shall be your servant;" and in this is pointed out the path to real preeminence. The true top to be sought is the top of the mount of service. Whoever can most largely serve his fellow beings, approaches nearest to God who is the great Servant—the one who gives to all living things every good gift, and sustains them in life to enjoy it. There is no unrest and unsatisfied longing constantly seeking to the frivolities of worldliness in the life that is devoted to Christian service.
