One of the conditions of the treaty of Mexico with the United States, it is said, is that any future war which may break out between the two countries shall be conducted on Christian principles. Now we know this is an age of progress, and that in all sorts of matters; but war on Christian principles is certainly the latest, and if carried out, we think it will prove the greatest of them all.

Just imagine it; we think we can see two armies drawn up in battle array. A fair field is before them; the positions are taken, the great guns unlimbered. The United States general is just about to give the order to fire, when the aid de-camp comes up and respectfully reminds him that war is to be conducted on Christian principles, and that it will not do to fire. "Very true, very true," says the chief; "but what are they? I have read Vauban, and Scheiter, and Turenne, and Coehoorn. I have read the lives of the old conquerors, and I have studied the campaigns of the greatest soldiers, but I never happened to come across these principles in any work on military art. Do you know anything about it, colonel?"

"No," says the colonel.

"Nor you, major?"

"Nor I, either."

"I really don't know how to begin; I suppose it would not do to shoot. Suppose we send for the chaplain."

The chaplain arrives.

"Do you know anything about this fighting on Christian principles?"

"Oh yes, it is the easiest thing in the world!"

"Where are the books which teach the art of this warfare?"

"Here," and the chaplain takes out the Bible.

"Really," says the general, "we ought to have thought of this before. It is a bad time to commence the study of tactics when the enemy is right before us; but I suppose we are bound by the treaty. What is the first thing, Mr. Chaplain?"

"'Thou shalt not kill.' 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'"

"But these are not my neighbors. They are Mexicans."

"The same Book tells us, a little further on, that the opportunity to do good to a man makes him our neighbor."

"Will you go on, Mr. Chaplain?"

"'Love your enemies.' 'Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.' If a man 'smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.'"

"But while we are praying for the Mexicans, they will be firing into us."

"No; they are bound by the treaty also. It works both ways."

"Then I don't see as there is anything for us to do here."

"Nothing, unless you send over and ask the Mexican general if he needs anything in the way of medicines, provisions, or clothing; I rather think the treaty requires this of us."

"But how do you ever know which party conquers in the fighting on Christian principles?"

"That is the great beauty of it. Both sides conquer, and there are never any killed and wounded."
