There are people who say that the SENTINEL is hard on the Catholics. We deny this charge; certainly we do not mean to be severe on the Catholics, or on any others. But we are hard on Roman Catholic principles—we confess that. And the reason for this is that Roman Catholic principles are hard on those who adhere to them. Those principles are chains which are bound about the adherents of the Catholic belief. And when we strike the chain, with the purpose of freeing the captive, it may appear that we are striking the man instead; but this is a mistake which a little discrimination will discover. This is the trouble with many people in their attitude towards God. They do not discern that his judgments are not against the sinner, but against sin. God hates sin; but he so loved the sinner that he gave his only-begotten Son for his salvation. It is always important to discriminate between the principle and the person who holds it.
