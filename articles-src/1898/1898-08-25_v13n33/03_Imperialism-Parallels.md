The following paragraph, which reflects the popular sentiment as represented by the daily press, is from the *New York Tribune*:—

"The philosophers who believe that 'imperialism' will be fatal to the 'great experiment' had their forerunners in the people who feared that liberty would perish from the earth with the 'imperialism' of the Federal Union, and Josiah Quincy, who saw the downfall of the republic in the acquisition of Louisiana, and the race has never since run out."

To which the Christian Advocate (New York) makes this fitting reply:—

"Anything can be paralleled from human history. The hotheads who believe that 'imperialism' is 'manifest destiny' had their forerunners in the people who hurried on Rome to its overthrow, who drove France into its revolution and later into its war with Germany, and who ruined all the extinct republics, and the race has never since run out. Nor has there ever been a foolish, a wicked, or a suicidal thing done by a nation that there was not a minority that pointed out the inevitable results."
