"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee." Isa. 26:3.

Peace is a word very hard to define because there is such a depth of meaning in it. It is used to express a perfect rest, perfect quietness, perfect trust. At such times one will forget all troubles, all the ups and downs of life, and rest quietly—in perfect peace.

We speak of a time of peace, and a time of war. War is opposed to peace. Peace is the condition existing at the close of war, when all war has ceased and all is quiet. Peace is desirable above everything else. No one can be perfectly happy without it; but oh! how few there are to-day who have it. How very, very few who really know what real peace is. They long for peace, but do not find it. Why not? Simply because they do not fulfill the conditions.

What are the conditions? "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee." It is plain, therefore, that in order to have perfect peace, one must take his mind off from earthly things, which are only temporal, and look unto Jesus, who is our peace; for we read that "He is our peace." Eph. 2:14. He will come into our hearts if we will let him. Paul says, "And let the peace of God rule in your hearts." Col. 2:15. Jesus says, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock, if any man . . . open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." Rev. 3:20.

Therefore, as Jesus is our peace, and is standing at the door knocking, waiting to gain admittance, all we need to do is to "let the king come in," and we may have peace in our hearts—the blessed peace that God alone can give. No matter what the world may say or do; no matter whether we are at home by the fireside, or behind the prison bars for conscience' sake; still we are kept in perfect peace. In all things we can only praise God. Again, the apostle says, "Be careful (full of care, anxiety, worry) for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God, and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." Phil. 4:6, 7.

When we have Christ in us we will do his will. There is peace in doing as the Lord says, and knowing that we are doing his will. In Isa. 48:18 we read, "Oh that thou hadst hearkened unto my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea."

Dear reader! are you enjoying the peace of God? Are you resting in the arms of the Holy One of Israel? If you are not, it is your privilege to do so.
