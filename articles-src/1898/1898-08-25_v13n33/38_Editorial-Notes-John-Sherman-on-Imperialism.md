Among the warnings that have been sounded in the nation's ears against imperialism, a forcible one is the following from ex-Secretary John Sherman, whose long experience in the business of republican government well qualifies him to know whereof he speaks:—

"I regret to notice a disposition in Congress to reach out for outside territory. This ambition for the occupation of territory has been the ruin of Greece, Rome, and the great nations of Asia in ancient times, and of Spain, Austria, and Italy in modern times. And now the United States is in more danger from similar causes than all others combined.

"The greed of territory and the attempt to rule it lost Great Britain the great body of what is now the United States of America. If we can be content with our vast continental possessions we can dispense with the islands of the sea. There is no room for them in our system of States. Their people do not speak our language. Friendly trade relations can be easily arranged, but American domination, if attempted, will lead to interminable evils."
