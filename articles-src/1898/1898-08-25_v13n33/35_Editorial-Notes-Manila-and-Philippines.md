As if to still further complicate the situation respecting the Philippines, Admiral Dewey and General Merritt assaulted and took the city of Manila, Saturday, the 13th, and received from the Spanish commander, it is said, the surrender of the whole Philippine group. So now it is claimed by the American press that there is no Philippine question, the whole group of islands being the property of the United States by right of conquest. But this happened after the signing of the peace protocol; the American commanders in the Pacific not having learned of the advent of peace. So that it would appear that the United States is bound not to make any claim based upon the latest victory of the American arms.
