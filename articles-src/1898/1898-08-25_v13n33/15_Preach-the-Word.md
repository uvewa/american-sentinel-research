"I AM tired and sick of moral essays. It would take about a ton of them to convert a child five years old. A man was talking of a certain church once, and said he liked it because the preacher never touched on politics and religion, just read nice little essays. Give the people the word of God. Some men only use the Bible as a textbook. They go up in a balloon and talk about astronomy, and then go down and give you a little geology, and next Sunday they go on in the same way, and then they wonder why it is the people do not read their Bibles.—D. L. Moody."
