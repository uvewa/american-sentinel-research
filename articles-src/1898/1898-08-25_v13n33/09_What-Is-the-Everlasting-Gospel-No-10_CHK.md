How shall we worship God? This question is asked in view of the fact that in the everlasting gospel of Rev. 14:6.7, every nation, kindred, tongue, and people are expressly enjoined to "worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters."

It must be plain to every mind that unless one worships God aright it is not true worship. There is such a thing as worshiping God ignorantly. Paul preaching to the Athenians said, "Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."

From this it will be seen that to render acceptable worship unto God one must know him. This does not mean to know something about God, but an actual knowledge of him, just as he is.

To the woman of Samaria Jesus said, "Ye worship ye know not what." John 4:22. And so it is that thousands to-day believe that they are worshiping God when it might be truly said of them, "Ye worship ye know not what."

But the instruction that Jesus gave to the woman of Samaria is good for us now, and will help us in our sincere efforts to render acceptable worship.

In a sense as never before comprehended perhaps, the "hour cometh—yes, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father "in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeketh such to worship him." John 4:23. And the reason of this is that "God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." Verse 24.

Our conceptions of God must be right conceptions. To worship in spirit and in truth we must know the truth concerning God. But how shall we know it? "Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?" Job. 11:7, 8.

The surest way to find out God is to believe what he says of himself in his Word. He is the "God of truth" (Jer. 10:10, mar.); therefore what he says of himself is absolutely true. If we discount any statement that God makes concerning himself, to what extent we say such statement is not true to that extent we fail to have a right conception of God. And while what he says of himself is perfectly true, and in it he reveals what he is, our unbelief of that statement will eternally prevent us from knowing God as he is. And not believing what he says renders us unfit to "worship him in spirit and in truth."

The everlasting gospel calls upon all to worship God "who made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters." That being so, it must be clear that no one can render acceptable worship to God who does not worship him as the Creator.

Nor is this all. To worship God as the Creator one must believe what he says as to the manner of his creating. But the views that largely obtain in religious thought are completely at variance with what God says as to the origin of all things.

Remembering what has been said in previous articles with reference to the chronology of the gospel message of Rev. 14:6, 7, when it says "worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters," the implication is that in some respects the Lord has not hitherto been worshiped as the Creator.

No one familiar with the wording of the fourth commandment will fail to notice the similarity between this gospel call and the statements found in the fourth commandment. In the commandment itself it says, "For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is." But it also brings to view the additional fact that the Lord also rested the seventh day, and because of this he "blessed the seventh day and hallowed it."

From this it will be seen that there is a direct connection between the creation itself and the seventh day. That day God expressly says is the Sabbath, and the Sabbath finds its source in, and is inseparably connected with, creation. It is God's signature, as it were, written upon all that he has created, so that the recognition of the seventh day is the recognition of his ownership over all things.

The purpose of the Sabbath is that we might know that God is the Lord—Jehovah—that it is he who sanctifies his people, for the power by which he sanctifies is the power by which he created.

As before pointed out, to believe that God created all things is to believe what he says as to the manner of creating them.

Is it a mere coincidence then that from the pulpits of our land, and of other lands for that matter, are being breathed out views, which, while having no particular agreement each with the other, are all antagonistic to what the Word of God says with reference to the manner of the creation.

There is no coincidence about it. It is a subtle plan on the part of the great arch deceiver, through such views to so befog the minds of the people that, losing sight of the object and purpose of the Sabbath, which if observed would lead to the proper worship of the Creator, they will the more easily fall in with the plan, well and skilfully laid, to bring the people to worship the beast and his image. That he is succeeding cannot be questioned if we may judge from the multitudes who are wielding such an influence for the enforcing of what is confessedly the mark of the papacy—the Sunday, the great antagonist of the Sabbath of Jehovah, the seventh day.

To render to God then the worship that is demanded in the everlasting gospel—to "worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters," one must return to the keeping of the seventh day, which is the sign of his creative power. Ex. 31:13-17.

Nor is it a coincidence that the very people who are calling attention to this everlasting gospel from the standpoint of the prophecy of Rev. 14:6, 7, preach as an essential part of the gospel the observance of the seventh day.
