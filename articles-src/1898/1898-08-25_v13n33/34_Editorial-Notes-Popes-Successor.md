The question of Pope Leo's successor is strongly agitating the college of cardinals at Rome, owing to the apparent nearness of the pope's decease. The probabilities, it is said, point to the election of one of the Italian cardinals. Taking a look historically at the "chair of Peter," it is to be observed that it has been filled more frequently by Italians than by all persons of other nationality combined. And from this the only conclusion to be drawn, from a papal standpoint, is that the Italian nation is far superior to any other nation on earth in the sight of God. Why it should be so is a mystery for Catholics to explain.
