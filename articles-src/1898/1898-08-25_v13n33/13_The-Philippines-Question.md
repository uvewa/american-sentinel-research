A commission composed of an equal number of representatives of the United States and of Spain is soon to begin a session to determine what disposition shall be made of the Philippines. A German paper says that the foreign firms in Manila met recently and agreed to urge upon the commission that the Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustinian monks be expelled from the islands, and that there be a stipulation for the freedom of religion.

It is altogether improbable that the United States will interfere with the monks and Jesuits in the Philippines. The Government does not interfere with them here at home, and it has sent a Roman Catholic prelate from this country to the Philippines in connection with the military expedition under General Merritt, for the special purpose of explaining to the monks and other Catholics on the islands that the United States is on friendly terms with the papacy. And so far as the influence of the papacy can be used in the settlement of the question, the principles of government that have been in force on the islands will remain undisturbed.

PROBABLY no other island territory could have been selected which would make the untried problem of colonization so difficult for the American Government as it will be upon the islands so long ruled by Spain. It will be interesting to watch the result of the experiment.
