According to the London Daily Mail (London, Eng.) absence from church on Sunday is still punishable under English law. The fact was called out by a case which came recently before a London court, of which the Mail makes the following mention. And it is fitting to re-remember in this connection that these Sunday laws handed down from former centuries show us unmistakably what is the real tendency of Sunday legislation. The Mail says:—

"Very few members of the Church of England are aware that the bishops have still the power to oblige them to present themselves at church on every Sunday in the year, as well as on no less than twenty-eight saints' days.

"Moreover, they could oblige them to fast at least a dozen times a year, if they felt so inclined.

"The act under which this power is held by the bishops is one passed when people apparently were given to cock-fighting and other profane amusements on the Sabbath, in the reign of Edward, A. D. 1551. Many years later another and more stringent law was enacted, but that has been repealed, while curiously enough, the older law is still in the statute book. The latter says:—

"'Forasmuch as, at all tymes, men be not so myndefull to lawde and praise God, so readie to resorte and heare Godde's hollie worde, as their bounden dewtie doth require; therefore, to call men to remembraunce of their dewtie, it hath been provyded that there shoulde be certaine days appointed wherein Christians shoulde cease from all other kynde of labour and applie themselves onelye unto the aforesaide hollie workes.'

"And if people should not obey willingly, then it is—

"'Lawfull to all archebusshopps and busshopps to enquire of every persone that shall offend in the premisses, and to punisbe each offender, and to enjoyne him such penaunce as shall be thought mete.'

"It might be thought that this law is quite obsolete, but it is not so. Corresponding with the power of the bishops to enforce attendance, there is a duty to provide accommodation for every parishioner. Quite recently a reformatory boy was refused admission to church by one of the churchwardens, and an action was brought against the latter. The judge decided in favor of the boy, and in giving judgment, he said that though the courts can no longer fine a man for not going to church on Sundays, the bishops can 'admonish' him if he refuses to go, and he would then be compelled to pay the whole costs of the proceeding."
