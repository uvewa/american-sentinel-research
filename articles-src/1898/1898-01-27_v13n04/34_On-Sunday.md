It is wonderful how the imagination of many good people is affected by the simple fact of the occurrence of some particular thing "on Sunday."

A writer in the Iowa Homestead—a Methodist minister and superintendent of a Sunday-school—says, "I have often thought that a gun sounded twice as loud on Sunday as on any other day."

And that is just what a great many others have thought. That is how it has seemed to them, not only as regards gunning, but other kinds of sport. A game of baseball, for example, seems twice as wicked to them on Sunday as on Monday or Tuesday. Even honest work seems to them to be criminal when done "on Sunday."

Now everybody knows that a gun really sounds not a bit louder on Sunday than on any other day; it is pure imagination which distinguishes any difference. And when we come to consider any innocent sport or recreation, and all honest work, as regards Sunday, we find nothing in either reason or revelation which marks them as being criminal or wrong on that day. We can only find that to many good people they sound twice as loud, or look twice as bad, or appear twice as wicked, etc.

Yet it is upon just this basis that our Sunday laws, which put a special stamp upon things done "on Sunday," have been established. But why should we not have laws that are founded upon fact rather than fancy?
