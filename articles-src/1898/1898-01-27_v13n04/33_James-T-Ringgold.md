We were startled a few days since by the intelligence that this name, so familiar to the readers of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, had been suddenly added to the long roll of those whose voices are but a memory and from whose hands the pen has dropped for ever.

For a number of years Mr. Ringgold has been a prominent figure in the arena where is being fought the battle of civil and religious liberty against the forces which are seeking to erect upon the ruins of popular government, a despotic, man-made theocracy. While identified in religious belief with a prominent and popular church—the Episcopal—he stood ever aloof from and in opposition to the movement with which the popular churches are so largely identified, for an enforced observance of the "Sabbath." He was able to rise above an environment in every way favorable to this movement, and to see clearly the principles of liberty and justice above the mists of church theology and tradition. Nor did he, as so many do, stop with merely acknowledging these principles; he was their active advocate whenever opportunity offered for his services. With the courage of his convictions, he never hesitated in this because of the seeming weakness or unpopularity of the side which stood under the ban of "the law."

It hardly need be said that Mr. Ringgold during this time rendered invaluable service to the cause of popular enlightenment upon the vital subject of the correct principles of free government. His works "The Legal Sunday: Its History and Character," and the "Law of Sunday," will remain unimpeachable witnesses upon this point.

Mr. Ringgold was well known in his place of residence (Baltimore) as a member of the bar and instructor in a school of law connected with Baltimore University. His death, which was sudden, is attributed to disease of the heart.
