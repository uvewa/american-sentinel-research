We are informed that the controversy which was raised in Colorado by the "Flag Salute" in the public schools is still "on," the Boulder school authorities having decided that any pupil who refuses to give the salute shall be suspended. A decision in the matter is looked for from the State superintendent of public instruction.

Our next issue will treat upon a subject which is kindred to the flag salute, relating to a situation which developed some time since in a village school in Pennsylvania. It will be a "special" for that State, but will be suitable for use in every state, for as we are learning more and more from our correspondents, the situation is essentially the same all through the country. Look out for it.
