EDITOR THE SENTINEL: Our public schools in their present form were established and are supported by the state—all the people. They are to instruct the children in the sciences, and educate them in everything necessary to make them good citizens; but it does not follow that this instruction should be of a sectarian character.

The state has no right to introduce into secular education in our public schools anything of a religious character or that will in any way conflict with the religious scruples of those who support the schools.

Now to introduce the flag salute as given in the Boulder school, and which is being introduced in other schools all over the country, blends the secular with the religious. Those who give that salute in fact do not in nine cases out of ten if ever give their hearts to God. They thus solemnly assert they do something they do not do.

But an atheist parent would object to his child saying that he gives his heart to a being that he did not believe existed, and he has a right to object too.

This also brings in the question of reading the Bible in the public schools, and many other religious forms, such as special costumes, etc.

General Grant, in his memorable speech, laid down a correct principle, namely, that the matter of religion should be left to the family altar and the church. Let nothing of a sectarian nature be taught in the public schools.

W. E. ARNETT.
