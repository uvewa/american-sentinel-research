By a fire which occurred at one of the Brooklyn docks on the night of the 20th, the New York harbor mission boat "Sentinel" was damaged to an extent which will necessitate the expenditure of a considerable sum of money in repairs, before the vessel can be of further use. The boat was not insured.

The "Sentinel" is devoted entirely to the work of distributing gospel literature among the sailors and others on the ships entering the harbors of Greater New York, and is the only vessel so engaged at the present time.

Any who would consider it a privilege to aid in work of this nature, are invited to forward donations to Mission Boat "Sentinel," 39 Bond St., New York City.
