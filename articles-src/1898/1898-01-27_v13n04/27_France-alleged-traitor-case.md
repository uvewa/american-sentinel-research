In France, a very highly civilized country, there is great excitement over the question of whether an alleged traitor, who has for some years been suffering a punishment worse than was ever inflicted on Siberian convicts, and is sentenced to continue the same for life, is really guilty of the crime charged against him. What the evidence is upon which he was convicted, no one knows except a few government officials who made his trial the secret matter that it was. Not even the unhappy victim nor his counsel were allowed to see upon what evidence he was convicted and sentenced to a punishment that is almost without a parallel in modern times. And the affair having been conducted in this unjust way, it seems now to be thought by those responsible for it that the important thing is not that a possible wrong should be righted, but that the "glory" and "honor" of France should be maintained, if need be by the covering up of a terrible injustice to one unhappy individual and those whom his misfortune has involved. And upon the theory that the state is everything and the individual is nothing, this might be the most expedient course to pursue. But that theory is wrong, and nothing but evil, both for the individual and the state, can ever come out of it.
