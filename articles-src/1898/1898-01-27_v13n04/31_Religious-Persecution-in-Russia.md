A HORRIBLE feature of state religion, even as practiced in a professedly civilized country, in the year 1898, comes to light in some statements made recently by the St. Petersburg correspondent of the London Daily Mail, concerning methods pursued by the Russian government for securing conversions to the state church. He says:—

"The authorities in the government of Samara, Russia, have recently been actively engaged in the criminal pursuit of kidnapping children. In the Busulykski district all parents known to belong to heterodox sects have had their children taken from them. The police usually make their visits in the middle of the night, take the children out of bed, and carry them off in the cold night air, in spite of the frantic entreaties of the parents. Many peasants have lost their whole family in this way.

"This practice of kidnapping children is increasing in all parts of Russia. It is, of course, a gross abuse of official power, and an illegal attack on the religious freedom established by statute in Russia."

And this is supplemented by the following statement made by a Russian exile to the London Daily Chronicle:—

"The sect on which this new form of persecution has fallen most terribly is the Molokan, or Sabbatarians, so called because they keep the Sabbath on Saturday instead of Sunday. Like all the Puritan sects, they are a very peaceful and industrious people, going their own way in the fear of God. But they do not observe the fasts, nor attach any particular sanctity to priests, and they allow any one who knows the Bible well to preach to them. That is all; and now their children are torn from their homes."

We say this is a feature of state religion; for while it may be said that this is the way they do things over in Russia, and that no such thing would be tolerated in other civilized lands, it is in fact the logical outgrowth of the theory that the majority ought to rule in religion. That is the theory upon which state religion rests; and it is adhered to by vast numbers of the religious people in these United States. If it be a sound one, the Russian government is justified in its course, as being the only one which in its view will secure to the children that religious training which the majority regard as essential to their own welfare and the preservation of the government. It is all logical enough, when once the theory is admitted that the state ought to govern in religious, as in civil, affairs.

"But such a thing could never be done in this country." So you say; but "logic" has a way of leading people to terrible lengths when it once gets them off the track of right principle. The only safety is in knowing what right principles of government are, and sticking to them.
