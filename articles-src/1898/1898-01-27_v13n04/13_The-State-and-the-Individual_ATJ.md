The doctrine that the state is everything and the individual nothing is exactly the opposite of that upon which all good and just government is established.

It is synonymous with the doctrine that government is instituted not to maintain the absolute inviolability of certain individual privileges known as "rights," but only to secure "the greatest good to the greatest number."

When the supposed interests of society or of the state come in conflict with individual rights, the latter are by this theory swept aside. "It is expedient that one man should die and not that the whole nation should perish."

So reasoned the Jews when they committed the most awful mistake that it was possible for any people to commit.

It is said that the preservation of the state demands the enforcement of Sunday laws, and that when the individual conscience conflicts with the "state conscience" in such a matter, the individual conscience must give way.

We are asked to believe that it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice the individual for the good of the state or of society.

There is an illustration of this just now in France, where there is great excitement over the question of the innocence or guilt of an alleged traitor. The government seems to think that the good of France demands that the condemned individual should suffer his prescribed punishment, even though he may have been unjustly convicted.

In Russia, as noticed elsewhere in this issue, little children and infants are ruthless torn from their parents' arms in the night, by the government police, and taken away to be brought up as orthodox members of the state church. And this is done for the preservation of the state.

But the government of God holds to no such principle. That government, the maintenance of which is essential to the welfare of every being in the universe; that government, as compared with which in importance all earthly governments are as nothing,—would dissolve and go out of existence sooner than it would perpetrate a wrong upon one individual, however small, obscure, or humble. Sooner than do this, God himself would abdicate the throne of the universe. Yet an earthly government, a mere human and temporal affair, tries to justify itself in doing what would never at any hazard be dared by the government of Heaven. That which would dissolve the government of the universe, these earthly governments do for their "preservation"!

But there is nothing in it but dissolution for any government that does it, under any circumstances. The interests of the individual and of the state cannot be separated. When the state cuts loose from the individual and holds only to "the masses," it cuts loose from safe principle, and starts upon the sure road to decline and ruin.

THAT wicked spirit of enforced militarism—miscalled patriotism—is becoming more widespread, and becomes more bold, unreasoning, and vicious, as it spreads. At Appleton, Wis., there is an institution called Lawrence University that is making for itself a reputation in this species of despotism.

There is at this "university" a student who is studying for the ministry, and who, quite oddly for these days of military Christianity, has enough of the spirit of Christ to enable him to see that training for the ministry of Christ and training to kill people are not consistent; that the Spirit of Christ and the spirit of war are not in any sense compatible. He has therefore refused to engage in the military drills, or to belong to the militia, of the "university." For this he "is to be court-martialed" by the "university authorities."

The Milwaukee correspondent of the Chicago Times-Herald reports on the matter thus:—

"The parents of Otto Haefner, the student at Lawrence University, Appleton, who is to be court-martialed or refusing to drill, live at 591 Reed Street in this city, and fully sustain their son in his action. When seen today Mrs. Haefner said she could not understand why the university authorities should take such a step. 'My son,' she said, 'is studying for the ministry and has no taste for the militia. It does not seem fair that he should be obliged to drill when his inclinations are in an entirely different direction. He has been a good student, and the letters we have received from him have told how well he is getting along. He has worked hard in his studies, and certainly ought not to be punished for not being in sympathy with a military training. If he needs help, we will go to him.'"

Yes, and so should the people of the whole State of Wisconsin and of the whole United States, come to the boy's help. For it is perfectly evident that this evil spirit of enforced militarism, of despotic "patriotism," proposes to stop at nothing; but will override all individual right, all right of conscience, and even of God himself.

Wherever there yet remains any person who has any real respect for individual right, for the right of conscience, or of God, it is high time that his voice were being heard as far as it can be made to sound. A. T. J.
