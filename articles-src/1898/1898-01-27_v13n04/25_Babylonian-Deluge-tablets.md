An important discovery is announced to have been made by delivers amidst the ruins of the ancient city of Sippara, in Babylonia, in the form of tablets giving in cuneiform writing a Babylonian account of the Deluge. These tablets are supposed to be the originals from which was written an Assyrian account of the Deluge, which formed a part of the library of Assurbanipal, who reigned in Nineveh about 600 years before Christ. The Assyrian tablets gave no clue to the date at which the story of the Deluge first became a part of Babylonian literature; but the newly-discovered tablets, it is said, throw enough light on this point to prove that the account is much older than the time of Moses; and this is what gives to the discovery its "importance."

The tablets are so mutilated that only a small part of the account remains to be put into the living language of to-day; but this fragment is supposed to be the most important portion of the narrative. It sets forth that there were two gods concerned in the Deluge, one of whom was angry with the world and brought the flood to destroy it, while the other befriended mankind and caused the building of a boat in which men might take refuge from the impending destruction. This account it is said, differs materially from the Assyrian story, and both are essentially different from the Biblical narrative given in the book of Genesis. This Babylonian writing dates back to the year 2140 B. C., as the historians figure it; and as it purports to be a copy of an older record that had been destroyed, there is opportunity to suppose that the origin of the account reaches considerably farther into antiquity.

But for the unaccountable perverseness of human nature, which is well known to most people, we might wonder why it is that people will attach great importance to the discovery of these cuneiform fragments, when they have a plain, straight narrative of the Deluge, much more full and circumstantial than any other, in the book of Genesis. It can hardly be considered a rash statement to say that the Biblical narrative of the Deluge is generally regarded, among "scientific" men at least, as a myth. And whether the common people so regard it or not, it is certain that they make little or nothing of it as regards religious belief and conduct. It is rarely mentioned in the pulpit. Now, if this plain and full Biblical account of the Deluge is a myth, and of but little importance at the best, why is it that such great importance is attached to the discovery of some obscurely-written fragments of a narrative relating to the same event? Probably if the Biblical narrative had not been preserved and handed down to our times in the straightforward and well authenticated way in which it has reached us, with the indorsement of Jesus Christ and his apostles, but had been unearthed in the form of a mysterious writing upon clay tablets, it would have been hailed by "Christians" and all as the most wonderful writing in existence, and every word of it received with implicit confidence. A thing has to be "dug up" nowadays to be considered of real value as a means of information concerning the events of antiquity.
