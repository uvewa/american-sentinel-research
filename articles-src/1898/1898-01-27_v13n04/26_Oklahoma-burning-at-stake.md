A few days ago a mob of white residents of Oklahoma took two Seminole Indians who were supposed to have committed murder, and burned them at the stake. It has since appeared that at least one of the victims was probably innocent; but this is less to the point than the fact that intelligent and civilized white people should conduct themselves in this way, whether the victims were guilty or not. It is a well-known fact that burning at the stake was a common method of torture in vogue among the savage inhabitants of this country while they were contending with the white man for supremacy; and it has been supposed that the torture of prisoners is a procedure which belongs to barbarianism and not to civilization. So we are not prepared to find civilization taking lessons from barbarism and adopting its methods as superior to her own, as is seen down in Oklahoma.

We are reminded of an old saying which we believe is attributed to Napoleon—"Scratch a Russian and you find a Tartar." When civilized white people torture Indians and negroes after the fashion which is becoming so common, it suggests a wider application of Napoleon's saying, like this: Scratch a civilized person and you find a savage. It gives force to the assertion that civilization is, after all, only a thin veneer, giving a polished and refined exterior to that which at heart is only barbarism.

Is it not a truth that, after all, civilization is not the opposite of savagery, but that the opposite is Christianity? From a Bible standpoint, we must admit that this is so; for the inspired Word puts no difference between men except on the basis of "carnal" and "spiritual." The "carnally minded" are by that Book regarded as all one class, whether Bushmen in Central Africa or members of the Board of Trade in New York City. And Christianity, when it gets hold of people of whatever locality or race, makes no difference between them as regards character, giving to all the same nature, which is the nature of Christ.
