*New York "World," January 20.*

BOSTON, MASS., Jan. 19.—H. L. Atkins, of Chelsea, has been fined $50 for painting his house on Sunday. Atkins says he didn't paint; his wife says so, too, but the court have decided otherwise, and the Blue Laws are triumphant.

The house of the Atkinses—very respectable people of Chelsea—is new. Last fall they say they were unable to lower a window of Mrs. Atkins's chamber one Saturday night, and on Sunday Mr. Atkins got an oil can and a brush and proceeded to oil the window. This is the story the Atkinses tell. A neighbor who saw Mr. Atkins at work was horrified at the desecration of the Sabbath. Mr. Atkins said the work was one of necessity, but a complaint was lodged with the police. The police were horrified and they dragged poor Atkins to court. The court was horrified and Atkins was fined. An appeal was taken in vain. The fine was enforced.
