An opinion filed by the Supreme Court of Michigan, December 6, holds that reading from the Bible without comment as a part of public school exercises, is constitutional, especially where the pupils are not required to listen. The court did not say whether the King James or the Douay translations should be used, but the decision will amount to nothing until Protestants and Catholics have settled the controversy which lies between them on this point.
