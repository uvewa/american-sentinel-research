The President's message to Congress conspicuously omits any reference to the race problem which recent events in the South have impressed so painfully upon the public attention, or to the labor problem as it has developed recently in Illinois. Congress might certainly do worse than concern itself earnestly and patiently with the question of the elimination or amelioration of these difficulties which so vitally concern the welfare of millions of American citizens and the stability of government at home.
