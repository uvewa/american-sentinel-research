"ALeck, I have been studying the Book of Acts to see the results of power from on high upon the disciples. It really is marvelous, and completely upsets my theories in regard to character building. The gift of God's Spirit and its unseen operation did more for those wavering, weak men, than years of education could have done."

"Yes, that is so, Cecil. The plan of salvation was devised because men in themselves are helpless. 'There is none that doeth good, no, not one.' 'In me . . . dwelleth no good thing.' 'Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?' 'Without me,' said Jesus, 'ye can do nothing.' That is, without an indwelling Christ, no good is from us."

"Right there, Aleck, I am puzzled again. How is it, then, that good does appear in men who make no profession of Christ, and have not even heard of him?"

"It means that they have the experience of Cyrus, of whom it is said, 'I have girded thee, though thou hast not known me?' This is accounted for on the ground of the text, that Christ is the light that 'lighteth every man that cometh into the world.'"

"Then if every man is lighted, why is not every man saved?"

"Because the light is not cherished, but rejected. 'This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light.' The responsibility of our salvation or condemnation will rest wholly on us. Abundant provision has been made for our transformation, even to the bestowing of the heavenly Spirit to operate our brain and control, with our consent, every motion and emotion."

"Such a plan, with such provisions, is utterly out of harmony with the idea of legislative reform so much talked of to day. I am more and more astonished at the irreconcilable character of the two principles we have started to discuss and illustrate."

"From the remotest ages there has been war between them. Let us notice how this war was manifested in the early history of Christianity. What kind of a reception did the world give the witness of the Holy Spirit through the disciples?"

"At first there was a great turning to God. Three thousand were converted at once, and souls were added daily to the church."

"This was the springing up of the seed sown during Christ's ministry. How did the priests and rulers look on the movement?"

"With jealousy and hate. The old fear beset them as to its outcome,—as to its effect on their selfish interests."

"What did they do?"

"They called a council; they were filled with indignation, and laid hands on the apostles and thrust them into prison."

"All this stands for human power. Force is the utmost appeal. Jesus had told them what would come. The servant was not to be greater than his lord. Bonds and imprisonment awaited them."

"Aleck, how do you account for the peace and prosperity of the church to day? There does not seem to be the antagonism between the church and the world that there was then."

"I account for it on the ground of the lack of Holy Ghost testimony. When the church is baptized with power from on high, the kingdom of the world and the devil will manifest all the old enmity. But Cecil, how much power had the priests and rulers over the apostles? Were they silenced?"

"No. It says, 'The angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, Go, stand and speak-in the temple to the people all the words of this life.' It seems to me, Aleck, that ought to have strengthened the disciples, and made them ready for any thing."

"No, Cecil; the mere fact of an angel appearing was not enough. It was the Holy Spirit in them that strengthened with all might. Were the rulers and priests then convinced?"

"No; they set them before the council, and the high priest said 'Did we not straightly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood on us?'"

"You can see that self-interest was behind all their opposition. Even when the officers went after the sivilenced prisoners, they took them, it says, without violence, because they teared the people. Surely the fear of man is a snare. It makes men hypocrites."

"Surely, Cecil. Then how essential it is not to fear man, but God only. What excuse did the apostles give for continuing their witness?"

"One that is in perfect harmony with their faith, and the only answer consistent with the principle of reliance on God,—'We ought to obey God rather than man.'"

"Was that all they said?"

"O no. They went on and boldly charged them with putting to death the Saviour of the world; but I noticed that in their testimony they also held out the privilege of repentance for Israel."

"Beside this they boldly asserted the witness of the Holy Spirit, men were cut to the heart, and yet though convicted of the truth,—for the Holy Spirit convinces of truth,—they took sides against it, opposed themselves in their conviction, and for the saving of self, took up stones to kill the apostles. What prevented the carrying out of their purpose?"

"The sensible talk of Gamaliel. He told them of various efforts that had originated in man and had failed, and declared that if this was of man, it would come to naught; but if of God, it would not be overthrown. For a time his good advice was respected. What a pity it is that this advice is not always respected! Persecution would not have much chance if it were followed."

"The prince of this world counts such advice as the worst of treason."
