EDITOR SENTINEL:—The quiet little city of Moncton has been stirred from center to circumference during the past few days by the clergymen composing the Ministerial Alliance sending a protest to the city council, against the "Robinson Opera Company" singing a sacred concert in the opera house belonging to the city, and leased by A. E. Holstead. This is their letter:—

"We, the undersigned, pastors of the city of Moncton, beg respectfully to call attention of the mayor and council to the proposed concert in the opera house in the city building on Sunday evening next.

"We beg to suggest that the sale of tickets as advertised is contrary to law, and that the holding of such a concert by a comic opera company is a desecration of the Lord's day.

"We, therefore, request you as custodians of the true interests of the city to stop the holding of such a concert, which, if held, could only prove the entering wedge of wholesale desecration of our Christian Sabbath.

"Signed (by seven clergymen)."

On the strength of this, the mayor called together the aldermen in council to consider the matter. After a few minutes talk, Alderman Masters moved, seconded by Alderman Wall, that the request of the clergymen, as set forth in the petition, be complied with, and that the concert be not allowed to proceed, and that the lessee of the opera house be notified of the action of the council.

The chief of police was accordingly ordered to stop Mr. Holstead and the people from entering the building, who, after consultation with the city solicitor, decided to disobey the mandate. But as is almost sure to be the result of the first wrong step, everything went wrong. The chairman of the police committee knew nothing of the change in the chief's intentions until Sunday evening, when a messenger was sent to him notifying him of the fact. He immediately repaired to the police station, after calling the force together, and forthwith suspended the chief, appointing one of the police in his stead.

The performance was allowed to proceed without interruption, the large building being crowded.

Probably in no other way could the citizens of Moncton administer such a rebuke to the clericals as by attending the concert in such large numbers.

Notice, these seven men claim to be the "pastors of the city of Moncton." What assumption! When were these men made pastors of the city? If they had placed themselves in their true attitude, they would write something like this: We, the undersigned ministers, hired by the people to dictate to them just when they shall go anywhere—having control of, and answerable for, the morals of the community, do hereby ask, etc., etc.

No; these men are simply what other men are before the law—citizens—good citizens if they do their duty.

Next; these ministers insinuate that for opera singers to sing sacred music is a "desecration of the Lord's day." Notice; these people sing the same music that is sung every Sunday in their churches, but the church choirs, I suppose, are all sanctified singers. But even so, why should it be wrong on Sunday to sing sacred music any more than on any other day?

Again, these clerical gentlemen advise the fathers of the city to take unlawful steps to prevent a lawful gathering. Just think of it! These men who pretend to be living on a plane elevated above the ordinary class, advising a breach of the law in order to protect what they conceive to be a "desecration of the Lord's day."

But after all, this is just what we ought to expect. When unjust laws are framed, such as our Sunday law is, there is no knowing where the mischief is going to stop. It places a power in the hands of such men as these to persecute and annoy the best citizens. Wherein were these men's rights trampled upon? If they did not want to attend, their chance to stay away was excellent. It was the same spirit, manifested by these clergymen, that made the Inquisition possible, and the class that prefer a Sunday evening in the opera to an evening in the churches, have reason to feel gratified at the result.

We await with interest the next development of this tangle.

Yours truly,

D. G. Scott.

Moncton, N. B., Dec. 5, 1898.
