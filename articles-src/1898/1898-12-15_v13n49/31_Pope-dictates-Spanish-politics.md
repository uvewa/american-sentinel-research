The pope, says a London despatch, has sent a nuncio to Madrid, to impress upon the Spanish clergy that it is their duty to oppose the movement for the restoration of the Carlist monarchy. The pope does not hesitate to dictate the politics of his adherents in Spain, and there is nothing in logic or the principles of papal belief which binds him to take a different course towards his adherents in any other country, not excepting the United States.
