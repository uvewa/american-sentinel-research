And now it is a boxing class which is put forward by the enterprising and up-to-date clergyman as one of the aids to the development of Christian character! The Rev. Mr. Stoddard, of St. John's Episcopal Church, Jersey City—says the New York World—has announced that such a class will be conducted at his church hereafter on Friday evenings. This startling innovation is justified, it is said, upon the theory that boxing develops manliness, manliness goodness, and goodness faith. This plan of Christian development, needless to say, has been overlooked in the Scripture.
