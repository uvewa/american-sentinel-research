A New York daily gives the following figures and observations on the subject of the prospective increase of the military forces of the United States:—

"A Republican contemporary offers the sage observation: 'A standing army of 100,000 men will mean one soldier to 750 inhabitants. That can scarcely be deemed a crushing load of militarism.'

"No; if the load of militarism were borne by having the one soldier stand on the heads of the 750 inhabitants. It happens, however, that the pressure of the load is financial. An expenditure of $166,000,000 a year for a standing army, according to Secretary Alger's proposition, means a tax of about $11 on every family in the United States.

"Ask the hod-carrier who supports his wife and six children on $1.25 a day how he likes that.

"And a total expenditure of $366,000,000 a year for military purposes—army, navy, and pensions—means a tax of $24.40 on every family in the United States.

"Ask the hod-carrier how he likes that."

And the hod-carrier is not the only American who will not like it.
