It is to be noted that not only are our statesmen discussing the merits and demerits of that new issue in American politics, the "expansion" policy, and its consequence, an increased standing army, but that the brain which is behind the hand that rocks the cradle and—we are told—rules the world, is giving considerable thought to the subject also. And it is a question quite within the legitimate sphere of womankind, even though that sphere may be regarded as bounded by the four walls of home. Mrs. Harriet Stanton Blatch, considering the subject of imperialism in a pertinent article entitled, "The Manifest Destiny of Women," published in a New York paper, points out that colonial interests would mean to America, as it means to England, a loss of balance between the sexes at home, and that the resultant economic conditions are such as to draft women into the industrial army to fill the gaps made by a large standing army and a big navy. Women do not weep and wait while men go a-soldiering, but they go forth to fight the battle of life in field and factory. Mrs. Blatch concludes with these words: "Do the women of America wish to outnumber the men of their country; do they wish prostitution to increase; do they wish to be pushed out of their work of home-building into that of field and factory? If not, the time has come, especially for the women of the working classes, to make their voices heard, and tell their men-folk that it is not the nation's destiny to raise the Philipinos and lower their own women to the level of Continental Europe."
