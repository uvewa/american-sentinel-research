Notwithstanding that the United States Government adopted into its Constitution the principles of religious and civil liberty, as taught by Christ, with the intention of assuring to all under its jurisdiction these God-given rights, this feature being set forth in the two lamb-like horns of the beast of Rev. 13:11, the sure word of prophecy shows that its acts are to belie its profession, for when it speaks it is as a dragon. In other words, instead of leaving religious matters to the individual conscience, where they belong, and as provided for in the Constitution, it is to enter upon a course which will finally invade these rights of conscience, and will enforce upon all religious worship.

Let it ever be remembered that the principles of religious and civil liberty were incorporated into the Constitution for the express purpose of keeping out of governmental affairs Romanism or anything like it, that the "Spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom and purity and power."

In invading the rights of conscience and enforcing religion it could not, in the very nature of things, be anything else than that Romanism would be recognized in a governmental way, even though it might not be under that particular name. Thus in the prophecy it says: "And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast [papacy] whose deadly wound was healed." Verse 12.

How this is to be accomplished is shown in verse 14 which says that he (the two horned beast) says "to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live."

An image is a likeness or representation of anything. From this it will be seen there is to be made in this country that which will be a living—a speaking—likeness of the papacy. This work cannot be the work of the papacy itself, for it itself, in the symbol, is "the beast." The conclusion therefore is inevitable that the image is a work to be accomplished through Protestantism.

When this is accomplished, then will be enforced the worship of the beast and his image. How many will worship the beast? "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world!" Rev. 13:8.

Just here it must not be overlooked that with the worship of the beast is associated the dragon power of verses 2, 4.

There can be no worship without service (Matt. 4:10), and no service without obedience. Rom. 6:16.

Now we inquire, What act of service will be demanded in this country that will constitute the worship of the beast and his image? Here it is: "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads." Rev. 13:16. This mark is the mark of the beast. Rev. 19:20.

Against the worship of the beast and his image, and the reception of this mark, God gives a solemn warning. Rev. 14:9-11. It is therefore of the utmost importance that we know what the mark of the beast (papacy) is.

In seeking to find out what this mark is we shall be helped greatly if we bear in mind that there is a trinity to be worshiped; viz., the dragon, the beast, and the image of the beast. This will be seen by comparing verses 2, 4, 8, 15, 16. These three symbols represent respectively, paganism, Catholicism, and apostate Protestantism. Then it follows that the mark, whatever it is, must be something that is taught by Protestants, claimed by Catholics, and derived from paganism. Furthermore, as the two-horned beast (the United States) is to enforce the worship of the beast and his image, by compelling the reception of the mark, and as the act of worship is a religious act, it follows that the mark when sought to be enforced must be set forth plainly as such. In other words, there will be in this country a religious institution sought to be enforced which will plainly be called, by those seeking to enforce it, a mark. Now we ask, Is there a work going on in this country that has for its object the enforcing of a certain religious institution which is plainly called a mark—an institution taught by Protestantism, claimed by Catholicism and derived from paganism? We answer there is—just one, and only one, and that one is Sunday. And this institution is positively the only one that will fill all the specifications of the prophecy.

Let us see. (1) It is taught by Protestants, and by them regarded as a necessary part of Christianity. So much is this so that they say that Sunday is "set apart for divine worship and preparation for another life. It is the test of all religion." So that it is further claimed that "he who does not keep the Sabbath (Sunday) does not worship God; and he who does not worship God is lost." And in being set forth thus it is called "the mark of American religion," the "mark of the nation whose God is Jehovah," a "sign between God and man," etc., etc. (2) It is claimed by Catholicism. Let the reader consult any Catholic catechism and he will find that the Catholic Church acknowledges having been the power that attempted the change of the Sabbath, substituting Sunday in its place. And (3) it is derived from paganism. This can easily be seen from its name Sunday, or day of the sun. It is recognized as the "wild solar holiday of all pagan times," and was devoted to the worship of the sun, which is "the oldest, the most widespread, and the most enduring of all forms of idolatry known to man."

These are facts that can be easily proven, and concerning which there is complete unanimity on the part of scholars; and so generally known that extended proof here would be wholly superfluous.
