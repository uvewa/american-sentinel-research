The New York Journal makes note of the prayer of Chaplain Milburn at the opening of Congress, in which he invoked the divine favor upon Spain, and says:—

"There is no occasion to criticise Chaplain Milburn for remembering the Queen Regent of Spain, the boy king, and the Spanish people in his prayer in the Senate. After returning thanks for our victories and commending the President of the United States to the Divine favor, the chaplain said:—

"We pray that thy blessing may be with the Queen Regent of Spain and her young son, and upon her nation. May Thy heavenly grace come to succor and uplift and uphold the stricken people."

"We do not know how the Spaniards will enjoy the idea of being prayed for by the people that have just knocked their teeth down their throats; but certainly no American need object to the blind chaplain's kindly attention."

Knocking a man's teeth down his throat is certainly a curious prelude to a prayer in his behalf.
