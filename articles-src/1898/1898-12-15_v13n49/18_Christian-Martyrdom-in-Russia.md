A book, bearing the above title, has come to the editor's table. It gives an account of a people in Russia, numbering over 20,000, and known by the name of Doukhobórtk si, or spirit-wrestlers. Bitter persecution has fallen upon them of late, owing to the fact that they refuse to serve as soldiers in the Russian army. They appear to be a simple-minded people who regard the human family in the light of a brotherhood. They are sober and industrious, and take no part in the amusements of worldly people. They use no flesh as food, drink no wine, and refrain from all that leads to a dissipated life. They worship no images, pay all state taxes, but refuse to obey when called to take up arms. Because of this, many of them have been imprisoned, and the treatment they have received from Russian officials, if the statements are true, is horrifying and inhuman. Their condition at present is most distressing, and they are seeking opportunity to emigrate to some other country. The following extract from the book, page 43, will illustrate their position before the law:—

"What are you?"

"We are Christians."

"What sort of Christians?"

"Do you not know what Christians are? A Christian is one who believes in Christ Jesus and fulfills the commandments of God."

"Whose subjects are you, the Turkish Sultan's or the Emperor of Russia's?"

"As a matter of form we pay tribute to the Czar of Russia, but we are the subjects of Jesus Christ."

"And on whose land do you live?"

"We live on God's earth."

"And whom do you obey?"

"We obey Him on whose land we live."

"As you live on God's earth and obey him, I suppose you do not acknowledge the emperor?"

"We do not take the emperor's title from him; as he has been emperor in the past, so let him be in the future. But God created the earth and all that live on the earth."

"Then as you do not refuse to recognize the emperor, why do you renounce your duties as soldiers?"

"It is not in our power to serve as soldiers, because we are Christians, and a Christian ought not to do violence to his enemies, but to give full liberty to every living being, and not to kill his brother."

"Where did you get this from? Did some one teach you so?"

"We got it from the commandments of God; for the sixth commandment says, 'Thou shalt not kill.' As Christians are not allowed under any circumstances to kill a man, we consider it wicked. To us all men are brothers."
