The Minneapolis (Minn.) Times, discussing the question of patriotism in the public schools, says that "every child should be taught that the chief mission of the public schools is to educate American citizens to an intelligent discharge of their grave and responsible duties, and adds:—

"But if the public schools are to do this—and we see there is no other reason for their existence—they must do more than raise flags. They must make the duties of citizenship the chief feature of their curriculum for all pupils who have advanced beyond the acquirement of the merest rudiments of an English education. The children should not only be taught something of our history but a good deal about our system of government. They should be taught the distinction between federal and state governments, where the power of the one ends and the other begins; they should be given an intelligent notion of municipal government, including the township, county, and city, and they should be given practical lessons in depositing the ballot, so that when at the age of twenty-one they graduate into citizenship they may be able to at least deposit their own ballots without requiring the assistance of a ward heeler."

But why not go back to the beginning and teach the children something about the foundation principles of free government? Why not teach them that they—and all others—possess certain unalienable rights; that to preserve these is the only proper purpose of government; and that respect for the rights of those around them constitutes the best evidence of their fitness to be entrusted with the duties of citizenship.

There are "educated" men in all parties,—men who understand "the distinction between federal and state governments," and know all about municipal government and how to deposit their ballots without assistance; but bad government prevails in spite of it all. In all parties the educated man and the ignorant man vote the same ticket; in each one intelligence and ignorance go side by side, and often hand in hand. The state political boss is always a man of education and "intelligence." But he is not a man who has respect for the principles of free government. In his practice he repudiates the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

The intelligence that counts for good government is that which comprehends the proper purpose of civil government and prizes civil and religious freedom; and that not only for one's self, but for all others. But such an education is beyond the power of mere secular teaching to supply. It demands that love of right and justice which can be supplied only from above.

The principles of free government are gospel principles; and only through the gospel is the ideal of such government to be attained.
