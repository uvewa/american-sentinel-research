It is reported that Japan has made a bid of $200,000,000 for the possession of the Philippine Islands. The paper which publishes this statement says:

"It is known that an influential senator recently had a long talk with the President, at which the disposition of the Philippines was the main topic of conversation. The argument of the senator was that while he was opposed to the holding of the Philippines, he had now become convinced that it would be necessary to hold the island of Luzon.

He told the President that it would be to the advantage of the Government to dispose of all of the group except Luzon, and that it would be the better plan to have several purchasers for the group. In other words, he would avoid all possible complications by letting Germany, England, France, Japan, and Russia into the gigantic auction sale."

And the same paper adds: "The positive statement is made that the President signified his assent to this elaborate scheme."

It appears from this that the Government is not only willing to buy the eight millions of Filipinos from Spain, but also to sell the greater part of them to the highest bidder, be that bidder a heathen nation like Japan, or a despotism as utterly opposed to free government as is Russia.

It is to be hoped that the United States will not make itself a party to what would be the most gigantic slave deal on record.
