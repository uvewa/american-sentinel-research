"Well, Julia, are you prepared this afternoon to tell us something concerning the last hours of Louis XIV.," asked Professor Carman.

"I have learned a few things, professor—only a few," replied Julia, as she rose and stepped to the desk beside her teacher, and began:—

"King Louis XIV. reigned much longer than any of the kings of France. His reign began in 1643, and he died in 1715; as he was four years old when he took the throne, this would bring him to the good old age of seventy-six years. But he had to die at last, even though he always had so dreaded death that he would not even look out of his window to see the church of St. Denis, where he must be buried. He had a very great deal of trouble, poor man, along at last. In the first place his son died,—the only real lawful son he had,—of small-pox; next his grandson's wife died of measles. She was a real sweet, nice lady, and the old king loved her very much, and used to get her to sit on the arm of his large chair and visit with him; so of course he must have felt very bad when she died. The young princess' husband died of grief in a week after her death. Then the eldest son of this 'ill-fated couple,' as Aunt Eunice called them, died too."

"Dear me!" exclaimed Florence Ray. "I don't see as there was any one left at all to take the throne. I hope nobody else died after this."

"But there did," continued Julia, "another grandson died two years after this.

"At last a poor, feeble little chap four years old was the only one left to take the throne. He was the old king's great grandson, and became Louis XV.

"When the old monarch was on his death-bed, he called this little boy to him and gave him some very good advice, which the young king did not live up to at all, though he had it nicely framed. He advised the child king to be more saving than he had been, and more peaceable, too; and then he called him 'darling,' and blessed him before he died.

"Aunt Eunice said it was such a pity that the old king didn't live long enough afterward to illustrate his good advice by his own works. As it was, the French people, generally, were only glad when he died."

"You have done well, Julia. This little king, Louis XV., was taken out of the palace so that the populace could see him. He was then five years old, but the little fellow did not have any near relatives, and so he had to walk out alone—though he was held by two ladies who each took an end of his little sash in their hands, but were not permitted to lead his august kingship! The duke of Orleans acted as regent, and although he was a very bad man he did the kindly act of opening the cachots or miserable places where many innocent people had been kept for years. One man had been confined for thirty five years who was an honest traveler. Very many times it was entirely forgotten why they were imprisoned at first. It was under the rule of this man that the horrible 'Chamber of Justice' was instituted."

"Please tell us about it, professor," said Max Smith.

"If a man was unfortunate enough to be rich, if he didn't belong to the court, he was likely to be brought up before this unjust tribunal, and tortured until he would acknowledge some imaginary crime which he never committed and surrender his money. In fact, some people were so afraid of this Chamber of Justice that the poor fellows killed themselves to avoid it. At last, because the country was so reduced for lack of money, the miserable expediency was adopted of debasing coin; that is, of mixing some other metal with the gold and silver, until it was only really worth four-fifths as much as before. Finally, a man named John Law thought he had a nice scheme for making money. So he coaxed the regent—the duke of Orleans—to agree that France should issue a great lot of paper money, in hopes that they could send expeditions over here to America and bring back ship loads of gold and silver, which, it was said, were to be found on the shores of the Mississippi."

"Well, I guess they felt pretty bad when they failed to find it," smiled practical Jack.

"The poor fellows who had gone into the hair-brained enterprise lost all they had and were beggars. But the city of New Orleans was founded at this time, and named after the duke."

"What became of the man Law?" asked Charley.

"He died after a while in beggary, but he honestly thought his scheme was all right, to the very end.

"Finally, when the little king was thirteen, he was given the royal reins to manage, and the bad Duke Orleans died the same year. I suppose Milly will be quite glad to know that young Louis XV. was a very royal looking handsome king, but I dare say she will be sorry to learn that he was utterly selfish and low minded, with no care whatever for his people or their comfort. Nor did he love to study at all. Of course he had his teachers, but as he did not try to learn his lessons, they had much trouble with him."

"I don't see what they could do; of course they did not dare to whip the king," smiled Jack.

"No, Jack, that would never do; but they were determined to punish somebody, so his teacher actually hired a poor boy to stand and be whipped whenever the king deserved it himself—certainly a very ingenious devise.

"At last, when the young king was not much more than sixteen, the duke of Bourbon arranged for him to get married. But when the young princess Maria who was living in Germany at that time came to Paris, the home of her royal spouse, the roads were in such a fearful condition,—partly caused by the severe rains which fell in France that summer,—that she was nearly drowned and had to be rescued many times from her carriage by her attendants."

"It doesn't seem possible, hardly!" exclaimed Rob Billings, "the roads were in a very good state when we were there."

"O yes, Robert; but this was a century and a half ago.

"Finally, Cardinal Fleury was raised to the head of the affairs of state, and although he was seventy-three years of age at the time, he succeeded in bettering the condition of the country to quite an extent.

"Next week we will learn how he accomplished this."
