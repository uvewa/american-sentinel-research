This conference was held at St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 9, 10, 1898. Although it was the fifth conference of the purity department of the W. C. T. U., it was the first National Purity Conference. There were two hundred and fifty delegates from all parts of the United States. Of these a daily paper said: "They are women who have truly the courage of their convictions. For they have been called upon to demonstrate that a certain sort of ignorance is an unblissful illusion, that to ignore vice is far from destroying it. To these women also is given the evangelistic task of imitating practically the charity of Christ under conditions where most religious women take pharisaic pride, setting an example to their Saviour."

The presiding officer was a maid of twenty years, Miss Rose Wood-Allen, supported by Mrs. S. M. I. Henry, national evangelist of the purity department. That the presiding officer was a girl, and that the most powerful appeal in behalf of purity in the marriage relations came from the lips of a girl, was, to say the least, an impressive propriety.

Miss Allen, with persuasive simplicity, urged that young women should band together to maintain the single moral standard for both sexes; and that they should receive instructions as to the reason, that it was a necessity in the interests of posterity. She urged that the standard of purity should be so high in the young women themselves that they should, and very properly too, refuse the attentions of any man who used intoxicating drinks and tobacco.

Mrs. Upham pleaded for the coöperation of parents and teachers for purity education in the public schools, asserting that "If the angel Gabriel were a superintendent of schools, and his corps of teachers were the angels nearest the throne of God, they could not counteract the immorality that prevails in the public schools unless they secured the coöperation of parents." Mrs. Isabel Wing-Lake urged as a remedial agent the Bible in the public schools.

A prominent figure in the convention, and one that added much to the interest of the occasion, was the presence of "Mother" Prindle, as she is called by the many unfortunate girls who were described in her paper as "poor, stray children, unpitied, unloved, unmothered." "I shall never forget," said Mother Prindle, "the simple, honest confession of a Swiss girl on Bleecker street, New York. 'I only do wrong when I am very hungry.' But how can the street girl best be reached? Surrounded by a group of these children of misfortune last week, I said: 'My dear girls, tell me the best method of reaching the heart of the street girl, drunk or sober. With one accord some dozen of voices responded, 'Speak kind words to her, mother, speak kind words to her.'"

Mrs. Prindle has given twenty years of her life to rescue work in London, New York and elsewhere, with success. She has recently resuscitated a languishing rescue home in Minneapolis, Minn. In explaining why she was a rescue worker she said that her Master was such; and that he had rescued her from the depths of hell just as verily as though she had been a drunken or an immoral woman.

Mrs. Isabel Wing-Lake gave an interesting outline of her work during the past ten months, during which time she had traveled 15,000 miles, had spoken in one hundred and ninety-eight cities and nineteen states. She claimed that present existing moral conditions are an evidence that men are blind; that they are unable to see God's thought for the birth of children; nor what the world, the flesh, and the devil are doing to destroy children; that men do not see the suffering that is about them, nor what might be done to alter present conditions. And, more than all this, men do not see God's offer of power and his willingness to supply funds in this service when his conditions are met. As means by which reforms could be brought about, she mentioned the scattering of literature among the suffering classes, by visiting the poor in their homes and doing their work while they are at purity conferences, by befriending factory girls and instructing them in regard to proper dressing, food, and hygiene in general; by visiting city officials and praying in their offices; by organizing rescue homes and "life-saving" stations. She said that small efforts were sometimes greatly blessed for good. Some Christian women sang in one town beneath the window of a sinning sister, and that single song saved her. A call of fifteen minutes at another place by some ladies had resulted in closing the place and releasing and reclaiming to virtue four inmates.

Miss Bell Mix repeated her address on "Purity's Greatest Foe," at one of the churches during the W. C. T. U. convention. There were three addresses upon this occasion, Elder A. T. Jones, of Battle Creek, Mich., giving one of them, speaking from the standpoint of the man. He repudiated the common idea that the woman was the greater sinner, and that she was the leader in sin. He declared that man could, if only he would, restrain his vile passions; and that if he would do so, the results would be immediate in the complete transformation of society; that before midnight there would be no more rescue work to be done for all would be rescued. He supported Miss Mix in her declaration that the procreative powers should only be brought into exercise when there was a desire for children; that this and this alone was the purpose of our Creator.

But time will not permit to tell of all the good things that were said at this conference. It was a notable meeting, and its influence will be far-reaching. Personally, I will say that in the line for which the conference was held, it was the most remarkable meeting in my experience. May the blessing of God go with these earnest workers.
