The Cuban general, Calixto Garcia, in speaking of expected reforms in Cuba, in a recent interview, said:—

"Another source of revenue from which we hope to get funds for schools will follow the readjustment of the church lands and properties. We are not going to wage a war against religion or the church; in fact, I am not sure that the church will be disestablished in Cuba, but we are determined that the church shall not collect such a vast amount annually as it does now and become thereby an incubus on the people. In Havana, for example, there are not only a great many more churches than the population would warrant, but altogether too much land and property around them goes to swell the revenues of the bishop. We shall also completely do away with the 'capellanias,' a complicated and burdensome system of mortgages, interest upon which is collected by the church from all families whose sons are educated for the priesthood."

And yet with all this wealth, according to this statement of General Garcia, who is certainly good authority on the subject, it has been represented to the Government of the United States, by the papal prelates whom the Government has consulted, that the Catholic Church in Cuba is so poor that it will have to be supported by the United States in order to be kept alive and in condition to confer its benefits (?) upon the Cuban people.

And the worst of it is that the President has fallen into the trap and agreed that this monstrous proposition shall be carried into effect, and the Catholic Church in Cuba be duly supported with money taken from the pockets of the American people!
