The City of Rosario, Provincia Santa Fé, Argentine Republic, was visited on the 9th of this month (October) by the Roman Catholic bishop, Dr. Bones. The streets were splendidly adorned in honor of his visit, and bands of music were waiting his arrival at the station. Among the many written mottoes, and inscriptions stretched from one side of the street to the other, was one which said, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord." Thus we see the propensity of the human heart is to exalt man, even unto the place which should be occupied by the Saviour of mankind only.

Upon the 21st of August last, the first Evangelical meeting was held in Puerto Rico. Many attempts had previously been made to establish Protestant worship there; but up till now these had never met with success. We believe the day is dawning for Puerto Rico, and that soon the gospel rays of truth will illuminate many precious souls there, who are now in error's night.

About fifteen years ago, when General Roca occupied the presidential chair in Buenos Aires, he was compelled by force of circumstances to return to the papal nuncio, Bishop Mattera, his credentials and passports. The latter had made himself obnoxious to the country by continually throwing impediments in the way of every reform that was introduced; and by threatenings of ex-communication, sought to intimidate the members of congress and prevent the enactment of liberal laws in opposition to the will of the Catholic Church. Since that time General Roca has been looked upon as a very disobedient child, by the pope of Rome, and by some it is said he has been cursed in Rome by the bell, book, and candle. However, for the space of fourteen or fifteen years, no papal nuncio has taken up residence here to represent the pope before this government. Nevertheless it is now well known that much communication is taking place between the Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vatican, with the object of again establishing diplomatic relations with the pope.

Recently the Church of England Missionary Society has sent a medical missionary, with several medical students, in their third and fourth year, and three evangelists, to evangelize the Gran Chaco. So far their efforts have been crowned with success, since they have gained access to several semi-Indian tribes. In this way the Bible is finding its way even to the uttermost parts of the earth; preparing the heathen for the reception of the message of truth which is also agitating the so-called "Christian nations."

During the past month here, in the different provinces, complaints have been made against the brutality of the so-called "Sisters of Charity," who hold the office of nurses in the government hospital. Clear evidence has been produced to prove that persons of Protestant profession entering aforesaid hospitals receive neither care nor attention upon their refusing to confess to a priest of the Catholic Church. The Rev. Mr. Tallon, presiding elder of the Methodist Church in Santa Fé, after having investigated some cases, denounces in strong terms the cruelty practiced by these "charitable sisters" to those of a contrary faith. Oh, how contrary to the action of the Master they profess to serve! Could they imagine Jesus doing such cruel things to convert a man from the error of his ways? God is a God of love, and not of coercion or force; and they who follow him must use the methods he would employ, and them only.

Never before during the whole history of the Argentine Republic was there so much talk as now of introducing laws for the stricter observance of Sunday. When a lottery is drawn on Sunday, the Protestant paper immediately cries out against "Sabbath desecration." When the city authorities adorn the streets on Sunday to receive a bishop, again wails and cries ascend to the heavens against the imagined transgression of the fourth commandment. All the Protestant pastors are seeking union with the church of Rome, to compel all to keep Sunday in a religious manner.

Suppose those our friends were in Arabia or Turkey, where the vast majority keep Friday as a holy day, would they be content if the Mohammedans there introduced laws to enforce all to conform to their opinion, by keeping Friday as a holy day? Let them then follow the Golden Rule, by doing unto others as they would like others to do unto them. Let them produce their arguments, their reasons for Sunday keeping, and if they bear the divine credentials, they can never be withstood. But the very fact of their seeking to coerce others, and force their views upon them, goes to prove that they are opposing truth, and hence are ignorant of the method by which truth can be best advanced.

Now is the time when a stand must be made to hold aloft truth's standard. Now if ever is the time to disseminate the glorious principles of religious liberty, and bring them before the people in all their beauty; losing the present opportunity, such an occasion may never again present itself to us. Let us be up and doing.

Argentine Republic.
