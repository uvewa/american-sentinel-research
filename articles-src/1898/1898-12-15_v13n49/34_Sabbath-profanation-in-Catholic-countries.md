"In countries where the Sabbath is most profaned, like Spain, France, Italy, and Bavaria," said a clergyman, recently, in a discourse on patriotism, "society is grossly immoral." But all these countries are Roman Catholic countries, in all which countries there has long been a union between religion and the state. All these countries have maintained religion by state laws, and yet they are the countries in which "the Sabbath is most profaned;" and so, to guard against profanation of the "Sabbath" in America, it is said that Sabbath observance must be enforced by state law! State support of religion is the very essence of the papal system; and this system will not bear different fruit now as regards Sabbath observance than it has always borne in the past.
