Now that the Government has acquired possession of the Philippines, the next question will be that of safely holding them against the grasp of the land-hungry nations of Europe. To do this will require a tremendous increase in the military forces of the nation. A large standing army and a formidable navy—formidable from the standpoint of a great military power, is the price of the possession of colonies. And this means a tremendous impetus to the development of militarism in this country. Already Secretary of the Navy Long has asked for fifteen new warships, to cost from $35,000,000 to $40,000,000, mainly for the protection of the new American possessions in the Eastern Hemisphere.
