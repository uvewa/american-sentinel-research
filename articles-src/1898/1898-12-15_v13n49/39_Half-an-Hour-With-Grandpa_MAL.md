"Well, boys, now for our evening story," said grandpa, as books were laid aside and the time for retiring was fast approaching. This was their grandfather's usual treat if the boys would have their lessons learned early enough to admit of half an hour spent thus pleasantly. Harry and Fred were eager to hear what grandpa had for them, for they always enjoyed his quaint stories and the pleasing manner in which he told them. He had on this occasion a small box on his knee, which the boys were very anxious to look into, but this treat was forbidden for the present.

"Well," said grandpa, "a long while ago there was a great king who ruled what was known as the Babylonian Empire, which really embraced the whole known world at that time. This king had a very long name—N e b-u-c-h-a-d-n-e-z-z-a-r."

"Well, I should say so," said Harry. "That is worse than Methuselah."

"This king made a huge golden image, about 110 feet high, and set it up in the plain which lies between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where it might easily be approached from every direction."

"What did he make the image for?" said Fred.

"This famous king was a worshiper of idols, and he made this great image of gold as an object of worship. He sent all over his kingdom to gather together the great men of his realm, governors, captains, judges, rulers of provinces, etc., and proclaimed that the dedication of the great image should be held upon a certain day. When the time arrived a great crowd of people assembled in response to the king's request, and we can well imagine there was great excitement and a general big time."

"What did they do at such a dedication as that, grandpa?"

"Well, I was just going to tell you that the program included a great deal of instrumental music upon many kinds of instruments,—a great orchestra we would call it. And a decree went forth that when the people should hear the sounds of instrumental music peal forth, they must all fall down and worship the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. It was also proclaimed, 'Whoso falleth not down and worshipeth the golden image, shall the same hour be cast into the burning fiery furnace.'"

"What did they say that for, grandpa?" said Harry. "I should think that would have spoiled all the pleasure of the celebration."

"Well, yes, one would think so; but sometimes the heart is so hard and selfish that it takes delight even in murder, as was the case in this instance."

"Why, was any one really killed, grandpa?" said Fred.

"There were only three in all that vast throng who refused to obey the command of the king. These worshipped the true God, and knew it would be wicked for them to pay any homage to idols; and God miraculously delivered them."

"What good did the king hope to accomplish by trying to compel people to worship the golden image when they did not believe in idolatry of any sort?"

"Well, Harry, it is the same principle as is seen in all our religious laws of the present day. Many people believe that everybody should be compelled to keep Sunday, whether they think so or not."

"The true God does not compel any one to worship him, does he, grandpa?"

"No, Harry, simply because forced service is worse than no service at all, in that it makes of one a hypocrite."

Here grandpa removed the lid from the box on his knee, and holding up to view some ripe fruit, he said, "What is that, Fred?"

"A bunch of grapes," said both boys in a breath.

"How funny they look," said Harry.

"Why," said Fred, "they are growing on the limb of a thornbush."

"O-ho," said Harry, "they are tied on!"

"Yes," said grandpa; "that is just the point—they are tied on. That aptly represents the evil results of all decrees compelling religious observance of any kind. If one is religious merely in outward acts, while true heart service is wanting, he is simply tying the fruit on,—pretending to be what he is not. And if one observes a command which in his heart he knows is not right, he is doing great injustice to his loving Father in heaven.

"I'd never want any religious fruit tied onto me," said Fred.

"Nor I," said Harry.

"No," said grandpa. "Nobody ever ought to display religious fruit in that manner. But there goes nine o'clock; so good night and pleasant dreams. Perhaps I may have another story for you the next time you get your lessons so promptly."

Mrs. M. A. Loper.
