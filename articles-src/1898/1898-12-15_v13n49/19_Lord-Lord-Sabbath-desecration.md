"Lord, Lord," exclaimed the moral-reform-by law advocate as he stood before the closed door of the Master's wedding feast, "I have not only kept Sunday myself, but I have made other people keep it too!" But his Lord replied, "I never knew you, your Sabbath, nor your gospel of force. Depart from me."
