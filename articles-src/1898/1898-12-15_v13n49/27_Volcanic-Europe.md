One cannon shot, fired in hostility, would almost certainly set Europe in a blaze of war.

Of the powers among which the continent is divided, most of those of importance are close to the verge of a conflict over some internal, continental, colonial, or foreign question. The others have either just been beaten at war, are too poor to afford a quarrel of greater proportions than civil riot, or else are either so small as to be beneath notice, or so closely allied to one of the great nations as to have their quarrels swallowed up in those of their allies or masters.

In France is the most serious aspect. That uncertain republic is beset by anarchistic mobs, endangered by a corrupt and scheming army, threatened by plotting royalists who hope to regain supremacy, browbeaten by England, and overawed by Germany.

England has no serious internal or colonial difficulties, but she is not many steps from trouble with France over Fashodia, or with Russia over the multifarious Chinese question.

Germany, aside from her old quarrel with France, has further reason for keeping her fleet in sailing shape and her army in marching order in the new troubles that beset France, and which threaten in several ways to draw the kaiser into the quarrel.

Russia's ruler, although he has formally invited all the other nations to join him in a peace conference, has not ceased to equip his armies and to improve his fleets, while he yields no jot of anything he has, nor to any of the claims made by England. He has also, according to late advices, found cause for anger in the friendly attitude of Germany towards England. He evidently resents any action along the lines of his peace proposition which does not include Russia as a beneficiary.

Italy would probably be on the verge of war with some nation larger than little Colombia, were it not that her poverty is too great. As it is, she must content herself with an occasional riot, of little present magnitude, but important as an indication of existing civil conditions.

Spain is more interested in efforts to escape from some of the results of her last disastrous adventure in war than in seeking fresh troubles abroad; but her Carlists and other insurrectionists are threatening revolution which may not only overthrow that government, but drag into the conflict half a dozen other powers.

In addition to these national troubles, the huge international pest of anarchism threatens to take advantage of the prevailing unsettled conditions to actively develop itself. Every monarch or president in Europe fears more than ever for his personal safety; every one finds hope or fear in frequent speculation as to the developments that would follow the assassination or overthrow of a brother ruler, the possibilities of disruption or reorganization of the fallen ruler's nation, and the advantages or disadvantages that might result to himself thereby. And it is safe to say that a large part of the constant military vigilance of European nations is for the purpose of developing or resisting any favorable or unfavorable conditions which might arise as the result of anarchy.

Nearly all of the European nations have consented to send representatives to the disarmament congress proposed by the czar; but it is nevertheless probable that there will not be even a temporary suspension in the work of enlarging and equipping the armies and in increasing and strengthening the navies. The indications are stronger than ever that the great European war that has so long been prophesied, may yet thunder a terrible farewell to the old century and greet the new one with a crimson baptism.
