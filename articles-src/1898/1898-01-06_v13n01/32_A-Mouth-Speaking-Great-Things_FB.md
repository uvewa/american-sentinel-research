"How far had we studied in the prophecy about the horns, Charlie?" asked Mrs. Ross.

"O, away down to the rise of the horn with eyes like a man, and a mouth speaking great things."

"When was this horn established?"

"In 538 A. D., when Justinian's decree, which made the bishop of the church of Rome the head of all the churches, was carried into effect by subduing three kings, and by crowning the pope with the tiara. But, mama, what does it mean that the horns had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things?"

"Eyes like the eyes of a man," would indicate the far-reaching policy of the papal system. Just think, Charlie, of the organization of the church under the pope. It is a vast secret order. Through the confessional the priests obtain a controlling influence over the people who are taught to look to them for the absolution of their sins, and you know, dear, that when we give our very heart's thoughts to any one, we bind ourselves to that one by the strongest of ties. This is the reason that God invites us to make him our confidant."

"But, mama, doesn't the Bible tell us to confess our faults one to another?"

"Yes; in whatever we have injured another. But David says, 'Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.' We can forgive faults; but sin is an assault upon God, and he alone can forgive sin. But the point of our talk, Charlie, is that through the confessional the people give themselves through the priests to the pope, and keep him posted as to the movements of men, and again the pope gives to the people his commands, so that the church becomes a vast organization to carry out the will of one man. No wonder the pope has been the arbiter of nations and has brought kings to his feet. The history of ages proves that the papal system is controlled by a very far-reaching wisdom, and evidences of craft are abundant and startling.

"Of course, you know, Charlie, that I am only mentioning this to show you that there is a higher wisdom than the far-reaching wisdom of the papacy, which has foreknown and foretold the movements of men and nations. It is not that I feel any bitterness toward the Catholics. In fact, I am sure that many of them are living up to the light they have better than I have lived up to the light God has given me, and are therefore more acceptable in his sight. But it is the system we are speaking of, and not the individuals that are involved in it. Behind the system is the wisdom of that old serpent, whose power to deceive dragged down principalities and powers from heaven. Lucifer declaring, 'I will be like the Most High,' is heard speaking through the mouth of this papal horn."

"O yes, mama, he had a mouth speaking great things. Now tell me what fulfils that point?"

"You may read the first part of the 25th verse of Daniel 7."

"And he shall speak great words against the Most High," read Charlie.

"Now you may turn to 2 Thess. 2:3, 4. What did Paul say must arise before the day of Christ's second coming?"

Charlie read: "Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God, sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."

"Now, Charlie, what is counted the greatest treason in earthly governments?"

"Why—why—let me see. In my old Reader there is a speech from Henry Clay, or some other orator, where he says, 'Charles I had his Cromwell and George III,'—and then some one called out 'Treason.' It was at the first agitation over the question of setting America free from England's rule. Of course, Cromwell was against the king, and took his throne."

"That's it, Charlie, and George III found a parallel experience in America's setting up a new ruler and deposing him. Now the apostle describes a power who will show himself in the temple of God, to take the place of God. Over the door of the Vatican at Rome is written an inscription in Latin which, translated into English, is 'Pope Pius IX, the best, the highest, and God on earth.' The title on the crown is 'Vicarius filii Dei,' or vicegerent of the Son of God. 'Lord God the pope' is another well known title. The claim to infallibility, that is, that the pope cannot err when speaking in an official way, puts him on a level with God. But where does this exaltation of the pope come from?"

"From self," said Charlie. "He opposeth and exalteth himself."

"Jesus says, 'He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.' And again, 'Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, and in due time he shall lift you up.' You have given a very good answer, Charlie. Now tell me if you can see any personal reason as to why God has pointed out the pope as one who opposeth and exalteth himself."

"Why, I don't know, mama."

"It seems to me that the pope simply stands as an example of the outworking of self. Charlie, what is the temple of God? Please read 1 Cor. 6:19."

Charlie read: "'What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?' Why, mama, each one of us is God's temple."

"Yes. Now when the pope through his decretals sets aside the rule of Christ, does away with his precepts, he commands the obedience of the people, steps into their souls, usurps the throne of God in the heart, and sits as God in the temple of God."

"O, mama, what a dreadful thing!"

"Yes, Charlie, it is dreadful; but wait, dear, we have each one been guilty of the same thing. Have we set aside Christ's precepts? Have we let self rule in our own hearts? Have we exalted self above God, and let self sit in the temple of God showing himself to be our God?"

"O mama," said Charlie, "I didn't know I had made a pope of myself before. What shall I do?"

"Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God. Give self up to Christ, and let him subdue the usurper and cast him out. Yield your will up to him who bids you to learn of him meekness and lowliness of heart."

"I see so many dreadful things in my life, mama. I am just full of the papacy. I've been trying to be at the head of everything in school, and, O mama, I never saw how sinful I was before. Why, I have had the mouth speaking great things. O mama, it's just as natural as can be to be a pope."

"So it is, Charlie. 'Catholicism is the religion of human nature,' some one has said. But now, dear, let us not take the next step into its mystery, and do penance and go into purgatory. Rather let us kneel down, confess our sins to the Lamb of God, who taketh away all guilt, who will impart to us his spotless righteousness, and reveal himself through us day by day as we trust in him."

Mrs. Ross and Charlie knelt to pray, and though tears were on their cheeks, a happy light filled their eyes as they arose. Mrs. Ross went to the piano, and they both joined in singing—

"Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee."

F. B.
