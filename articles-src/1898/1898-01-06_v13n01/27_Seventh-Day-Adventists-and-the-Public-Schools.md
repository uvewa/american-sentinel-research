[The following, setting forth the views of the Seventh-day Adventist Church of Boulder, Col., on the subject of saluting the flag in the public schools, has been sent us with the request that it be given space in the columns of the SENTINEL. As much criticism has been heaped upon the Adventists, because of their stand in this matter, it seems entirely proper that this request should be favorably received.]

During the last few weeks, as is well known to the people of Boulder, there has been much agitation and discussion, both in a public and a private way, of the relations the Seventh-day Adventist church of this city sustains to the Boulder public schools. Nor has the discussion of this matter been confined alone to our own city, but has extended to Denver and neighboring towns, and even gone outside the State. In many instances the erratic utterances and statements of irresponsible parties, and of those outside the Seventh-day Adventist Church, have been accredited to this organization. In view of this it seems but reasonable that the Seventh-day Adventist church of Boulder should state to their neighbors and fellow citizens their true position on the school question.

In the first place, Seventh-day Adventists are in no sense opposed to our system of free public schools, nor are they in any measure whatsoever opposed to the government under which we enjoy our present freedom. Among all the nations of antiquity, and of medieval and modern times, has there arisen no government of man so noble in its purposes, and so true to the principles that should underlie just and wise government. It is in this country, as expressed by Dr. Josiah Strong, that the two great ideas of which the Anglo-Saxon is the exponent—civil and religious liberty—have had their fullest development. For these noble principles, our forefathers gave their fortunes, their honor, and their lives. Hence, for the American flag, as representing these great basal principles, which lie at the foundation of our national existence, every loyal heart must hold the highest respect. And of these high and exalted principles, for the defense of which our nation was established, the system of our free public schools was designed to be the great conservator. Ignorance and free government are incompatible. Both cannot exist together on the same soil. Hence, for the maintenance of true principles in the home, the church, or the state, education becomes an essential factor. This education may be imparted in the grades, the high school, and the university; or it may be given in private, church, and denominational schools. Into the hands of a truly educated people may be safely entrusted the important interests involving the integrity of social and political life.

But while the Seventh-day Adventists of Boulder most firmly believe in the principles above stated, they cannot but feel that the requirement of the public schools in Boulder in respect to the so called flag salute is a violation both of the spirit and of the letter of these principles. They believe in God, but they do not believe that the attendance of their children at the public schools should be conditioned upon the open avowal of this belief. It is not the right of any State, of any court, of any school board, to require from any American citizen, or from the child of any American citizen, a recognition of God. Every citizen of Boulder, whether he be Christian, Jew, infidel, or pagan, is entitled to the privileges granted by our system of free public schools, and he is entitled to these privileges without any declaration on his part of his belief or disbelief in any deity. Civil government and the system of education provided by civil government should not, nor can they of right, deal with the religious beliefs, views, or prejudices of the individual members of the commonwealth. In doing this they usurp the prerogatives of Deity, and do that which Christ or his Spirit never attempts. Faith in Christ and sincere adoration of the supreme Being must spring from love and not fear, from volition of the will and not force. And while Seventh-day Adventists hold for the principles represented by the stars and stripes the highest reverence, and for the American flag as representing those principles the deepest regard, while they hold in the highest esteem those who fought and bled and died that to us might fall the heritage of freedom's blessings, they still feel that it is not the province of our public schools to require from the pupils a pledge of their heads and hearts to the maintenance of that flag. This is contrary to the spirit of freedom which the flag represents.

Seventh-day Adventists are uniformly law-abiding citizens. They believe in the support of the government by taxation, and by every laudable means consistent with Christian life; but in principle they are non-combatants. They believe that it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong; better to leave to God the avenging of every just cause than to take vengeance into their own hands. The Christians of Europe, of Asia, of Africa, are as much the children of God and members of the household of faith as are the Christians of America. With their understanding of the requirements of the gospel of Christ, the members of the church could not enter conscientiously upon any warfare, either public or private, in an individual or national sense, to maim, kill, or destroy their fellows.

Hence, the objection of the Seventh-day Adventists to the flag salute should not be construed as antagonism to the flag or to the government the flag represents.

The church wishes to say in conclusion that for the larger portion of the agitation and controversy over this question in Boulder the church or its officers are in no way responsible. Aside from the publication of an article in the Camera, of this city, by the elder of the church, neither the church nor its officers have authorized, nor been parties to, the publication, in any paper whatsoever, of a single word on this question. And the church does not wish to be held responsible for the undignified representation of this question by others, nor as being governed by personal animosity or feeling, nor as desiring to excite public sympathy in behalf of its cause. Principles are above men, and above personalities, and it is for principle only that the Seventh-day Adventist church of Boulder would contend. And the church trusts that this expression of its conscientious convictions on this question, and not the representations of others, may be taken as voicing its true sentiments.

The above paper was adopted as expressing the sentiments of the Seventh-day Adventist church of Boulder at their regular morning service, Saturday, December 18. Of the two hundred present, there were but three opposing votes.
