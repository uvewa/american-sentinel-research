The short-time subscriptions taken last August expire with the present issue. Many of these have already renewed. Those who have not are hereby cordially invited to do so at once, and so receive the paper without interruption.

If it is not convenient to remit for a year, do not hesitate to send in your subscription for a shorter period, say for three or six months. We want you to continue as a member of the SENTINEL family. We shall aim to make the paper, if possible, better the coming year than ever before. In view of the live issues before us, we ask in all earnestness, can you afford to be without the means of keeping in the fullest touch with the developments of the work? We believe the answer will be an emphatic No.
