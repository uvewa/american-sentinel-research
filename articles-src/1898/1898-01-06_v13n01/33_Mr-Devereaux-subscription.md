MR. J. N. DEVEREAUX, of Parker, S. D., a warm and appreciated friend of the SENTINEL, sends us twelve subscriptions to the paper, with this note appended: "I am sorry the list is not a larger one, but it is the best I could do. When I was in the army during the late war, I sometimes would catch a sentinel asleep on guard, but I must say I have never caught the AMERICAN SENTINEL napping. It always gives the alarm in season, but the sad feature of the situation is that the majority will sleep on heedless of the warning till it is too late to do them any good."
