We desire to extend our thanks for the missionary effort that has been put forth during the past month in behalf of the SENTINEL, and the good lists of subscribers that have been sent in. They have been similar in size and number to those sent in under our special offer last August, and accompanying them have been words of the warmest appreciation of the paper, and the deepest interest in the cause it represents.

The effort is not confined to any particular locality, but has been general. A young man, going to school and clerking in a store nights and mornings, sends in a nice list from Oregon; a man in Wyoming forwards us a list of twenty-five, eight of them taking our Premium Bible; another from Florida sends a dozen or more, and a friend of the paper in Iowa forwards us a list of seventeen subscriptions secured in one day. These cases might be multiplied almost indefinitely, but this will suffice.

We assure our friends, one and all, that we appreciate their efforts, for it shows that they are keenly alive to the situation that confronts us.

During the coming year, the SENTINEL will endeavor to keep fully abreast of the battle it is waging, and deliver its notes of warning so clearly, so earnestly, yet with such tenderness and good will toward all that men and women everywhere will be led to see, acknowledge, and accept as truth the principles for which it contends.
