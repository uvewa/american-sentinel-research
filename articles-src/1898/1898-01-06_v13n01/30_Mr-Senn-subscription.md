MR. F. OTTO SENN, of St. Louis, Mo., in remitting for a nice club of subscriptions to the SENTINEL, expresses himself this way: "I am a reader of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, and support it only because I think it patriotic, and because it is the only religious paper I know of which recognizes and advocates the rights of free-thinkers and non-believers. I wish it continued success and prosperity."
