When the government of the United States began, all was done that was possible to make this nation what every nation ought to be.

It recognized the self-evident truth that "all men are created equal; that they are endowed with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."

The noble men who wrote the Declaration of Independence, from which the above is quoted, knew that these rights could not be secure in this country any more than in those which existed before it, unless steps were taken to prevent any church or all churches together having any part in the conduct of its affairs.

They recognized the fact that religion is a matter that pertains to the individual, and that where this is not the case, any profession of that kind on the part of the people comprising the government must be at the best hypocritical, and that it must work injustice to those who may be honest and God-fearing.

Accordingly this principle was incorporated into the Constitution, in the First Amendment, which reads, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

This is the principle of Protestantism. In the Augsburg Confession and at the Diet of Spires, in the sixteenth century, the true relation of the church and the state was clearly set forth.

It must follow, therefore, that any attempt to change this feature of the Constitution, and to use the power of the state for the enforcement of religion of any kind, is a square denial of the Reformation, a declaration that its cause was unrighteous, and ought never to have been. But the Reformation was aimed directly against the papacy. Therefore to say that the Reformation was wrong is to say that popery was right; and, consequently, that as Rome never changes, it must still be right.

It would not of course be a matter of surprise to see Catholics themselves contending for this. They could not do otherwise, and still be Catholics. But that there should be those who are professedly Protestant who stand with Rome upon this ground is not only surprising but alarming.

That this is so, no one who is acquainted with the history of this nation in recent years, can question.

For nearly fifty years there has been a regularly organized association—the National Reform Associati — which has had for its object the changing of the Constitution, demanding that, at least, certain features of the religion of Christ be enforced by human enactments.

It is not to be understood by the above statement that this association openly espouses Romanism, or that they acknowledge that their work is really Romanistic.

But it must be understood that in prosecuting their work they have felt the necessity of, and have been glad to seek, the cooperation of Roman Catholics.

Thus a leading National Reformer—Dr. Scoville—says, "We may be subjected to some rebuffs in our first proffers, and the time has not yet come when the Roman Church will consent to strike hands with other churches—as such; but the time has come to make repeated advances, and gladly to accept cooperation in any form in which they may be willing to exhibit it. It is one of the necessities of the situation."

Any rebuffs to which they might be subjected from the Catholic Church would not be because the Catholic Church is opposed to their work. Far from it. They would be only blinds, as it were, until they felt the time was ripe for an alliance to be affected without danger to themselves. This would be when this reform(?) work should become more widespread, and become more firmly engrafted in the Protestant ranks.

The above, from Dr. Scoville, was uttered in 1881. Eight years from that time—1889—the Catholics felt free to express themselves. At the Congress of Catholic Laymen of the United States, then assembled at Baltimore, they said: "What we should seek is an en rapport with the Protestant Christians who desire to keep Sunday holy. . . . We can bring the Protestant masses over to the moderation of the Catholic Sunday."

On this question of Sunday it was felt, on the part of each, that they could, as Archbishop Ireland, in 1893, expressed it, "stand together in demanding the faithful observance of Sunday."

Now the Catholic Church repudiates, and always has repudiated, the work of the Reformation, denouncing those who uphold it, as heretics, and up to within a few years ago denounced the Constitution of the United States.

Why is it then that Catholics are willing to unite with these Protestants in the way that is proposed? How can Catholics do this without stultifying themselves in their opposition to the Reformation? The answer is easy. It is because these Protestants, in their zeal for Sunday and Sunday laws, have surrendered all that the Reformation stood for.

Catholics know this, but do Protestants?

It must be conceded that a great many, if not all, Protestants, who are thus engaged, are true Christians, men and women who really love the Lord, and who, in this thing, think they are doing God service.

However honest they may be, they are nevertheless, not only striking a blow at the foundation of this nation, but, as before pointed out, are repudiating the Reformation.

With the progress that has been made, by both Protestants and Catholics, how long will it be before the dire work will be completed? Surely not long.

We shall print an extra number of papers of this issue, believing that in many communities where the question of the introduction of the flag salute in the public schools is being agitated, it will be a good missionary document to place in the hands of teachers and school boards.
