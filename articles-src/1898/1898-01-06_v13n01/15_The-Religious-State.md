NOBODY in this country is, professedly, in favor of a union of church and state; but there are a great many people here who say that the state ought to be religious.

But how is the state to be religious without favoring a church? And what attitude will the church maintain toward the state when the latter professes religion?

Will the church stand off and forbid the state to come within her fold? How would it look for the Christian church to forbid a Christian to unite with her?

When therefore the state becomes Christian, how can the Christian church consistently close her doors against the state?
