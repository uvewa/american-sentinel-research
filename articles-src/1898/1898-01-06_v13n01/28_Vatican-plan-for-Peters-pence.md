A PLAN has been devised at the Vatican, it is reported, for remedying the falling off in "Peter's pence," which has of late been causing the papacy some concern. It is that of placing in every Catholic Church throughout the world a statue of St. Peter, together with an alms box, bearing an appropriate inscription. It is characteristic of the papal religion that it appeals to its adherents through the outward senses.
