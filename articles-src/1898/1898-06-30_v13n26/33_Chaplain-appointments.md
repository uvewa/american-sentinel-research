Some idea of the reasons which are usually set forth in an application for appointment to the office of chaplain, may be had from a published letter of application made by a minister of Iowa to Governor Shaw, of that State. A religious journal enumerates the points made in the application:

> "He was a missionary to South America in Panama and Aspinwall, and was chaplain of the Panama Canal Company. He is immune against yellow fever, having been through a siege of it, and is familiar with the diseases and dangers of the climate. He has preached on decks, wharves and streets, in city and country, for twenty years. He is an American and has great hopes for the future of the country. His father raised a company at the outbreak of the war in 1861; his grandfather was in the War of 1812; and his great-grandfather and three brothers were soldiers in the War of the Revolution. The first of the family came over in 1635, landed at Cape Cod, and dwelt in Plymouth. He can read Spanish well and speak it some. He says that if appointed he will wage war against 'Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion,' which he charges have been the curse of all the republics in South and Central America."

We see nothing in this to prove the applicant was spiritually qualified to minister divine grace to the soul; but this is a point about which a civil ruler is not supposed to concern himself, as there is nothing in a civil office which qualifies the holder for discernment in spiritual affairs. In such appointments, the spirituality of the applicant is the least of all matters considered. In the very nature of things, it could not be otherwise.
