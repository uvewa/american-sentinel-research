"Well, Rob, you're in the limboes, as they say, now, I suppose," said his friend, Charlie White, as they walked home from school that afternoon.

"Good enough!" chimed in Edna Phillips, it will be good for you,—strengthen your memory, you know."

"Well, you are about as comforting to a fellow as Job's three friends, I must say!" exclaimed Rob. But I imagine I can find more to say of interest about Jeanne Darc, Charlie, after you and I have been to visit the very places where she lived and moved and had her being;—let's see," mused Rob; "it isn't so very long now. Examination comes,—and I suppose that decides it,—in only three weeks, and if we pass,"—and Rob drew a long breath.

"Yes," echoed Charlie; "if we pass."

The boys had been in the habit of counting the weeks to examination, and at last the days, for a long time. They were to start on the long-anticipated journey in a few weeks afterward.

"Mother," said Rob at the breakfast table next morning, "Professor Carman has appointed me to read something about Jeanne Darc,—it must be original, you know; or I can give a little talk about her, just as I like."

"I am thinking it would be well to talk instead of write; you are quite handy with your pen any way, much more than with your tongue."

Tuesday afternoon came once more, and all too soon for Rob, who thought he had never seen a week pass so fast, for he had been very busy. But although he hardly felt equal to the task before him, he stepped to the desk in response to his teacher's invitation, and began his little story:

"The home of Jeanne Darc at the time when she began to fight for her country, was a little village in the north-eastern part of France called Domrémy.

"This girl pretended to have visions, which fact led her to leave home and go to Orleans as fast as she could, to raise an army to fight the English. She didn't like English people at all, and she didn't want them in her country."

"I wonder if we would confuse Rob if we asked questions once in a while," piped Will Palmeter.

"No, I guess not; if I can't answer them, may be Professor Carman will help me."

"Well," said Will, "I was wondering if this girl had any parents or relatives, and if they were willing for her to go."

"Why, yes; she had folks, and they tried their best to keep her at home, but she was bound to go,—I forgot to speak about that. When she was only a little girl, the English came and drove all the native French people out of the little village where she lived with her parents, and ever since then she had an awful horror of the English. Of course when the people came back there was not anything left to speak of, of their pretty homes, only just ashes."

"I wish Rob would please tell us something about her looks," pleaded Milly Brown.

"Well," said Robert, good-naturedly, "I have read in something, somewhere, that she was 'tall and fine looking.' She wore men's clothes, though, and that would spoil any woman's looks, I think."

"May be that was so she could ride her horse easier," remarked Julia March.

"I think so; but she did not appear to make a very favorable impression on the French general who had command of the French forces at Orleans. When he received word that the Maid, as she was called, was coming, and had promised to 'raise the siege of Orleans, and crown the French king, the Dauphin Charles, he said they would better 'box her ears and send her home.'"

"That was not a very gallant reply for a French general to make," smiled Professor Carman.

"No, not very; I presume the French were not so noted for their polite manners as they are now. The general soon saw the time when he repented his speech, for the brave girl did as she had said. She entered the city in triumph, though it is awfully queer that the English ever let her do it; but they did, and after very much coaxing from the Maid, the indolent Charles at last consented to go to Rheimes, and be crowned king. This city was also in English hands, and here again, strange to say, they opened the gate, and surrendered the keys to Charles.

"After the king was crowned, this simple-hearted girl only asked to go back to her parents, and take care of her sheep. But the king did not let her do this, though I don't think he half appreciated what she had done for him and for France. At last, while in a battle, the Maid and a few soldiers found themselves surrounded by the English, who captured them."

"Where was this battle fought, please?" asked Harry Ray.

"I don't believe I can remember that. Will you please answer, professor?"

"This was the battle of Compiègne," replied the teacher. "Most of the French troops had already entered the city, when 'the drawbridge was raised,' and thus the poor girl was made an easy captive."

"Count John, one of the Burgundians, which party, don't you remember, had joined the English so they might have greater vengeance on the Armagnacs, is the man into whose hands the maid fell. He sold her to the English—the Duke of Bedford, regent of France,—for 10,000 francs, in spite of his wife, who tried her best to prevent it."

"How much would that be in our money?" asked Will Barnaby, pencil and note book in hand.

"I think a single franc is nineteen cents in our money, so you can soon reckon it for yourself.

"The English finally burned the poor maid alive, and a great shame it was, indeed."

"Bravo!" said Professor Carman, as Rob took his seat.

"We will study a little more about this strange maiden on next Tuesday afternoon."
