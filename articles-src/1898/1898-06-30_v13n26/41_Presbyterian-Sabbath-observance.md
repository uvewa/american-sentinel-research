At the late session of the Presbyterian General Assembly the "Committee on Sabbath Observance" presented a report, which was adopted, "declaring the law of the Sabbath to be a perpetual obligation upon all men; calling upon all within the church to use their influence for the biblical observance of the day by abstaining from the purchase and reading of the Sunday newspaper, from all forms of amusement and unnecessary work on the Lord's Day; deprecating the opening of the gates of the Omaha Exposition on Sunday; commending the American Sabbath Union and its allied societies, and recommending that each pastor preach on the subject on some Sabbath in next October. The Board of Publication and Sabbath-School Work was requested to prepare a lesson on Sabbath observance."
