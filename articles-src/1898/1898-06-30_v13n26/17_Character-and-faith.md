THAT which is of most value to any person, is character.

And that which, above all other things, is effectual for the development of a strong, sound character, is faith.

But faith does not call the individual's attention to the multitude of other people around him. It does not call attention to public sentiment nor to popular customs and maxims. By faith, the individual sees none of these.

By faith, the individual beholds Jesus Christ, the author of salvation to all who believe on him. The life of the Christian is lived by "looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of faith." Heb. 1:2:2.

By faith the individual sees "no man, save Jesus only." If he is looking at some other man or set of men, or if he is looking at human customs, opinions, and laws, contemplating the question of how much help he may derive from them in right doing, he is not beholding Jesus at all. He is not walking by faith; he is not forming a character which will be worthy of perpetuation beyond this life.

And when laws are passed to prescribe moral duties to the individual, or those things necessary to the formation of right character, their only effect must be to point him away from Jesus Christ to the multitudes of the world, and to the sentiment of the multitudes, which the law embodies. Such laws can tend only to weaken character, not to strengthen it.

Jesus Christ is the standard of righteousness. He is the divine standard; and any standard set up by human law, whether by people in the church or out of it, can be only a human standard, and altogether below the required excellence.

Laws which are passed with the intent of doing more than to protect the rights of the individual, are worse than useless.
