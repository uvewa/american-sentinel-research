The universal God of Nature—the Saviour of mankind—the Fountain of all light, who came to pluck the world from eternal darkness, expired upon a cross—the scoff of infidel scorn; and his blessed apostles followed him in the train of martyrs. When he came in the flesh he might have come like the Mohametan Prophet, as a powerful sovereign, and propagated his religion with an unconquerable sword, which even now, after the lapse of ages, is but slowly advancing under the influence of reason, over the face of the earth. But such a process would have been inconsistent with his mission, which was to confound the pride, and to establish the universal rights of men. He came, therefore, in that lowly state which is represented in the Gospel, and preached his consolations to the poor.

When the foundation of this religion was discovered to be invulnerable and immortal, we find political power taking the church into partnership; thus began the corruptions both of religious and civil power, and hand in hand together, what havoc have they not made in the world!—ruling by ignorance and the persecution of truth.

Constraint is the natural parent of resistance, and a pregnant proof that reason is not on the side of those who use it. You must all remember Lucian's pleasant story:—Jupiter and a countryman were walking together conversing with great freedom and familiarity upon the subject of heaven and earth. The countryman listened with attention and acquiescence, while Jupiter strove only to convince him; but happening to hint a doubt, Jupiter turned hastily round and threatened him with his thunder. "Ah! Oh!" says the countryman, "now, Jupiter, I know that you are wrong; you are always wrong when you appeal to your thunder."
