No, it is not; and it is gratifying to find those who have such sound ideas on the matter, as is indicated by the following, which we take from the editorial columns of the *American Banner*, of Philadelphia, Pa.:

> "Many people, of all shades of belief, have become very fond of claiming that 'this is a Christian nation.' The thing is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! Only an individual can become a Christian, and a comparatively few Christians in a nation does not make it a Christian nation, any more than a few righteous people in Sodom and Gomorrah made those cities righteous. To claim that this is a Christian nation is tantamount to saying that religion and civil government are already united in this country, for no government becomes 'Christian' without forming a union with the church, the same as the individual does upon joining, to be subject to her laws and doctrines."
