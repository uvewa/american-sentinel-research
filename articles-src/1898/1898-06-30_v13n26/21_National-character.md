No result of the present war could be so disastrous to America as a relapse on our part from this Christian temper of cosmopolitan love, to an insular and barbarous hatred of other nations. Interruption of commerce, loss of property, the sacrifice of some, or even of many, lives, would not be so deplorable; for no one of these, nor all of them combined, could turn back or materially retard that majestic march of civilization in whose van we have been grandly holding our place for more than a century. But if our hearts should be hardened toward men beyond our own borders, if our sympathies should be chilled and our respect turned into suspicion and enmity, we should suffer a loss in our national character that it would require several generations and incalculable efforts to repair. "Confidence is a plant of slow growth," even between individuals; proportionately more so between communities and nations. And impairment of national, like personal character, is inestimably more serious than of national wealth or even of national domain.—*Teunis S. Hamlin, D. D.*
