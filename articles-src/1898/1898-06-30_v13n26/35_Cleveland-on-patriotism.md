Some timely observations upon the duties which a true patriotism imposes upon American citizens in the situation which has arisen from the prospect of territorial extension in foreign lands, were made by ex-President Cleveland in his address to the students of Princeton University, June 21. In part, Mr. Cleveland said:

> "The American people are tempted every day and every hour to abandon their accustomed way and enter upon a course of new and strange adventure. Never before in our history have we been beset with temptations so dangerous as those which now whisper in our ears alluring words of conquest and expansion and point out to us fields bright with the glory of war.

> "Since patriotism underlies good citizenship you should avoid a misconception of the meaning of this word. I believe there is sometimes a tendency to think of patriotism as something bellicose and defiant, best illustrated by noisily bragging of our national prowess, quarrelsomely seeking some one who dare dispute it and threatening war against the combined world on the slightest pretext. Of course true patriotism is a very different thing. If it is exhibited by the man who leaves home and friends to follow our flag in war and risk his life in his country's quarrel, it is none the less exhibited by the wife or mother who remains at home to weep and mourn."

> "Do not fail to gain by study and reflection a just apprehension of the purposes and objects for which our Government was established to the end that you may detect any proposed departure from such purposes and objects and be able to form an opinion as to its justification or desirability. You will probably be led by your study and reflection to the conclusion that our Government was formed for the express purpose of creating in a new world a new nation, the foundation of which should be man's self-government, whose safety and prosperity should be secure in its absolute freedom from Old World complications, and in its renunciation of all schemes of foreign conquest, and whose mission should be the subjection to civilization and industrial occupation of the vast domain on which it has taken root. If you believe these things do not permit any accusation of ultra and unprogressive conservatism to trouble you. If the suggestion is made that the time has come for our nation to abandon its old landmarks, and to follow the lights of monarchical hazards, and that we should attempt to force the simple machinery of our popular and domestic Government to serve the schemes of imperialism, your challenge of the proposition is entirely in order. If you are satisfied that foreign conquest and unnatural extension or annexation are dangerous perversions of our national mission, and if it shall seem to you, in the light of reason and history, that such perversions bring in their train a people's demoralization and a decay of popular contentment and virtue, more surely destructive to republics than armies with banners, you will not necessarily be wrong.

"Recalling what we have done and what yet remains for us to do under the guidance of the rules and motives which have thus far governed our national life, you surely are entitled to demand the best of reasons for a change in our policy and conduct, and to exact a conclusive explanation of the conditions which make our acquisition of new and distant territory either justifiable, prudent or necessary. Perhaps you should be satisfied with the excuse that such acquisition is necessary by way of warlike preparation or precaution. This, however, will immediately suggest to you that we have found heretofore a constant source of congratulation in the fact that the contemplation of war and its contingencies is not, and should not be, familiar to our ordinary national life; that it has always been our boast that a large standing military establishment and warlike precautions are not among the needs of a people whose victories are those of peace, and whose immunity from armed conflict is found in their freedom from the foreign relationships that give birth to war; and that, though it has been abundantly demonstrated that the courage and splendid fighting qualities of our countrymen will never fail in time of need, it is still a grave question whether the cheapening of our estimate of the value of peace by dwelling upon war and warlike preparation is calculated to improve the quality of our national character.

"It is difficult to deal with the question of war just at this time and avoid misconception and misrepresentation; but we are considering American citizenship and endeavoring to find its bent and most useful characteristics and how they can be most effectively cultivated and securely preserved. From this standpoint war is a hateful thing, which we should shun and avoid as antagonistic to the objects of our national existence, as threatening demoralization to our national character and as obstructive to our nation's destiny. If you believe this you should stand bravely for your belief, even though a shower of stupid cat-calls may fill the air. If, on account of this belief, you are called milksops and cowards, wanting peace at any price, you will find yourself in splendid companionship."
