Once there was a set of religionists bent on having other people follow their ideas of Sabbath observance. Certain things were being done that they could not endure. At the very moment when they were eagerly seeking what they might do to prevent these things, this question was presented to them: "Is it lawful on the Sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?" They did not go so far as to declare in words their answer, but they proceeded forthwith to declare by their actions that in their minds the destruction of life was better Sabbath observance than those acts of mercy which they were seeking to prevent. For they "went forth and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him."

On May 20th, in the town of Winona Lake, Ind., another company of religionists were assembled. They, too, were grieved by certain things which conflicted with their ideas of Sabbath observance, and were seeking how they might stop the one and carry out the other. While engaged in this work substantially the same question was presented to them. And they answered it as unmistakably as did the others, and declared in words, and as far as actions could go on the occasion, exactly what the others declared.

It came about on this wise. And, by the way, this assembly was the 110th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the United States. In the discussion of what could be done and what could not be done according to their ideas of Sabbath observance, they naturally came to the point as to what the President of the United States should be allowed to do and what he should not be allowed to do. It was proposed that he use the army and navy as little as possible on Sunday. But, lo and behold, the exclamation went up in a moment, "If Dewey had not struck the blow in Manila Bay—and I claim it was a holy act—he might never have ——" That was enough; the conclusion was lost in a burst of applause by the assembled ministers. Some one exclaimed, "We as a church have every confidence in the President's ability to direct the armed force of the nation," and "another volley of cheers and applause shook the auditorium." A spectator declared that "it was just as significant as though a formal vote had been taken on the President's war policy." And it was. But later they "most earnestly recommended to the directors of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition to be opened at Omaha June 1, immediately to decide that its doors shall not be opened to the public on the Lord's day."

If these actions mean anything, they mean that the Presbyterian Assembly looks upon the destruction of 400 lives on Sunday as a "holy act," but that they cannot bear such desecration as an exhibition on that day of the fruits of peace and industry. This need not be regarded as a strange thing. There is an affinity between even the slightest enforcement of religious ideas and the taking of life. The spirit which inspires the one is the inspiration of all the other steps in the career of intolerance. And every step in that career is animated by the father of lies who "was a murderer from the beginning." It is therefore not remarkable that the first and last steps are avowed at one and the same time.
