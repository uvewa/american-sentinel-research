To those of our readers who are deeply interested in the special line of work to which the SENTINEL has been called, but who have not had the privilege of being thoroughly conversant with it in the past, and to those also who value the SENTINEL for reference and help in their work, we would respectfully call attention to our "Bound Volume" ad. which appears in this issue of the paper.
