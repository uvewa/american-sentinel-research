This is the resolution with regard to the claim of the Methodist Church South, introduced in the Senate June 9 by Mr. Lodge, of Massachusetts:

> "Resolved, That the Committee on Claims be directed to inquire and report to whom the money was paid under the claim of the Methodist Book Concern South; and also as to all circumstances connected with the passage of the bill providing for the payment of said claim, and with the subsequent payments of the money under said act of Congress."

Since the trickery of the Methodist agents in getting this claim allowed has been exposed, some of the ministers are trying to save the reputation of the church by loudly demanding that the money be returned to the treasury of the United States, which of course cannot be done, as the attorney already has his fee of $100,800, and a large part of the balance has been distributed by order of the conference. *Zion's Outlook*, a Methodist paper published in Nashville, has three condemnatory articles in one issue, perhaps inspired by the proposition to make a rival Methodist paper, the *Advocate*, a daily on a capital of $75,000 drawn from the fund. The Rev. Dr. Lovejoy, of Atlanta, one of the most prominent Methodists in the South, calls the money tainted because some of it went to a lawyer for lobbying the claim. But all these gentlemen are too late in discovering the "taint," which does not consist so much in hiring an attorney on commission as in presenting the claim in the first place. Every dollar paid out of money raised by general taxation, for the benefit of ecclesiastical institutions, is tainted with the corruption of illicit relations between the state and the church.—*The Truth Seeker*.
