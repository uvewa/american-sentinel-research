The American Bible Society, after an interval of sixty years, has obtained a footing once more in Ecuador for Bible work. Sixty years ago its agent was banished by the Government at the request of the bishop of Quito. Repeated efforts have been made since that time to renew the work, but in vain. Eleven years ago a ton of Bibles was barred out because the ecclesiastical authorities were not willing to have them circulated without accompanying notes. Under the new political régime in Ecuador the Bible Society is again at work. There is at present a large measure of liberty. The agent of the Society, Señor Antay, a Peruvian, recently had access to President Alfaro, who became much interested and bought a Bible for himself, paying $7.50 in currency for it. It is hoped that by legislative enactment the Scriptures may be made entirely free from import duty. The difficulties the agent has met so far are the indifference of the Liberals toward religion and toward the Society's books and the general prejudice against Protestantism.—*The Independent*.
