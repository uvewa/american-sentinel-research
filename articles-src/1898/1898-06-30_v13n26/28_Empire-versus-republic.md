The political machinery necessary to the government of an empire is altogether different from that suited to a republic. The American people seem to want an American empire do they also want a revolution in the American system of government? France, with her foreign colonies, calls herself a republic; but in fact, as recent events have shown, she is a military despotism; and France is the only colony-holding nation which is a republic even in name.
