"MAMA, since our last talk about the subjects of Christ's kingdom, I have heard Mr. Metcalf talking about the millennium. He says that all the world is to be converted; but it seems to me he has some very strange theories about how it is to be done."

"What were his theories?" asked Mrs. Ross.

"Well, in the first place, he thinks that we will have a terrible time of trouble,—war among nations, socialistic revolution, famine and pestilence. But out of this state of things will evolve peace and righteousness on earth. He said that a taste of war now-a-days, would result in men seeking arbitration; that riots among the poor against the rich, would cause an equal distribution of property; that famine and pestilence would lead the state to legislate in harmony with God's laws; and that everybody would learn that he must do right. Then the millennium would begin, and God's will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

"Mr. Sawyer did not agree with him about the time of trouble coming, but said the world was growing better, kinder, and that in the course of time we would see the golden age. Neither of them think that Christ will come very soon. Mr. McAllister said that it was nonsense preaching so much; that what we needed was law to compel men to do right until they learned to like to do it. He said this was the only scientific way to convert the world. He said that sensation had to be specialized along moral lines as well as along mental and physical, and that people had to 'learn righteousness' by right doing; and as they would not do right without law, that it was clear that law was the solution of the world's problem. He said he was glad that there were thousands of people waking up to the fact to-day, who were not theorists; but were going to see to it that religious reforms took the form of law, and that those who would not now do right, would soon be placed where they could not do wrong."

"Righteousness on earth by law, has ever been the will-o'-the-wisp that the prince of this world has kept the world chasing after. It is not strange that just as the subjects of Christ's kingdom are about to be made up, there should be a renewed effort to make men trust more fully in the delusion that his kingdom is to be of this world. But of how much value to God or man would the righteousness be, that is the result of law?"

"Mama, they said the Bible said that there was to be a millennium on earth, and that nations would beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks."

"No, Charlie; the Bible says that the nations will say that they will do this. But saying and doing are two different things. Suppose we turn and read the passage referred to in Micah 4:2, 3.

Charlie read, "'And many nations shall come and say. Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, and he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.'"

"Now read the first four words of the first verse to answer the question, when will many nations be talking like this."

"'In the last days,'" read Charlie.

"Timothy says, 'In the last days perilous times shall come,' that men will be 'lovers of their own selves,' and that even in the church there will be 'a form of godliness' without the 'power thereof.'"

"Why is it, mama, that people believe the world is growing better?"

"It is because they are deceived by appearances. The whole world is running into sentimental delusion. In the time just before the French Revolution, the people at Paris were under the same impression. Because they could weep over the sorrows and trials of the hero of a novel or drama, they reckoned themselves sympathetic and noble; but they were content with emotional nobleness, as it seemed, and never gave it a practical outlet. The poor who were ground down on their country estates, felt the outrage of this kind of goodness, and hurried their tender-hearted oppressors to the guillotine and gallows."

"What a delusion that is!" said Charlie. "And it is one that is easy to fall into."

"So it is. While the church will profess to be more religious than ever before, it will depart more fully from God's word. We can see to day how 'higher criticism' so called, has presumed to throw aside God's word; how infidelity is preached from professedly Christian pulpits; how the church, that has long been wooing the world, now comes to lean on the arm of human law for the enforcement of religious observances. While professing to trust in God, she denies it by her dependence upon the state. The same inconsistency is in the world. While nations say they will not learn war any more, they 'prepare for war, and wake up their mighty men.' While they talk of arbitration, they send forth armies. While they prate of brotherhood, they reduce the poor and grind down the weak. While their wickedness brings its own result,—famine, pestilence and perplexity—they charge these evils upon those who obey God. The plea has already been urged that Sunday observance must be enforced by law, because the Bible says that judgments will fall on those who fail to observe the Sabbath, and those who have presented this plea for Sunday enforcement, know that the Sabbath is the seventh and not the first day of the week."

"Mama, how do you account for these inconsistencies?" asked Charlie. "It seems as if they were losing their minds."

"There is a verse that accounts for it. It is the one that says, 'The devil hath come down unto you having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.' Falsehood is always inconsistent. Those who choose to be deceived will have strong delusion, that they may believe a lie. One of the most pleasing delusions is the delusion of a temporal millennium. It is the siren's song of this century. Bellamy's 'Looking Backward' was a dream of a millennium that has taken hold of the popular desire. In that book he pictures the world under the working of what would seem righteous laws, aided by invention, education, religion and brotherhood.

"Men are chasing up this delightful delusion, while Infinite Love points them to the New Jerusalem, to the coming of the King of kings, and urges souls to prepare for 'him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders;' for when they shall say 'peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them.' Satan will keep up his idea of an opposition kingdom to the bitter end." F. B.
