The following resolution recognizing the dangerous character of much that passes for patriotic teaching, was passed recently by the Women's Press Association of Michigan:

"Recognizing that in the efforts to inculcate patriotism in the minds of our youth there is a danger that we may teach militarism, and in trying to incite to duty to country we shall induce a spirit of retaliation, therefore,

"Resolved, That we will use our best efforts to teach the young that war is greatly to be deplored, even when a necessity; that mercy is compatible with justice, and that defense of the weak and oppressed should not arouse a spirit of revenge toward the oppressor."
