Public opinion is an unstable thing. Only a few months ago, when President McKinley's predecessor was in office, the whole country gave a shout of approval over the message of the chief executive which threatened Great Britain in the matter of Venezuela, and declared that the "Monroe doctrine" must be upheld at all hazards. Now, the whole country signifies its approval of a national policy which is the opposite of that doctrine. While a few dissenting voices are heard, public sentiment as voiced by both press and pulpit strongly approves the idea of an American empire which shall extend to the very borders of the Asiatic continent. But the Monroe doctrine forbids American conquest in the Old World as certainly as it forbids the extension of European conquest in the New.

This change in public sentiment is a very significant fact, and one worth bearing in mind. It admonishes us that we may be greatly mistaken in counting on the stability of public opinion, even for a short period of time. Men say that this or that thing can never happen because public sentiment is strongly against it; but the fact affords no real evidence in support of such a conclusion. The only sure evidence of what is to be expected in the developments of the future, is found in the statements of inspired prophecy. Those statements are the guide of the Christian, and by their light he is saved from the fatal blunders of those who try to forecast the future by means of the finite resources of the human mind.

The word of prophecy assures us that some things are soon to take place which have not as yet been strongly indicated in public sentiment. And now, in addition to that word—if any further evidence could be needed—we have this object lesson on the point of the great rapidity with which public sentiment may undergo a complete change. Events that cannot now be foreseen, but which may be very near, may contribute as powerfully to turn public sentiment into channels leading to the fulfillment of the prophetic word, as Dewey's victory at Manila did to turn such sentiment in favor of a world-wide American empire.
