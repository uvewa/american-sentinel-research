The gospel of Rev. 14:6, 7 is the gospel of Jesus Christ, for there is no other. All that the gospel requires is expressed in the words: "Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters."

With reference to the foregoing it has been shown that the call to "fear God," etc., is really a call to keep the commandments of God.

It has also been shown that this gospel message, as expressed in those words, must be proclaimed at the time when the prophecy of Rev. 13:11-17 is being fulfilled. Furthermore it has been shown that the two-horned beast of verse 11 is the United States, and that consequently it is in this country and by this Government that the work of enforcing what the prophecy calls the "mark of the beast" is to be carried on.

With reference to this work, it has been pointed out that in the very nature of things it would be propagated as a gospel work, having for its object that which would be professedly the worship of God, but which in reality would be the worship of the "beast" of verse 1, which is a symbol of the papacy; and that this worship would be realized in the reception of that which the prophecy calls "the mark of the beast;" and further, that as the true gospel is a call to keep the commandments of God, so in this professedly gospel work which embraces the mark of the beast, a like claim is made with reference to the commandments of God.

Let it be remembered that when this mark, and consequently the worship, is enforced, it will not be openly as the mark and worship of the beast, but professedly as the worship of God. As already shown in previous articles, anything else but that would be simply to expose the whole thing. It must be claimed as the work of God, although such a claim will be absolutely false.

Now as the everlasting gospel calls upon all to "fear God and give glory to him, . . . and worship him that made heaven and earth," etc.; and as this gospel is proclaimed at the very time when by the enforcing of the mark the beast itself is to be worshiped, it will be perfectly clear that the worship of God and of the beast cannot possibly be represented by the same mark. If such were the case it would be equal to saying that the beast is a symbol of God. This indeed would be most dishonoring. But this will be still more apparent when it is remembered that the third angel warns against the worship of the beast and the reception of his mark. But God will certainly not punish those who worship him.

Furthermore, if it should be that the mark of the beast is also the mark of God, it could not be distinguished, so far at least as outward appearances are concerned, who it was that was being worshiped, God or the beast.

Now, leaving out for the time being what has been said thus far in these articles with reference to the question of what the mark of the beast is, let the reader bear in mind that whatever the mark is, it cannot be found anywhere in the Bible. If it could, it would not be the mark of the beast, and the writing of the prophecy and the warning against it would be an absurdity, and an impeachment of the wisdom of the Holy Spirit, by whose inspiration it was written.

In view of the fact that the gospel of Rev. 14:6, 7 is a call to keep the commandments of God, it will be well just here to recall a statement made in last week's article: "There is only one commandment in the decalogue over which there could possibly be any controversy of the nature brought to view in the prophecy under consideration." It was shown there that that commandment is the fourth.

Now recall that which has been stated in this article, that in the very nature of things the mark of the beast is something that cannot be found in the Bible; and then recall too that the mark is enforced with reference to the commandments, and it will be still more evident that the controversy is narrowed down to the fourth commandment.

But what does the fourth commandment require? Simply that we keep holy the Sabbath day.

Now it is a fact that for upwards of forty years a strong effort has been made, gathering strength year by year, until now there are millions of people, represented by various religious societies, committed to the movement, to have a day enforced as the Sabbath of the fourth commandment which cannot be found in the commandment itself, nor anywhere else in all of God's word; and that day is the Sunday. And Sunday—mark it well!—is positively the only day sought to be enforced by civil law which has ever been called a mark.

Concerning this day (Sunday) it is everlastingly true that in the Bible it is never called the Sabbath day; there is not a text which says directly or indirectly that at any time it was to take the place of the Sabbath—the day that God blessed and sanctified—only as such an attempt would be made by the "man of sin" (2 Thess. 2:3, 4; Dan. 7:25). Never does the Bible say that either Christ or the apostles ever kept Sunday as the Sabbath or Lord's day; nor is there the slightest proof that it was ever regarded as a sacred or holy day. And when those who for years have been at the head of this work for the enforcement of Sunday as the Sabbath—when they have been asked, and that, too, repeatedly, for such evidence, they have been forced to acknowledge that the Bible is silent concerning it. And this again proves that which in these articles has been abundantly proven, that Sunday is not the mark of God, but the mark of the papacy.
