Press reports state that the State Prohibition party of Kansas have nominated Senator W. A. Peffer for governor, on a platform in which appears this declaration:

"We regard civil government as an ordinance of God and recognize the Lord Jesus Christ as King of Kansas, and therefore believe that the administration of civil affairs should be in harmony with the law and in his spirit."

Is making note of this the New York Sun observes that these Prohibitionists are "violating the spirit of the Constitution, and presenting a totally false theory of the relation between religion and civil government in the United States. This same platform claims for all persons of legal age and requisite qualification, regardless of race or sex, the right of a free ballot;" and yet if the Kansas Populists carry out the theory set forth in their politico-religious resolution they must hold that no atheist or agnostic or disbeliever in the divinity of Christ should be allowed to vote; and so they would restrict instead of enlarging the right to vote."

Nothing but inconsistency, injustice, and hypocrisy can come out of the effort to join Christianity with the State. The Prohibition party make a fatal mistake when they put this into their program of work.
