It is not possible for me to give the chronological order in which the departments of the W. C. T. U. work developed. All I can do is to present them in what might be called their logical order.

We had not been long at work for the children until we discovered the ignorant mother and needy home, in which the profligate, careless or absorbed father was an important factor; and this led out to many other discoveries which filled our hearts with a great longing after all the powers with which it is possible for the Spirit of God to equip a human being for service.

The Department of Work among Mothers was made one of the first subdivisions of the Evangelistic Department, and nowhere have we been made to realize in a greater degree than here the force of this evil against which we have dared to array ourselves; for one woman who was intimately associated with the work of this department, while still in active service, was compelled to live through the arraignment, trial and execution of her son for one of the most terrible crimes in history, and is lingering out the life of a heart broken mother, while her sisters who knew and loved her, are continually sending after her in the seclusion from which she never comes, tender thoughts and prayers that all of comfort that can possibly be administered to her from the Holy Spirit of God may be granted until the end.

The principle that is at the foundation of our work among mothers, is that of the right of God in every human being, as stated by David in Ps. 127:3: "Children are the heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his reward." In connection with this we have taken the statement of Paul in 1 Cor. 3:9, that "we are laborers together with God." In these words of divine authority we have all these years found our inspiration and consolation, for we are sure that the blessing of God must follow every effort that we make to preserve his heritage and to assure his reward to him; and that since he has chosen to be our fellow-laborer, he will be at least as faithful in doing his part as we can be in doing ours.

We have been a long time in getting down to the meaning of that "working together with God," but some of us saw years ago that it covered a vast range, touching not only the drink question, but that of food for body and soul and all habits of thought and action, dress reform, and every point of education; a field so wide that the only possible provision for it must be found in the whole Gospel for the whole man.

No more remarkable experience could ever come to a Christian worker than to our women when, filled and enthused with the greatness of this gospel, seeing it in its own clear setting of eternal glory, realizing what it and it alone can do, they have gone for the first time into some home in which Egyptian darkness reigned, and have begun the effort to awaken an ignorant and prejudiced mother, perhaps a hardened, discouraged and vicious one, to some understanding of her responsibilities and privileges as one who has been entrusted with a portion of God's heritage and reward.

In my work as National Evangelist it was my duty to hold institutes and teach methods of reaching mothers of all classes; and I can probably do no better than to give an outline of the plan of work which has been followed for years, and which has borne blessed fruit. The first point emphasized was to keep the work as near the cradle as possible. Let any father and mother discover that you have a genuine interest in the baby, and they will listen to anything which you may have to say that concerns the life and well-being of any child. I have known men of the world to abandon the use of tobacco as well as strong drink, and make as thorough a reformation as possible in their habits of life, because of truth which the mother had learned in the talk of the W. C. T. U. evangelist over the cradle of her child, or in a mother's meeting, and which she repeated to the father. One father came to me at the close of a Sunday service and said:

"I thought you might be glad to know that what you have said to the mothers has led me to give up my tobacco entirely, and reform in many other things."

"Then," I said, "you believe that I told the truth."

"As to that," he said, "I thought it might be that some things were put rather strong, but I reasoned this way: I am absorbed in business; I have not time to look into these subjects that you have, and I had to believe that there must be truth in it, for you would not dare to go out representing that great body of the best women in the world and teach falsehood, and I concluded if there was a shadow of truth in what you have taught about parental responsibility and pre-natal influence, and the effect of a father's habits on his children, that I could not afford to risk it any longer for the sake of the children which I expect to have; so I have set myself to work to clean my life up to the best of my ability."

And I am sure no one will be surprised to know that as he went on honestly in this endeavor, he soon found his need of a power greater than his own will, and so surrendered to the Holy Spirit, accepted Christ, and began with his wife to make a truly Christian atmosphere into which to welcome the child that was expected in their home.
