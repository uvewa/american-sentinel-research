**THE Christian Statesman**, in an argument made to demonstrate the awful recklessness of deeds which constitute a desecration of Sunday, says that "Every battle begun on the Sabbath as a historical fact resulted disastrously to the aggressor."

This was printed by the Statesman just about the time that news came of Dewey's great victory in Manila harbor, on Sunday. As a matter of fact, it is not historically true that battles fought "on the Sabbath" have always resulted disastrously to the aggressor; but the engagement in Manila harbor, fresh in the minds of all Americans, should constitute a complete answer to the current sophistry that the Government ought, as a measure of safety, to avoid the desecration of the first day of the week.
