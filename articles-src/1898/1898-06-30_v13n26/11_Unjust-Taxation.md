**UNJUST TAXATION.**—A century ago, our forefathers made war with Great Britain and declared their Independence, because they were required to pay an unjust, though very slight, Tax in Money. To-day, vast religious organizations purpose, through the Sunday Law, to impose upon the American People the enormous Tax of One Seventh of All Their Time. This will become a reality if the Sunday Laws are revived and enforced. Will the American People submit to this most unjust Tax? Or will they declare their Independence?
