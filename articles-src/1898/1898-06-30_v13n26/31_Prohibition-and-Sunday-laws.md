The attitude of the Prohibition party towards Sunday observance in many places leads a journal of this city to remark that "it is sometimes hard to tell whether the Prohibition party seeks to suppress liquor because it is an evil or because saloons violate the Sunday law."

The Prohibition party would gain immensely by a change of attitude in this respect.
