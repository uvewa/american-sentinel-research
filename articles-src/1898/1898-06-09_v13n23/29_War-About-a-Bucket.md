"The Oriental Watchman."

Every one knows that a very small matter may grow into a quarrel, when two small people feel quarrelsome. And when grown people allow pride and selfishness to rule their hearts they can quarrel about as small a thing as children. So nations may fall out and fight, spending large sums of money and many lives over a very little thing. The following shows what "standing up for their rights" may lead men to do:—

"In the year 1005 a soldier of the commonwealth of Modena ran away with a bucket from a public well belonging to the State of Bologna. The bucket might have been worth a shilling; but it produced a quarrel which was worked up into a long and bloody war. Henry, king of Sardinia, assisted the Modenese to keep possession of the bucket, and in one of the battles he was made a prisoner. His father, the emperor, offered a chain of gold that would encircle Bologna, which is seven miles in compass, for his son's ransom; but in vain. After twenty-two years' imprisonment he pined away. His monument is in the Church of the Dominicans. The fatal bucket is still exhibited in the Cathedral of Modena, enclosed in an iron cage."
