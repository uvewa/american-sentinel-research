One can hardly blame Mr. Dooley, a character discovered by the *Chicago Journal*, for being more impressed with the religious aspect of the controversy with Spain than with the material aspect, in view of the tremendous activity of the ecclesiastical powers engaged, and the comparative quiet in the operations of the fleets and armies.

Relating his impressions of the war recently to an acquaintance, Mr. Dooley is quoted as saying that while the "sthrateejans" in Washington have been holding their discussions "they'se been goin' on the mos' deadly conflict iver heerd tell iv between th' powerful preachin' navies iv th' two counthries." The bishop of Cadiz, he went on, "fired the openin' gun," and "sint n storm iv brimstone an' hell into us," and was immediately "answered be our whole fleet iv preachers. Thin he was jined be th' bishop iv Barsaloona an' th' bishop iv Mahdrid an' th' bishop iv Havana," and "to meet thim we sint th' bishop iv New York, th' bishop iv Philadelphia, th' bishop iv Baltimore, an' th' bishop iv Chicago, accompanied be a flyin' squadron iv Methodists," Presbyterians, Baptists, and others. "Th' bishop iv New York" is now "blockadin' th' bishop iv Santiago de Cuba, an' they'se bin an' exchange iv prayers between th' bishop iv Baltimore an' th' bishop iv Havana without much damage." His impression was that we were having a shade the best of it so far, but the Spanish bishop, he said, "prays har'rd, an' 'tis no aisy wurruk to silence him."

Mr. Dooley's observations would be perfectly in order if we were to take seriously the attitude of the ecclesiastics belonging to the opposing sides in the war. As it is, they illustrate the absurdity of the idea which both parties are seeking to carry into effect, that God can be made a party to the mixing of Christianity with carnal warfare.
