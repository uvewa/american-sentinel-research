"I don't believe Professor Carman thought twice, or he would not have given Ed Barnaby that job to do," said Charlie White to Rob Billings, on their way home from school.

"What job?" asked his companion.

"Why, that essay to write. He never could write a composition worth a fig. I expected he'd refuse, point blank. Besides, you know, the Barnaby bookshelves are as barren of books as a Kansas garden is of vegetables after the grasshoppers have put in their work."

"I know it; I'm just sorry for those boys. Their father lost his job after his last spree, and Mrs. Barnaby has begun to take in washing, mother says, to support the family."

"I think its wonderful how Ed and Will have stuck to school, and especially to the French history class."

"Well, I don't know; Professor Carman makes them pretty interesting. But what can we do to help Ed with his essay?"

"I'll tell you," said Rob. "Mother has a history of France which tells lots of interesting stories; maybe that would help him. I'll ask mother to lend it to him, and, then, besides, Professor Carman said he'd let him have some helps."

Robert Billings was as good as his word, and the next Tuesday afternoon, thanks to his kindness and the thoughtfulness of his teacher, Edward Barnaby had an essay, which he had worked very hard to prepare, and which, as the teacher has just called him up, we will hear him read:

"King Charles VI. of France," began Edward, bravely, though his voice shook a little, for he always had a great dread of essays, "was also called the Well-beloved, though why, I can't see for the life of me, unless it was because he was so crazy, most of the time, that he did no particular harm. His people never seemed to pay much attention to him,—only they liked to see him out in public when he was able. I don't believe he knew they thought much of him till he died—and then of course he didn't know it. But then they cried and took on pretty bad. I'm sorry to say that's the way people do nowadays,—they wait till a fellow dies before they find out that he amounts to anything."

That's true, Edward," interrupts the teacher, "and more's the pity."

"After the king began to get better from his first crazy spell, which lasted near a year, one of his silly courtiers thought he would invent a kind of fun that was entirely new. He did. It was a masked ball, in which the inventor of the sport, the king, and four or five knights dressed up in linen suits, which they covered all over with pitch, and then attached tow to the sticky pitch,—they must have looked odd, I think. At last the king's brother, the Duke of Orleans, carelessly held a burning torch so close to one of these human pieces of kindling wood, that the tow with which he was covered took fire, and that set all the rest afire except the king. His aunt threw her cloak around him, and so managed to get him out. The inventive genius who got the play up was burned to death. This man was so cruel toward the people that they hated him and were glad when he died. He used to whip them cruelly, and then, calling them 'dogs,' would tell them to bark. So when the funeral procession was going along the streets, these poor fellows would call out, 'Bark, dog, bark!'

"Of course the king was too weak in the head to endure so much excitement, and he was soon crazy as ever. He even imagined his own wife was a stranger; but, I don't know as there was anything so very queer about that, seeing she was so unkind to him. But he thought a great deal of his brother's wife, the Duchess of Orleans, and used to call her his sweet sister; he was always contented when she was near him.

"For weeks and even months the poor king was so neglected when in his crazy fits, that he did not even have his clothes changed. All this time he stayed in the Hotel St. Pol. His wife, Queen Isabella, was just as heedless of her children's comfort as she was of his; in fact the young princes and princesses were allowed to go quite destitute. Once when the king was told of this he cried, and took his cup of gold and told the attendant to sell it to get what was needed.

"At last he died after reigning from 1380 to 1422, or about forty-two years."

"Come now, Edward, never think again that you can't write an essay," said Professor Carman, as Edward took his seat. "You're good for any number of them, I'll guarantee.

"Now, though Edward has done well and has brought out many good points, he has omitted a number of incidents in the reign of the crazy king, which it will hardly do to let pass without notice. Almost his entire reign was one dreary quarrel for the supreme place, between the dukes of Burgundy and Orleans. At last the latter is most cruelly betrayed and assassinated by order of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. This strange man wept at the funeral, when he saw the disfigured remains of his relative, and at last confessed the crime, but declared it was only an act of patriotism; and strange to say, although the murdered duke was a great favorite among the common people, he made a great many people believe it."

"Well, I think that when so-called patriotism leads to downright murder, it's high time to call a halt," said Joe Palmeter, indignantly.

"You are right, Joseph; but not only did the Duke of Burgundy make the people believe him innocent, but he even forced a great preacher of the day to praise the act, which was nothing but the most dastardly murder—in one of his public sermons."

"Do you think that was right to submit, professor, even though the duke threatened his life if he refused?" asked Julia March, who always wanted to know the moral bearing of any question.

"I will answer you next week, Julia," said the teacher, glancing at the clock and ringing the bell for dismissal.
