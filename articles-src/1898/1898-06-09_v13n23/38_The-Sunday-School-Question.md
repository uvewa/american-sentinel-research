WHAT is the matter with the Sunday-school? is a question considered recently by Mr. Edward Bok, who is well known as the editor of that popular magazine, The Ladies' Home Journal. Mr. Bok says that there is decidedly something the matter with the Sunday-school; that, in short, its old-time efficiency is almost wholly gone. His statements raised a storm of protest, which he probably foresaw; but he spoke with a tone of conviction, fortified by his own experience and observations.

BUT the question, What is the matter? covers a broader field than the Sunday-school. Recently we printed an article from the New York Sun, on the subject of the decay of orthodoxy. There is something the matter with the orthodox churches in general. This is more especially evident in the Presbyterian body, where there is a feeling of dismay which cannot be disguised. The church and the Sunday-school are bodies so closely connected that it is only to be expected that a serious malady in one will make itself felt in the other. But whatever cause may be assigned for these alarming symptoms, one thing is certain; there is nothing the matter with the Christian religion. Man is a frail creature, continually failing and wandering away from the right path; but the wisdom and power of God are manifest in the gospel still, as they have been since time began.
