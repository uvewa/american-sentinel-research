SOME idea of what would be involved in carrying out an offensive and defensive alliance with Great Britain may be obtained from these figures applying to the British Empire, given by the N. Y. Christian Advocate:

"At the present moment the British Empire is fifty-three times the size of France, fifty-two times that of Germany, three and a half times that of the United States of America, thrice the size of Europe, with treble the population of all the Russians. It extends over 11,000,000 square miles, occupies one fifth of the globe, containing one fifth of the human race, or 350,000,000 people, embraces four continents, 10,000 islands, 500 premoniories, and 2,000 rivers."

The United States may well pause before making an agreement to share with Great Britain the task of defending this vast realm.
