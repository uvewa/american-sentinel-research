The well-known writer, George Kennan, in describing some recent experience at Key West, tells of meeting some of the captured Spaniards, who with their ships, had been taken by the vessels of the American fleet. In speaking of these he says that "On the schooner 'Power of God,' there seemed to be more wild, cruel, piratical types than on any other vessel, except perhaps 'St. James the Apostle." Imagine the incongruity. It is just such ridiculous travesties of sacred truth that are always furnished by a union of religion with the state.
