BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

It was hardly to have been expected that the national game of "ball" would become the redeeming virtue of the American people, or that this country would ever have its sports cited as the convincing evidence of the civilization, bravery, and enlightenment of its inhabitants. Nevertheless, one of the leading journals of the country (the Chicago Times-Herald), and one that is usually quite sound in its conclusions, has attempted in good faith to score a point against the Spanish people and in favor of the American people by a comparison of the national sports of the two countries.

It says truthfully that "sport after all is a serious matter," and that "the play hour and the manner of its spending, recreation, and the character of its indulgences, are considerations which become national in importance." It then portrays the brutality and cowardice of the Spanish bull fight in which the matador fights "with an inferior with tremendous advantage in his favor," and how "every lad from Barcelona to Cadiz dreams—sleeping and waking—of the hero in the ring, and imbibes in infancy, cultivates in growth and exercises in manhood the essentials of the ideal character." This character must first be cruel and then cowardly. All Spaniards, however, are not bull-fighters, the majority being even too cowardly for that, so that there is but one matador to many spectators the spectators being fighters only "in their souls."

It then proceeds to compare with this the national game of America which "i· said to be baseball, although football has gained a wide popularity." Its remarks are confined particularly to baseball, although we see no reason why they are not just as applicable to football.

The American in attending the national game finds the "very essence of his enjoyment in the equal terms—of intelligence and muscle and training—on which the contestants meet." The participant in the game "is training good human muscle and developing good human brain in the only way which can yield a nation of men. He is matching human against human—not man against brute."

No one having the slightest acquaintance with the subject will wonder that football was shunned in this connection, notwithstanding its "wide popularity." It is virtually admitted, however, to be as much the American game as baseball, but whether it be admitted or not, we know that it is. It has all the virtues here ascribed to baseball. The game is too notorious and the tragic results of its "training of good human muscle" and its "matching of human against human" too fresh in our memories to require details here. Suffice it to say that during the last season eleven deaths, not to mention all the accompanying evils and minor brutalities, were reported in a short time, and one state was sufficiently aroused to abolish the game by rendering it a criminal offense.

An investigation of the details will not lead anyone to question the statement in the editorial under discussion, that "no bull-fighting nation on earth ever could come creditably out of a war with ball-players." There is one point in this connection that we wish to emphasize. With all their boasting the Spaniards have not, to our knowledge, pointed to the picadors and banderilleros of the bull-fight as the representatives of either their honor or their bravery, and we do not believe they represent the little intelligence with which Spain is credited. But the names and achievements of the "rushers" and "backs" of the American game of football, together with the accounts of the deaths, maimings, and injuries occasioned by them, are invariably connected with such names as Yale, Harvard, Brown, Pennsylvania, Princeton, and the various state universities. On the one hand we have the ignorant matador tormenting and slaying an animal in the arena; on the other we have the inmates of the highest educational institutions of this country, who are supposed to be basking in the full blaze of our enlightenment, and enjoying the very heights of its attainments, trampling over and kicking each other on the football ground almost in the shadow of those institutions. Is that a spectacle to be held up with pride as an evidence of our superior civilization? It would seem that all ordinary motives of humanity and self-respect would have led us, instead of glorying in this our shame, to have sought with averted gaze to cover the deformity. To what lamentable lengths do we go when determined to ignore the truth, and to substitute "gross darkness" where there is the clearest light.

There is another sport which has attained a "wide popularity" in this country and which also possesses the virtues mentioned above. In it the contestants meet "on equal terms of intelligence [which isn't saying a great deal] and muscle and training." They "match human against human—not man against brute," and they consider that they are using muscle and brain in a way which will show them to be "men." And it is not too much to say that many, a youth from New York to San Francisco aspires to be just such a "man," and that he, too, "dreams—sleeping and waking—of the hero in the ring, and imbibes in infancy, cultivates in growth, and exercises in manhood the essentials of the ideal character" fully as much as does any lad between Barcelona and Cadiz. It need not be said that the sport to which we refer is prize-fighting. The fame of the light and heavy weights of Spain has never reached us, but reliable statistics on prize fighting show that thirty-one pugilists have been killed in the arena between the years 1832 and 1897, and of these deaths, three occurred in England and the remaining twenty-eight in this country. No credit need be taken from the fact that the time extends back to 1832. Nine of these deaths occurred in 1897, and the whole twenty-eight in this country have occurred since 1876. It may be that there is more brutality in matching "man against brute" with "tremendous advantage" in favor of the man, than there is in matching "human against human" with the deliberate intention and expectation that one or the other will be cruelly maimed if not killed outright; but a person of average sensibility will not be able to realize it. To our mind it is "man's inhumanity to man" that is the great offense, and in that respect we think this country will have little difficulty in maintaining its reputation with Spain.

There is something else which sometimes occurs in this country, and which has an important bearing in determining the relative brutality and cowardice of the Spanish and American people. In it "human is matched against human" and in one respect it closely resembles the description of the bull-fight—"tremendous advantage" is on one side. But it is not necessary that we should add to the horrors of this list those of lynch law. Nor need we add many other things which properly belong in this category.

We are by no means defending the bull fights of Spain. We regard them as both cruel and cowardly. In fact, we know of but one thing which exceeds in barbarity the cruel and wanton destruction of animal life, and that is the cruel and wanton destruction of human life, whether it be on the football ground, in the prize ring, or on the deck of a man-of-war. The one exceeds the other in brutality just to the extent that the life of a human being is of more value than that of an animal.

The plain truth is that by nature and of himself the Spaniard and the American is one and the same. The average American goes to the football game or a prize-fight for exactly the same reason that he goes to war, or that the Spaniard goes to a bull-fight—because he experiences a certain infatuation and delight in seeing life and limb risked in a brutal encounter. But notwithstanding the fact that all men are of "one blood," there have been certain great influences which have operated for the elevation of the one nation and the degradation of the other. Next week we shall point out those influences by quoting from an authority who has investigated deeper than the "play hour and the manner of its spending."
