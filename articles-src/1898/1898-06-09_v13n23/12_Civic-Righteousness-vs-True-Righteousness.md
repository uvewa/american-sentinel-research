"EXCEPT your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees," said Jesus Christ, "ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

What was the matter with the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees? Oh, it was all on the outside. It was all a matter of forms and ceremonies and respectable appearance. It was not a matter of the heart.

And this must be the case with all righteousness—so called—which is the product of civil law. The law cannot change the heart; it can affect only the outward deportment.

Reform by law can go no deeper than the outward deportment. But—to paraphrase the Saviour's words—Except your righteousness shall exceed that of a pious and respectable outward deportment, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. Or, in other words, Except your righteousness shall be greater than "civic righteousness" ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.

Civic righteousness—the righteousness of outward forms, of scrupulous regard for the letter of the law, and of pious look and demeanor—did not stand very high in the estimation of Jesus of Nazareth. And it does not stand any higher in his sight now than it did when he rebuked the Pharisees and Scribes. The only righteousness we want is that which bears the genuine stamp.
