The New York Sun, of the 23rd inst., gives the following interesting observations on the session of the Presbyterian General Assembly, which began at Winona Lake, Ind., May 19:—

"Dr. Sheldon Jackson, the retiring moderator, preached a notable sermon, so far as concerned pulpit eloquence, but he made no direct reference to the lapse of faith manifested in some parts of the Presbyterian Church, here in New York, for instance, unless in the remark that 'we are living in one of the greatest crises of the world's history.' In saying this he may have had in mind merely the political conditions of this period, for he spoke surrounded by national flags and to an audience which was roused to enthusiasm by every appeal to patriotism. Unquestionably, however, we are living in a time when religious faith is passing through the greatest crisis in the history of Christianity and of all religions. It is a time when supernaturalism itself is assailed as mere childish superstition, a tissue of fairy tales and ghost stories, even by theologians themselves, and when the Bible, the source whence is derived the whole Protestant belief in supernaturalism, is relegated by a distinguished theological school to the place of a criticisable human production.

"Among the reports presented in the early routine of business was one complaining that the standard of 'Sabbath observance' has been lowered constantly in this country, the 'Continental Sunday' replacing the 'American Sabbath' in many places. Undoubtedly the old severity of Sabbatarianism has yielded under the pressure of both popular distaste and religious doubt. It is not surprising that when people begin to lose faith in the Bible, under the teachings of the Presbyterian critical school, they should become careless about keeping Sunday in the old Presbyterian fashion. Various suggestions were made against the reading of Sunday papers, bicycling on Sunday, and other and almost universal departures from the strict Puritanical observance of the day; but nothing definite as to them was done by the General Assembly.

"Whatever may be done in the way of prohibition will be of no practical consequence. Presbyterians, clergy and laity, will do as they think best in this matter without regard to the precepts of that body. They are now as eager as the rest of the people to get the news of the war, and they want it on Sunday as much as on other days. Sunday bicycling, moreover, has been encouraged by some pastors in the provision of receptacles for the machines in their churches; and, by means of a wheel, a missionary is enabled to conduct Sunday services at widely removed places.

"Moreover, when a Kansas delegate offered a resolution earnestly requesting President McKinley to use his influence and prevent 'needless work by the navy and army, and especially the beginning of movements or battles upon the Lord's day,' the resolution was tabled almost unanimously, the Rev. Mr. Hudnut, of Brooklyn, arousing patriotic enthusiasm by declaring that 'Dewey did a holy thing in striking at Manila on the Lord's day.'"
