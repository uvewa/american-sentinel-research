JUST WHEN the seat of European political disturbance has been transferred to the precincts of the crumbling empire of China, and the forces of the powers are gathering by land and sea to enforce their respective claims for territory and commercial privileges, a new figure appears upon the scene, as "Uncle Sam," with one giant stride, steps clear across the Pacific and plants one foot squarely down almost at the edge of the field of controversy. What is now to happen? is the question in the minds of European statesmen, as they contemplate this new and not very welcome addition to their "war concert." Will "Uncle Sam" lift that foot and step back again to his own side of the earth? or will he keep it where it is? The indications are that the latter will be his choice. But the decision which is made in the matter will be of far greater consequence than any of the battles that may be fought in the existing war.
