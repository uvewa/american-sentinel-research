A meeting of ministers of Jefferson, Ia., and vicinity, was held in that city recently, to devise a plan of action for opposing Sunday excursions on railways. Four Protestant clergymen and the Catholic priest joined in the call for the meeting, and all Catholic priests within a considerable distance of Jefferson were invited to participate in the conference. The effort resulted in the production of resolutions designed to create public sentiment against this form of Sunday desecration. These resolutions were forwarded to all ministers in the vicinity of Jefferson, to be used by them in creating sentiment among the people within their reach. An appeal will also be made to the railway companies to run no Sunday excursions, and petitions to the same end will be forwarded to the railway officials by the middle of June. The Jefferson Bee says that the ministers are taking vigorous action in the matter, and their efforts may be expected to produce results.
