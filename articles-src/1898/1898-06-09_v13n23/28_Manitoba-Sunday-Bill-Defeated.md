The following item from a Manitoba journal states in detail the "destruction of the enemy's fleet"—so to speak—in the battle between the forces of liberty and of religious legislation in the Manitoba legislature:—

"Clause two of the Sunday observance bill, prohibiting the sale of goods and the performance of ordinary work was struck out, as was also clause three, prohibiting political meetings; clause four relating to games and amusements and clause five, with sub-sections relating to Sunday excursions. In place of clause four a provision was inserted making it illegal to advertise or attend games or entertainments for which a fee is charged. A clause was added providing that this bill did not repeal the general Sunday act now in force."
