Extract from a paper read at the Willard Hall Conference, Chicago, April 18, by Rev. G. A. Luckerman.

### LOW HIGH CLASSES.

Shall we ever learn the fact that there is not a single social evil which has not its root in respectability, modern phariseeism, the spawn of special privilege—that there is no corrupting influence which takes not its rise in what are called the higher classes? If we ever do we may learn, in the name of betrayed humanity, to say to all such influences, no matter how bold their effrontery, "Thou couldst have no power at all against me were it not given thee from above. Therefore he that delivereth me unto thee hath the greater sin."

Oh, for an Isaiah to sound his Woe to them that call wealth success and poverty failure; that call pauperization charity and bribery legislation; that call policemanization law and love anarchy; that put respectability for righteousness and make the bestowal of hush money their religion. Woe to the Esaus, who rate man below property and mind below matter. . . . Woe to the professed followers of Christ who seek to be ministered unto rather than to minister, whose aim in life is to get without earning, who fear nothing in comparison with losing their social position and their soft job, who say "Master, master" with one breath and with the next "We have no king but Caesar."

For surely the picture is not overdrawn nor the implied comparison unwarranted. It was the dominant social class, the respectably religious, that rejected him then, not the rabble nor the Romans, and to-day it is the counterpart of the same class that hourly rejects his claim and delivers him up to be crucified; these, and not the saloon-keeper.

And, as of yore, that class is organized, has its hierarchy and its myrmidons. There is the eminently respectable and next to him the quasi respectable, and next to him the boss and the ward politician, and so on down the descending scale to disreputability of the lowest sort. And the man at the top is at the bottom of the deviltry. He is the arch-corrupter of youth, and not the saloon. He is the arch-debaucher of women, and not the saloon. He is the arch-foe of justice, and not the saloon. Indirectly, of course, and in the majority of cases unconsciously; but really and truly, nevertheless, for he holds himself aloof; he moves in the best set, so far as any one knows, never moving out of it. The grievous and heavy-to-be-borne burdens of his business schemes and legislative measures he lays upon the back of his so-called attorney, whom he of course pays liberally, and who in turn employs others for the dirtier and less arduous work. These last he never sees, does not know, nor want to know. It might make him uncomfortable if he did. They are paid for what they do and are satisfied, presumably. What affair is it of his? Indeed, he seldom if ever thinks of them; the ward politician looks after all that.

## AN EVIL HERITAGE.

He is blind; yet his blindness is not altogether willful, and in so far, therefore, he is not to be blamed. He was the product of the existing social order before he became one of its chief upholders, and the church which he supports has never told him—shall we say never dared to tell him?—in language he can understand that he is daily responsible for the crucifixion afresh of the Son of God through cooperation in a system which gives the lie to professions of faith in Christ and renders incapable of fulfillment the definite, practical injunctions of his teachings.

In this respect his experience is not unique. Each of us enters upon life with the innate capacity for Christlikeness, and the equally innate tendency toward Phariseeism, and the very worst that can be said of the existing order, this so-called Christian civilization, is that it develops the Pharisee and kills the Christ in us. All of us are under its spell, and so the objects of divine displeasure. The differences are only differences in the degree of culpability dependent on the measure of received enlightenment and they who really see are the first to feel the force of the Master's command: "He that is without sin, let him cast the first stone."

## AN EX-PHARISEE'S EXAMPLE.

Let us would-be reformers, therefore, not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no one of us put that worst of stumbling blocks, Phariseeism, in his brother's way. To do this is not easy, but it is possible. For from out that old party of self-righteousness, respectability and special privilege there came a man who, having suffered the loss of all things of that sort, did count them as so much dung in comparison with the knowledge of Christ and acceptability with him, consequent upon that knowledge and that loss. In saying "Be ye followers together of me, even as I am of Christ," Paul, the ex-Pharisee, prisoner of Jesus Christ, said what each one of us, lay as well as clerical, must be able to say if he would be other than a blind leader of the blind. For the Master's requisition the necessary qualifications for real discipleship is the same to day that it was in the first century: If any man would come after me let him turn his back upon respectability and social station. Let him come out of that smug little world of his own imagining, out into the real world of the common people, bearing his cross of misrepresentation and ridicule and scorn, and let him follow me in the search for rightness of personal relationship with publicans and sinners.
