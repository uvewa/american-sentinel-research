One of the speakers at a recent mass meeting of citizens of Nashville, Tenn. (mentioned in another column), called to consider means for suppressing the Sunday saloon, said he thought that saloon men ought to form an alliance to keep the laws, and in case one of their members should break over, "kick him out" of the organization.

This might be good policy for the saloons. But the fact is that the saloon is essentially a law-breaking institution; it is in its very nature an outlaw. Hence it is not to be expected that the saloons would be able, even were they willing, to form and maintain an effective organization for the promotion of obedience to law. All they ask is to be let alone; and all their power is naturally exercised in the direction of securing conditions in which they will be let alone to the fullest possible extent.

The saloon is a positive force only in the direction of evil.
