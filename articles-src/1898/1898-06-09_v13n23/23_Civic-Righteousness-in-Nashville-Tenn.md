The "Ministers' Alliance" of Nashville, Tenn., has inaugurated a campaign for "civic righteousness" in that city. What is meant by "civic righteousness" may be seen from the following resolution, which is one of several passed at a mass meeting called by the Alliance, the evening of May 23:—

"Resolved, That it is the sense of the people of Nashville that gambling houses and open saloons on Sunday are a serious menace to the peace and good order of the city, and to the manhood of our youth, especially so since Nashville is an educational center and hundreds of young men are residents here during the formative period of their lives."

In other resolutions following, the meeting called upon the city authorities to permanently close the gambling houses and shut up the saloons on Sunday.

Righteousness has nothing in common with the saloon any more than it has with gambling or with any vicious indulgence. But "civic righteousness" says that the saloons may remain open and transact their nefarious business all days of the week except Sunday. It is evident, therefore, that "civic righteousness" is not righteousness at all.

It was not the fact that the saloons and gambling houses were open that draw the attention of the Ministers' Alliance; but the fact that they were open on Sunday. It is needless to say that it is regard for Sunday which prompts people to feel more concerned at evils seen on that day, than at those which show themselves on ordinary days of the week. But regard for Sunday is a religious sentiment purely, and one with which civil government has no concern.

"Civic righteousness" has its origin in religious sentiment. It means a form of city, state, and national government which has for its main object the exaltation of Sunday.
