A REPRESENTATIVE of the Society of Friends, Mr. Richard Henry Thomas, writes the following to *The Independent*, in justification of the Society's attitude on the question of war:—

"We are unable to find anything in the example of Jesus, or in the spirit of the New Testament that justifies the assertion, when made without qualification, that 'self defence is Christian.' Within certain limits it is, as is also the defense of the weak, and the defense of the right. These limits may include any amount of suffering on the part of the defender, even unto death; but they admit of no departure from the spirit of love or from the spirit of His example who came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them, and to give his life a ransom for many."
