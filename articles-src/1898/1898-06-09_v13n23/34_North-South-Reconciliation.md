THE other day the historic "Sixth Massachusetts" regiment passed through Baltimore on its way South, and was received by the people with an ovation. The soldiers received flowers instead of the stones and bullets hurled at them back in '61. The incident was a very pleasing one, and is one of many indications that the old dividing line of animosity between North and South has passed or is rapidly passing away. Perhaps by the time the war is over there will be nothing left to mark this dividing gulf of former days, except—except the dividing line perpetuated by the "Church North" and the "Church South," as found in the Methodist and some other denominations. How would it seem if the church should come to have a monopoly in this unbrotherly business?
