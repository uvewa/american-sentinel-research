DOWN in Louisiana the other day, if press reports be true, a crowd of white people took a negro criminal, chained him to a stake, and burned him after the fashion of the auto-date of the Dark Ages. The whole affair was executed as deliberately as heretics were wont to be executed by the church-and-state authorities in the days of papal supremacy. This and other like occurrences will constitute convincing proof in the eyes of European powers of the desirability of driving Spain out of Cuba and supplanting her rule with the "Christian civilization" of this Republic.
