THE Michigan Christian Advocate says:

"Protestantism will follow the flag into Cuba and Porto Rico, and the Philippines, and to the ends of the earth."

Now Protestantism has lost its way when it begins to follow earthly flags. It started out to follow the Word of God, and any attempt on its part to follow any other ensign than that of King Immanuel is to depart from the principles that gave it its original prestige. Had Protestantism gone forward in the way marked out for it by divine Providence, instead of leaning on the arm of flesh, it would have encompassed the "ends of the earth" long ago, without waiting to follow any earthly flag. Jesus says, "All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations." "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Again he commands, "Follow Me." What then have Protestants to do with following any other standard, when the God of heaven says, "Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward;" when he who has "all power" has promised that "the Lord will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward?"

All this dependence upon the governments of earth to go before, and the arm of human flesh to sustain, in the spread of the gospel is just so much catering to Romanism; for it was the entrance and encouragement of that principle in the church that made Romanism and the Roman Church possible.
