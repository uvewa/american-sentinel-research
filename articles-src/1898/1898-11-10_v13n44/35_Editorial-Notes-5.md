One great evil of "moral reform by law" is that the spasmodic effort to enforce the laws enacted for the purpose, and which often overstep the bounds of justice, is invariably followed by a reaction in which the wave of immorality sweeps over the city and the state to a worse degree than before. The rule of "Tammany" in New York City, for example, is even worse to day than it was before the famous Parkhurst crusade. If the principles of good government are not more openly disregarded now than then, the confidence of the people in them has been weakened by the failure of that crusade to produce permanent results. A few failures turn the mass of the adherents of a reform movement over to the other side, and the cause of good government suffers to the extent that it was confounded in the public mind with the reform crusade; and this is often to no inconsiderable degree. Let laws be enacted solely to protect individual rights, and let immorality, as such, be combatted by Christian teaching and example. This will promote the welfare of the individual and of the state as well as it is possible for human wisdom to do.
