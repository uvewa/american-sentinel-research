The church of apostolic days was an Established Church. "And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily." Acts 16:5. There is this difference between the establishment of religion then and now, as the world uses the term. Those churches were established "in the faith," which stood "not in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God," and it stood against all the persecutions and efforts of governments to root it out. Now the establishment of religion means a religion established in governmental law, by the wisdom and the power of politicians.—*Oriental Watchman*.
