The following extracts on this important subject are from a speech by Llewelyn D. Bevan, LL. B., D. D., of Australia, spoken during the recent agitation in that country over the question of State support of religion:

"We all agree that children should have religious teaching. But who shall give it? This is the question at which so many part company. All will consent to the parent of the child teaching religion to his offspring. All will agree that religious teachers, voluntarily chosen by the parent, may do it. But what of that system which, wisely or unwisely, we have adopted, which takes the children by a vast machinery of state and compels them to be submitted to its methods of instruction? Shall that include within its subjects of instruction, religion?—'No;' say the Romanists, 'for we do not believe that the state should teach anything but help our priests and appointed persons to do it and all other teaching, for that is the special care of the church.' 'No;' say the secular educationists (we use the term in no opprobrious sense) 'for the state cannot teach religion, not being religious, and it would only raise bitter sectarian jealousies if it were to try.' 'No;' say many religious persons, 'for though we should like the schools to teach religion, yet there are some evils attendant which we fear.' 'Yes;' say some others, 'for though there are some evils, we must face them; and no evil is so great as that of the children having no religious teaching at all.'

"Thus we are divided, and sometimes are very angry with one another, which is an unfortunate condition, and certainly not very helpful to the education of the children in good manners and good morals, which are a sort of religion in their way.

"We are all, I think, satisfied that it is useless to ask the state to give religious teaching. Its teachers could not do it, seeing that they include persons of all sorts of religious opinions, and many of none. Even if they could it would be hopeless to try to satisfy the people of the fairness or the goodness of teaching thus supplied. We should be soon plunged in inextricable confusion and ceaseless quarreling.

"Let us suppose that the Protestant churches should agree to accept the Bible reading or Bible lessons in schools, it is quite certain that the Roman church would more than ever condemn the state school system. They would refuse to allow their children, even where they attend school, to be present at the classes. And they would justly claim that the Protestant conscience being satisfied by the introduction of the Bible, the state was obliged in all fairness to recognize and support the schools which they conscientiously (one must say with remarkable generosity and devotion) had established. The claim would be reasonable.

"It would be a great gain, undoubtedly, to have the Bible read and known. It would be the best thing, from the merely educational standpoint, that the children would receive at school. But it would not be religion. The fact is, the churches need quickening. They are asleep, careless of their duty, indifferent to the claims of the Lord, the needs of the children, the interests of the country. Some are awakened and are troubled. Bible reading would only be a sop to these to lull them, too, into a fateful satisfaction.

"Therefore I hold that such a system as we possess requires the fresh, free life of a voluntary addition. It needs the impress of parents, and of churches, and of cooperative organizations to give it plasticity and variety to save it from the mechanical formalism into which it must decay. It was never intended to give more than secular instruction, and even that it cannot perfectly give. Religion it cannot give at all. That must be found where only it exists, in the hearts, and lives, and lips of religious men and women."
