"New York Journal," November 1.

The Rev. F. M. Foster, preaching in the Third Reformed Presbyterian Church, of this city, startled his congregation last Sunday by the solemn declaration from the pulpit that a Christian cannot consistently vote in this country.

And this remarkable statement he sought to defend thus:—

"The principal reason why it is believed that the elective franchise cannot be consistently used by the Christian is because the Lord God Almighty, whose dominion is throughout the whole earth, is not recognized as the Supreme Ruler and as the source of authority in the Government of the United States, the Constitution of which makes the people the source from which all authority emanates."

The Rev. F. M. Foster may not know it—and we are charitable enough to grant that he does not—but the utterance quoted is as blasphemous a thought as was ever conceived in the brain of the rankest and most irresponsible infidel.

The Constitution of this country, which he undertakes to assail, vests the right of government in the people—the people whom God made after his own image, and to whom he gave the products of his creation.

Does the Rev. F. M. Foster think that the Almighty needs "recognition," when a religious people draw up laws for the government of men?

Is the Omnipotent Creator like an ambitious politician, who needs resolutions of indorsement and approval whenever the conventions meet?

Are we a nation of Pharisees to make ostentation of the most sacred recesses of our hearts?

The Rev. F. M. Foster may be, and we hope he is, a sincere man; but there is more religion in the incantations of the self-starved Oriental than in the screed he preached in New York day before last.
