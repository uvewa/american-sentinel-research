"Well, Aleck, since our last talk, I have been reading up Jewish history. The Jews did not avert the calamity they feared, by putting Christ to death. The Romans did come and take away their place and their nation."

"Yes, so they did. What a commentary is the destruction of Jerusalem on the inefficiency of human defense! When Titus and his armies entered the flaming city, he looked with amazement on the strong defenses, and declared that God must have given the city into his hand. After all, Cecil, the battle is the Lord's. God hath his way in the storm."

"O, but Aleck, I did not think of attributing the fearful destruction of Jerusalem to God. It seems to me the Jews simply reaped their own sowing."

"You are right, Cecil. They had abandoned the protection of the Infinite, and thereby fell a prey to satanic fiends. They sowed the cross of Calvary on Golgotha, and little dreamed of the harvest. Thousands of crosses covered the hills, whereon hung the Jews who had cried 'crucify him,' and furnished feasts for kites and vultures. The siege and overthrow of Jerusalem presents one of the most fearful retributions of history."

"Retribution;—why do you call it that?"

"Because it is the retribution of following a false principle. It is the revenge of revering tradition, of upholding established customs, of reverencing a sanctuary from which the Shekinah had fled. The old wrath of error made them furious antagonists against the Romans, and brought upon them the fulfillment of the desolation foretold in the days of Moses."

"What had Moses foretold, Aleck?"

"He had said that if they refused to depend on God, and broke his commandments, that they should be destroyed. Here, let me read it to you, said Aleck, taking his Bible from his pocket. You'll find the prophecy in Deut. 28:49–53: 'The Lord shall bring a nation against thee as swift as the eagle fieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; a nation of fierce countenance. . . . And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land until he have destroyed thee, and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trusted . . . And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and daughters, which the Lord thy God hath given thee, in the siege.'

There is another prophecy in Dan. 9:24–26, that brings out the events to be fulfilled in the city from the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the captivity in Babylon to its final destruction in A. D. 70."

"Is that so, Aleck? Do let us read them."

"In the previous chapter," said Aleck, "Daniel is shown a period of 2,300 years. In the 9th chapter the angel is sent to further explain to him the meaning of this period. He asks him to recall the vision, and then says, 'Seventy weeks are determined [or better, "cut off," from this long period] upon thy people [the Jews] and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.'

"Seventy weeks would be 490 days, and as each day represents a year in prophecy, it would be 490 years. The angel then tells Daniel when this period would begin,—at the commandment to build and to restore Jerusalem. This commandment was issued by Artaxerxes in A. D. 457 (See Ezra 7). From that year until Christ should appear as the Messiah or the Anointed One, it would be 69 weeks or 483 days or years. Reckoning this time brings us to A. D. 27 when Jesus was baptized in the Jordan at the beginning of his ministry as the Messiah. He was there anointed with the Holy Ghost, and to this time the prophecy was fulfilled."

"But what does this mean, Aleck, that the 69 weeks are first divided into 7 weeks and then into threescore and two? And what does it mean by saying the street shall be built again and the wall, even in troublous times?"

"It took 7 weeks or 49 years to rebuild the city. The nations around were angry, and tried to prevent it. You may read of their opposition in Nehemiah. Then come the 62 weeks of which we have already spoken. After its fulfillment the prophecy says, 'Messiah shall be cut off, but not for himself.' Thus Daniel foretold the death of Christ for all men over 500 years before his advent to earth. We have now seen how the 69 weeks were fulfilled; but 70 were cut off on the Jews, so that one more week still waits to which to fit the historical fulfillment to the prophet's specifications."

"The 27th verse says, 'And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week, and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.' For the last seven years of the time, the gospel was preached by Christ and his disciples among the Jews. At the end of that time the nation by an act of the Sanhedrim rejected the truth, and the disciples went out to the Gentiles."

"What is the meaning of making the sacrifice cease in the midst of the week?"

"How long did Christ minister in person to the Jews?"

"Three years and a half, I think," said Cecil.

"Yes. By comparing the gospels this conclusion is evident. It is generally agreed that this was the time of his earthly ministry. He was crucified in the spring of 31, and by the sacrifice of himself put away sacrifice and oblation forever; for he is our passover, sacrificed for us. This was in the midst of this prophetical week. The seventy weeks ended in A. D. 34. The Jews rejected the gospel, and the disciples went to the Gentiles. Now what is to follow? They would not rely on God, but on themselves. They would not exchange tradition for truth, they insisted on custom rather than Christ. God foretold the result. Read the sequel in Dan. 9:26.

"And the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, unto the end of the war desolations shall be determined."

"Over a million people perished in the overthrow of Jerusalem. Those who remained were dragged away as slaves to Rome. The suffering was indescribable. The temple was devastated, and it is said that every stone in it was overturned in order to secure the gold that in the heat had melted and run between the crevices. Thus was the word of Christ fulfilled. The site of the city was plowed as a field. No more tragic picture arises in the fields of history than the history of Jerusalem, from Christ's advent to the final overthrow in A. D. 70.

"I wonder if any of the doomed people recalled the tender words of Christ as he wept in anticipation of their destruction, saying, 'How oft would I have gathered you even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not. Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.'"

"It is very impressive," said Cecil. "And you think it was the result of the outworking of the principle of human reliance, instead of reliance on God."

"Indeed I do. But the destruction of Jerusalem is a picture of the fate of every soul who depends on man.

'Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.' The yearning love of Christ's words reaches out to every soul, saying, 'Come under my wing, let me be your refuge and defense, lest your house be left unto you desolate.'"

Cecil gave Aleck no word of reply, but wrung his hand, and walked away thoughtfully.
