From a circular sent out by Mr. Geo. B. Knapp, Secretary of the National Armenian Relief Committee, it appears that time has by no means ameliorated the condition of the Armenian refugees since the massacres by the Kurds and Turks. The condition of these wretched people, who wander about from one district to another, and are welcome in none, is described as touching the extreme limit of desperateness, and they have no prospect of relief. A few months ago representative men in civilized lands talked long and loud about the duty of "Christian nations" toward Armenia; but the war in Cuba, famine and plague in India, the reconquest of the Soudan and the prospects of war between England and one or more of the Powers of Europe, has turned public attention in these lands away from the Armenians, and they have been forgotten. Thus their situation appears to have become more hopeless than before.
