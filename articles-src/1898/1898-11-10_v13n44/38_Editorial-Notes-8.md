There have been rumors of a military plot in the French army in Paris, aiming at the overthrow of the civil government; and more evidence has been found to substantiate them than usually exists behind mere rumor. A sudden revolution in France—a coup d'état, as the French themselves call it—must be counted as among the probabilities of the near future. In the Roman republic the army finally took the affairs of state into its own hands, and the same thing may occur in the French republic. In a republic, a great military power does not balance well with the civil government. Militarism is suited only to a monarchy.
