BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

The only thing that calls for mention in the proceedings before Friday—Civic Day—was this: F. D. Kelsey, pastor of the Central Congregational Church, Toledo, Ohio, in the course of his address on Wednesday, said that "the people are listening to an immense number of vagaries which will ultimately end in a French Revolution, unless the ministers of the country impartially educate and enlighten them with reference to these things." Further on he said: "We are on the eve of a great reformation or a great revolution. I hope for reformation, but fear revolution. One must come, or the other is inevitable."

On Wednesday the subject of the churches and the masses was discussed, and the fact was pointed out that there is almost a total separation between them. A man, who declared himself to have been a member of the committee of fifteen that formed that "magnificent organization, the Municipal Voters' League, which has done more for Chicago than any other organization," obtained the floor and declared that whatever might be the case with other churches, there was one church that the masses had not deserted, one church that knew how to reach them: that it was to the honor and glory of the Catholic Church that all its members were treated alike, that they met in worship on a common footing; that the priest at the altar treated alike the millionaire and the pauper. This man afterwards proved to be J. P. Brushingham, D.D., pastor of the First Methodist Church of Chicago.

On Civic Day the discussions took on a warmth and interest beyond any that had preceded them, and it became evident that on the subjects discussed there was a wide difference of opinion. Dr. Burrell, of New York, on surrendering the chair to Mr. Jones, mayor of Toledo, Ohio, took occasion to remark that "reformers' day had arrived," and that he was to deliver the gavel of authority to one of them. But he was glad to say that while Mr. Jones was a reformer, from his knowledge of him, he knew that he was a reformer with some common sense, which was saying a great deal for most of them. He wished to say before resigning the chair that the motto that should be inscribed on the banner of those who take up the subject of capital and labor and allied questions with the intention of improving the condition of affairs, should be, "Be ye angry and sin not." This they should never forget. It was easy enough to get up, as most of these would-be reformers did, and denounce capitalists and monopolists; and rave about aristocrats and grinding combinations of wealth, but that kind of reform would never help things a particle. A reformer might become angry, and it was sometimes necessary that he should, but he should not sin at the same time.

The mayor made a brief speech in which he said that he knew of but one thing that would ultimately cure these difficulties—the force of love. We must recognize that all men are our brothers, and have rights and claims equal to our own. He did not think it was necessary to get mad at all. What was necessary was that we should become inspired by that spirit of love and sacrifice for our fellow men shown in the text, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life." The mayor was dressed very plainly and spoke in a quiet, unassuming manner.

The mayor had said that in politics he was a Republican, but that no one would get that impression if they got next to the Republican machine in Toledo. But, nevertheless, he was a William Lloyd Garrison—Abraham Lincoln Republican, and expected to remain such. Others who spoke mentioned their politics.

When Mr. Walter Thomas Mills, of Chicago, arose, he said that as it seemed to be in order he would first state his political faith. He said that he was a Thomas Jefferson—Andrew Jackson—Wendell Phillips—William Lloyd Garrison—Charles Sumner—Abraham Lincoln—dyed-in the wool Republican, and that therefore he voted the straight Democratic ticket. He declared that the industrial and economical condition of things was becoming intolerable; that he wanted to see a system in which when a man died he would be obliged to turn the world loose instead of being able to hold on to his ill-gotten gains, as is done under the present legal system. He wanted the living to have some show. He declared the devil owned the controlling interest in the commerce of this country. He pointed out, as illustrating the success of the cooperative system, that one or two small colonies near Chicago had gotten some land and property and used it for the common good of all, and that one of them would soon be able to purchase enough land for another colony, the privileges of which would be free to all those who would enter the arrangement—"as free as God had made the land at first," he declared.

In the afternoon Dr. Bayard Holmes, of Chicago, spoke from a Socialist's standpoint. It was noticeable, too, that he was dressed very plainly, and spoke earnestly and without any of the flourishes and gymnastics that marked some of the speeches. He showed that society industrially was in a lamentable condition, and laid down some propositions, the practice of which he thought would cure the evils. He said that according to the statistics of Carroll D. Wright, commissioner of labor, there were not less than four million able-bodied, unemployed men in this country to-day, turned out to starve or to prey upon the rest of society. He also made the statement that there were more poor in the world to-day than ever before. He wanted a system in which there would be no capitalist, in which it would be a crime to attempt to become one; in which there would be no private property except what each needed for personal use. If a person needed a tooth brush he could have it, if he did not need it, he would not have it. He said that all men were equal and that they should all receive equal remuneration for their work—namely, what they needed.

He had scarcely finished before several were on their feet ready to attack his propositions. Before recognizing anyone the mayor asked if anyone present had ever stopped to think that when the Lord told Adam to eat bread in the sweat of his face, that there was no employer to whom he could sell his labor, no boss to whom he could go for a job. He said that he was in hopes that that condition of affairs would become more general nowadays.

Doctor Burrell, the general president, first obtained the floor. With more than his usual warmth he declared that this socialistic conception of society was exactly the condition he had found on the reservation of the Sioux Indians in Minnesota a few years ago. There everything was held in common, they were on a dead level; there they had no private property, not even tooth brushes. As nearly as he could tell this condition of society was nothing more nor less than original and unregenerate barbarism. He declared that he took direct and unequivocal issue with the statement that there were more poor in the world to-day than ever before. The condition of the Roman world at the birth of Christ was infinitely worse. In the age of the Caesars there were ten thousand knights who owned all the wealth and property, and there were millions and millions of slaves in the most degraded condition, sleeping without shelter, murdering each other for the amusement of their masters, and having not the semblance of a right before the law. It was a shame to say that since the introduction of Christianity into the world that any such condition has ever been repeated or approached in any degree. He exclaimed, turning to Dr. Holmes, "If I should see stretched before me in rags the shivering, wasted, and starving bodies of those four million unemployed, even then, sir, with that exhibition, I would never admit, but that the condition of this country was ten thousand times better than was Rome in the age of the Caesars." "Why is it," he exclaimed, "that we can assemble here and discuss these matters? Is it because we are all slaves? Is that the cause of our lamentations and dismay at the sight of three or four million ragged and starving people? Do we assemble here in this city and discuss these matters because there are here 19,950 slaves and the rest tyrants? May such slavery continue!"
