SELF-ENJOYMENT is the world's idea of happiness. "How are you enjoying yourself?" is one of the most common questions; and "I am enjoying myself very much," is the common term to express perfect satisfaction. If one is enjoying himself, nothing more is thought to be needed.

Ah, how small enjoyment that is! He who has nothing but himself to enjoy, has a very limited range of enjoyment. And very mean enjoyment it is, too. God would have us enjoy something far better, and so he gives us himself. "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only so, but, we joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement." Rom. 5:10, 11.

Here is true enjoyment,—the enjoyment of God. He who enjoys God has an unlimited and eternal field of enjoyment. God gives himself to us in Christ, in whom are all things, and so it is that he "giveth us richly all things to enjoy." 1 Tim. 6:17.

When people learn that "every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights," and that we have no good thing except in him, they will cease asking their friends, "How are you enjoying yourself," and will say, instead, "How are you enjoying the Lord?"—Sel.
