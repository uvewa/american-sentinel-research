The *Chicago Israelite* prints a report authorized by the "American Missionary Association," of New York, stating that a Congregationalist minister, Rev. J. B. Fletcher, by name, had been shot while organizing a Congregational Church at Smiley, Ga., the guilty parties being colored members of the Methodist Church. The assailants aimed through a window in the church, and Mr. Fletcher was shot down in the pulpit. He was seriously though probably not fatally wounded, and announced that he would prosecute his assailants at any cost. The *Israelite* adds this comment:—

"Now if Mr. Fletcher had been a German, and the emperor had made this assault a pretext for attempting to annex Florida and making the United States pay a million or two of dollars indemnity, besides demanding privileges not granted the other foreign nations, Germany would have tried to do to us only what she did to China on the same grounds precisely. Of course we should laugh at the threat of such a proceeding and serve Germany as we did Spain if she should make it advisable for us to do so. . . . Public opinion in America is probably no more opposed to murderous violence than it is in China, and that people as a whole is as little to be blamed for isolated lawless acts as ourselves. Let us be just, and, knowing the shortcomings of our own, never condemn a whole people for the wrongdoings of a few individuals."
