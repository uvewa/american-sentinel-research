AFTER the death of Constantine, his son Constantius succeeded to the government of the Eastern provinces, and eventually became the sovereign of the whole empire. And as he, his empress, and his whole court, were Arians, he forthwith used all his influence, as the head of the church, to exterminate, as far as possible, evangelical doctrine; and the whole world groaned and wondered, says St. Jerome, to find itself Arian. The tyranny of Theodosius restored the orthodoxy of the churches, but could not revive their piety; and from that time, in union with the state, they continued to be so corrupt, that at length the profligacy, covetousness, fraud, and arrogance of the clergy generally, from the pope to the obscurest monk, so revolted the conscience and the common sense of Europe, that in the sixteenth century it burst from this oppressive and degrading yoke.

"The nature of the relation between the potentate and the priest during this period was frequently illustrated by incidents like the following. Pepin, who was mayor of the palace to Childeric III., king of France, having formed the design of dethroning his sovereign, assembled the states of the realm, A. D. 751, to whom he proposed that violent measure. They voted that the bishop of Rome must be consulted; embassadors were therefore sent by Pepin to demand from Pope Zachary, "whether the divine law did not allow a warlike people to dethrone a cowardly and indolent monarch, and to substitute in his place one more worthy to rule?"—Mosheim. Zachary's answer was favorable, Childeric was deposed, and Pepin ascended his throne. Pope Stephen II. confirmed the decision of Zachary, and wanting the aid of Pepin against the Lombards, paid him a visit A. D. 754, when he released him from his oath of allegiance to Childeric, anointed him, and crowned him.

But it would have been happy had the union between the secular and ecclesiastical powers been productive only of such occasional specimens of villainy on either side; but alas! for many centuries before the Reformation, it universally and constantly checked the promulgation of the gospel. Had there been no such union in the nations of Europe, then in each kingdom peaceable subjects would have been protected in life and property, whatever their creed might have been; disturbers of the peace would have been repressed; pious and enlightened men might have preached Christ to their contemporaries without molestation; and evangelical churches, formed through their ministry, might have prevented the spiritual slavery, superstition, and demoralization, into which the churches so generally sank.

But through the union, each student of the Bible, with any energy of character, was speedily arrested by the anathemas of the priesthood; and the state was ever ready to give these anathemas effect. It was the church which condemned Lord Cobham in England, John Huss in Bohemia, and Savonarola at Florence; but it was the state which consumed each of them in the flames. Had there been no union, Cobham would still have led on the Lollards to new successes; Huss would have still lived to confirm his disciples in the faith; and Savonarola might have reformed Italy. Devout and resolute men might have defied the malice of the priests if the state had not placed the dungeon and the thumbscrew, the rack and the stake, at their disposal. The union, therefore, is responsible for the religious ignorance and general degradation of manners which disgraced the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries.

When the reformers of the sixteenth century struggled for the doctrines of the gospel with the hierarchy and the priesthood, the union was still their greatest enemy. Unchecked by the governments of Europe, the Reformation would have been nearly universal. In Scotland the reform conquered the government; but in England the union mutilated the reform; and in France, in parts of Germany, in Spain, and in Italy, overcame and crushed it. The union alone gave teeth and claws to the two Inquisitions of Spain and Italy; and without its aid the powerful confraternity of Loyola would have been baffled. As the union had previously corrupted the churches, so at the Reformation it prevented their restoration to purity of discipline and to spiritual life.

Since that day superstition has maintained its hateful ascendency in Europe through the union alone; and were it removed, France, Roman Catholic Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, might be pervaded in every direction by zealous evangelists.

On the other hand, it has not been less disastrous in Protestant countries. The reformers, who had a gigantic foe to grapple with, were too happy to secure the aid of their rulers, by investing them with almost all the prerogatives of which they despoiled the pope. Misled by the evangelical zeal of some leading statesmen, they vainly hoped that Protestant governments would, in successive generations, heartily promote the progress of the gospel, and consented to a union which has been productive of endless mischief. Ever since the union of the Church of England with its imperious and profligate head, Henry VIII., who burned alike the friends of the pope and the followers of Zuingle, because he would not endure that men should have any other religious opinions than his own, the state in England, with scarcely the exception of one brief interval, has been steadily opposed to evangelical religion. Queen Mary, though a bigoted Catholic, continued to be the legal head of the Church of England, and availed herself of the supremacy with which she was invested by the union to crush the English Reformation.
