"If parents would do for their children what God in in his Word has commanded them to do,—teach them his law when they go out and when they come in, and bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,—we would hear no more of this demand that the state must teach religion. And which should ministers do, teach parents to do their duty, or demand that the state shall do something that is not its duty?"
