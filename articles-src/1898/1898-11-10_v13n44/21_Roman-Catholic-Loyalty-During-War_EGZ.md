In *The Examiner*, a leading Baptist organ, Rev. E. G. Zwayer gives some observations on the attitude of American Roman Catholics during the war with Spain. He says:—

"The war between the United States and Spain was not a religious war. It was not a war between Catholics and Protestants as such. But those of us who live in sections where the European Catholic population is large have seen some things during the past few months that convince us that Romanism is even more of a menace to the safety of American institutions than we have imagined.

"The anthracite coal region has a very large Catholic population. In many places the Catholics far outnumber the non-Catholics. Just before the war broke out, and during the first few weeks that followed the outbreak of actual hostilities, there was little, if any, attempt on the part of the Catholics to disguise their sympathy for Spain.

"In some churches the priests spoke strongly against the American attitude, and in some cases are said to have given the impression that it would be entirely wrong for the Catholics to fight against their 'Spanish brethren.' At Mount Carmel, a town of about 15,000 inhabitants, an American flag was torn down and trampled under foot; and in another place an American flag was taken down and a Spanish flag substituted. In still another town the flag rope at the armory was cut and many small flags torn down from the homes of citizens.

"By and by the sentiment began to change, and it was evident that some higher authority than the local priests was bringing about the change. It was surprising to see what efforts were made to prove, on public occasions, such as flag raisings, that Catholics are loyal and patriotic. . . . One young priest, in demonstrating the loyalty of his people, declared that 'Before war breaks out, we are all free to hold and express our views, and to show sympathy for the side nearest to our hearts. But when once "the powers that be" have declared war, then it is the duty of every citizen to obey his government, unless the commands of that government are contrary to the will of the "higher authority." 'Catholic theology,' he said, 'teaches that authority must be respected, and that the opinions of the individual can never be used as an argument against such obedience.'

"Another priest argued that Catholics could consistently fight against their 'brother Catholics' on the ground that both brothers in the faith, and natural brothers, as well as fathers and sons, had fought on opposite sides in the Civil War. Toward the close of his oration he expressed the hope that 'when we have a man in the supreme office of the United States, the Protestants will be as loyal and as ready to answer his call for soldiers to fight against some other nation, as we are now to fight against Spain.'"
