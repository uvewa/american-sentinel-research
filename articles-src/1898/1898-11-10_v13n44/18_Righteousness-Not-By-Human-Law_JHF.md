By James H. Fairchild, President Oberlin College.

The positive requirements of government must be, as far as they go, reenactments of the law of obligation. It can never rightfully require what it is wrong for the subject to do, but its requirements may properly fall far short of duty. They are, probably, never complete expressions of duty.

In this respect they differ from the divine laws. The divine law covers all duty; human law only such duty, and so much of it as properly falls within its sphere. Many matters of important obligation are never touched by human law. Indeed, the substance of all duty, the duty of benevolence, is not at all enjoined by human law.

But aside from this, there are multitudes of outward duties which human law does not contemplate. It does not require politeness, or charity, but these are manifest duties. The law does not undertake to express the full obligation, but only so much of it as is essential to the outward regulation of society. God's law, not man's, is the standard of righteousness.
