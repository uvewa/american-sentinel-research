THE principal object of Emperor William's pageant to Jerusalem is said to have been the consecration of the Church of the Redeemer, which was accomplished with "impressive ceremony" on the last day of October. Incidentally however—though perhaps not so incidentally as it seemed—the emperor took occasion to show that a very friendly understanding exists between himself and the sultan. The sultan presented him with a piece of ground which tradition marked as having been the site of the abode of the Virgin Mary. And this the emperor in turn, through the pope, presented to the German Catholics.

The emperor sent a telegram to the pope, as follows: "I am happy to be able to inform your holiness that, thanks to the benevolent intervention of his majesty the sultan, who has not hesitated to give me this proof of his personal friendship, I have been able to acquire at Jerusalem the abode of the Holy Virgin. I decided to place this ground, consecrated by so many pious memories, at the disposal of my Catholic subjects. It rejoices my heart to be able thus to prove how dear to me are the religious interests of the Catholics whom Divine Providence has placed in my care. I beg your holiness to accept the assurance of my sincere attachment."

In reply, the pope expressed his deep satisfaction at the gift, for which he was sure the German Catholics would be deeply grateful. And as the gift of the traditional abode of the Virgin Mary is a matter of interest to all Catholics the world over, it may be safely assumed that Catholics in all countries will share in the emotions of gratitude felt by their co-religionists in Germany; and as the gift came in the first place from the sultan, and no doubt with a knowledge of what disposition Emperor William wished to make of it, it may be also assumed that Catholics the world over will entertain a friendly feeling for the sultan. The emperor's oriental tour has vastly strengthened the throne of the sultan. There is something significant in this drawing together of Turk, Protestant emperor, and Roman Catholics at this most noted of historical and prophetical sites.

Among the "impressive ceremonies" which marked the "consecration" of the Church of the Redeemer, was an address by the emperor, in which he said: "From Jerusalem there came the light, in the splendor of which the German nation became great and glorious. What the Germanic peoples have become they became under the banner of the cross, the emblem of self-sacrificing Christian charity. As nearly 2,000 years ago, so there shall to-day ring out from Jerusalem the cry voicing the ardent hope of all for 'peace on earth.'"

Bearing in mind that it was Sadowa and Sedan which lifted the Germans to their present eminence as a nation, and that the German army marched to these great victories under quite another standard than the "banner of the cross," the necessity will be evident of making a very liberal discount upon this part of the emperor's speech. Nor can a less discount be placed upon the "ardent hope" for peace on earth, in view of the unusual preparations England is now making for a great struggle for supremacy in the far East.
