SUNDAY is the "pillar" of tradition—tradition as understood and taught by the Catholic Church. Tradition itself is the "pillar" of Roman Catholicism. This we have shown in former articles.

As, therefore, the Catholic Church depends upon tradition for its existence, and tradition, in turn, depends upon the Sunday institution, it follows that Sunday is the foundation of the Catholic Church—it is the mark of the papacy.

Further: As Sunday is the foundation of the Catholic Church, and as genuine Protestantism is a protest against the Catholic Church, it not only follows that Protestantism, to be consistent with itself, must protest against the Sunday, but that Sunday is itself the actual dividing line between Roman Catholicism and true Protestantism.

So far as the Catholic Church is concerned, the question of Sunday, as a Christian institution, has been settled for all time. But the question has not been settled so far as Protestantism is concerned.

Just here it might be well to note that when we speak of the settlement of this question in this connection, we mean only so far as it can be settled by man. No man, or body of men, can settle for another his duty to his Maker, although the attempt has been made, and as we see will be made again. Such settlements as these really settle nothing. There is a tribunal before which this matter, with all other matters, must come for final settlement, and when it is settled by that tribunal, it will be settled right, for God himself will be the Judge, and he makes no mistakes.

And so we say, so far as man can settle it, for the Catholic Church the Sunday question has been settled for all time; but not for Protestants.

There are very few people comparatively who do not know that upon this question of Sunday as the Sabbath day, Protestantism is divided.

This perhaps at first would not appear strange, inasmuch as there are other doctrines upon which the Protestant churches are divided. But when it is remembered that the Sabbath, leaving out for the time being the question as to what day is the Sabbath, is set forth as the "test of all religion," so that it is said that "he who does not keep the Sabbath does not worship God, and he who does not worship God is lost"—when this is remembered it will be seen that these other differences sink into comparative insignificance.

Now as Sunday at the beginning of the Reformation was a vital question, and as the Protestants then stood on the wrong side of the question, and as the Reformation cannot be complete until every error is rooted out, this question of Sunday must come up again, not as in this first instance, between the Catholic and the Protestants, but between the Protestants themselves.

But when it shall come up, where will it be settled?

If we turn to the Old World we find that Sunday is, and has been, an integral part of the laws of the various European nations. But if we look at this nation—the United States of America—we find that the matter of the Sabbath, as indeed all other religious matters, are not permitted by the Constitution to come within the purview of the Government; but are left to the individual conscience, the Constitution guaranteeing the recognition of the rights of conscience for all alike, even to the humblest citizen.

Thus in 1830, the Congressional Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, to whom had been referred a matter involving the question of work upon Sunday, reported:

"We look in vain to that instrument [the Constitution] for authority to say whether the first day, or seventh day, or whether any day, has been made holy by the Almighty.

"The Constitution regards the conscience of the Jew as sacred as that of the Christian, and gives no more authority to adopt a measure affecting the conscience of a solitary individual than of a whole community. That representative who would violate this principle would lose his delegated character, and forfeit the confidence of his constituents. If Congress should declare the first day of the week holy, it would not convince the Jew nor the Sabbatarian. It would dissatisfy both, and consequently convert neither. . . . If a solemn act of legislation shall in one point define the law of God, or point out to the citizen one religious duty, it may with equal propriety define every part of legislation and enforce every religious obligation, even to the forms and ceremonies of worship, the endowments of the church, and the support of the clergy.

"The framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle that man's relation to his God is above human legislation, and his right of conscience inalienable. Reasoning was not necessary to establish this truth; we are conscious of it in our own bosoms. It is this consciousness, which, in defiance of human laws, has sustained so many martyrs in tortures and flames. They felt that their duty to God was superior to human enactments, and that man could exercise no authority over their consciences. It is an inborn principle which nothing can eradicate.

"It is also a fact that counter memorials, equally respectable, oppose the interference of Congress, on the ground that it would be legislating upon a religious subject, and therefore unconstitutional." (Italics ours.)

This extract clearly shows the attitude of the Constitution toward all prospective religious legislation, and declares the fact that one's duty to God is superior to human enactments.

It will be proper here to enquire what was the motive governing the framers of the Constitution when by their action the question of the truth or falsity of any religious doctrine, and its decision were taken out of the hands of the law-makers, who, in making the laws, are sworn to uphold the Federal Constitution?

The answer to this question must be reserved for another article.
