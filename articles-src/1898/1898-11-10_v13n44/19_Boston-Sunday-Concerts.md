The following from the Haverhill Gazette, which quotes from a leading Boston daily, expresses public sentiment in Massachusetts relative to the agitation which is being vigorously kept up by the Sabbath Protective League and similar bodies, to secure moral reform by law:—

"The citizens of Boston are very much oppressed by laws passed every session of the legislature to please reformers. The latest trouble experienced is the threatened interference of the Sabbath Protective League to prevent a continuance of the Sunday concerts given to keep the musicians of the municipal band together during the winter, and furnish such music at a low price as will elevate the public taste. Referring to this subject the Boston Transcript very aptly says:—

"While no protests have been officially received, the Sabbath Protective League has made a general objection, moved thereto by the circulars distributed to the schools, in which the purpose of the enterprise was announced and coöperation invited, but we cannot believe that it will be sustained by public opinion. The influence of good music is elevating and refining. Probably even the league would admit that premise; and it will be difficult to convince the average citizen that that which is elevating and refining six days in the week is a desecration of the Sabbath on the seventh. It is entertainment, it is true, but it is entertainment with a larger purpose than mere amusement. The more appeals of this kind to the higher tastes and interests of the individual there are, the less will be the resort to grosser methods of disposing of a day whose hours to many are inevitably tedious.

"The effect of closing the theater Sunday concert was to immediately fill every sham hotel and public house in Boston with men and women who drink liquor. Nor has it been helpful in creating a large attendance at the various church services on Sunday evening. It is to be hoped that the law as it now stands will be amended to permit the rendering of such music as made up the average Sunday concert programme of the lamented Gilmore and Tourjee."

It would seem that Puritan religion looks with suspicion at whatever is calculated to make Sunday anything but a day of gloom and discomfort for the common people.
