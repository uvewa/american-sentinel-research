A BILL has been introduced in the Vermont legislature, providing for free text-books in the Catholic schools of the State; requiring also that school directors visit all schools and that teaching in the same be from prescribed text-books. It is wrong thus to invade the domain of the private school, and equally wrong to provide text-books for the same from the public funds. This bill is an example of the common effort to correct one wrong by committing another.
