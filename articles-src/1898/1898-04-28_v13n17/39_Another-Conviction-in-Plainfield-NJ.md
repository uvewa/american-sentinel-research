Another of the individuals arrested in Plainfield, N. J., for keeping open store on Sunday—a man named Huff—has been tried and found guilty of this "crime." We have not yet heard what sentence was pronounced by the court.

As showing the religious character of the Sunday law, the following account of the trial, taken from the Plainfield Courier-News, of April 16, is of interest:—

"Two more of the Sunday-selling cases were tried yesterday afternoon in the City Court, and these two finish the test. All the eleven who were arrested on March 20, for violating the ordinance, have now been disposed of. The two tried yesterday were Fred Huff and Morris Kodenski. Huff was found guilty and sentence was deferred for one week. Kodenski, who is a Russian Jew, and keeps a store at 836 South Second Street, proved to the court conclusively that he kept Saturday for religious reasons, and Counsellor Craig A. Marsh promptly moved to have the case dismissed, and Kodenski was discharged.

"The city's witnesses were Roundsman Flynn and Patrolman McCarthy, who told how they went to Huff's stand at the end of the trolley line on Sunday, March 20, and purchased a package of tobacco and one cigar. Huff admitted the sale, but claimed that he had a right to keep open on Sunday as he was a 'Seventh-day.' When asked how long he had observed it, Huff said that upon reading the Bible and studying it he had come to the conclusion that Saturday was the true Sabbath, and consequently began to observe it early last September. When asked if he intended to unite with the Seventh-day Baptist Church, his answer was that he hadn't made up his mind yet.

"Another line of defense was that he made a specialty of lunches and sold cigars and candy only when he had to. Another point Huff made was that his waiting-room was a convenience to the church going public. Huff had two witnesses who testified that he kept Saturday as the Sabbath. One of them, Mr. Weber, knew that Huff came around dressed up on Saturday, and on being told that Huff had turned 'Seventh-day,' believed it. When asked what churches he attended on Saturday, Huff refused to say, although he afterwards admitted that he went to the Catholic and Presbyterian churches."

It is clear from this fact that Mr. Huff was prosecuted because he was not sufficiently religious; and a law under which a man is condemned on religious grounds cannot be other than a religious law, which has no proper place in the machinery of civil government.
