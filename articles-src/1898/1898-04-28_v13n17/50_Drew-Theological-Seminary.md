DREW THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY, in Madison, N.J., is threatened with the necessity of closing up because nearly all the theological students want to go to the war to fight. A secular journal makes note of the fact with the appropriate remark that the tender of their services constitutes "what is perhaps the most unique offer that Uncle Sam has yet received."
