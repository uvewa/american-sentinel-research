AN Episcopal church in Detroit, says the New York Sun, gave this notice in an inscription nailed over its door, the evening of the 20th:

"This church will be open for prayers until Spain answers."

The pastor and a number of the more devoted of his congregation, says the Sun, "assembled in the church at an early hour this morning, and throughout the day [April 21], at intervals of one hour, they besought the Almighty to avert war. The almost continuous service will continue to-morrow; but now that a conflict is inevitable, their invocations will be in behalf of the Michigan troops and the honor of the country. Other churches expect to begin similar services."

Of course, to pray in behalf of the troops sent to the war, and for the "honor of the country," is to pray that the troops may do some good fighting; since the better fighting they do, and the more of the enemy's ships and cities are sunk and captured, the more "honor" will there be in it for the victorious party. First, then the church prays that there may be no fighting; but that prayer not being answered, it turns and prays that there may be real hot fighting, such as the "honor" of the troops and of the country requires. Just where the consistency is in such procedure is not clear to us.
