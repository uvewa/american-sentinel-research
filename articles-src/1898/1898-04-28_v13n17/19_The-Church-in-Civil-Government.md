It is a notable and very noticeable fact that the church, to-day, in this country, has become an ardent participant in the affairs of civil government.

It is no exaggeration to say that the church, as represented by the clergy, is abreast—if not in advance—of even the political parties in point of zeal to discuss and enact resolutions relating to affairs of a purely political character.

An illustration of this was given in the national campaign of '96. It is a well-known fact that the most powerful and the most radical oratory called forth by that campaign, was heard in the pulpit.

And now that the nation is on the brink of war with Spain, the church again assumes the lead in the discussions which relate to the proper attitude of the civil government. The most radical action that has been proposed is that which has been called for by the church. This is true of at least one church—that of the Rev. Thos. Dixon, in New York City—whose congregation on Sunday last, the 17th, passed a resolution calling upon the Government to make war upon Spain by the 20th inst. at the very latest!

The church speaks in a manner which assumes an actual identity with the civil government. As an illustration of this fact, some points in the indictment against Spain, drawn up by the Methodist Conference lately in session in this city, are worthy of note. For example:

"2. Its insolence in searching our merchantmen on the high seas and repudiation of claims for restitution.

"3. Its cowardly insult to our honored President by its representative at our nation's capital.

"4. Its trivial treatment of international diplomatic relations," etc.

There are ten counts in the indictment, some civil and some religious in character. Examples of the latter are furnished by the 8th, 9th, and 10th specifications, thus:—

"8. Its sacrilegious pretense of claiming to be a Christian nation.

"9. Its prostitution of the moral sense of our citizens, by obliging them for years to look upon and become familiar with fiendish barbarism," etc.

"10. Its paralyzing power upon the Christian civilization of the country," etc.

Of this religio-political manifesto the *Independent* (N. Y.) says:—

"We deprecate the inflammable resolutions of the New York Methodist Conference as designed to arouse the fiercer passions, and especially their appeal to intense religious prejudice. A war with Spain is enough; we do not want any religious question mixed with it."

But a "religious question" is just what will be mixed with every important act of governmental procedure, when governmental action is dictated and controlled by the church. And as the church is intruding herself more and more into politics, and taking upon herself more and more the responsibilities of the civil government, there is nothing else to be expected in the future of this nation than that civil and political questions will be mixed more and more in matters with which the Government has to do. And it may be set down as certain that when the church takes up one of these great political questions for settlement, there will be "inflammable resolutions," "designed to arouse the fiercer passions," as in the present instance, and as it was in the fierce campaign of '96.

And it will be very strange if during the present national crisis, or in the events that result from it, the church does not find some occasion for taking further steps toward the attainment of that position of virtual control and dictatorship in national affairs to which she evidently aspires.

CHRISTIAN principles are especially adapted in this world to the needs of the minority.
