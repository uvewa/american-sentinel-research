The man who assumes to be the earthly head of Christendom, and who recognizes Spain and the United States as being Christian nations, has failed to prevent these same nations from fighting each other. He has the choice, now, therefore, of admitting either that he is not the head of Christendom, or that one or the other of these nations is not Christian. He is logically bound to do one of these two things.
