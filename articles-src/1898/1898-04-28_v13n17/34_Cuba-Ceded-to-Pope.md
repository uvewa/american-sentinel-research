As a last resort to avert hostilities with the United States, it was proposed to Spain that she cede the island of Cuba to the pope, who, it was said, would then declare its independence. But if, in such a case the pope should choose to declare Cuba subject to the papacy, the administration of the "government" to be still in the hands of Spain—as the ally of the papacy—the Government of the United States would be placed in an awkward predicament, since it would be obliged to make war on the papacy, or recede from its demands respecting Cuba. And there is not a government on earth that would think for a moment of declaring war on the papacy. Such a step on the part of any government would be the signal for civil war at home, between the adherents of the papacy and other citizens,—an event which no government could afford to encounter.
