A CORRESPONDENT who is a staunch friend of religious liberty takes exception to the application made in a recent SENTINEL of the prophecy of Isaiah 60. He thinks that if it is true that this prophecy applies to the church of Christ, the position of National Reform advocates must be correct. We believe it will only be necessary in reply to remind him that the fundamental feature of the National Reform program is the coercion of worldly people to the observances of religion by incorporating the latter in the "fundamental law of the land"; while the prophecy in question presents the Gentiles as being drawn to the church because of the bright light which she reflects from the glory of God. There is no hint of coercion in it. It is the gospel principle that is set forth of drawing men from the world through the manifestation of the power and glory—which is the goodness—of God. National Reform coerces people, Christianity wins them. Here is the vital distinction between the two.
