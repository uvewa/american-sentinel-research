"The Examiner," New York City.

The attempt of Pope Leo XIII. to thrust himself into the controversy between Spain and the United States, at this late day, is a forcible reminder of the fact that he has been a passive spectator of the frightful atrocities perpetrated by loyal sons of the Roman Church upon their helpless co-religionists during the past two years.

This crime of the centuries has met no rebuke from him. Hundreds of thousands of his own flock have been doomed to a lingering death by starvation, but no voice has thundered from the Vatican in denunciation of the villainy. But now that Catholic Spain is in peril, now that her wicked rule in Cuba is threatened, now that the interests of the church are likely to suffer loss through the losses of Spain, "His Holiness" is all anxiety and zeal.

We do not mean to be uncharitable; but we cannot but regard this sudden activity of the pope, so strongly in contrast with the indifference he has displayed toward the sufferings of the oppressed Cubans, as the result of anxiety for Spain and the Catholic Church rather than of desire for peace.

He cannot plead ignorance of the condition of affairs in Cuba. All the world knew of Weyler's edict and what it meant, and an official inquiry of the papal representatives in the island would have put him in possession of the facts. But he made no sign, and the infamy went on. The pope's eleventh-hour attempt to stay the punishment of the crime comes too late. He might have interposed to stop the Spanish atrocity with a good grace; his effort to save Spain from the consequences of her evil conduct is an impertinence.
