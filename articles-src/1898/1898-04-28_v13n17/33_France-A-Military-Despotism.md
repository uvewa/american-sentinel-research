"The possibility of a republic in name, with scarcely a vestige of the substance of republican institutions, now presented by France," says the New York Christian Advocate, "should be a solemn warning to the United States jealously to watch all modifications that may take away the real liberties of the people enjoyed in the earlier days of the republic." France is a military despotism; and so likewise is Germany, Russia, and every other country where the war spirit has had full opportunity for development. The great armies "protect" the country against neighboring nations, but what is most wanted is something to protect the people from the terrible oppressions which the maintenance of the great armies forces upon them.
