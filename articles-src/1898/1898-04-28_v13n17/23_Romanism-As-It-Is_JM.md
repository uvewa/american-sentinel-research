It may be asked, How is it that the Protestants are so easily deceived by the Roman Catholic astuteness? The answer is simple. First—Because the majority of Protestants have abandoned the use of the weapons stored in the celestial armory, the only legitimate arms allowed by God to bring people to the knowledge of the glorious gospel truth; and have resorted to methods of Roman origin, employed by them in the Middle Ages; viz., prison, force, and human laws, to make people Christians; thus acknowledging that their preaching is ineffectual and powerless to uplift fallen man. Thus immediately that Protestantism stoops to such means to convert people from the error of their ways, she becomes papal in everything but the name. Second—Protestants are deceived by the hypocritical workings of the mystery of iniquity.

In the United States there exists no nominal connection between the church and state; there Catholic prelates pose as the fathers of religious liberty; and by rhetorical dissertations and discourses upon the tolerant spirit of the "mother" church; and their denial of the massacres, dark crimes, inquisitorial dramas and persecutions, ascribed to them, they throw dust into the eyes of the "liberal" Protestants, who are as anxious as the Catholics, to narrow the breach which has hitherto separated them. But would the Protestant carefully study the pages of history, in an impartial manner, he will find that the terrible crimes committed by Rome, in the name of religion, have been glossed over and underrated by historians, and not exaggerated as Catholics would have us believe. And yet in the face of these historical facts, Protestants will allow themselves to be duped by papish falsehoods; forgetting that one of the principal doctrines of Rome is, The end justifies the means.

But why look back so far? for we see incidents transpiring daily which clearly demonstrate the intolerant spirit that saturates the entire Catholic system. In the United States and England, both of which are Protestant countries, the papacy continually clamors for a fair field, and no favor, and they aver if this is conceded they are contented; and at the same time they pretend to allow these same advantages to all comers. But for the present we shall cite but one case of many, to prove the fallacy of such action.

About three years ago the Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, Ireland, made a tour to Spain to consecrate the first Spanish Protestant bishop, and to dedicate the first Protestant church in the city of Madrid. Scarcely had it become publicly known, when a great uproar was raised, and the Catholic Archbishop of Madrid breathed forth threatenings against those Protestant intruders, and immediately appealed to the legislative assemblies to invalidate the Protestant bishop's consecration; and to prohibit the continuance of dissenter's worship in the former headquarters of the Iberian inquisition. And although he was unable to fully execute his malevolent designs, he eventually succeeded in having a statute passed to prohibit the Protestants from building an entrance to their church on the main street, so they have to be content with a small entrance to their house of worship, on a narrow side street.

Now if the Catholic Church is content with a fair field and no favor, why did their ecclesiastical primate in Spain protest against the free worship of the Anglicans in Madrid? Simply because in Spain Rome has the majority, and there you see her in her true colors.

May the Sun of Righteousness so illuminate the minds of Protestants of all lands, that they may discern the danger of compromising in any degree whatever with Rome, since such a course would eventually carry them down the stream of error, over the rapids of delusion, finally to be cast into the boiling waters of eternal destruction. "Awake, thou that sleepest, arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light."
