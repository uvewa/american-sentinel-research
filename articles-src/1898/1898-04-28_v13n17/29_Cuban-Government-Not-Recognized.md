The Government has issued a proclamation declaring that the people of Cuba are and of right ought to be, free and independent, but refusing to recognize the Cuban Insurgent government. But the Insurgent government is the only government on the island that stands for freedom and independence from Spanish rule. All those in Cuba which do not adhere to the Insurgent cause proclaim by that fact that they do not want to be independent. Hence the Government has undertaken the task of making free and independent a people who do not want to be free, but are satisfied to let the government remain as it was. How it will succeed in this rather curious enterprise, remains to be seen. But in any event, the resulting government can hardly fail to be an improvement over Spanish rule.
