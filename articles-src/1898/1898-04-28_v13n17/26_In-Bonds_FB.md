"Unto the furtherance of the gospel." Phil. 1:12.

HAST heard the great apostle speak
Of bonds? Hast heard? Hast heard?
Art thou in bonds sad, tempted, weak,
And hast thou understood the word,—
How for the furtherance of God's grace
It happened by His ministry?
And art thou sighing in thy place,
When God will work the same for thee?

Look at the great apostle's face
Glorious as Stephen's, yet how wan!
Standing a king with royal grace
To preach to kings as man to man.
And yet if bonds had not been his,
No king had heard his message given.
Would he be free and fail of this?
Bound so of earth, freed so of heaven!

So God's beloved, where thou art,
Bound with temptation, sorrow, grief.
Lay thou no charge against God's heart.
Let faith reach up for love's relief.
And thou, for learning trust, shalt know
A secret that hath fragrant wings
For furtherance of the gospel. So
Thy gift shall stand thy feet with kings.

And when thou seest heaven come down,
And earth with ministering angels stirred,
When tears fall 'neath a monarch's crown
As he sits trembling at God's word,
When slaves about his throne are freed
To live or die for Christ through thee,
Thy bond-chains shall be light indeed
For such rewarded ministry.
