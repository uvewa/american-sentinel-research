A STATE of war now exists between the United States and the government of Spain. And as Spain is allied with the papacy, there being in Spain a close union of church and state, the American government is virtually at war with the papacy. We would suggest therefore to those whom it may concern, that the occasion be improved by repudiating papal institutions and ideas which have fastened themselves upon any branch of the national or state governments; such, for example, as laws for the enforcement of Sunday observance. The papal origin of such laws is unquestioned; and being of papal descent, there can be no question as to their un-American character.
