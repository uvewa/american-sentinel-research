A prominent member of the Canadian Parliament, the Hon. John Charlton, recently introduced a bill prohibiting American Sunday newspapers from coming into Canada, and any paper from being published in Canada on Sunday. The measure was vigorously discussed in the Canadian House, and was finally defeated by a vote of 43 to 60.
