"As to [Sunday] amusements, it seems to me that the less we depend upon legislation and the more upon education and the pressure of public opinion to keep the day from degenerating into one of mere self-indulgence, the better. It is putting Christianity in a false and ignoble position to even make it appear that her power and indeed her very existence are involved in a law-protected Sunday."—Rev. Hugh Pedley.
