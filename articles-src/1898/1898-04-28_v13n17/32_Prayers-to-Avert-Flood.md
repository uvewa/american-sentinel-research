A forcible comment on the supposed antagonism between civilization and superstition, is the following, which appeared in a recent issue of the *Cincinnati Enquirer*:—

"Owing to the rapid rising of the Ohio River, the most reverend archbishop directs, that in order to avert the hardships and sufferings caused by a flood as well as other tribulations, the priests recite in mass, for three months, the collect Pro quacumque necessitate, and after mass, one Our Father and Hail Mary.

"After the expiration of the three months they will say for three days in mass the prayer Pro Gratiarum Actione, and after mass one Our Father and Hail Mary.

"By order of the Archbishop.

"HENRY MOELLER,
"Chancellor."

The only sure cure for superstition is faith.
