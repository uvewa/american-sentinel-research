"Scores of protests against the Sunday work at the Brooklyn Navy Yard," says a New York daily, "have been received from ministers and other persons by Rear-Admiral Bunce, commandant of the yard. . . . Admiral Bunce has referred the objectors to the Secretary of the Navy. Most of them take the ground that by being fitted out on Sunday, disaster is sure to overtake these vessels."

It is all right to fight, say these same clergymen,—all right to kill people with the guns of these ships of war, and destroy cities and other property; all right to entail the misery and ruin which must come from war; the protest is not against this; it is against work being done on Sunday. If work were not done on Sunday, God would favor them in their mission of death and destruction; for God does not care how many people are killed and how many others are plunged into misery and ruin; what he is particular about is that there shall be no work done on Sunday. And since his will is not observed in this, he will bring disaster upon the ships of war, which means triumph to the enemy. God would rather the government of Spain in Cuba—with all its horrors—should continue than that American ships of war should be fitted out on Sunday. All this is said, in effect, in these protests against Sunday work. Evidently it would be difficult to name anything which, in the view of this class of persons, would be worse than the desecration of Sunday.
