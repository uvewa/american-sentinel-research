"Of course it is the pope's duty," says the Independent, "to do what he could to prevent war. Those people have little sense of Christian duty who find fault with him, or call it interference." Was it his "Christian duty" to try to prevent the starving to death by Spain of several hundred thousand Cuban women and children? If he had done his "Christian duty" in that, his actions might with some reason not be regarded as "interference" now.
