"I think," said Charlie White to his mother, when he reached home that night, "that Professor Carman's talks on French history are more and more interesting. It makes me very anxious to go with father next summer, and visit some of these places I have heard about so much; and I think Rob is as anxious as I am. I tell you, mother, we're studying hard, and I think we'll pass examination pretty well. Don't you think so?"

"I hope so, Charlie; but I trust you will not forget that you are building character all this time. I do not want you to study solely for the purpose of 'passing,' but because it will the better fit you for usefulness in the world."

The next Tuesday afternoon found the little class assembled in the professor's room, eager to hear about the battle of Calais.

"Who can tell me where the city of Calais is situated?" asked the teacher. "Edn, you may please locate it on the map."

"I suppose it's somewhere in France," said Edna, taking the pointer, and stepping up to the map, "but I don't see it just now."

"You are looking too far south, Edna," volunteered Rob Billings, "it's away up there on the northern coast, —that's right,—there it is, just across from England."

"You see, we are not done with Edward the Third, yet," began the teacher, "or, rather, he is not done with France. So he next goes over to Calais and lays siege to it. This siege lasted for more than a year. The town was strongly fortified, and so he determined to starve the wretched inhabitants until they would yield."

"Couldn't King Philip have reached them with supplies by sea?" asked Joe Palmeter.

"No; for Edward had the coast so securely guarded by his own ships, that no help could reach the miserable people from that quarter."

"Did Philip make any effort to save them at all?" asked Milly Brown.

"Yes; but when he came near enough to see how strong the English were, he became faint hearted, and went away, taking his army with him. So the joy and gladness of the poor people, caused by a sight of the king coming, as they thought, to help them, was short lived. They became at last so reduced for eatables, that every stray rat had been eagerly devoured, and the starving people were even forced to chew and swallow their boots and shoes. At last Calais was forced to surrender."

"I am thinking if this is not the time when those six noble men came from the city and stood before Edward, with halters around their necks, and whom the queen saved by her pleading," said Harry Ray.

"Yes, it was at Calais, Harry, that this occurred; but this belongs more properly to English history. But we are made glad to know that in those selfish and troublous times so kind-hearted a woman lived as Queen Philippa, of England.

"King Philip spent much time in massing together large armies. But he did not need to do this, as they were of little use. He might much better have spent his time more profitably. His poor people were in the meantime taxed most cruelly to support the useless armies."

"Speaking of taxes," said Joe Palmeter, "I have read about the 'Gabelle Tax.' What was that, if you please, professor?"

"It was an unjust tax on salt, and was forced upon the miserable inhabitants during this time. Then, as if the poor people had not suffered enough already, the cruel king began the debasing of the coin. After awhile, no one could be certain of the value of any money which he held, and it almost drove the unhappy people to distraction. It became almost impossible to do any business at all; and instead of the gay city of Paris, which was the envy of kings, at the beginning of Philip's reign, it is said that grass now grew in its streets. Of course the track of the English army was one of ruin and desolation, and the poor country of France no longer happy and flourishing, seemed blasted and withered with desolation.

"As if to add to the horrors of the time, a dreadful pestilence broke out, called the Black Death."

"Well, I should suppose this would put a stop to the fighting, at least," said Jennie Jacobs.

"It did, indeed. The people had enough to do now, without fighting. But, again, the voice of superstition and bigotry makes itself heard, and the miserable Jews are again the objects of attack. The frenzied Frenchmen accuse them again of poisoning the wells."

"What object could it have been for them to do that?" asked Charlie White, indignantly.

"None whatever, Charlie; but prejudice is blind and unreasoning, and never stops to ask if this or that is right or just. So, many thousands of the poor unfortunate wretches were cast into the flames without mercy."

"I wonder if the Jews who suffered so much at the hands of so called Christians, ever remembered the awful words of their fathers: 'His blood be upon us, and upon our children,'" said Julia March.

"I dare say they did not. But still, even though they did the dreadful deed of crucifying their Lord, do you think that sinful men have any right to take it upon themselves to punish their descendants?"

"No, indeed, professor; they have none whatever," said Joe Palmeter, stoutly.

"No; for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord,'" exclaimed Professor Carman, earnestly, as he dismissed the class.
