At a recent address in the city of Evanston, Ill., Evangelist Moody spoke the following as his convictions regarding the difference between "Christian civilization" and Christianity:—

"Would we welcome Jesus to-day in America? People think the world is better than it used to be. But, do you know, if it could be put to a vote that Jesus Christ should come and reign as King upon earth, do you believe he'd carry a state in the United States? Do you believe he'd carry a county in this State? Do you believe he'd carry even a ward in this city? I don't believe he would.

"We're strong in churches, but when it comes to accepting Christ himself it would be different. Would the societies want him—the Odd Fellows or the Free Masons? Would the Republican party want him? They would vote for the greatest blackguard on earth, sooner. The Democratic party? They would go almost solid against him. Ah, but you say, the Prohibition party would want him. I guess not. Some of you are shaking your heads at that. Well, shake 'em! I'm talking facts.

"I'll come a little nearer home. Even the churches wouldn't want him to come, some of 'em. It would spoil some of 'em. There isn't a nation in all the so called Christian nations that would elect him. But I tell you we won't have peace on earth until he does come. The earth looks dark, now. It's going to be darker just before dawn."
