"Some dangers of a sea fight." are described in *The Independent* (N. Y.), of April 21, by Mr. Park Benjamin. We quote one paragraph:

"In our last war the forts at Mobile and New Orleans used grape and canister shot with much effect against our attacking fleets; but this was at very close range. At long range, shell and the flying splinters of wooden vessels were the principal agents of wholesale destruction. But now the huge shells will begin to come on board from the high-power guns when the contending vessels are nearly three miles apart. The largest guns, twelve and thirteen-inch caliber, can be loaded and fired almost once every three minutes. At a little less than two miles' distance the five and six-inch rapid fire guns will begin to pour in their projectiles, and these weapons can be loaded and fired at the rate of from seven to fifteen aimed shots per minute. Then come the six-pounder guns, delivering forty shots per minute, the one-pounders, throwing a shot per minute, the machine one-pounders (Maxim Nordenfeldt), two hundred shots per minute, and so on up to the Gatlings, fed automatically by electric motors and projecting bullets at the rate of 3,000 per minute. A man might brave a storm of grape and bullets with a chance of escape; but the battle of the Yalu River showed that under the quick fire hail of the Japanese ships the slaughter on the Chinese ships was so frightful that the Chinese with all their stolid contempt for death could hardly be kept at their posts. So fierce was the storm of steel around the attacked vessels that the sea was literally lashed into foam by it."

All of which only shows that General Sherman's remark—"War is hell"—will be even more true to day, if possible, than it was when he uttered it.

War is but the application of force to settle a dispute in which each of the contending parties claims to be in the right. It is upon the theory, therefore, that "might makes right." But Christianity recognizes no such theory as that.
