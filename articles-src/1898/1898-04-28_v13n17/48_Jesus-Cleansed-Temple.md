The only thing that Jesus Christ ever did in the way of using force among men was to take a "whip of small cords" and cleanse the temple of God. He used force—or its equivalent—to drive worldly men out of the temple of God; but to-day his professed representatives want to use force to drive worldly men into that temple.
