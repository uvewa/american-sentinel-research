The indictment of Spain, drawn up by the New York Methodist Conference, sets forth that "humanity, honesty, virtue, reason, liberty, civilization, and Christianity demand the expulsion of this last consummate specimen of the criminal cruelties of a Latin civilization from the island, whose shores are touched by the same ideas that wash the coasts of this Republic."

It may be well that Spain should withdraw from the shores of the Western Hemisphere, but her departure will be to very little purpose if her ideas are left behind. The principles of Spanish government are vastly more dangerous to America than are the Spanish fleet and army.

We wish the New York Methodist Conference would manifest a little more hostility to these principles; for instance, to the union of church and state. This represents, most of all, the "criminal cruelties of Latin civilization." And we would remind them that the union of church and state had its beginning in the enactment of Sunday laws, under the Emperor Constantine. It was the emperor of Rome—the same Rome that is now fast joined with the government of Spain—who enacted the first law for Sunday observance, and it is through Latin civilization that such laws have come down to us and have found a lodgment among the institutions of a civilization that claims to stand for liberty and progress.

In getting rid of Latin civilization, let us by all means recognize religious legislation as a prominent feature of that civilization, and expel it from the ideas which "wash the coasts of this Republic."

THESE are days when "patriotism" covers a multitude of sins.
