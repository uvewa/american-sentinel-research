The question of a Roman Catholic chapel at West Point has again cropped out in governmental affairs, and it is stated that a bill providing for the erection of such a building has been favorably reported to Congress by the Committee on Military Affairs. The papacy is nothing if not persistent, and her machinations require the exercise of "eternal vigilance."
