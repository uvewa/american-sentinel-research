The Washington correspondent of the *Chicago Times-Herald*, in speaking of the efforts of certain ones to make political capital out of the war question, says:—

"It is not believed the American Congress has sunk so low that it is going to convert a high Christian task into a mere political trick."

What "high Christian task" it is that the American Congress has on hand, this writer does not tell. The article in which the sentence is used is altogether devoted to the war situation over Cuba and the "Maine." Congress has no Christian task to perform at all, and never can have. It is neither a Christian body nor a body of Christians.

This sentence is a striking illustration of the utter confusion of thought that obtains with respect to what is a Christian, and what a Christian task would be.
