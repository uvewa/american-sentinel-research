I would ask my readers to try to comprehend the situation in which the Christian mothers of this nation found themselves when they realized that the petitions which they had presented to governing bodies all over the land had been rejected. Realize if you can the labor which the canvassing for names to both pledges and petitions had entailed; the weariness of the "crusading" which had preceded both; the confidence that had been disappointed in every case; the hopes upon which life itself seemed to hang which had been killed in their hearts.

These experiences had also been a constant education in things that filled us with amazement and alarm. It seemed that nothing but ruin awaited us and our children, and no one can wonder that we began to question as never before.

When the victorious saloon-keeper and subsidized press began to say to us, "Where is now your God?" for a time we could only echo in our hearts with an awful sense of despair, "Where is now our God?"

In this story as we have told it, we have come up to about April and May of '74, and it is safe to say that for three or four weeks of that time there was more of questioning and less of the ordinary form of prayer by the women of this nation than had ever been known before. We met as usual in the places of worship; we went into our chambers with our Bibles, read and knelt as had been the life long habit, but instead of praise and petition, there was dumb, yearning, heart-breaking waiting and listening for some voice to drop down through the darkness into our silent anguish, and give us hope, and the power to, spiritually, live on. It was not long that we had to wait. When we had become still enough,—when we had come to realize that vain is the help of man,—there came to some of us what we could but recognize as a revelation from God, in the light of which we saw that this great evil had its root in ignorance, and could only be killed by a process of crowding in the knowledge of the truth.

The man who sold the drinks; the one whose money was invested in the saloon; the politician who used it for his own selfish promotion to place and power; the poor victim who fed it with his own body and soul, his home, his wife and children; all were in it through ignorance and unbelief. If they could come to know God and his truth as we women knew him, they could never stay as they were; the bartender must stop filling glasses and fly from his business; the brewer and distiller must cease to manufacture; the capitalist to invest his money in it; the aspirant for public honors must become afraid of power and position obtained by such means; and the victim who had become reckless because he was hopeless, must see that there was deliverance for him from the bondage of appetite.

It was plain that we could not at once close up the saloons. We had before us a life-long educational process in principles and truths; we must more thoroughly organize for the purpose of as rapid work as possible, for the need was great enough to excuse the most urgent haste; but the task was so delicate in its nature that haste would be fatal. It was the King's business, and required haste according to the King's calendar; but it was also husbandry of a sort that could not bring a harvest in a day.

At first our hearts had been filled with indignation at the sorrows inflicted upon the women and little children because of the drunken men with whom they had to live; but we had come later on to see that the drunkard was himself a sufferer second to none. His was the agony of a soul who could but feel and see his own degradation and that to which he was dragging his loved ones, and was yet powerless to save himself or them, and we were aroused to the profoundest pity for him, and to most earnest consideration of methods for his deliverance.

Out of the efforts to bring all of these various classes of men to see the truth as God had revealed it to us in his Word, and to inspire the despairing with a hope of salvation, there was organized the Evangelistic Department of the W. C. T. U.

The "gospel meeting" came to be a regular institution wherever there was a Union, and women who had never before been able to do anything more public than to teach a Sunday school class, led these meetings, giving the plain gospel message that Christ came to save sinners, of any and all classes; that drunkards, saloon keepers, capitalists, and politicians could never be any worse than sinners, and that therefore the invitation "Whosoever will, may come," was to them.

In those days were fulfilled in a remarkable manner the words of Christ when he bade his disciples to go to the lost sheep, into the highways and hedges and "as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand." Our women with their Bibles in their hands went from morning until night, for weeks and months and years (many are still going), into all haunts, of vice and poverty, looking after those who were considered lost; holding daily meetings in all manner of places, railway stations, prisons, cottages, churches, and in market places, wherever they could find a listening ear, preaching Christ and his uttermost salvation.
