It is generally known that in Spain there is a union of religion with the state. The particulars of this union, however, are not so well understood, and we present a few of them as given by a journal of this city:—

"The constitution of Spain says: 'This nation binds itself to maintain the worship and ministers of the Roman Catholic religion.' Of the 17,565,600 inhabitants, in 1887, 17,535,300 were Catholics. Public notice of any other worship than that of the Roman Church is prohibited by law. 'Spain has 65 cathedrals, 30 religious colleges, 18,564 churches, 161 monasteries, 1684 monks, 1,027 convents, 14,592 nuns, 11,202 sanctuaries and other religious houses not churches, and 32,435 priests.' The people know nothing but their catechism. A recruit must pass a religious examination before he can enter the army or navy, and the same is true of a candidate for any public office. The priests are active politicians, and ecclesiastics sit in the national parliament by virtue of their sacerdotal office. The prison doors are ready to fly open to any Spaniard who 'insults' the Catholic Church, and now, as in the days of Philip II., there is no place in Spain for a heretic."

All this reveals the internal rottenness that has made the once vast and mighty empire of Spain weak before the power of nations which, while vastly inferior in size, have embodied the virile principles of civil and religious freedom.
