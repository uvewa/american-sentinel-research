"The Waning of Evangelicalism," is the title of a seriously-written article in a recent issue of the London Contemporary Review, from the pen of an English writer, Mr. Richard Heath.

That the decay of evangelical enthusiasm in English-speaking lands is a plainly-apparent fact, is evident not alone from this article but from comments made upon it by the New York Sun. In summing up the situation the Sun says:—

"In the English Church the Evangelical party distinctively has almost ceased to exist, and the same is true of the Episcopal Church in this country, though at one time it included a great part of the pulpit eloquence of both. The Low Church school, once powerful, if not dominant, has passed away, and there remains only the two parties, the Broad Church, or liberal, and the 'Catholic,' or ritualistic, closely approaching the Roman Church in its devotion to church authority and sacerdotalism. The Congregational churches departed long ago from earnest sympathy with the Evangelical movement, and consequently the Unitarian rebellion, once active, is now quiescent.

"It is a receding movement, for Unitarians are finding that Evangelical orthodoxy itself has thrown down most of the barriers separating it from them. They are no longer fighting against it, for there is nothing of importance left to fight against. Presbyterianism, a very citadel of Evangelicalism, is surrendering the stronghold to its skeptical enemies. Some of its most prominent theologians are rejecting the infallibility of the Bible, and thus leaving it no ground on which to stand. A critical instead of a believing spirit prevails, and the latitude of Broad Church Episcopalians is attracting many of the laity. Defense of the Bible as the only rule of faith and opposition to the pope as the antichrist and to the church of Rome as the sum of all abominations have been succeeded by Presbyterian laudation of a Roman Catholic archbishop at a recent celebration, and sympathetic treatment of the church of Rome as one of the greatest and most valuable of Christian agencies.

"The Contemporary Review writer undertakes to discover various remote causes of the 'waning of Evangelicalism,' but there is no need of going further or deeper than this waning of earnest religious belief. The vital warmth of faith is passing out of it. It has become skeptical, or at least a spirit of skepticism has entered into its theological seminaries and thence spread widely through its pulpits. The Baptists and Methodists, especially bred or stimulated by the Evangelical movement, are less affected, perhaps are little affected as yet by this destructive spirit of criticism; but it is devitalizing the Presbyterian Church. How could it be otherwise when this new movement, now so powerful in Presbyterianism, is directed against the very foundation of its faith and whole system of theology?

"That is enough to account for the 'waning' of which the Contemporary Review treats. What can remain of Evangelicalism if the source from which lone it draws its inspiration is degraded by its own appointed defenders into a polluted stream of superstition, delusion, fraud, and ignorance, having its springs in the groping of mere human intelligence incapable of penetrating the mystery of life?

"Without an infallible Bible, sent as a revelation direct from God, Evangelicalism must necessarily wane and die."

We have an "infallible Bible, sent as a direct revelation from God;" that much is secure. That is as real now as it was in the days when evangelical enthusiasm was at its height. But that infallible Book contains the query, "When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?" Faith is dying out, and we are in the days when "the Son of man cometh."
