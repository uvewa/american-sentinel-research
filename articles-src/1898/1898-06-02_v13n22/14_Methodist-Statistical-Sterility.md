METHODIST journals and some others have of late been discussing the question of the cause of Methodist "statistical sterility," shown by the last denominational census, which reports an addition of only about 19,000 members to the denomination during 1897. The Rocky Mountain Christian Advocate gives this explanation, which is worthy of note:—

"Full many a time the devotional meeting of the chapter closes with tear wet cheeks, and the uplifted hand or voice of penitence and desire for a saving knowledge of Christ; and the leaguers coming from the inner sanctuary of the mercy seat pour into the evening services only to hear a discussion of social science, or local politics, or an adjudication of science, or a manifestation of temper on this or that. The stricken lad hearing this kind of thing, crying in his soul, 'Sirs, I would see Jesus,' and hearing not, 'Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world,' but —— goes out into the darkness, after the service is over. 'And it was night.'"

While this may not fully explain the statistical loss in a church of the size and popularity of the Methodist body, it does present a sufficient reason for the failure so far as concerns those whose desire is to see Jesus, rather than to engage in the various church schemes for cleansing politics and reforming society.

The Christian Citizen says that this is a "strange explanation;" and so it is from the "Christian citizenship" standpoint. That is a political standpoint, and not one from which an individual can "see Jesus;" for the Saviour of men was never in politics, and from this it is perfectly plain that there is nothing in politics that can save mankind.
