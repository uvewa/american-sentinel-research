It is not always safe in this world to be on the side of the majority.

It was not safe in Noah's time, or in Abraham's time, or in Elijah's time. There is no evidence that it was safe in anybody's time. The Word of God expressly cautions the Christian that he shall "not follow a multitude to do evil."

The history of the cause of truth and righteousness is but a history of the minority who have stood for God against the spirit and will of the majority. It presents many a picture in which an individual stands alone against a multitude.

Christianity does not rest upon the decisions of majorities. It cannot recognize their authority in religious things.

The last view, prophetically given, of the majority, in the history of human events, is an interesting one. It is given in the 20th chapter of Revelation. The prophetic description is:—

"And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison; and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."

In the beginning the majority were destroyed by a flood of water; and in the end they are found overwhelmed in a flood of fire.

There should be in this sufficient warning to Christians against building their hopes upon what may be done in this world by the majority.
