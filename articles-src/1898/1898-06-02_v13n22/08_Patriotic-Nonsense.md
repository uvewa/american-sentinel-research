A Baptist minister in the West, Rev. Stephen Northrop, is quoted in the Kansas City Journal as having said in a recent sermon that "the men who have achieved glory on fields of battle have all been followers of the Master." When clergymen indulge in such "patriotic" nonsense they invite people to believe that the doctrines of the religion which they profess are only about as near the truth as the idea that Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Napoleon, were all faithful Christians.
