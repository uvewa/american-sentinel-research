**EDITOR SENTINEL:** When the news of Admiral Dewey's victory at Manila reached this country an officer of Commodore Schley's Flying Squadron stated, so it was reported in one of the New York papers, that he would willingly have given his right arm for the privilege of being in that battle. The reason assigned was that he had been educated for that kind of work, and he wanted an opportunity to put his knowledge into practice; and, it is to be presumed, show how well he had learned his art.

This is natural enough. What is an education for if it is not to put the knowledge acquired to the use for which it was intended? This man has been taught how to kill men in the most scientific manner, and it seems to him that without the chance to do this work his life is a failure, and his time wasted.

Never before, in this country, was the spirit of militarism so prevalent as it is now. It is everywhere. Even the school children, boys and girls, in some places are being taught the use of weapons of war.

Who cannot see that the same desire to kill men will be the logical outcome of this, as in the case of the naval officer referred to above.

The chances are quite good that opportunities for this kind of work will not be lacking from now on. The war spirit has taken hold of Americans. It will not easily let go.

It is plainly seen at home and abroad, that the military and naval strength of this country must be increased so as to make this nation second to none in the whole world. We see the beginning; who will see the end, and what will it be?
