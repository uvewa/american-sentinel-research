*"Oswego Daily Times," May 6.*

The queen of Spain has asked the pope to pray for the success of the Spanish arms, and from a thousand pulpits in America invocations have gone up to heaven for Spanish defeat. At a recent church conference, in particular, the delegates fairly shouted for war against "Catholic Spain."

What is a perplexed Providence to do—assuming that Providence hearkens to all the prayers of the faithful?

What is the real "Christian spirit" in such a case as the present? Shall we, in view of last Sunday's victory at Manila, sing a new doxology, as suggested by a flippant New Yorker?

> "Four hundred Spaniards gone below,
> Praise God from whom all blessings flow."

It is a hard question, nor does it seem to grow easier however fast the advance of civilization (with a big C). After all, are we a whit better than our savage forbears? A year—two years—ago, we were talking as if the day of battles and bloodshed had passed, to make way for the new era of arbitration. Who talks of arbitration now? If anyone, his voice is lost in the clamor for the latest news from the fleet, raised in the blood-thirsty hope that the remnant of the Spaniards may all have gone to Davy Jones' locker.
