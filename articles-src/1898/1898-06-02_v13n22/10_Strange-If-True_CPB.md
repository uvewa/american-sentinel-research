"It may be regarded as a strange fact," said the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, of March 12, "that at a time when the sentiment of the civilized world is the strongest in opposition to war, and the implements of warfare are most destructive, nearly every nation in existence is making greater preparation for the exigencies of war than ever before."

But is it true that at the present time "the sentiment of the civilized world is the strongest in opposition to war"? Have not recent events proved quite the contrary? Did we not see not only the "civilized world" but the "Christian world" ablaze with the war spirit less than three years ago over the outrages in Armenia? Did we not witness the spectacle of nearly the whole "Christian world," through the various churches, demanding action at the hands of the so-called Christian powers, especially at the hands of England, that would have deluged the world in blood? Was it not indeed churches, synods, conferences, etc., that were in the van of the movement in England that well-nigh caused a cabinet crisis in that country because the government was not willing to set the world ablaze with war—to enter upon a crusade to drive the hated infidel from the sacred soil of "Christian Europe"?

Was not the same spirit again manifest in large measure when "Christian" Greece declared war against infidel Turkey? And in the case of the present war between our own land and Spain, where, north or south, east or west, has even "Christian sentiment", voiced by the churches, been against it? The pope and his prelates were almost alone in their efforts to preserve peace, and their motive was too evident to deceive anybody. So far as sentiment was concerned they were not able to control or mould that of even their own people; while Protestant pulpits have all the while been ablaze with the war spirit, and thousands of them ring weekly with arguments in justification, if not of war in general, of this war in particular.

No it is not true that at the present time "the sentiment of the civilized world is the strongest in opposition to war." It is, as a secular paper remarked recently, true that "civilization has not lessened the war spirit in men, it has not made them less ready to fight; it has only changed the reasons for war. Given what appears to men to be an adequate reason for war, and they are as ready to fight to-day as they ever were." And it might truthfully have been added that the causes which are supposed to justify war are not so very different to-day than they used to be. National honor, territorial extension, the collection of claims, the protection of citizens, and even revenge for real or fancied wrongs, are still held as they have ever been, to be just grounds for war.

Even in the present war with Spain, undertaken so far as Mr. McKinley is concerned, the writer believes, only for the freeing of Cuba, the mass of the people are moved far more deeply by a desire for revenge than by motives of philanthropy, and the battle-cry alike on land and sea is, "Remember the 'Maine.'" Dewey's fleet went into action at Manila under the inspiration of these words signaled from the flag ship. The same thing is true of several actions in West Indian waters, and every cracker in an order of over six hundred thousand pounds of hard bread for the army, now being filled in St. Louis, bears and is to bear the same motto of revenge, "Remember the 'Maine.'"

Now the writer believes that Cuba ought to be free and that Spain has by injustice and oppression forfeited all just right to govern that island: he also believes that the destruction of the "Maine" was due to a plot that must have involved Spanish officials, and that the perpetrators of the crime deserve punishment; but from the Christian standpoint these facts warrant neither individuals nor nations in seeking revenge. It is written in the Christian Scriptures, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." And let true Christians everywhere say, Amen.

The moral of this is that we should not deceive ourselves with the thought that civilization, even "Christian civilization" will ever abolish war. The Scriptures tell us very plainly that the last days of this world's history are to be days of unparalleled strife. And at the same time they tell us the people will be deceiving themselves with the cry of "peace, peace, when there is no peace." Unexampled preparation for war and unparalleled talk of peace,—much talked of but never materializing sentiment against war,—are signs of the last days; and their language to all who will hear is, Get ready for the great day of God! Get ready! Get ready! GET READY! And the preparation that God would have all men to make is plainly indicated in Zeph. 2:1-3. "The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord." God help his people everywhere to heed the warning, and Get Ready.

C. P. B.
