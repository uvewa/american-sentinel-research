During that summer of '75 our work was in the two lines of Reformation and Formation or Prevention. The reformed man as an evangelist had arisen on the world's horizon, and through the marvelous experiences of salvation from the rum curse which he related was moving all hearts. The enthusiasm of pledge signing and soul winning was such as our generation had never seen before. The most thrilling experiences of Crusade days were improved upon in the meetings which were held from twice to thrice a day wherever these returned prodigals appeared.

We had Francis Murphy, who was just beginning his career, at Rockford; and between his meetings and the "army," were kept busy early and late.

All the while I kept in view that coming convention in Cincinnati, and was preparing myself to make a presentation of this line of preventive work before the women who should there assemble. I learned the manual of arms, or at least so much of it as was necessary to make it possible for me to train a boy to appear with me before the convention to illustrate my theme, or to drill a company if one could be raised quickly for the occasion.

When the time came I took a uniform and a gun; I borrowed a Cincinnati boy, who proved to have the right material in him. The manner in which he wore that uniform and followed my leadership during that memorable week will never be forgotten. He stood with me for hours on that platform, the sole representative of a whole generation, while we discussed him and his contemporaries, and their place in the redemption of society. He was always ready to respond instantly when in the progress of discussion he was called upon for anything "in his line."

The women were feeling their way through mists out of desuetude and narowness into things that already loomed like mountains and spread out like seas before them; and among these mists was the parliamentary fog, so that it was not an easy process to arrive rapidly at a conclusion in such a manner as to keep everything "straight on the minutes."

In this, as in every later discussion, we had all phases of temperament and belief to deal with. There were among us "friends" who objected to the "war footing" upon which we had put the boy in the uniform, and while there was not a dissenting voice concerning the proposed line of work, while this was recognized as the strategic point in the battle with the liquor traffic, yet there were many minds as to methods.

One sweet-faced "Friend" from Philadelphia, at last, however, practically settled the question by saying:—

"Mrs. President" (Mrs. Annie Wittenmyer, of Penn., had been called to that office) "I have been on principle opposed to anything which savored of militiasm, but as this discussion has progressed I have thought that truly the 'Lord he is a man of war,' and if it will hasten the destruction of King Alcohol to equip the boys of the nation after this fashion, and drill them in the use of a wooden gun, making this the means of holding their attention to the truth as it is in the Word of God, I am ready to vote 'aye' and go home and help to raise and equip a regiment of Philadelphia boys."

There was a perfect storm of applause at this concession; the question was called; the vote taken; and the Cold Water Army was a recognized department of the W. C. T. U., and Miss Julia Coleman, of New York, was appointed to prepare for us a text book on alcohol to accompany our Bible temperance lessons.

The work of organizing the children began at once in nearly every state, and went forward with the energy of a forlorn hope; for the more we tried to "evangelize the masses" the more we saw of the desperate need of preventing the formation of such a vicious, sensual appetite as that for strong drink.

The next May, I think it was, I made my first visit to Evanston, called by Miss Willard, for the purpose of organizing an army among the children in whom she was especially interested. I was entertained at what was afterwards named, and has come to be known all over the world as "Rest Cottage," with her as my hostess; and I have a pathetic pleasure in remembering that we sat and talked in the evenings on the very spot which she occupied during the little time that she lay in her last sleep under her own roof that day before she was taken to her final resting place.

If I were writing my own experience I should have a thrilling one to tell of this meeting at Evanston; an experience like that of a bird whose wings had never been discovered, but who, suddenly conscious that it must fly or die, unconsciously spreads a pair of pinions, strong and instinctive with power, and sails away to its own amazement and delight; if not to that of those who are looking on.
