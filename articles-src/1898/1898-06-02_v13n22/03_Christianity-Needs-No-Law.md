RELIGION—the Christian religion—is a law. It is "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus." So the Apostle Paul speaks of it; and he says that by its power he was made "free from the law of sin and death." Rom. 8:2.

Being a law itself, it must be obvious that Christianity does not need a law to give it support. One law is not made to support another. A law that could not support itself would be useless altogether.

Any law that is passed for the support of Christianity, therefore, is but a declaration that Christianity is, in itself, a powerless and useless thing. It is a reflection upon God himself.

But this "law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" has power to deliver men from the "law of sin and death." This is power vastly superior to any that ever was or can be exercised by any legislature or government on the earth.

To be certain of this, it is only necessary that the individual should experience the deliverance of which the apostle writes. Try it, if you have not already, and be convinced.
