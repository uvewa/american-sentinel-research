It may be truthfully said of the present that it is an age of federations and fortifications.

There is federation everywhere among men and among the nations; and there are vast armies and navies created by the nations in the hope of securing a defense behind which they will be impregnable against attack.

These represent the greatest power of which the world knows. In them the world is obliged to put its trust. But will they be sufficient for the test of the day that is coming?

The world hopes that they will, but it feels no assurance. Its statesmen look to the future with forebodings. What is there that will really prove a safe defense when the forces of destruction that have so long been gathering are unloosed?

He will be safe in that day who is behind the Lord of hosts. The winds of the final commotion are held by the angels in the "four corners of the earth" until the final choice of the people in the earth is made. Rev. 7:1-3.

There is a choice for every person to make in this matter. There is a choice to be made by you. Will you choose the means of safety that are being provided by the world? Will you be secure behind the defense of an international alliance, with the resources at its command? Will you be secure behind anything less than the shield of Omnipotence? And can you afford to place yourself behind any other defense than this to-day?
