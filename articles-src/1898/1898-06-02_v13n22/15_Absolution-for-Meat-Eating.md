THE chaplain of a Missouri regiment which is to participate in the war is Father Thomas Sherman, a Jesuit priest. In a recent address to the regiment he gave the Catholics enrolled in it permission to eat meat on Fridays and on fast days, saying that in so doing they would not be false to their religion. He assured them that God would forgive them for eating meat on such days, considering that they were supporting the hardships of a war waged for the freedom of their fellow-beings. His remarks, it is said, were hailed with delight by the soldiers.

THE motive for this absolution is not hard to discover. It is evident that without it the Catholic Church would be very likely to be brought into conflict with the Government by the circumstances attending a campaign. The rations of the troops are supplied by the Government; and in an enemy's country provisions are apt to be scarce. So that it might easily happen that at times meat in some form would be the mainstay of the soldier in keeping up his bodily strength, without which he would be of little service to the Government. The Government would insist, of course, that the soldiers keep themselves, when possible, in condition to do battle with the enemy; and it would be necessary for the Government or the Catholic Church to give way in the matter of eating meat. It would seem that in this case the Catholic Church has deemed it wise to give way before raising an issue in such a controversy.

THE incident calls attention to the primary principles of the papal religion. By the word of a man—a fellow-mortal like themselves—these Roman Catholics felt themselves absolved from what they believed to be the command of God, but which was in fact nothing more than the decree of man, since the Word of God says nothing at all about eating meat on Fridays or observing certain days as fast days. They receive the decree of men as the command of God, and then accept the word of man as having authority to release them from their obligations to God. It is thus that the papal religion puts man in the place of God.
