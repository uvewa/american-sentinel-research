The following petition has been presented to the President by a committee of Southern Baptists:—

"To the President: We, citizens of the United States, looking to the probability that our Government may be called to exercise its office in the adjustment of the pending difficulties in Cuba; and whereas the doctrine of the equality of religious rights of all men is a doctrine dear to the heart of every true American; we therefore earnestly request the President of the United States that in such contemplated adjustment the influence of this entire Government be employed to secure equality of religious rights to every inhabitant of Cuba."

As between Catholics and Protestants, it is altogether likely that the influence of the Government will be exerted in Cuba in harmony with the terms of this request. But unfortunately, this Government has not within its own borders secured "equality of religious rights" in cases of controversy which have arisen between Protestants and Protestants. "The influence of this entire Government" has by acts of Congress and the decisions of its courts been thrown upon the side of religious intolerance. And by this the Government has unfitted itself for sincere and consistent action in behalf of religious freedom for the Cuban people.
