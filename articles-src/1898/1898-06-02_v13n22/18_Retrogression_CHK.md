Prince Bismarck, according to the New York World, May 19, makes the following statement concerning the United States: "America's change of front means retrogression in the high sense of civilization. That is the fact most to be regretted about this war. The war cannot have a wholesome result either to America or Europe. The United States will be forced to adopt an intermeddling policy leading to unavoidable friction. She thus abandons her traditional peace policy, and in order to maintain her position she must become a military and naval power—an expensive luxury which her geographical position rendered unnecessary."

There is much food for thought in these utterances. They are the words of one who for years has stood in the front rank among statesmen, and who has watched closely the history of this country, and knows whereof he speaks.

"Retrogression" is an awful word at any time, meaning, as it does, a "going backward," a "declining from a better to a worse state;" but it is especially so when used in this connection. "America's change of front means retrogression in the high sense of civilization." And from now on she will be "forced to adopt an intermeddling policy leading to unavoidable friction."

This "intermeddling policy" is the one that has marked the history of the nations of the Old World, and it has always led to "unavoidable friction."

Therefore, from this time on, America will be on the down grade, from "a better to a worse state," until it reaches the level of these other nations.

Bismarck's words are a confession that the "traditional peace policy" of the United States has lifted her, to put it no stronger, above the nations of Europe in the scale of civilization.

But now, forsaking this peaceful policy, she must adopt an "intermeddling policy" which must lead her to "unavoidable friction."

"Friction" means the "rubbing of one body against another." The continual rubbing together of two bodies that are in their nature combustible must produce fire.

And everybody knows that nations—especially Christian(?) nations—are "combustible." To-day this world is like a vast powder magazine. So when this rubbing begins and is continued, sparks at least will follow, and falling somewhere in this vast powder magazine, the result will be a tremendous explosion.

Let everybody take note that "Old Glory" is no longer the emblem of a peace following nation; and that the unseen hand of Destiny is even now writing "Ichabod" upon her banner.
