**EDITOR SENTINEL:** The following editorial statement by the *Chicago Times-Herald*, April 27, was very significant when published. It is now doubly so in view of the threatened complications over the Spanish war:

> "Metaphorically, Europe is a powder magazine, which one spark would ignite. If a nation like France, for instance, should espouse the cause of Spain, all Europe would be ablaze with war within a fortnight. A new map of the world would have to be made when hostilities were ended, and on that map there would be no such country as Spain."

There will, indeed, have to be a new map of the world after this looked-for conflict of the nations, and it can be said just as confidently that on that map there will be no such country as the United States. For "the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up," and there will follow "a new heaven and a new earth," where there will be "no more sea."

J. D. BRADLEY.
