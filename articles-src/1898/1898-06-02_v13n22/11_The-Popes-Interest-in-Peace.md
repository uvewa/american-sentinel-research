THE AMERICAN REVIEW OF REVIEWS gives the following in explanation of the pope's desire for peace so fervently expressed in connection with the Spanish-American conflict:—

"In the early part of this century the property of the Roman Catholic Church in Spain absorbed a large part of the wealth of the country. In 1820 there were 150,000 monks and priests in Spain, besides many thousand nuns. At present there are only about 35,000 priests and monks in Spain, and 15,000 nuns. In all the struggles of factions and parties in Spain, clericalism has played a large part. In 1835 the success of a particular faction meant the crushing defeat of the clerical party. This led to sweeping confiscatory decrees, and these led to a long quarrel between the Vatican and the Spanish government. This was kept up for nearly a quarter of a century, when a new concordat between the Spanish government and the pope was established. In harmony with that a large amount of church property was sold off, and there was issued to the church several hundred millions of dollars in interest-bearing Spanish bonds. This huge block of securities is now held by the Roman Catholic Church. No wonder the pope is anxious to intervene. The interest on these bonds cannot be paid unless Spanish credit is maintained, and protracted war between the United States and Spain means Spanish bankruptcy."
