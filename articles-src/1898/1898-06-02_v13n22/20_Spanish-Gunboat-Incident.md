RECENTLY a Spanish gunboat in a Cuban port fired into a British ship which was near by, loaded with coal, and apparently about to leave the harbor. Later the Spanish officials represented to the British authorities that the shot was an accident, and this explanation seems to have been accepted; on account, perhaps, of the fact that the shot took effect in the hull of the British vessel.
