A RESIDENT of this city, Mr. Michael Powers, was recently fined $50 by Justice Bennett in one of the city courts for the crime of blasphemy. As reported, the justice in passing sentence said: "I find you guilty of the charge of swearing in the public streets contrary to the laws of the State of New York, and also of disturbing the quiet of your neighborhood. I, therefore, fine you $50, or fifty days in jail. You stand committed until the fine is paid."

It is quite proper, of course, to prohibit by law such conduct on the part of any person as properly constitutes a nuisance. But when the offense is one which derives its force from religious belief, as in the case of profanity, it is one beyond the province or the power of civil law to correct. "Blasphemy" is a term which, as defining an offense punishable by civil law, has a tendency to become very broad, and to include any word spoken derogatory to the prevailing religion. As such it has often been made the means of religious persecution; and to admit the propriety of legislating against it, is to throw down the barrier between church and state.

Profanity is a fault that may be eradicated by the grace of God, but not by the lash of the law. It is altogether likely that Mr. Powers' tendency to profanity was strengthened rather than diminished by the punishment imposed upon him by the court.
