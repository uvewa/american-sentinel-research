As the Cuban war progresses, indications are pointing more and more clearly to the probability that the United States will, from necessity if from no other motive, take such action at the close of the war with reference to the future of Cuba as will belie, in the eyes of European peoples, the professions of disinterestedness with which she began the war.

The universal testimony of Americans who have come in personal contact with the Cubans, is anything but flattering to the latter. There is friction between the American troops and their Cuban allies, and already the Washington Government finds itself in serious perplexity over the situation. The halo of heroism which American eyes looking through the press reports saw encircling the heads of the Cubans, seems to have been dissipated completely; and with it has vanished in large part at least the idea of a Cuban republic flourishing under the hands of the natives now in arms against Spain.

There is every indication that at the close of the war it will be clearly seen by the authorities here that the power and authority of the United States are necessary to insure a stable and proper government in Cuba.

The trend of sentiment in this direction is well voiced in an article in *The Independent*, of July 21, by the governor of Colorado. In reference to the fulfillment of the purpose of giving liberty to the Cuban people, which the nation proclaimed to the world as her justification in taking up arms, he says:—

"I preach a new political gospel; a creed to which I am in part a recent convert. I have always believed that Cuba should be under the Stars and Stripes; to-day I believe that duty and destiny demand that the United States retain control of every island captured from Spain in the West Indies or in the Pacific. Our quixotic friend proclaims that we are engaged in a war of humanity, not of conquest—that we must give up every acre we gain at the cost of our treasure and the rich blood of our sons. How can we better meet the demands of humanity than to place our flag over lands that have been riven with revolution or debased by tyranny and misrule? Congress declared that we sought not Cuba, but its independence and freedom. How can Cuba be more free or independent than as a territory of the United States? The fourth Senate resolution, as were all declarations, was rendered null and void by the action of Spain in sending the American minister from Madrid before receiving the ultimatum from the United States.

"Are the natives of Cuba prepared for independence? Are they qualified to maintain a free State worthy of the sacrifice we are making in their behalf? If the history of similar people be a guide it would not be ten years before an independent Cuban republic would involve us in controversy and perhaps war with some first-class Power. For one hundred years it has been a menace to our peace—a fountain of contagion. Under our rule it would become a paradise, an ideal land of beauty and liberty, in strange contrast to its four centuries of blood and bondage."

Of course the United States will explain to the world that it is necessary to the welfare of the Cuban people that the island should be under the protectorate of the great American Republic; but who can suppose that the cynical-eyed powers thus addressed will be ready to accept this explanation? All things considered, the lofty ideal of the United States standing as the bestower of freedom and independence upon the oppressed peoples of the earth, might as well be regarded as a vanishing dream.
