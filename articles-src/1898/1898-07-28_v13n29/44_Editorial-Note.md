CERTAIN Roman Catholic journals are with all seriousness offering to the public an account of a wonderful "miracle" which occurred recently at Turin, Italy. It is described by the Rome correspondent of the Freeman's Journal, thus:—

"While the sacred winding sheet was exposed for public vision in Turin a couple of weeks ago, permission to photograph it was asked of King Humbert by Signor Secondo Pia, a member of the committee of sacred art of the Turin exposition. The first proof was a failure, but the second revealed a marvelous fact. As I explained a couple of weeks ago, the winding sheet bears a double impress of the figure of our Lord—but faintly, and showing only the outlines. It was naturally expected that the photographic negative would contain no more than was visible to the naked eye in the original. Instead, however, the photograph reveals a perfect design of the sacred face, hands, and limbs; so, after nearly nineteen centuries modern science manifests to us what manner of man our Lord was in his sufferings and death."

The "sacred winding sheet" has come to public notice through the mediumship of the Catholic church, and this miracious occurrence of course attests the truthfulness of the church's claim to be the genuine and only medium through which the power of God is manifested for the salvation of human souls. That is what all these Catholic "miracles" are designed to teach to a credulous public.

But to discount the claim which is made for the church in this instance, it is not necessary to discount the story itself. Were the account true, it would be proof that God had nothing to do with the phenomenon. This may be known from the fact that God does not manifest his power in that way. The phenomenon—if such there was—indicates a power which appeals to the senses, one suited to a sensual religion. It is altogether appropriate that such things should be connected with a religion which appeals, as does the Catholic, to the eye and ear with form and ceremony calculated to dazzle and strike with awe rather than enlighten with truth.

God is working to-day not as a showman, doing wonders merely for people to behold, but to exalt his Word. Any "miracle" may be safely discounted which stands disconnected from that Word. His Word is mighty to convict of sin and save the soul, and it is always for this purpose that God manifests his power to-day. That is the work God is doing now. By and by this work will be finished, and then will be seen the manifestation of the power of God in a strange work upon material things. The all-important thing now is to know the power of God working in the heart by faith.
