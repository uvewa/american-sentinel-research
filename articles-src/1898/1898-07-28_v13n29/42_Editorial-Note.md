ONE great reason that is given for the decadence of Spain is expressed in the word "manana," which falls so naturally from the Spaniard's lips, and means "tomorrow." Its real significance may be expressed by reversing a well-known Anglo-Saxon motto,—Never do to day what you can put off till tomorrow. In addition, fully half the calendar year, it is said, is made up of saints' days and holidays, upon which no work is expected to be done. It would not be unnatural to suppose that the prevalence of saints' days and holidays is responsible for the use made of the term "manana." And it may be fittingly observed that when a nation begins to multiply "holy" days and holidays, it is exhibiting sure symptoms of decadence.
