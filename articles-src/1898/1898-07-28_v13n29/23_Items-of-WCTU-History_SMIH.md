The last chapter was a connecting link between the preceding one and this, in which I wish to resume the story of our work for mothers, and through them for the children. We early became convinced that the work for mothers must be fundamental to every line of effective Christian endeavor, and I may seem to be giving more time and space in these articles to this line than any other; but as I believe the methods adopted to be the very best in securing practical results for father, mother, child, church, and society, I may be pardoned for dwelling upon them.

Another bit of incident will illustrate the methods and the practical result. I conducted an institute at the New York State Convention in '79 I think, giving a large share of the time to preventive methods and mother's circles.

When the National Convention was in New York in '80 or '81, a White Ribboner came to me saying that she had attended that institute, and had gone to her home in a New Jersey suburb of New York City to put the methods to the proof, with results of so gratifying a nature that she wished to show them to me. Accordingly I gladly accepted her invitation to visit her immediately after adjournment. I found her and her husband working together in the most unselfish manner to alleviate human suffering and ignorance. She had begun to apply what she had learned by calling to her help all whom she could interest in the principle of organizing everything that was good against everything that was bad. The city had been districted, and the workers had begun visiting, going into every home; into some for the purpose of getting help; in the others for the purpose of taking help.

The first aim was to reach the mothers of the neglected class. The plan was to organize a weekly mother's circle to meet in their own cottages. Three ladies were required for the work of the mothers' circle. All agreed between themselves beforehand as to what each should do in the work of the afternoon. The entire afternoon was required. The women brought their darning and patching. The three ladies upon whom the responsibility rested distributed the service among themselves in this fashion: one read aloud while the others plied the needle, from something carefully selected from the literature that had been produced by the W. C. T. U. for the purpose of meeting this very need; short, concise, scientific papers, easily comprehended by those who had any special interest in the subject. The ladies would decide beforehand what points should be emphasized in the conversation which accompanied the reading. One would act as a questioner, that she might lead the timid women, who, themselves unable to lead out even in questioning, would eagerly listen, and soon learn to formulate crude, and often pathetic inquiries for themselves, which would lead naturally on to the "whole gospel for the whole man."

The women were encouraged to bring their children, as many could not otherwise come. The third lady would take these children into another room, or, if there was not one to spare, would go with them wherever it seemed most suitable, to spend the time with them. A little kindergarten was the natural outcome of this part of the method. Once a month the meeting would be continued into the evening, the mothers of the circle and the W. C. T. U. women taking their tea together. Sometimes a general invitation was given to the men and women of the neighborhood, and the tea would be followed by a gospel meeting.

My hostess said to me the next day after my arrival: "I would like to have you remain in your room this afternoon, if you will; or at least, do not come into the drawing-room until I come for you."

I said: "Are you preparing a surprise for me?"

She said, "If it is to be a surprise, and I answered you, I am afraid I should spoil it."

"Do not speak for the world," I said. "I will remain in my room until you come for me, so as not to spoil anything."
