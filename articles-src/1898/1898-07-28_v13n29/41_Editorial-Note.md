THE health of Pope Leo, says the New York Sun, is so precarious that the pontiff is preparing for an early demise, and conferences of cardinals are discussing the question of his successor. It is the wish of the pope that his body be buried by the side of Innocent III. The latter is a conspicuous figure in medieval history, and was one of the worst popes that ever lived.
