MUCH is being made in the secular press these days of the "heroism" of Roman Catholic priests, chaplains, etc., in occasions of emergency such as those furnished by the destruction of the "Maine" or the sinking of "La Burgogne." In connection with the latter a pen picture is drawn of a Catholic chaplain giving "absolution" to a company of the passengers on the deck of the fast-sinking ship. Bravery and devotion are high qualities, and we do not question what is said of Catholic chaplains in this respect; but there are times when the most religious duty, the highest heroism, takes the form of quick, energetic action for the saving of human life, and such a time was that when the "Burgogne" was settling, with its human freight, into the watery abyss. The energy to work is God-given as well as the faith to pray.
