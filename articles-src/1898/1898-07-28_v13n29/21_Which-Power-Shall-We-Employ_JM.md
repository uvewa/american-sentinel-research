Not all earth's legislative halls
Can e'er regenerate one soul:
Nor can the best religious laws
Enact a statute to control
The passions vile of fallen man:
'Tis but God's power alone that can.

Learn well the lesson Jesus taught,
That only He has power to draw
The wandering ones, in sin's net caught,
Unto Himself, no human law
Can make the evil-doer good,
Nought can avail but Jesus' blood.

How vain we strive this end to gain
By seeking legislation's aid:
We from such methods should abstain
Since force hath ne'er true converts made.
With cords of love, the Spirit's sword,
Draw erring ones to Christ our Lord.

Read history's pages through and through;
Doth it not cause thee constant pain
To know the gibbet, stake, and screw,
Were used religion to sustain?
Thus covering Christ's holy name
With baneful ignominy, shame.

Ah yes, religion's virgin dress
Has e'er been stained by martyr's blood:
Shall we continue to oppress
Those of a different faith, and mood?
Or shall we learn in Jesus' school,
To practice well the Golden Rule?

Thus loving Jesus, thou shalt love
Thy neighbor as thyself, alone
Shalt thou use power from above
Fallacious doctrines to dethrone.
No force could'st thou through life employ,
That would thy brother's rights destroy.

All men are equal, why should thou
Then seek another to enchain?
Dost thou claim freedom? then allow
The same to others; ne'er sustain
An act that would their rights curtail,
Or their blest privileges assail.

Do unto others, true refrain,
As thou would'st have them do to thee:
Follow this rule through life's campaign
If thou on earth true joy would'st see.
Only as we make others glad,
Can we reap joy we ne'er have had.
