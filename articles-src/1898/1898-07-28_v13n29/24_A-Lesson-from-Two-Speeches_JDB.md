How natural it is for false principles to skulk under the cant of formal piety! The traitor angel who was

"The first
That practiced falsehood under saintly show,"

was by no means the last. From Eden down the worst evils that have afflicted the human race have appeared in a garb of deception, and to-day the mild appearance of the lamb is belied by the harsh tones of the dragon.

The new foreign policy of this country, which its supporters do not hesitate to call "the policy of imperialism," is properly receiving at this time considerable attention. It is to two speeches on this subject, delivered on June 21, that we wish to call attention. One was made by a man high in the councils of the party now in power, and who is known to be the spokesman for the administration. The other was by a man who has twice held the office of president at the head of the other great political party.

The first speech was an enthusiastic announcement and indorsement of the new policy as shown in the following sentence which was received with great favor: "I doubt very much whether you and I will live to see the day when by the order of a republican administration, and surely not by the order of McKinley's administration, the starry banner of your country's glory shall be pulled down from any flagstaff where conquest of arms has placed it." In striking contrast with the avowed object of the war, but not with the sentiment of this speech, is the obscurity that is thrown upon the nature of the future government of these islands that are being "set free for humanity's sake." Speaking first of Hawaii, the speaker said: "It will be the policy of the administration to plant the flag of the United States at Hawaii, to occupy it and fortify it and make it a part of the territory of the United States, and when the war is over we will then settle the question of what sort of a government we will have over there. . . . Let us wait. It is not important to settle the status of the Philippine Islands now. It is not important to settle the character of the government, the stable government, which we promise to Cuba." In connection with that note the following expressions: "The diplomacy of a great Christian nation could not rescue us from war when it was decided both upon moral and material grounds to drive the Spanish flag off the Western hemisphere." Where the flag is placed "we will take, hold, fortify, and eternally, with the blessing of God, defend." And this will all be done "patriotically, wisely, and from the standpoint of American progress and in the career that God has marked for us in the world."

This speech is only an incident showing how religious sentiment is being connected with this new policy. The popular religious press and pulpit of the country is almost a unit in favor of "expansion." It is to warn against this kind of piety, whether proclaimed by orators or preachers, that is our purpose here.

The other speech was well headed by the newspapers, "A Note of Warning." Calmly and dispassionately it portrayed "the folly of a departure from national purposes and the crime of unnecessary and unjustifiable war." Here are some of the statements: "Never before in our history have we been beset with temptations so dangerous as those which now whisper in our ears alluring words of conquest and expansion, and point out to us fields bright with the glory of war. . . . Our government was formed for the express purpose of creating a new world, a new nation, the foundation of which should be man's self-government, whose safety and prosperity should be secured by its absolute freedom from old world complications, and in its renunciation of all schemes of foreign conquest. . . . If, then, the suggestion is made that the time has come for our nation to abandon its old landmarks and to follow the light of monarchical hazards, and that we should attempt to employ the simple machinery of our popular and domestic government to serve the schemes of imperialism, your challenge of the proposition is entirely in order. . . . Such perversions bring in their train a people's demoralization and a decay of popular contentment more surely destructive to the republic than armies with banners. . . . The people whose victories are those of peace and whose immunity from armed conflict is found in their freedom from the foreign relationships that give birth to war, will not improve the quality of their national character by a cheapening of their estimate of the value of peace, or by dwelling upon war and warlike preparations." . . . Notwithstanding the bright dress and gay trappings which war puts on, in the light of true American citizenship it is a hateful thing, which we should shun and avoid as antagonistic to the objects of our national existence. If you believe this you should stand bravely for your belief, even though a shower of stupid catcalls may fill the air. . . . If you are tempted pleasantly to drift with the current of thoughtless popular sentiment, look carefully to see if the stream runs in a safe direction."

Altogether this second speech was the soundest and wisest utterance from a political standpoint that had been delivered on the subject up to that time, and there will be no question as to which of the two is more in accord with those words of Scripture, 'Seek peace, and pursue it," and "As much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men." But nowhere does the speaker claim that he is urging that which has been the purpose of "a great Christian nation," nor does he claim that "the blessing of God" will attend an adherence to original principles, or that such adherence is "the career that God has marked for us in the world." He simply refers to "the rules and motives that have thus far governed our national life;" that experience has shown them to be correct, and that therefore they should not be abandoned. As if to make the contrast more striking these speeches were reported side by side in a prominent newspaper, and at the very point in the column where one declared that the new policy was "the career that God has marked for us in the world," the other, just across the column rule, declared that "the rules and motives that have thus far governed" our national life forbid such dangerous perversions."

We wish to impress the fact that truth, justice, and uprightness need no cant. It is infinitely better to declare what is just and upright and attribute it to no higher source than the "rules and motives that have thus far governed," than it is to mingle with false principles the most reverent and pious expressions. God has long ago proclaimed that it is an amending of the ways, an execution of judgment between a man and his neighbor, a withholding of the hand from oppression and blood, and not a trust in profitless and lying words that secures his blessing. Justice and judgment are the habitation of his throne, and wherever they are found, even if unaccompanied by formal declarations, he is there just so certainly as he is not with that piety that would serve as a cover for the baldness of injustice, pride, ambition, and conquest.

Such piety is indeed a drawing nigh with the lips, but in this instance the heart is evidently far away in Puerto Rico, Cuba, Hawaii, and the Philippines. This is the kind of piety that, mistaking words for godliness, would "acknowledge" God in the Constitution by excluding therefrom his principles of justice and liberty which are the guarantees of the dearest rights that he has conferred upon man. This is the kind of piety that is so anxious to obtain a formal "Sabbath" observance that it imprisons upright and God-fearing men. It is the kind of piety that indeed sayeth, "Lord, Lord," but which is unknown in heaven, and which will finally hear the words, "Depart from me; I never knew you."

When Mr. Burke was remonstrating with the ministers of George III. against the folly and inconsistency of their course in taxing the American colonies, he exclaimed: "Do you mean to tax America, and to draw a productive revenue from thence? If you do, speak out: name, fix, ascertain, this revenue; settle its quantity, define its objects; provide for its collection; and then fight, when you have something to fight for. If you murder, rob; If you kill, take possession; and do not appear in the character of madmen as well as assassins." In like manner it may be said to those preachers and orators who to-day stimulate and attempt to sanctify the ambition for conquest: Do you mean to take and control foreign possessions, and to draw an increased power and revenue from thence? If so, take them, subdue them, and receive all the benefits that they give. Do you mean to pursue the policy of imperialism and aggrandizement in the face of all just principles? If so, pursue it; but do not appear in the character of Christians and benefactors as well as conquerors and dictators. Do not assume the garb of piety and philanthropy when reaching for the scepter of conquest and imperialism. Do not talk of holding and fortifying distant islands "with the blessing of God," or say that that is "the career God has marked for us in the world."

And where has God marked this? No one knows, and no one ever can know, for God has marked for us no such thing. He has indeed pointed out for us in prophecy that this would come to pass. But certain preachers and politicians are attending with the utmost expedition to the marking.

In this thing is another parallel to Roman history. In the days when republican Rome was expanding her territory "public men spoke conventionally of Providence, that they might throw on their opponents the odium of impiety. . . . The whole spiritual atmosphere was saturated with cant—cant moral, cant political, cant religious; an affectation of high principle which had ceased to touch the conduct, and flowed on in an increasing volume of insincere and unreal speech."

Those who were told that they would never live to see the day when "the starry banner of their country's glory shall be pulled down from any flagstaff where conquest of arms has placed it," will not need to live long in order to see that very thing done, and, in common with the majority of their countrymen, to rue the day,

"When pride and worse ambition threw them down."

"When his [Nebuchadnezzar's] heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him." Dan. 5:20. That text means to-day that when the hearts of the American people are lifted up, and their minds hardened in pride, then will they be deposed from their republican government, and their glory shall be taken from them.
