ROMAN CATHOLICS in this country have, not unnaturally, taken umbrage at the assertions from a Protestant source that "God has given into the hands of American Christians" the regions taken by the army and navy in Cuba. Previously to this these regions have been in the hands of American Catholics; hence the statement plainly implies that the Catholics are not Christians. Thus in one way and another the question is coming up for settlement, as to what class or classes of people constitute Christians, and what do not.
