THE question of allowing church buildings upon the military reservation at West Point, has been settled, for the present, in favor of such buildings as the Secretary of War sees fit to allow to be erected. The matter is left to his "discretion." This being so, we may expect that a Roman Catholic chapel will be forthcoming shortly.
