The Melbourne Age, in its issue of May 23, last, makes the following note of several cases which have come before the courts there under the law against "Sabbath breaking":—

"Numerous complaints have been made to the authorities of the practice of Chinese and other market gardeners working in their gardens on Sundays in Brighton District, and it was recently decided that a raid should be made upon them by the police. Accordingly Constables Healy and Ward yesterday detected six Chinese thus Sabbath breaking, and one Englishman, who claims to be a Seventh-day Adventist, and who therefore observes Saturday as the Sabbath prescribed in the Scriptures. Summonses will be issued against the seven men under an act of Charles II., passed for the proper observance of the Sabbath. The penalty upon conviction is a fine of 5s., in default distress, or 24 hours in the stocks.

"As there are no stocks in use in this colony at present, in the event of the Chinese or the European defendant requiring them, the authorities will of course make stocks. In the case of the seventh-day Adventist, it is understood that the case will be fought by that body, and some interesting legal arguments may be expected.

"The Chinese aver that they do not want to work on Sundays, but being only the employés of rich countrymen in Melbourne, who own most of the gardens, are compelled to toil whether they like it or not. Their pay, as a rule, is 10s. per week, and their board and lodging. The cases will be heard at the Brighton Police Court on Friday next."

With reference to this the following appropriate observations were made in the June issue of the Melbourne Southern Sentinel:—

"Through 'numerous complaints' made against the poor Chinese market gardeners around Melbourne, the Sunday law of Charles II. has been set in motion again in Victoria, as appears from an article in another page. We have never heard of anyone, from the time of Constantine's Sunday law in 321 to the present day, ever having been converted to Christianity through the enforcement of Sunday laws. To fine men, and talk of putting them in the stocks for failure to observe a religious institution reminds us very forcibly of the days of religious intolerance and persecution. Mr. Wise spoke well when in the Federal Convention, in support of Clause 115, he said:—

"'I wish I could share Mr. Barton's optimistic views as to the death of the spirit of religious persecution. But we have seen in our own time a recrudescence of that evil demon, which, I fear, is only scotched and not killed. At any rate, the period during which we have enjoyed religious liberty is not long enough for us to be able to say with confidence that there will be no swinging back of the pendulum to the spirit of the times from which we have only recently emerged.'

"To resurrect and put into operation the Sunday law of 1667 here in the year 1898, is certainly a swinging back of the pendulum to the spirit of the times when religious persecution was rife. Every government on earth ought to repudiate the principle of state censorship over men in religious things. Every civil constitution ought to have in it a clause similar to Clause 115 of the Federal Constitution. Then we would hear no more of stocks or Sunday laws. Every man would be left free to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, just as he should be."
