A MEMBER of the Volksraad, the legislative body of the Orange Free State, is reported as having recently declared to his fellow-members that if stringent Sunday regulations were enforced, "rinderpest and all other plagues would banish." This was in the course of a debate on the propriety of new Sunday legislation. It illustrates how superstition connects itself with the cause of Sunday enforcement.
