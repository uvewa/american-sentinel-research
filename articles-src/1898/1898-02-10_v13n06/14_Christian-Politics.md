CHRISTIANITY is not of this world.

To his followers Jesus Christ said (and still says): "Ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world;" and in his memorable prayer (John 17) he said of them, "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." Vs. 14, 16.

That which is of the world, the world loves, and that which the world engages in with all ardor may safely be set down as being congenial to worldly taste.

And in what does all the world engage more zealously than in politics?

The very acme of worldliness is represented in political organizations and methods.

The ballot is an instrument of worldly power. The agent of evil makes use of it as gladly and as freely as does anyone. Not so of the instruments of righteousness,—the weapons which are not carnal.

In the very nature of things, therefore, there can be no such thing as Christian politics.

"Christian politics"—that which we see developing in this country by that name—is politics in its worst and most dangerous form.
