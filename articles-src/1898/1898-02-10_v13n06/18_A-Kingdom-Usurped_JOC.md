As learned from a previous paper, the kingdom of God is composed of five constituents, or necessary parts, namely; territory, subjects, the King, his throne, and his laws. That kingdom complete must retain all these features. To take away from the compact, any one of these is to destroy the unity of the kingdom. In every part of God's kingdom these must not only be retained in harmony with each other, but all these parts must render homage to the one sovereign King. Any portion of these elements, not so related to the general whole, is in rebellion against their rightful Ruler.

When man in Eden was induced to transfer his allegiance from the king of heaven to Satan's rule of sin, he not only withdrew himself, *as a subject*, from that compact, but *the territory* which had been entrusted to his dominion, as God's representative, was *also transferred* to the rule of sin, and man became Satan's representative in that portion of the universe, to govern it after the model of force. Thus it is seen that,

as shown by the line drawn across the diagram, a portion of the original kingdom was affected by sin. The earth and its inhabitants, represented by that part of the diagram marked B, were by this cut off from the government of heaven, as shown by A, and became the territory and subjects of another government.

In this transfer it was impossible to make over to the usurper more than these two parts,—the territory with its subjects. The king, with his throne and laws, being higher than man, and therefore beyond his reach, were not in his power to carry over to the side of Satan. These being eternal in their nature, remain forever as they were before sin entered. This being true, the three eternal, unchangeable elements of the kingdom of God can never combine with the rule of earthly governments, because of the difference of their administrations. Love and force, as governmental policies, cannot possibly unite. God cannot join the divine elements of his government with those of earthly rule, because his righteousness and love are entirely incompatible with the laws of sin and force.

The Saviour therefore said truly, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon." Matt. 6:24. The reason is plain. Such a course would necessitate serving two masters who are directly opposite in every particular, which would be utterly impossible. So, then, while the influence of human selfishness, combined with Satan's system of government, controls the world, it cannot be true that God unites the will of heaven with these revolting portions of his kingdom to enforce obedience to his law. When one is forced to do a thing, his mind does not give consent, and without the consent of the mind, one cannot serve the law of God. Rom. 7:25. So long, therefore, as the mind remains unchanged from its carnal state, it is always, and at all times, enmity to God and his rule. Rom. 8:7. God cannot add his sanction to any attempt to force obedience to him, and still retain his gentleness, which alone makes men great in righteousness. Ps.18:35.

Since the reign of sin, which makes force the predominant element in earth's governments, separated the earth and its dwellers from God's kingdom, it must be necessary for that rule to pass away before the earth can again become a part of the kingdom of righteousness. To this end the Saviour has instructed all to daily pray, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven." Matt. 6:10. God's will is not done in heaven because its inhabitants are forced to it, nor are different degrees of consecration known in the service there rendered. All the service of that intact reign is therefore complete in single-mindedness, and no one there dissents in any degree from the mind of Jehovah.

The restoration of that perfect rule in the earth must therefore be the entire elimination of sin from every heart and from every nook of the territory usurped by Satan. In other words, the kingdoms of this world must become "the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ," that he may rule therein forever, just as he now reigns over that portion of the territory and subjects which were never subjected to the rule of sin. But this work must begin *in the hearts* of the subjects, and under the influence of God's Spirit, rather than by the force of law. It must be accomplished by those loyal to God's government entering the usurped territory and proclaiming "liberty to the captives" in the name of the king of heaven (Isa. 61:1, 2), and pointing them to a better reign, as exercised by the Lord himself, rather than by using the laws of the usurped territory to enforce an obedience prescribed by them as the will of heaven.

It almost seems as though men are blind who cannot see that Satan, having brought sin into the world, and so secured control of it, will never try to make its inhabitants become loyal to heaven, the very government of which he is an avowed enemy. It is indeed strange that so few suspect that the laws enacted in Satan's territory, apparently looking to setting up the reign of God there, are but a feint,—a politic move—to cover up Satan's opposition to God, by his appearing to be an "angel of light" (2 Cor. 11:14), and that he deludes men by this device actually to assist him in his work, under the pretense that they are thus advancing the interests of the kingdom of God.

The Pharisees of Christ's time were similarly deceived. They believed that their nation and country constituted the kingdom of God, even though fallen under the exacting rule of the Roman power. Knowing no form of government but that which was external and visible, they supposed that when their kingdom was again liberated from a foreign yoke, it would be done by being reconquered by the Messiah, who would then rule over them and their territory in person. So, as a test by which to decide whether Christ was really the Messiah or not, they demanded of him to tell them when he would reinstate the kingdom of God among them. His answer was clear and decisive: "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation [margin, outward show]; neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, lo, there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you." Luke 17:20,21. In other words, the outward form of God's government on earth is lost. It will not return in that shape, but must, for the time, be established within you, and your bodily members become wholly subject to God's will from the heart, even though your territory be ruled over by a foreign power.

The earthly part of God's kingdom having been separated from the government of heaven, the way was then opened by which men might signify their loyalty to God, even though living in the territory of a hostile government. To show the nature of this arrangement, let us study the following diagram:—

The upper horizontal line will represent the kingdom over which man was given dominion at the beginning (Gen. 1:26), and which, upon the entrance of sin, became subject to the rule of Satan. Man being born upon this usurped territory, is by nature a slave of sin, but is invited by the gospel of Christ to renounce the service of Satan, and yield allegiance to the king of heaven. But inasmuch as the territory under which men are born is detached from the kingdom of heaven, and must remain a part of the realm of wickedness until sin is destroyed out of it, an arrangement has been made by which man may connect with that part of the kingdom of heaven that remains steadfast, including the King, his throne, and his law, these to be enshrined in the heart. This, of course, constitutes him a subject of that kingdom which reigns within. The lost territory, however, cannot be received thus, but must be waited for until it also is cleansed from sin, when it will be restored to its original domain, and so the kingdom of God be again united in its original perfect state.

This reign of God in the heart is known as the kingdom of grace (Heb. 4:16). and has run parallel with earthly kingdoms ever since the fall of man. It is indicated in the diagram by the lower horizontal line. Growing out of man's necessity for a purer and more satisfying government than that in which fate has placed him by birth, it stands in the place of the lost territory until that territory can be restored to the reign of heaven. Whoever, therefore, becomes an "adopted" citizen of this kingdom of grace is "called out," in heart, from the rule of earth, hence must count himself a "pilgrim and stranger" in a foreign land, an alien from the commonwealths of earth, to be looking for "a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God." Heb. 11:9,10.

As this temporary kingdom grew out of, and runs parallel with, the kingdom first given to man, but now usurped by Satan, so when that territory is again restored to its first condition, the two will be merged into one perfect state, and those who have been subjects of the kingdom of grace will then be subjects of that perfect and eternal reign of righteousness. This is clearly shown in the following words of the Saviour: "Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Matt. 25:34.

Then the kingdom which was prepared for man at the foundation of the world; which was given to him, and passed over to the control of Satan, will have been redeemed by Christ and restored to man, who will again "reign upon the earth," as at the beginning. But more upon this in another paper. J. o. c.
