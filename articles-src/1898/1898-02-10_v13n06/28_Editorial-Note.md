Notwithstanding a very unfavorable report sent back by an agent of the Government commissioned to investigate the situation in the Klondike country as regards the prospects for success in fortune seeking, it is apparent that thousands from all parts of the country will soon be joined in a great rush to the reputed land of gold. There is something in this which illustrates a strange quality of human nature. Why is it that people are willing to work so hard and face such difficulties and dangers to get gold in this particular way? It has been said by those who spoke from experience, that the hardest way in the world to get gold is to dig it; and it is no doubt true that if the average person would expend the same amount of hard thought and active effort and perseverance in seeking wealth through some of the ordinary channels of business enterprise, that is expended in fortune seeking in the soil of a desolate and inhospitable country, his success would be much more certain.
