In Washington, D. C., there is considerable agitation over the matter of opening the Congressional Library on Sundays. One who is well informed upon the situation as regards Sunday opening of libraries, museums, and places of amusement on Sundays in other lands, says that "We would learn something from that little republic out in mid-ocean—for the public library in Honolulu is open not simply every week-day, but all day Sunday, having the same hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock in the evening. And yet, Honolulu might well be called a City of Churches and church going people. From personal knowledge during my recent three-months' visit to Hawaii, I can say, no New England village in our own land shows a more strict observance of Sunday than Honolulu."

Why, asks this writer, should we have the saloons accessible on Sundays and the libraries closed, as is the general rule in this country? The writer goes on to state that "This is the more remarkable because of the mixed population—Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese—who may not care for the Christian Sabbath, but respect the law, in the strict observance of the Sunday as a day of absolute rest from all work or business.

It seems from this that the best Sunday observance by law is secured where the population are mostly straight-out heathen, making no pretense of regard for Sunday as a sacred day. But is this what is desired by the clergymen and others who are calling for Sunday laws?
