All Christians agree that the law of God is the rule by which the lives of men should be governed, and that one of the precepts of the Christian religion is obedience to the civil power in the realm of civil affairs as it speaks through national law; but it will doubtless be a surprise to some to learn that national law is God's law, and "that society with its rights and its institutions is of divine mold."

These astonishing ideas are however held by many and were advanced by one of the foremost men in the Roman Catholic Church in America.

At the annual banquet of the Cleveland, O. Chamber of Commerce, May 14, 1897, Archbishop Ireland, in his response to the toast, "The Sure Foundation of a True Citizenship," is reported to have said, "Whence will come to Democracy the potency of immortality? With reverence I pronounce the sacred word—conscience. Conscience ruling, Americans will be a law-abiding people; for righteousness commands obedience to law and proclaims that the law of the nation is the law of the supreme governor of men and of nations—Almighty God. Americans will respect the rights of their fellow citizens; conscience bids them know that no one lives for himself alone, and that society with its rights and its institutions is of divine mold."

It will be noticed that according to the archbishop's idea the law of the nation is the law of God; and righteousness—right-doing—commands obedience to this law. Thus the person who refuses to yield obedience to the law becomes not only a criminal, but a sinner who does not follow the dictates of conscience; and thereby becomes a menace to the immortality of our democracy.

All can see that the idea advanced is one long held by Rome,—that the church and state should be united, and that the former should dominate the latter. The surprising thing is that our nation, a professedly Protestant power, should have reached a place where one high in the councils of the Roman Church dares publicly to declare that its laws are the laws of God and that all are in conscience bound to obey them.

When such bold declarations are publicly made, surely it must be that Rome is confident of her position and believes that she can dictate in the enactment and enforcement of our national laws.

In the face of these things liberty-loving men of every creed and political faith should rally to the defense of the liberties purchased by the untiring efforts of the founders of this government.

If society with its institutions, which are manifestly of the world, is of divine mold, then the Apostle John was sadly in the dark when he said that the things of the world "are not of the Father." 1 John 1:15–17.

Many years ago the National Reform party expressed their willingness to unite with the Roman Church on any basis that the latter would propose. It is evident that there is nothing to prevent this union now.

Reader, pause and consider. Which side will you take in this matter? Do you agree that national law is God's law and that society with its institutions is of divine mold? or do you stand for the infinite superiority of God's law over all other law and pledge obedience to it without regard to the laws of civil governments which are many times framed to favor the rich and oppress the poor?
