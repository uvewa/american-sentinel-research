Some one has asked, with considerable point, why it is that the U. S. Government has inscribed on a part of its currency the sentence, "In God We Trust." The circumstances of the origin of the inscription we do not know, but the words must be taken as showing some connection between the Government and religion; and as such, they are worthy of note.
