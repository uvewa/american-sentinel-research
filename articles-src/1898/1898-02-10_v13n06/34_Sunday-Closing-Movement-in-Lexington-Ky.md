The Lexington (Ky.) Morning Herald, of January 24, reports a meeting held in that city the previous day to inaugurate a movement for Sunday closing of all kinds of business. It was held under the auspices of the Christian Endeavor and Epworth League societies of the city, joined by the W. C. T. U. and Y. M. C. A.

The meeting was held in the Central Christian Church, and was "largely attended."

The object of the meeting was stated as being "to devise some means of preventing the opening of business houses and saloons on Sunday," which was alleged to be in violation of existing city and State enactments.

It was decided that Sunday newspapers should be prohibited, as well as other business enterprises; also that an investigation be made with reference to Sunday mail delivery in the city, with the view of securing its abolition.

After this the meeting adjourned until February 6.

Whether or not it was claimed that this movement for Sunday closing was of a merely civil character, is not stated. If the claim was made, as is usual on such occasions, it was sufficiently refuted by the circumstances of its inauguration.

A number of purely religious organizations came together in a church building and inaugurated a movement for the compulsory closing of all business on a religious day. Is there anything in this savoring of a union of church and state?

For whose benefit is the government of the State of Kentucky run? For the religious societies, or for the whole people?

And who is to be benefitted by a forced observance of a religious day?

These are live questions, which it belongs to legislators and the whole people to consider.
