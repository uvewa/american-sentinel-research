"How many can repeat the names of the kings of France given as far as the last study?" questioned Professor Carman.

Every hand came up except Milly Brown's and Jennie Jacobs', who excused themselves by saying that they were sorry they had neglected to write them in their notebooks, but would surely do so and have them all learned before another lesson. After repeating them once more in concert, Charlie White said, eagerly:—

"Professor, we were learning about Hugh Capet. Will we hear a little more about him to-day?"

"Yes, Charlie; though I have more to tell you about his son Robert than about him. Hugh began to reign 987, and had a reign of nine years, that is, he was king in name, but he really was absolute ruler over only a little part of France directly around Paris. The nobles had all the rest,—a good example of the workings of the Feudal system.

"Once when one of his nobles displeased King Hugh, the king asked him, 'Who made you a count?' but the other had only to ask his liege lord, who made him 'a king' to effectually silence him. Hugh gained the respect of the nobles and of the clergy by his kindness and wisdom. Some of his relations are still living. May be they have hopes yet of ascending the throne of their illustrious ancestor."

"My! wouldn't they feel grand?" said romantic Milly Brown.

"Perhaps some of them may. All the world is making history very rapidly of late years."

"Robert the Pious, as he was called—the son of Hugh—well earned his title; for he was a kind and conscientious man, and altho' his reign of thirty-five years was marred by a period of religious persecution, still we are sure that poor Robert would not have allowed this if he had been better enlightened."

"I should have thought if Robert's wife had been as tender-hearted as he that they would both together have found out that religious persecution was a cruel thing."

"His first wife perhaps might have been a help to him; for they were tenderly attached to each other. But they were forced to a separation by the pope, and were both of them very miserable on account of it."

"What business had the pope to interfere with the king's private life, I'd like to know?" said Joe Palmeter.

"He made it his business, Joseph, and a miserable business it was. Poor Robert at last married a frivolous, vain woman named Constance. She wearied him with her continual scoldings, for she disliked to have him so charitable and liberal toward the needy. But poor Robert would indulge his desire to give to the poor, and even if he had no money about him, he would give away the very clothing he wore."

"Was it King Robert who once gave the silver ornaments which he wore on his lance to a poor beggar, and then told him to be sly and not let the queen know it?" asked Edna Phillips.

"Yes, it was King Robert, and when the stingy queen missed the ornaments, the king actually lacked the moral courage to tell her the truth, and denied knowing anything about it. At another time when he was eating, there was a hungry fellow under the table, and while the generous king was feeding him, as was his custom to do to the very poor, the ungrateful fellow cut a valuable gold ornament from off the king's clothes, and ran away, the king only remarking that it would do the poor fellow more good than it would him. Once, while the kind-hearted king was at his prayers in church, a thief cut off about half of the gold fringe which bordered the king's mantle before he said a word to him,—though he knew what the scamp was about perfectly well,—and then he only asked him to leave the other half for some one else."

"I wonder if the people appreciated so good a king," said Julia March.

"I fear not, for his was a stormy reign. Robert had also quite a talent for music and writing poetry, and when Queen Constance asked him to write her a song, he sang a Latin hymn, the first line of which, translated, means, 'O constancy of the martyrs,' and the ignorant queen was satisfied, hearing, as she supposed, her own name; but really the king was only laughing at her.

"This was about 1000 years after Christ. Now there were some of the people who, because of a passage of scripture in the book of Revelation, jumped to the conclusion that Christ was coming in the year 1000. The historian says that it is not strange that the people should have been frightened at the thought of the coming again of the Christ, for there was then existing such a state of frightful wickedness as had never been known on earth. The Catholic Church, which pretended to teach men good, set such an example of evil that instead of light, she was a body of the grossest darkness. Of course the Christ did not come, and then—"

"What did they do then?" asked Joe Palmeter, excitedly.

"Do?—The brief morality which they had practiced from a sense of fear was succeeded by a relapse from virtue, though really they were less wicked for quite a time, and the religious leaders did become somewhat purer in life and practice."

"Well, then, the excitement did do a little good," said Milly Brown.

"Yes, but it was the beginning of a dreadful season of religious persecution, in which, I am sorry to say, King Robert joined. The miserable Jews were driven from place to place, tortured, and put to death most cruelly."

"Did they do this out of a religious zeal?" queried Joe Palmeter. Joe could not reconcile the idea of loving God so well that people would be led to commit murder because of it, with his idea of right.

"Yes," said the professor, sadly, "yes; they forgot that Christ said, 'If ye love me, keep my commandments,' and that the sixth forbids murder."

"Well, mother says that the history of France will be repeated in our own country," said Charlie White, "but I hope that part of it—the religious persecution part of it—won't be."

"But I tell you I am afraid it will," said Joe Palmeter.

"There are already indications—strong ones—that Joseph is right," said Professor Carman, sadly. "But you are now dismissed until another week; and I hope you will try and remember what you have learned to-day, for there have been some things in this lesson of considerable importance."
