The following figures of Christian Endeavor progress are given in a New York religious journal:—

"The sixteenth year of the Christian Endeavor Society which closes this week has been the best year of all. Abroad, it has seen the inauguration of a United Society for India, Burma and Ceylon, the establishment of an Endeavor paper for India and of a number of Unions in South and North India. In South Africa the movement has received a great impetus. Great Britain has passed the 5,000 line; and from all the English colonies come reports of progress. The year shows an increase of 5,000 in the number of societies and of 250,000 in the membership."
