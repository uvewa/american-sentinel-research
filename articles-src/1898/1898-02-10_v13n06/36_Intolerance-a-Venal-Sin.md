The question of Roman Catholic interference in behalf of civil liberty for Protestants in Peru, who are denied the rights accorded to Catholics, is one that Protestants in this country have long been pressing upon the attention of representative Catholics here, and which seems to be causing the latter some trouble. The Catholic Citizen has finally admitted that intolerance on the part of Catholics in Peru, while not a mortal sin, is one which will send them at least as far down as Purgatory. The matter is set forth in the following from *The Independent* (N. Y.) of February 3:—

"We asked the help and the influence of our Catholic press to relieve the wrongs of native Protestants and American citizens in Peru, who are not allowed religious freedom in the matter of civil marriages. Our excellent contemporary, *The Catholic Citizen*, is the first to give answer, as follows:—

"That Peruvian Protestants and American citizens residing in Peru be permitted to marry there as here (divorcees excepted), and that their marriages be considered legal marriages. If the laws of Peru do not permit this, then those laws are unjust. Catholics concerned through any mistaken notion of zeal in obstructing remedial legislation will burn for it in Purgatory.'

"No answer could be more satisfactory, although we hesitate to indorse the penalty."
