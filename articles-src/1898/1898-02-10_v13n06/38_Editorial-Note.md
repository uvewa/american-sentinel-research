The writer who conducts the department of "good citizenship" in the *Voice* (N. Y.) says that "Perhaps the clearest thing in the minds of our forefathers in America was the importance of keeping forever separate the church and the state. And perhaps the muddiest reasoning ever done by the human brain was that by which we arrived at the imbecile and impossible corollary that pious standards were to be excluded from political duties."

If this does not mean that politics are to be conducted so as to suit the church, it is one of the "muddiest" paragraphs that have come under our observation. "Pious standards" in politics means church politics or it means nothing.
