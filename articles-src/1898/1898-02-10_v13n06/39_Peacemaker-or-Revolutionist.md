Under the heading, "The Arch Revolutionist," an English journal makes this comment on the latest attitude of the pope towards the Italian government:—

"The pope's Christmas allocution, as it is called, was all about his desire for 'peace,' and there was promise that his views would be further explained. And now the chief Vatican organ comes out boldly inviting a political revolution in Italy. The pope desires a 'real sovereignty' among the princes of this world, and cannot tolerate that a king should sit in Rome as head of the State. He suggests overthrowing the monarchy and setting up a republic, and in the confusion he would doubtless expect to make sure of dominating the republican federation. It shows the pope as the arch-revolutionist, stirring up strife, resisting the 'powers that be,' and generally making plain the anti-christian character of the papacy."
