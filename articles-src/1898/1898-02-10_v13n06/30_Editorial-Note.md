We have been asked if we would object to the "flag salute" provided the word "God" were left out of it. This is a question that is too indefinite to be answered definitely. As has been said, however, we do not object to a flag salute, in itself; but we do object to the salute in its present form, and it might be objectionable without containing the word "God." A salute which embodies nothing more than a recognition of the principles of liberty and justice upon which this Government was established, and for which the flag is supposed to stand, might be proper enough; and certainly the flag can claim no higher honor than to be recognized as the emblem of that which is noblest in human government.
