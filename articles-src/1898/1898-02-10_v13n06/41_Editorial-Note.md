The New York Independent, of January 27, voices our sentiments in the following:—

"We sympathize with the converted Jew who has been told that he must eat pork as a testimony that he is a real Christian, and who publishes his protest in the leading poem of a Jewish Christian magazine. It begins:

'Oh, must we eat the flesh of swine,
Because, Lord Jesus, we are thine?'

It is not at all necessary."

There would be a good many more Jews converted to Christianity if they were not given to understand they must as Christians do some things that Christ not only never commanded, but that are positively against his precepts.
