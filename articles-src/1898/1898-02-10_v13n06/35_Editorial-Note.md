A movement is now in progress in New York City "to lessen the amount of Sunday labor, due to the increasing tendency to open shops on that day." "Many proprietors say that they would be glad to close, but are forced to keep open by their customers, many of them church people."

That is, the fear of losing a little trade forces them to work on the day they profess to believe in as the Christian Sabbath. Something to put a little backbone into such people, is the thing that is needed.
