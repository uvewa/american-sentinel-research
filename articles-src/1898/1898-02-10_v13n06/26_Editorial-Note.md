They are worthy of note as illustrating the worthless character of a profession of religion by the Government. For they do amount to a profession of religion. To trust in God is to be religious in the fullest sense of the word; and the inscription is a governmental declaration of trust in God. It might be asked, In what god? and this not being specified, room is left for the suggestion which some persons have made that, if we may judge from the practice of the great majority of the people, the real meaning is—or should be—"In [this] god we trust." The people do trust in something; and if the majority do not trust in money more than in anything else, the observations of many good minds are certainly at fault. However we may look at it, we can find nothing to demonstrate the propriety of this bit of governmental procedure.
