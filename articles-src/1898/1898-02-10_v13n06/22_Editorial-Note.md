EPISCOPAL BISHOP NICHOLSON, of Milwaukee, Wis., has come out with a protest in the name of the church against the practice of referring to the naming of war ships as "christeninge." Christening, he holds, means coming to Christ; its use in connection with ships is blasphemy, and he would not be surprised to hear that the battleship "Kentucky" had gone down by reason of the profanation. The bishop says nothing about the country at large, though the majority of ecclesiastics are accustomed to take the name of Christ in vain by calling the United States a Christian nation. Why should not a man-of-war be christened as well as the ship of state?—Truth Seeker.
