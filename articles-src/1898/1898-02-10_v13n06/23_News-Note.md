A cable dispatch from London to the New York Sun under date of February 5, gives the following: "The French authorities have decided to abandon the inscription on coins, which, since the days of the Consulate, has been Dieu protège La France [France, the favored of God]. Sacrilegious English journals suggest that the Czar will do as well." Of course, France is not the only nation that is the protège of God; that could not seriously be claimed. Each of the "Christian nations" is—in its own view and upon its own authority—the favored one of Heaven. And in fairness, the claim must be allowed to all alike.
