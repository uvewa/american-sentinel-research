Mr. Brown.—Good morning, neighbor Smith; what's this you are working on? What are you trying to do by heaping up this mountain of brick?

Mr. Smith.—Why, friend Brown, I'm going to have a very fine building; one of the finest that was ever made, when it's finished.

Mr. Brown.—Y-e-s; but it don't look like much of anything now; I should say it was in pretty bad shape for a building.

Mr. Smith.—Oh, yes, it does look so just now; but it's going to look a great deal better pretty soon.

Mr. Brown.—But you're not doing any brick laying, my friend; you're having the brick just dumped down onto the top of the mass in heaps.

Mr. Smith.—Oh, I'm not paying any attention to the individual brick; that method is out of date. The individual is nothing; it's the mass that counts.

Mr. Brown.—U-u-m, I see. Well, I don't think your building will be a success.

Mr. Smith.—You're a pessimist, Brown; I've no patience with a person who still clings to that old doctrine of individualism. Come around two or three weeks later, and you'll see that I know what I am doing. Good morning.

Mr. Brown.—Good morning.

Moral.—The best government, like the best building, is that in which most careful attention is bestowed upon the individual constituents that enter into it.
