Without life, gold is of no possible value; yet men will risk life in the most reckless fashion to get possession of this metal. There is something about the love of money which tends to warp the judgment as well as the conscience, and that to a most dangerous degree. Carried to the extreme, it presents to us the sad and incomprehensible picture of the miser who, for fear of experiencing want and hunger through deprivation of money, voluntarily put himself in that very condition and keeps himself there till death results. Certainly is not hard to see, in the light of many circumstances, the wisdom of the Scripture which mentions the love of money as a thing of which we are to beware.
