It is for this reason, and this alone, that the flag can be worthy of honor. This is a great nation, it is true; but mere greatness is not a thing to be honored. Rome was a great nation—so great that she ruled the world—but we would hardly think of paying homage to the Roman eagles. It is goodness, not greatness, that makes anything worthy of recognition; and the flag would be just as worthy of honor were this the weakest and most insignificant nation on earth, but founded on the principles of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, instead of being, as it is to day, one of the greatest and most influential. But in saluting the flag what thought is uppermost in the minds of the children,—that of the principles of civil liberty for which our forefathers contended? or of how big and powerful we have grown to be among the nations of the earth?
