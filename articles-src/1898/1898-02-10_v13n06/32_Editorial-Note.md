There is nothing more essential to the welfare of the country than that these principles of civil liberty should be recognized and put in practice by all the people, both young and old. But that the flag salute contributes anything to this end we have no evidence for believing. On the contrary there is evidence that it tends to revive that sectional animosity which can have no place in free government. Moreover, as an indication of real patriotism, the salute is of no value; it stands only on a par with formalism in religion. Principles—the principles of right and manly conduct—are the things of value. Beside these, all sentimental forms and ceremonies sink into insignificance.
