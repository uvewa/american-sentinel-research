"Present Truth," London, Eng.

In a plea for a united and vigorous effort for Sunday closing, in view of the fact that Parliament soon meets, a writer says in one of the religious journals: "Against the united voices of the Christian churches of our land, no government dare turn a deaf ear." We have been searching the Bible with the special object of finding where Christ or Christians ever made even a covert threat against the government if it did not meet their mind, and we find no such thing. We do find these words of Christ: "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not." John 12:47. We are therefore forced to conclude that the Christianity which that writer has in mind is a sort that has come up since the days of Christ and the apostles. Beware of it.
