THE Independent (N. Y.), of April 28, prints the following from a correspondent touching the treatment meted out to dissenters in "holy Russia," where the theory that religion and the state should be united is carried into full effect:—

"A poor fellow named Simerenko has arrived in Tulcha in Rumania, having escaped from Russia, where he had been cruelly tortured by his neighbors for leaving the Orthodox Church and joining the brethren [Stundists]. His hands and feet were tied, and then he was strung up to a rafter in the ceiling, in which position burning cigarettes were put on his naked body until he yelled in his agony. The torturers told him they would let him go if he abjured Stundism and returned to the Church. When about to cut him down they first cut the cords attaching his head to the rafter. His head came down with such force that he was almost rendered senseless, and from that day to this he suffers pains in the back of his head. On another occasion his head and hands were fastened in a vise and over fifty wounds were made on his bare back with hot irons. The brethren in Tulcha have seen the scars. On yet another occasion his wife, who was with child, was violated by the peasants. It seems that all this was done with the connivance, at any rate, of the local village authorities. As soon as Simerenko could he fled; and, as I have already said, he is now in safety in Tulcha, but in abject need."
