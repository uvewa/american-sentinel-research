When the class again assembled for their customary chat, Milly Brown raised her hand.

"Please, professor, about what time did the facts happen which you told us about last week?"

"I can tell, I believe," volunteered Jennie Jacobs. "I think it was about the year 1300."

"A little later than that, Jennie," corrected her teacher; "the lesson closed with the history of 1345, or very near that time. The people of France being very much frightened and disheartened by the horrors of the Black Death, began casting about in their minds, to discover some cause of it, or some way to check its frightful ravages. At last they came to the conclusion that the nation was so wicked that the Deity could endure it no longer, and so had determined to punish the people with war and pestilence. So they decided to help matters by inflicting punishment upon themselves. A class of fanatics sprung up, called 'Flagellants,' who took it upon themselves to appease the Deity by wandering about half naked, and whipping themselves with whips, which had steel on the ends of the lashes. This they did until the blood would run down their naked shoulders."

"I should think that the French people would not have allowed such work," said Charlie White, indignantly.

"They did put a stop to it at last, or rather, the pope did, for even he grew tired of their dreadful excesses."

"Well, did this stop the pestilence?" asked practical Jack.

"Indeed it did not, Jack," replied Professor Carman, "and it seems strange to us now as we look back over the centuries, how any one could have been so foolish as to believe and practice such follies, when nothing but the blood of Christ will pay the debt of sin. Even an angel's death and suffering would not atone for sinful man; how much less then can we, by self torture or penance, pay the debt for ourselves."

"It reminds me of what I read quite often in the papers," interrupted Joe Palmeter. "Some people say that all the trouble this country has is caused by the careless way folks keep Sunday. So they propose to make a law forbidding anyone doing any work, and making them go to church, whether they want to or not. O, I guess this country is quite a little bit like France was in the days of the Flagellants; don't you think so, professor?"

"Your argument seems to prove your point pretty well, Joseph."

"But don't you think people ought to keep the Sabbath?" asked Milly Brown, with a shocked manner.

"O yes, Milly; but I think I am right when I say that I believe it to be very offensive in the sight of God, to coerce or force anybody against his will in such matters. God says he delights to be worshiped in spirit and in truth,—which worship is prompted by love alone,—not by force.

"The wife of King Philip died of the plague, and when at last it began to abate, he married again. These wedding festivals must be attended to, even though the nation itself wore a badge of mourning on account of war and pestilence. To pay for these, the wretched people were taxed anew, and it was without doubt a relief to them when King Philip died, directly after his wedding."

"Did he leave any son to take his throne?" asked Edna Philips, who had kept a careful record of the kings, from Clovis.

"Yes; his name was John, and he was very inappropriately called The Good. He began his reign in 1350, and reigned fourteen years. The last words of his father to him were not words of good advice,—to rule his kingdom wisely, and to be warned by his own sad failures,—but he died urging his son to maintain his right to the kingdom at all hazards and against all rivals.

"John knew that France was in a sad condition, but he was a foolish, extravagant fellow, and imagined that if he would just make a journey through his country and let the poor people gaze upon his royal face, it would help things amazingly. So out he started over the plague-blackened and war-distracted country to have a good time and hold tournaments, which by the way, the people must pay for."

"Will you please tell us what tournaments were?" questioned Harry Ray.

"They were a kind of mock fight between a number of people and were once quite in vogue."

"I should think King Edward of England had given the people as much real fighting as they needed by this time, without any make-believe fights," said Edward Barnaby.

"Indeed; and even then there was real fighting enough that he could do if he liked, for Edward was still in the country; but John did not consult the people or trouble to ask them what their wishes were in the matter. Of course all this fuss did not help the people to pay their heavy taxes, nor did it put food into the mouths of the famished wretches, or wipe the blinding tears from their eyes, or put hope into their disconsolate hearts."

"King John must have been a very silly sort of fellow," said Jack Smith.

"Yes; and one reason for this was, he had been fond of light reading all his life, Jack," answered Professor Carman, "and so his head was full of trashy ideas. That, you know, my boys and girls, will almost always have the same effect. Those who indulge in reading trashy books and stories are apt to grow to be as foolish and addle-pated as King John. And certain it is that no one in this day of good books and cheap printing has any excuse for reading trash of any kind.

"King John was perfectly happy if he was only surrounded by gay ladies who flattered him and humored his foolish vanity."

"I presume he thought he was as great a man as Charlemagne himself," smiled Joe Palmeter.

"I dare say he did. But it seems to me that instead of John the Good, he should have been called John the Foolish."
