SIGNOR CRISPI, ex-Prime Minister of Italy, and generally recognized as Italy's greatest statesman, is quoted as saying that the decadence of Spain is due primarily to the Roman Catholic religion. "The prime cause of Spain's condition is the general state of ignorance—in the upper, as well as in the lower classes. It is the priesthood, absolutely sovereign everywhere, which has led that fine country into ruin." Such is the statement recently given by the ex premier to a press representative in an interview touching the probable results of the war.

Signor Crispi is not an opponent of the Catholic religion. In the same interview he said, as quoted: "The Catholic religion is indeed a beautiful religion. Christianity has done much good. But through an ever retrograde spirit the clergy has done irreparable damage to the Latin races." The view of this eminent observer is not biased by religious hostility. It is not colored by Protestantism. It is the view of one who though a confessed admirer of the Catholic religion, sees too plainly the facts of which he speaks to speak as one who confounds that religion with Christianity might naturally be expected to do. And it is the truth observed from the eminence of position of a statesman, which commands a clearer and broader view than that of the ordinary man.

It is worth while also to note some of the views held by this eminent man regarding the present outlook for the world, to which he gave expression in this connection. "If the United States," he said, "defeat Spain, as is probable, they will be obliged, in order to maintain their position, to have recourse to costly armaments; and Europe, which is looking forward to the time of actual disarmament, will more than ever be plunged into an endless expense. After armies for lands the navies must now be increased. Where it will stop I do not know. In any case it seems to me that the war has in store some unpleasant surprises."

In reply to a question relative to European intervention, Signor Crispi said that in Europe "anarchy is dominant everywhere;" that "to speak frankly, there is no Europe; the 'European concert' is only a sinister joke;" and that "nothing can be expected from the concert of Powers."

But "we must," he added, "have confidence in the future."

The world offers no source from which confidence in the future can be drawn. The source of such confidence is supplied alone by Christianity.
