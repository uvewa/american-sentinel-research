It is a significant fact that the tremendous and unceasing preparations for war which are in progress the world over, call up even in the minds of the irreligious the words of prophetic Scripture which connect "wars and rumors of wars" with the troublous times of the last days of the world. The following in a recent issue of a London (Eng.) secular journal, the Evening News, is an illustration. It points out what is being done by only one of the great Powers, England, and that at a time when "Her Majesty's government"—as stated in England's proclamation of neutrality a few days ago—is happily at peace with all other civilized governments. The News says:—

"'Wars and rumors of wars' is an ancient prophecy with nearly two thousand birthdays; and judging from the strange stories which are floating about just now, the latter part of the prophecy is being fulfilled with a vengeance. Eyes are at this moment naturally being turned toward the government dockyards and factories, and any extra activity in them is attributed to impending warfare.

"Woolwich Arsenal is extremely busy at present, busier than it has been probably for half a century, for England has been making ready for the worst for some years.

"For two years, at any rate, work at the Arsenal has not ceased day or night in several of the departments.

"One good reason for this is the keen competition of the rival Powers.

"Altogether there are at the Arsenal some 17,000 employés, and about 4,000 of them are engaged in night work, starting at six in the evening and leaving at five in the morning, three of these hours are overtime, and the day workers are doing about the same extra work.

"In the torpedo factory there are 400 men working overtime; there are the same number in the fuse factory, and, so far as can be ascertained, other departments are proportionately busy.

"But overtime at the Arsenal is not a novelty, and has caused no trepidation or anxiety among the employés. The more work the more pay, and the

### STEADY INCREASE OF WORK

has done good all round. Through overtime the engineers, says one of the men, have made £4 a week, skilled laborers £2 5s., and unskilled men £1 10s.

"A casual visitor to Woolwich with the China situation in his mind might see in the bright glare at the Arsenal the beacon of a coming warfare, in which all the nations of the earth shall participate. Those who live in Woolwich are used to this, however, for they have seen the factories lighted up for the last two years or more.

"Nevertheless the employés at the Arsenal are working with increased energy just now.

"The War Office has ordered half a million cartridges a week in excess of last year, bringing the total weekly output up to 2,000,000.

"In the fuse factory the men are engaged on 2,500 fuses of one make, and 1,800 of another, and orders have been received to push along with the quick firing guns.

"Many of the orders on which the men are working are not of a very recent date, but by April it is anticipated that the men will be busier than ever they have been before."

The children of the world are still wiser in their generation than the professed "children of light."
