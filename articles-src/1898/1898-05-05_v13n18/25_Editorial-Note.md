A NEW YORK CITY daily which has earnestly labored to promote the war which is now begun, gives this quotation and credit, which is more pertinent than the paper intends it to be:—

> "My sentence is for open war."
> —Milton.

The quotation is from "Paradise Lost," and the words are there given as emanating from a council of devils. What seems to be the language of a Milton, often has its real authority from the devil.
