THE NEW YORK Sun mentions that "a number of young men, who were formerly members of the Second Company, Boys' Brigade, of the First Presbyterian Church in Jersey City, have organized a company of volunteers and offered themselves as a nucleus for the regiment the Board of Trade proposes to organize," etc. The "Boys' Brigade" business is calculated to train the boys for actual war and to develop in them the military spirit which longs for the experience of real conflict.
