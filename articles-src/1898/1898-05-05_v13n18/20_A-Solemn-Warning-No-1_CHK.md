*BY C. H. KESLAKE.*

"AND the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name." Rev. 14:9-11.

Such is the message that God gives against the worshiping of the beast and of his image, which is brought to view in chapter 13.

The beast, as has been abundantly shown in previous articles, is the papacy. The essential feature of the papacy is the union of church and state, with the church using the power of the state for the furtherance of its own aims, and with a man at the head of the church sitting in the place of God.

Also it has been shown that the "two-horned" beast (verse 11) represents the United States. That being so, it will be seen that this Government is to make an image to the beast—or papacy. See verse 14.

An image to the papacy would be a union of church and state, with the church predominant.

Furthermore, it has been shown that Sunday is the mark of the papacy. It is, therefore, against these things that the Lord solemnly warns his people.

Not a few doubtless will turn aside from these things and treat them with derision. Every reform of gospel work has been treated thus.

But the supreme danger that this will be done lies in the fact that Sunday has been so long observed as the "Christian Sabbath," that to the minds of many it would seem impossible that such awful results should follow. The temptation, therefore, would be to conclude that Sunday cannot be the mark of the papacy.

This might on the surface seem plausible; but it is not sound reasoning.

It cannot be denied (1) that there is not a single command in all the Bible for Sunday observance—expressed or implied: (2) that the papacy bases its claim to have the power to command men under sin, upon having the power to change the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week, and that consequently Sunday is the mark of its power: (3) that there is now, at this very time, a strong organized effort to have Sunday enforced by law in the United States, and that it is the only thing sought to be enforced that is called a "mark."

The position is therefore impregnable, the logic invincible, that it is against Sunday as the mark of the papacy that the prophecy speaks.

This proves two things; (1) that notwithstanding Sunday has so long been venerated by Christians, there are principles involved in this question that the people of God have not yet seen or understood; (2) it proves the long-suffering of the Lord in that the true Sabbath has been trodden under foot so long—innocently of course on the part of God's people—and a pseudo Sabbath allowed to stand in its way.

There are thousands of Christians who do not realize that ages before the papacy substituted Sunday in the place of the Sabbath of the Bible, it was kept as a pagan festival. The origin of the day is set forth by its name—Sunday, the day of the sun—"the wild solar holiday of all pagan times."

It was the day especially devoted to the worship of the sun, which was "the oldest, the most widespread, and the most enduring of all the forms of idolatry known to man."

The limits of this article forbid an extended study in detail of what sun-worship really is. Our purpose is simply to give a few general statements concerning sun-worship in order that the reader may see the true character of the day that has for so long usurped the place of the true Sabbath.

That sun-worship was regarded by the Lord as the most abominable form of idolatry can be seen in Ezekiel, chapter 8. The prophet was shown various forms of idolatry, each in their turn being called a "greater abomination" than the preceding one, until he was shown the greatest abomination of them all. Thus we read in verses 15, 16: "Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these. And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshiped the sun toward the east."

Inasmuch as they turned their backs upon the temple of the Lord as they worshiped the sun toward the east, it will be readily seen that sun-worship involves turning their backs upon God.

Sun-worship in Egypt, in its various forms—as Phtah at Memphis; Tum at Heliopolis; Amun Ra at Thebes, etc., was the prevailing religion. And it was so in other nations under different names. But wherever it was, or under whatever name, it was accompanied with the most lacivious rites—rites too revolting to be named.
