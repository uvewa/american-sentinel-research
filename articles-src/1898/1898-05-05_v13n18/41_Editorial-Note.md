The effort to enact a strict Sunday law for the province of Manitoba, Canada, seems not to have met with much success. A long and heated controversy has been in progress there over the question but the committee of the legislature who were given charge of the proposed measure finally decided upon radical changes from the provisions of the bill as presented to them, so that but little if any addition is made by it to the law now in force. The bill as thus amended has passed the House.
