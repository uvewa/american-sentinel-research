"MAMA, I have been reading the 13th of Revelation to day, and I am anxious to know what government the beast with the two horns represents."

"You remember, Charlie, that the 13th chapter opens with a description of the beast. We have already located the beast as a symbol of the papacy, or the system of control that includes a union of church and state, the enforcing of religious observances by the power of the law."

"Yes, mama, I think it was made very plain up to the time that papal power was broken in 1798 by the captivity and death of the pope and the overthrow of his temporal power."

"That brought us to the 10th verse. You may read that verse, Charlie."

"He that leadeth into captivity, shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword."

"We have already recalled his captivity, and the time of his overthrow."

"At that time what does the prophet behold?"

"And I beheld another beast coming up."

"You may pause there, Charlie, and in 1798, take a bird's eye view of the world. Under the symbol of the beast with ten horns, we have the old world established. No new government is springing up into power. The dominions under the ten kingdoms took in the world with one exception. Can you tell me what the one exception was?"

"Yes, the United States."

"When did the United States become independent?"

"In 1776."

"From that time until now it may be described as coming up. Its power in the world so far, has ever been in the ascendency, commercially, educationally, and religiously. The world has looked toward the United States, and all nations have been influenced by her policy."

"You may read on, Charlie. Where does this Government seem to spring from?"

"Out of the earth," read Charlie.

"Where did the beast come from?"

"From the sea."

"You recall the fact that water is a symbol of multi-tudes, nations, and tongues as we learn in Rev. 17:15.

"The beast rose from an inhabited place, and merely organized the people, nations and tongues into its own spirit and system. The government symbolized under the two-horned beast grows out of the earth, as a plant. This is the original meaning of the verb. From the time of the landing of the pilgrims, who fled from the oppression of the beast for 'freedom to worship God,' until the present hour, the United States has been growing as a plant, reaching out its roots into unacquired soil, spreading its branches into new atmosphere.

"What is the next specification?"

"And he had two horns like a lamb."

"What is the chief characteristic of a lamb?"

"Harmlessness, meekness, inoffensiveness, I should say."

"Yes. What difference is marked between these horns like a lamb and the ten horns?"

"The ten horns represent the monarchical form of government. But the two horns of the lamb represent something inoffensive and full of liberty. For what two civil and religious principles has our Government stood as a distinctive exponent?"

"For the principles of civil and religious liberty."

"Yes; in our country the value of the principles enunciated by Christ has been demonstrated, and these two principles may well be represented by the harmless symbol here presented. Christ bade men to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. Church and state have been kept separate by these harmless principles that have their origin in the Lamb of God. Had they always been inculcated in the functions of government, the bloody acts that have disgraced the annals of history would never have appeared. The Constitution of our country forbids Congress the making of laws that will prohibit men the free use of their religious rights, to worship God according to the dictates of their conscience, does not require any religious test to qualify for office, and holds all men equal before the law."

"O, but mama, times have changed since Thomas Jefferson and the framers of our Constitution lived. If religious tests are not now required, it certainly will not be long before they will be required. Can't you see yourself that a great change has come over the people? Last summer all the ministers preached on religious legislation, and urged the church to take a lively interest in politics, and especially to vote for the enforcement of Sunday laws. They even enrolled their congregation by a standing vote as in favor of petitioning Congress for such enforcement. Bills and bills have been presented. Here is a note from a late paper that says, 'Strong organizations are being marshaled to get the passage of a Sunday rest bill.' Petitions are going to Congress for a reversal of the principles of civil and religious liberty."

"Yes, Charlie, I have seen all this; but did not know that you were becoming so well informed. This very change is indicated by the prophet. What inconsistent combination do we find in the symbol?"

"And he spake as a dragon."

"Here is foretold a striking reversal of policy. The inconsistency of the symbols has already been made clear in the manner in which dissenters have been treated. The Puritans banished Roger Williams, whipped Quakers, and burned witches; and though men have laughed at the idea that this wonderful Government should ever again indulge in the spirit of the Dark Ages, yet in the last ten years observers of the seventh day Sabbath have suffered for their faith by the enforcement of religious laws that conflicted with the law of God. Men have languished in prison, and have died as the result. In the South they have been relegated to the chain gang, dependent women and children have been the victims of religious bigotry backed by unrighteous legislation. Some of the leaders in the movement for Sunday enforcement have put themselves on record as determined to push such legislation for the sole purpose of oppression. Of course the masses who are not acquainted with history, who do not understand prophecy, who cannot see the logical outcome of a union of church and state in our land, honestly think that Sunday laws would be a great benefit. Brought up to regard Sunday as a holy day, it pains them to see it turned into a holiday. Avaricious employers take advantage of our freedom, to compel their employés to labor, and the zealous Reformers, some honestly and some dishonestly, plead for the working man's right to rest one day in seven."

"Well, that's so, mama; it does seem as if the people's right to rest would be interfered with unless some kind of a law could be established."

"Charlie, who gave men a right to rest one day in seven?"

"God did."

"Cannot the God who gave protect that right?"

"Yes, mama; but"—

"But there's no but about it. Who could take away my right to observe the Sabbath, or the rest that God has given? It is simply a matter of asserting and claiming the right that is involved."

"But, mama, if a working man did assert and claim his right, he would be thrown out of his position, and starvation for himself and family would stare him in the face."

"No, indeed, Charlie; God provides for such an emergency. He says, 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.' The right to rest, and there can be no Sabbath rest without worship, is based solely on the command of God. This command must be obeyed by faith that acknowledges its possessor wholly dependent on God. He who claims he cannot exercise his God-given rights without the power of human law, casts reproach upon God. All are free to do what God commands, and he who is all powerful, all wise, all love, will take care of the consequences."

"O, mama, I see the principle; but how hard it will be for the world to acknowledge it. The enforcement of Sabbath observance by human law would indeed be an interference with God's government, an insult to heaven. And yet," Charlie spoke slowly, "and yet those who stand stiffly for God's honor in this matter, will surely hear the voice of the dragon."

"Yes," said Mrs. Ross, "but they will also hear a voice from heaven, saying, 'This is my beloved Son.' 'Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have a right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the city."
