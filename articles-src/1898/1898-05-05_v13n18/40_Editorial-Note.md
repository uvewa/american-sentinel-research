A colony of the Waldenses, whose history adds a long and thrilling chapter to the annals of religious persecution, has been established in what is called the Piedmont Section of the Tennessee mountains. The colony owns ten thousand acres of forest and cleared land, and have built a thriving town, which is called Valdese. They observe Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter; and also the 17th day of February, which is their "emancipation day."
