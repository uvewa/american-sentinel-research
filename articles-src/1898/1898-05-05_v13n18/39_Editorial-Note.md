In the present crisis England and the United States—the representatives of Anglo-Saxon civilization—have drawn together, and it is well understood that an unwritten but nevertheless actual alliance exists between the two great divisions of English speaking people. And this leaves the rest of the world in another division,—a division which does not represent Anglo Saxon ideas and institutions, but those of autocracy and despotism. And in the light of the fact that these two great divisions of civilization represent respectively the camps of liberty and of despotism, it is evident that it was not by chance that the English speaking race has spread its rule over so large a portion of the habitable globe, while the once-great empire of Spain has shrunk up to its present insignificant dimensions.
