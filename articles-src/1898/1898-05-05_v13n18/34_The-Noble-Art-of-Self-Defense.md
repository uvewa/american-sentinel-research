"Do you think it would be wrong for me to learn the noble art of self-defense?" a religiously-inclined youth inquired of his pastor.

"Certainly not," answered the minister; "I learned it in youth myself, and I have found it of great value during my life."

"Indeed, sir! did you learn the old English system, or Sullivan's system?"

"Neither. I learned Solomon's system."

"Solomon's system?"

"Yes; you will find it laid down in the first verse of the fifteenth chapter of Proverbs: 'A soft answer turneth away wrath.' It is the best system of self-defense of which I know."

Cultivate consideration for the feelings of other people if you would not have your own injured. Those who complain most of ill-usage are those who abuse themselves and others oftenest."—Sel.
