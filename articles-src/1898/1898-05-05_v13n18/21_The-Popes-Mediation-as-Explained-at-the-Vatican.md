*"The Ram's Horn." Chicago.*

Those who looked with misgiving upon the spectacle of the Roman pontiff acting as an intermediary between the United States and Spain, have found ample grounds for their fears in the later developments of that controversy. The authorized organ of the Vatican publishes the dispatches which related to the inner history of papal machinations at Washington and Madrid. The first is a note, dated April 9, sent by the Spanish minister for foreign affairs, Señor Gullon, to Monsignor Merry del Val, the papal chamberlain, requesting him to inform the papal secretary of state, Cardinal Rampolla, so that the latter might communicate it to the pope, that the Spanish government, "in consequence of the ardent, noble and repeated urgings of the pope," had decided to order Captain-General Blanco to "concede immediately a suspension of hostilities for the period which his prudence may deem fit, with the view to prepare for and facilitate peace."

In reply to the above, the papal secretary of state directed the papal representative at Madrid to—

"Thank the Spanish government, in the name of the pope, and be good enough to assure it that the pope will not fail to use his influence where the occasion offers in order that the legitimate wishes of the Spanish government may be realized and the prestige of the noble Catholic nation be unimpaired."

Our Roman contemporary concludes the publication of its series of documents with a dispatch from Washington dated April 11, the source of which is not indicated, saying:—

"The suspension of hostilities has produced an excellent impression. I have no doubt of the maintenance of peace. We shall have bellicose speeches in Congress, but without results. The influence of the pope in obtaining the armistice is fully recognized by the American people, and is hailed with gratitude."
