THE following item from the Inter Ocean (Chicago) states the outcome of the controversy in Ohio over the question of Sunday baseball:—

"The law prohibiting the playing of baseball Sunday was sustained by the Supreme Court in the case of John Powell against the State yesterday at Columbus, Ohio. Powell was arrested at Cleveland, but his case was dismissed by the common pleas judge, who held that the law was invalid. The prosecuting attorney excepted to this ruling, and the Supreme Court sustained the exceptions, dismissing Powell's petition. A member of the court is authority for the statement that the principle applies also to Sunday theatricals."
