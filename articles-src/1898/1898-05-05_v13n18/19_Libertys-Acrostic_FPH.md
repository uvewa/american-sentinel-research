*BY FRED PARDIE HANCHETT.*

"We, the people,"—sons and daughters of patriot sires,—should

Hold firmly to the vital truths which they upheld of yore.

These principles—maintain'd through many tribulations, are

Truths born of Heaven, and are older than the hills. The right

To have, and to enjoy liberty, to gain knowledge, to

Be free!—free to think, to speak and to act!—such, indeed, is

Self evident liberty! Such liberty is ours by

That law which says: "There is no respect of persons with God."

All are born free and equal. Despotism was unknown till

Men sought to establish religions of their own. In such

Are the seeds of priestly assumption and intolerance.

Created as we are, with a free moral nature, with

Equal rights in earth and the Heav'n to come, it is not well

That men should order the ethical bearing of others.

They that assume the prerogative to such a calling,

Are ever obnoxious to all thoughtful Independence.

Endowed by Omnipotence with those qualifications

By which men are enabled to judge the right and the wrong,

Their claim to office, or assent to plain untruths, mock the

Creator who, in His great wisdom, saw fit to bless all

With individuality—with sacred "rights" which a

Certain just—perhaps inspir'd soul—chose to designate as

"Unalienable," because of divine origin. Those

"Rights"—under church rule, live not. No slav'ry so abject as

That 'neath ecclesiastical despotism—an evil

Among other evils, now threat'ning the precious weal of

These United States. It is clearly assur'd us that we

Are "created in Jesus Christ," the all-potent Source of

Life, True Light and Liberty. Then let us "stand fast in that

Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free;" and, by all just

And valid means, endeavor to render innocuous

The efforts of would-be religious legislators. In

Pursuit of that liberty warranted to citizens

Of this Union, one should not forget that the basis of

Happiness lies in the freedom of a soul's convictions:

That Bigotry, Ballots and Bullets can never dictate

To Conscience a prescrib'd course of spiritual action.

Secure, heretofore, in the full and free enjoyment of

These rare blessings, men see not the threat'ning evil; yet their

Right s are in danger. Is the pow'r of God declining, that

Governments assume the execution of His laws? What

Are the duties of a just and progressive government,

Instituted for the general good? Are they to raise

Among the people, inquisitorial fires in which

Men and women shall again die for their faith? Are they

Deriving incomes from excesses of the people? Does

Their duty—the government's, rest in making men loyal,

Just, pious, by law, and pronouncing judgment on sin?

When

Powers of earth pretend to such Divine authority,

From whom is it deriv'd? What does it signify? Away

The union of church and state! No true American will

Consent to such ignoble slav'ry. Sanctification

Of man through compulsion, must nauseate e'en man himself.

"The law of the wise is a fountain of life;" and to be

Govern'd wisely, is to live at most "perfect" liberty.

San Francisco, Cal.
