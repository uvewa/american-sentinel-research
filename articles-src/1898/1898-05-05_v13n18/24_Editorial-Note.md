A WRITER in a journal devoted to the cause of Sunday legislation, notes the increasing desecration of the "Sabbath" in the United States, and adds that "the wickedness of the West is surely, but slowly, traveling East."

To which it may properly be added that it will be a very good thing for the West if the wickedness of the East can be prevented from traveling in that direction. For there is as much more wickedness in the East than in the West as there are more sinners in the East than in the West, and there are more sinners in the East than in the West for the simple reason that the East is more thickly populated.

It is characteristic of this National Reform standard of righteousness that it overlooks the wickedness of the "scribes and pharisees," while being profoundly shocked at the sins of the publicans. But the latter are the more righteous of the two classes.
