A ROMAN Catholic priest, of Kingston, N. Y., having said in some remarks made at a funeral address, that it was the duty of every loyal Catholic to take up arms against the United States in case of war with Spain, the Catholic authorities there and at other places in the State have made almost frantic haste to disclaim his utterances as voicing the sentiment of the Catholic Church. They have taken the occasion to pose as fighting patriots of the most pronounced type, ready to follow the American flag in the bitterest opposition to the interests of that most Catholic nation—Spain. And that they are, for the most part, sincere in these protestations, we do not doubt.

It seems to have been realized by the Catholic authorities that there was a logic behind the priest's remarks that would strongly appeal to the credibility of the American people. Unquestionably, consistency demands that all Catholics remain at least friendly to Spain; for, as every person knows, Spain is joined in close union with the Catholic Church; and what does a union of church and state amount to if each of these is not to support the other? Spain does support the Catholic Church; that is beyond question. Shall the Catholic Church now refuse her support in Spain's extremity? We do not pretend to say what she will do; but we say that she cannot consistently withhold her active support from Spain when that "most Christian government" and faithfully of the church is threatened with harm from the forces of a foreign power. Especially must this be true when that foreign power is, in its principles of government, anti-papal.

EVERY Catholic, therefore, whatever may be his personal feelings and preferences, is as certainly bound to uphold Spain as he is bound to be loyal to his church. He is bound to do this or repudiate his religion altogether. It is a cardinal principle of that religion that church and state ought to be united; and in harmony with that principle the Catholic Church and Spain have for centuries been closely united. And no Catholic can now repudiate the principle of church and state union, and the union of the Catholic Church with Spain in particular, and still be a loyal member of the Catholic Church. By the very act of repudiating that principle, he would proclaim himself a Protestant.

It is religion, above all things, that determines an individual's course of action. In the very nature of things this must be so. Religious obligations are recognized as the highest and most sacred. Dealing as they do with eternity as well as with time—with affairs and interests that infinitely surpass in magnitude those of this temporal world—they take hold upon the mind and heart as nothing else can; they command the deepest emotions of the soul. In his sympathies, and the conduct through which these find expression, an individual therefore may be expected to respond first of all to the demands of his religion. The sincere Catholic is a Catholic before everything else. The religionist of any name—if he is sincere—puts the claims of his religion before all others. This is only what every religion demands.
