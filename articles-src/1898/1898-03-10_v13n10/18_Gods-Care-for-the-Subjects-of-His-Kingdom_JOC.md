After the overthrow of the ten tribes, Judah alone was left as the remnant of Abraham's seed, by which to prove the stability of God's promise. To remove that people by force from the land in which God had placed them, would, in Satan's mind, be to defeat the plan embraced in the promise to Abraham. Divine prescience foresaw the effort that would be made in this direction, and through the prophet Jeremiah forewarned that people of their impending calamity, but told them, however, that they should again return from their captivity.

From the earliest moment of that prophet's ministry, he was charged to reveal the true situation of matters to that people. He therefore told them that evil out of the north was sure to come unless they returned to God. Jer. 1:14; 4:6. But even though they were removed from their possession, he told them that, if they would but be true to Him to whom they had been married, He would in due time bring them back from that northern country of captivity to the land which had been given to their fathers for an inheritance. Jer. 3:14–18.

To Abraham God had said that his seed should return to the land of promise after four hundred years. Gen. 15:13–16. To Judah, however, the promise was that they should return from their captivity at the end of seventy years. Jer. 25:9–11. God assured them, through the prophet, that he would not forsake them, because of his "everlasting" love for them, and so would positively bring them back again from the north country to which they would be carried by the oppressor. Jer. 31:3–9.

As was predicted, in due time the king of Babylon came at the head of an army to Jerusalem, took away its treasures, and led captive the inhabitants of Judah, and that land lay desolate for seventy years, while its people languished in Babylonian captivity. Dan. 1:1, 2. To all human appearance, the purpose of God was then thwarted. But the promise to Abraham had been backed by the oath of God (Heb. 6:13–18), and could not thus be made void by Satan, even though the powers of earth were at hand to do his bidding.

At the end of the predicted seventy years, Babylon was conquered by the Medo-Persian army. The Jews were then, by decree of Cyrus (Ezra 1:1–3), permitted to return to Palestine, but that territory was held under the rule of Persia. The territory was not restored to the seed of Abraham; they were simply permitted to dwell there as strangers, like their great ancestor, upon whom the promise of possessing the land was first bestowed.

The fifth power through whom Satan attempted to deprive the seed of Abraham of their inherited rights, soon came upon the scene to act the part assigned to it by the One whose usurped territory it was permitted to occupy. Grecia gained the ascendancy in the third century before Christ, and thus the Jewish nation came under the authority of another heathen power, which continued to deprive them of the control of the territory to which they were heirs, as the seed of Abraham.

Under the sixth power—pagan Rome—the one true Seed, who was to be head and front of all the believing children of Abraham, came upon the stage, as the rightful heir of God's promise to the father of the faithful. Gal. 3:16. He was born in Judah—the proper place—and was of the seed of David, who was of the lineage of Abraham. Matt. 1:1. Through all this line of family connections, the record of pedigree had been carefully preserved so that it was fully known by Satan, as well as by the faithful in the house of Israel, that the "babe of Bethlehem" was the long-promised seed. Luke 2:25–34. Herod the Roman governor of Judea, immediately gave orders to kill all children in the region about Bethlehem, who were under two years of age, in order to destroy this royal seed of Abraham. Matt. 2:12–16.

By a warning from God, the Child escaped this onslaught of government decree, but was afterward given a mock trial before Pilate, and condemned to be crucified. This, however, was a failure; for on the third day after, the crucified One burst the tomb, and came forth to life, to ascend to his Father, from whence he had come.

This was a great triumph for the seed of Abraham. The natural seed of the patriarch had lost at every contest with Satan. But now their great representative had shown himself superior to every attack of the arch enemy. In the wilderness of temptation, he had refused to acknowledge the authority of the usurper, even though the promise of yielding up the disputed territory was freely made to Him. Luke 4:5, 6. Although He was born a King (John 18:37), yet when the people attempted to make Him king over Satan's subjects, He sturdily refused, and fled away. John 6:15. At last, when every effort had been exhausted, yet without avail, to make Christ yield to Satan's authority, the power of the government was invoked to put him out of the way, and so to rid the world of one who was likely to inherit the promise made to the seed of Abraham.

But when Christ arose from the dead and ascended on high, Satan vented his spleen against the country and the people of the Jews. The Roman army was induced to destroy the temple and the city of Jerusalem, and scatter the Jewish nation to all parts of the earth. But that did not matter then. The people of Judah, though extremely wicked, had only been held together until the pedigree of Christ had been established as the seed of Abraham, when their union as a nation was no longer necessary. They had themselves rejected the One to which all their prophecies pointed as the Messiah,—the anointed One,—who was to be the salvation of their title to the inheritance. From the time of their rejection of him, the kingdom was to belong to another people who would bring forth the fruits of the kingdom of God. Matt. 21:43.

The literal seed of Abraham was then no longer in evidence. They had been held together as the connecting link between Abraham and the One to whom the promise was made, after which all who are the children of the promise must become such "by faith in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:19,25. So then, all who now become Christ's are, through this relationship, Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. Verse 29.

This being so, the persecution of Satan was extended from the literal seed to the spiritual. Since the appearance of Christ as the Head of Abraham's seed, his followers are also made to suffer through national power. Under pagan Rome, the sixth persecuting power, even the Jews, the literal seed of Abraham, united with the government to persecute Christians. When the system of government changed from Imperial to priestly,—from pagan to papal,—the persecution became more deep-seated and wide-spread than ever, because the seed of Abraham became more widely extended, reaching from the seed-sowing at Jerusalem to the uttermost bounds of the earth. Luke 24:47. Of this we will speak at another time.
