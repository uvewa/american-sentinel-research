The hearing on this bill, the object of which is the removal of Sunday restrictions from plays, games, and general amusements recognized as being lawful on ordinary days of the week, was held before the Committee on Codes at Albany, March 1. The opposition speeches to the bill were very tame and contained nothing worthy of mention. The principal speech was that made by Mr. Harburger, of the Assembly, in favor of the bill, of which he is the author. This contained a number of interesting points, which we regard as worthy of wide publicity. To this end we make the following quotation:

"I contend, first of all, that there are fewer violations of law and fewer breaches of order where the liberties of citizens are not curtailed on Sundays than in large cities in which there are such fanatical restrictions. In the city of Glasgow, in Scotland, where perhaps the severity of the Sunday ordinances against harmless amusements of any sort have been carried further than elsewhere, the number of arrests beginning at midnight on Saturday until midnight on Sunday is 10 per cent. larger than on any other day in the week, and in the city of London, where rigid local ordinances have curtailed the amusements of the people, the recent public statement of the London police department shows that there are more arraignments in the criminal courts for disorderly acts on Mondays than on any other two days in the week. I have been to the trouble of inquiring how in Berlin, Vienna, Paris, Milan, and other cities where there are no such radical restrictions against entertainments and amusements on Sunday operate, and I find that in each Sunday's arrests are fewer than on any other day and serious crimes on Sundays are a rarer occurrence than where such restrictions prevail. In the city of Glasgow the number of persons fined for intoxication in a year is twice as large as the number fined for the same offense against order in the city of Vienna and the population of Glasgow is 700,000, while the population of Vienna is 1,400,000."

"The opposition to a free Sunday," said Mr. Harburger, "has been waged along three successive lines: "first, opposition to Sunday travel; second, opposition to Sunday newspapers; third, opposition to Sunday art galleries, museums, and libraries. What intelligent man," he continued, "on the floor of this assembly does not remember the long and vigorous battle waged between the narrow-minded bigots on the one side and the broad-minded and intelligent friends of freedom on the other concerning the opening of the Metropolitan Museum in New York on Sunday? The one day in the week upon which workingmen and their families, clerks, employés of commercial houses, and the great body of the population generally have for recreation, the ponderous doors of this establishment in the Central Park were closed upon that day. The libraries were closed, the minor art galleries were closed, and if some of the bigots had had their way the parks would have been closed. But battles for liberty, battles for freedom, battles for the restoration of popular rights are never lost.

"I contend that where the largest personal liberty is allowed by law on Sunday, there is the most liberal and unrestricted acknowledgment of the rights of every man who is so disposed to worship on that day and the largest freedom consistent with order. In the district which I have the honor to represent the sentiment for liberal Sunday laws is so nearly overwhelming as to be unanimous. An intolerant Sabbatarian would find no following there, and yet as the records of the New York health department for 1896 and again for 1897 show, the clergyman in New York who performed the largest number of marriages is a resident of the Tenth Assembly District, a clergyman of the Lutheran Church there.

"In the six square blocks bounded by Second and Fourth Streets, Second Avenue and Avenue B, there are three churches of the Catholic faith, a larger number than are to be found in a like portion of a like territory in any portion of the United States, and in another portion of the district the spiritual ministrations of practically all the inhabitants come not from those associated with any of the Christian churches, but from the synagogues which are there numerous. Yet such a thing as a collision or dispute on religious grounds in this neighborhood of thickly populated East Side is unknown. All dwell together in harmony; there is no conflict and no friction.

"Religious holidays are celebrated by this, or that, portion of the population as they occur in the round of the year, and in summer time especially some of the ceremonials are in part celebrated out of doors, but there is no such thing as a dispute of any kind. The golden rule is the rule of all. How is it in so many of the districts of the west and southwest where Whitecaps flourish and regulators abound—where the rights of one individual in a small town are held on the suffrance of his fellows? These are the places in which rigorous, austere, fanatical, and unreasonable Sunday laws abound, wherein, as has been said, the chief function of each man is thought by him to be to interfere with the rights of his fellow. I appeal to the consideration of the Assembly not for liberal Sunday laws but for the abolition of illiberal ones inconsistent with popular right, detrimental to order and morality, unreasonable, impracticable, favorable to corruption, and totally unsuited to the requirement and to the welfare of the people of a great cosmopolitan city."

We cannot of course recognize Mr. Harburger's distinction of "liberal" and "illiberal" Sunday laws; for in principle, all Sunday laws are the same, and the principle of them all is an illiberal principle.

It seems to have been taken for granted that Mr. Harburger's bill would not become a law, otherwise the opposition to the measure would doubtless have been much more strenuous.
