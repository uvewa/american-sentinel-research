We have received a small tract and a card sent by a party in Davenport, Iowa, making a "Call to the Christian Voters" of the land, for the formation of a United Christian Party to take charge of the country. He sees "a golden opportunity for the Christians to advance the kingdom of Jesus Christ on earth, to better the condition of the human race, and to overthrow the work of Satan in our Government," by having all Christians "united at the ballot box." "Present political parties," he says, "fail to give us a remedy to destroy evil and better conditions, because they have wandered away from God and rejected his Son, Jesus Christ, in politics." It is a straw which shows how the wind of "Christian politics" is blowing among the people.
