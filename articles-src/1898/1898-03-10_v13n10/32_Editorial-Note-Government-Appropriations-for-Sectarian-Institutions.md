Some interesting facts and figures will be presented in next week's issue showing that a determined opposition is being made to the policy of discontinuing government appropriations of public money for sectarian institutions. In fact, it seems probable that this policy will be reversed, and the Government put back on the old track of church and state partnership. And remember that facts like these are what everybody ought to know.
