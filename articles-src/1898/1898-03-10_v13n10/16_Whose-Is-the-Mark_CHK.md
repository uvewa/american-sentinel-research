It has been proved in previous articles that the beast having two horns like a lamb (Rev. 13:11) symbolizes the United States, and that consequently it is this government that is to enforce that which the prophecy calls a "mark."

In this article it will be proper to inquire whose mark it is that is to be enforced by this nation.

The answer to this question will furnish additional proof that the two-horned beast and the United States are one and the same.

The enforcement of the mark is set forth in the prophecy thus, "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in the foreheads." Verse 16.

In connection with this there is to be brought about in this country that which is called "an image to the beast," and which is to be worshiped by the receiving of the mark. Verses 15, 16. The original of this image is the beast that had the deadly wound and was healed. Verses 12, 14.

From this it will be seen that it is the power symbolized by the beast that received the deadly wound, and yet was healed, to whom the mark belongs.

The record of this deadly wound being inflicted is given in verse 3 of the chapter under consideration, and verse 1 shows it to be the ten-horned leopard beast.

The power there symbolized is quite generally conceded, by Protestants, to be the papacy; and correctly, too.

In tracing this subject it is necessary to examine several scriptures.

A comparison of the symbol of the little horn of Daniel 7, and the beast of Rev. 13:1-10 will show that Daniel and John are speaking of one and the same power.

Daniel was told that the kingdom symbolized by the little horn was to arise subsequent to the division of the Roman Empire into ten kingdoms, which in turn is symbolized by the fourth beast having ten horns. Dan. 7:8, 23, 24.

In attaining to supremacy the little horn was to uproot or subdue three of these kingdoms. Chap. 7:9, 24.

Very plain is the prophecy concerning this matter; equally plain is the history showing the fulfillment.

The Roman Empire was divided into ten kingdoms between the years 356 and 476 A.D. Between 476 and 538 A.D. three of these kingdoms were plucked up, and this was done by the papacy—the Roman Catholic Church. And as a testimony to this fact the pope to this day wears on his tiara a triple crown.

Of this (papal) power it is said "He shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law (R. V.) and they shall be given into his hand until a time, times and the dividing of time." V. 25. This period is the same as the forty and two months of Rev. 13:5 or 1260 days of Chap. 12:6.

There is no question as to this being the papacy, for there is no other power which has ever claimed to have the power to change God's law, and it is the only one that has ever made the attempt.

It was in 538 A.D. that the papacy became supreme, and as it was to continue for 1260 years—a day standing for a year, see Eze. 4:6—the time when it was to receive its deadly wound was 1798 for 538 plus 1260 equals 1798. And it is a well-known fact that in this year—1798—The French army under General Berthier, abolished the papal See, took the pope—Pius VI.—prisoner, and carried him off to Valence, France, where he died a year later.

But its deadly wound was to be healed. Although shorn of its power in 1798, two years later another pope was elected, and while from that time it began to lose its temporal possessions until in 1870 when it had nothing left but the grounds upon which the Vatican stands and which is subject to taxation just like the property of any other private citizen of the Italian kingdom, it has gradually been regaining strength and power, until at the present time all that remains of the deadly wound is as it were, an old scab, and it appears to be but a very short time when that will be removed.

It has been stated that it was in 1798 that the papacy received its deadly wound. At the time this wound was inflicted the prophet saw the two-horned beast coming up rapidly to take its place among the great nations of the earth. Compare Rev. 13:10, 11.

But the only government that was coming up at the time was our own nation—the United States of America—Thus: In 1776 the Declaration of Independence was made; in 1789 the Constitution was ratified, and the Ship of State started on its career. At this time this Government—and positively the only one that ever did it—recognized and adopted the principles of civil and religious liberty as taught by Jesus Christ—the Lamb of God—and which in the prophecy is indicated by the two lamb-like horns.

Thus it is proven again that the United States is the nation described in Rev. 13:11 by the Seer of Patmos, and thus it is proven that the beast which received the deadly wound that was healed is the papacy. And as it is this beast to whom the mark belongs, by this same token it is proven that the mark to be enforced by this nation is the mark of the papacy—the Roman Catholic Church.

Consequently if we can find that which the papacy sets forth as the mark of its power, and if too we can find that this is the identical thing that is sought to be enforced upon the people of this nation the proof will amount to a demonstration that this mark claimed by the papacy, and sought to be enforced by the United States, and the mark in the prophecy are one and the same.

What the mark itself is will be considered at another time.
