"The man doesn't live," said the mayor [of Chicago], "who could shut up Chicago saloons on Sunday. I shall not try to do it. It isn't for political reasons—that's not important especially—but because the people would not tolerate it for an instant."

"Then you don't believe in enforcing laws not approved by public opinion?"

"No, I don't," replied the mayor, "and I don't intend to try it."

"But your oath of office requires you to enforce all laws, and Sunday opening of saloons is against law."

"There's a difference of opinion about that," answered Mr. Harrison. "Our Sunday closing we interpret to mean the outward closing, the semblance of closing. That I believe in."
