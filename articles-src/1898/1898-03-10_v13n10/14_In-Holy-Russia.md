Thirty families of the Russian sect nicknamed the Shelapouti were summoned by the police to the village offices of Ekaterinovka. There the police officer read an official circular ordering that the children from the ages of two to eleven should be taken from them and entrusted to orthodox villagers. The priests were present, and one of them enlarged on the "demoralization" effected by the sect, and added that it ought to be relentlessly persecuted and eradicated. The parents burst into heartrending lamentations, and were joined by the sobbing children. Children were torn from the parents' arms. A little provincial paper, by some means, was allowed to publish an account of the scene, of which a translation appears in Free Russia. We read:—

"The parents finally seemed to have lost their senses: they kissed the skirts of the priests' garments, embraced the police officer's knees! The whole scene was unspeakably painful. But one figure made a particular impression on my mind. This peasant was a widower of about thirty-five years of age, tall, solidly built, with an agreeable though somewhat gloomy face. He kept all the time his pretty, tiny daughter of about five to seven years in his arms, never letting her go. Then he tried to escape from the courtyard of the village-office, but several policemen stopped him and violently tore the child from his embrace. No sooner was this done than he fell to the ground in a heap, unconscious. Not one single groan or sound did he utter. This sent a thrill through all present; everybody shuddered. Yet the zealous officer kicked him with his boot, exclaiming, 'Acting! The beast!' But 'the beast' did not recover his senses for a considerable time, and when he did he stretched out his hands and began to feel around him as if searching for something, although it was broad daylight. Never will that instance fade from my memory."

There will be an awful reckoning some day for the government and the church that thus ride roughshod over the primal affections of humanity.
