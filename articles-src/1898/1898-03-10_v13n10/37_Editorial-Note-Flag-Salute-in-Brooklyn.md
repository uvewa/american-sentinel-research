The "flag salute" has appeared in the public schools of Brooklyn; and, of course, there is trouble. A resident of that borough of Greater New York who knows the facts of the case sends us the following statement: "In one of the Eastern District schools of our city a little boy eight years old, for refusing to comply with the teacher's request to salute the flag, and participate in a military march around the school room, in which each boy when passing the flag was supposed to lay his right hand finger on the left shoulder, imitating the carrying of a gun, was punished by having to stand up all day during his studies. The following day he was punished by having his hand slapped with a ruler. His mother, when informed of these facts, called on the teacher, who tried to defend her act on the plea of patriotism, but referred her to the principle of the school, who pleaded ignorance of the matter, but promised to stop it; which, I am glad to say, was done and it has not yet been repeated." The lad's refusal, we learn, was not from stubbornness, but because he had been taught that the spirit of militarism was contrary to Christianity.
