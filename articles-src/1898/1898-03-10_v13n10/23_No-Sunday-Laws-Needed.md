The following under this head relative to the hearing on the District Sunday Bill, spoken by so influential a paper as the *Washington Post*, may be taken as reflecting the sentiments of a large proportion of American citizens outside of those who desire Sunday legislation because of a religious regard for the day. It is for this reason that it is given space in the SENTINEL:

"It will be observed by reference to our report of the hearing before the House sub-committee, on Friday last, that the only persons who appeared to advocate the bill were a few professional busybodies, while a somewhat larger number of public-spirited persons unselfishly gave their time to combat a measure which has for its object a tyrannical interference with the rights of individuals. To these latter the community owe a debt of thanks. The bill in question contemplate an intolerable oppression, and yet the great mass of the population have left to accident their protection against its sinister and odious purpose.

"The chief champion of the bill was the Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, who seems to be unable to find legitimate employment in his pretended occupation, and who, therefore, serves as superintendent of what he calls a Reform Bureau—at a salary, of course—and manifests his activity by meddling impertinently in other people's business. We have had this Crafts with us in the character of an irritant for some years past. Upon what authority he proceeds, and how far he represents the wishes and opinions of any considerable element of society, we do not pretend to say. All we know about him is that he undertakes to regulate the morals of the District and to annoy and bore nearly everybody in it with his offensive importunities. Speaking to the sub-committee, on Friday, he tried to produce the impression, if he did not actually assert, that he plead the cause of certain labor organizations—the Federation, the Knights, and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers—but no representative of any of those orders was present to ratify his pretensions, and in our belief none would have done so had he been present. The labor organizations do not need Crafts to voice their sentiments or to advocate their rights. They have full control over their own affairs. They can see to it that their members have one day of rest out of every seven. We do not believe that these organizations ever commissioned Crafts to speak for them. It is our conviction that they would infinitely prefer to be left free to spend the Sabbath according to their individual preferences.

"Crafts and his coadjutors have been conducting their . . . propaganda for a very long and weary time. . . . In the prosecution of their pestiferous enterprise they have resorted to every form of slander and mendacity. They have pictured Washington as an immoral city, where vice runs riot, where the Sabbath is habitually desecrated, and where, for lack of Sunday laws—to be formulated by themselves, of course—our youth are systematically corrupted and debased. The facts are, as shown by the statistics of the Police Department, that, in Washington, Sunday is the most orderly and decorous day of the whole week; that ours is a moral and a well-behaved community; that the thing we need least of all is a new law still further regulating the observance of the Sabbath. They complain vociferously of the profane noises which, on the Sabbath, disturb the pious at their devotions, while the truth is that the church bells furnish the only clamor on that day which can be said to annoy or distress any reasonable human being. They come forward with lists of the 'places of business' found open on Sunday, when it is perfectly safe to say that nine-tenths of them could not be closed without paralyzing our common civilization. They are, in fact, a set of blatant and pernicious busybodies, who represent nothing worthy the attention of Congress.

"Such citizens as Gen. William Birney, Prof. W. A. Croffut, Rabbi Stern, Rev. Geo. B. Wheeler, Rev. A. H. Lewis, and the others who appeared to protest against the Crafts' bill are entitled to the heartfelt gratitude of the public. They stand for something in the communities to which they respectively belong—for legitimate occupation, for intelligence, for responsibility, and for the spirit of religious and political freedom.

"They plead the cause of human progress and enlightenment. They stand for the principles which this republic was founded to perpetuate. They do not ask that others shall be forced to accept their dogmas. They ask only that which the pioneers of liberty in America died to win for their posterity—emancipation from the cruelties and horrors of fanaticism. They are entitled to the respect and confidence of Congress. They represent the true public opinion of Washington. We want no more Sabbath legislation. We need no more. We are a moral and a cultured people. We ask that no encouragement be given to salaried meddlers with our affairs."
