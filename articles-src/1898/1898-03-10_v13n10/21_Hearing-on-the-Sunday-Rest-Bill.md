The principal speaker at the hearing in behalf of this bill was Rev. W. F. Crafts, whose chief aim for many years past has been to promote Sunday observance by legislation. Mr. Crafts said that the bill was the same as had been recommended by the District Commissioners in 1896, and that it had been asked for at a union meeting of the churches of Washington in 1895, and had been indorsed by Archbishop Keane, Father Stafford, and Cardinal Gibbons, of the Roman Catholic Church. He also claimed that the measure was favored by the American Federation of Labor, the Knights of Labor, and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. Upon this point he was disputed by Dr. W. A. Croffut, who said that he had recently talked with leading officials of the labor unions, and found them opposed to Sunday observance by law, and desirous of being left free to rest or work on Sunday as they themselves might choose.

It cannot be denied, however, that resolutions favoring Sunday laws have within recent years been passed at meetings of the labor unions, and that these organizations stand on record as committed more or less definitely to Sunday enforcement.

Mr. W. A. Gordon appeared for the Churchmen's League, an organization representing the Protestant Episcopal Church. He said that the League did not ask that the liberties of any man should be curtailed, but that the Sabbath should be preserved from profanation.

The "profanation" of the "Sabbath" can of course be nothing else than an *irreligious* use of the day. Mr. Gordon's speech was a plain admission that the Churchmen's League asked Congress to forbid the people of the District spending Sunday in a way that was not religious.

Mr. H. C. Kirk, President of the Secular League of Washington, took decided exception to the implied charge that Washington was a city given over on Sunday to immorality. He made statements to show that Washington compared favorably with any other American city in this respect.

Elder Geo. B. Wheeler, of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, scored a point by asking if the bill aimed to distinguish between a religious and a secular noise; otherwise, the church bells and Salvation Army drums would be prohibited from use on Sundays. He referred the committee to a similar law in Tennessee under which one hundred and twenty persons had been arrested and seventy-eight fined or imprisoned. Quoting from recent statements made by Mr. Crafts, Mr. Wheeler brought out the fact that the leading advocate of the bill denounced all who do not observe Sunday as being traitors to God and but little better than traitors to their country. Mr. Crafts interrupted him with the statement that what he had said was meant for Christians; but obviously, that which constitutes treason for one person, must constitute treason for all; for one and all stand under the same obligations both as regards God and their fellow men.

Rev. A. H. Lewis, representing the Seventh-day Baptists, made an able and telling speech against the bill, treating the subject from the standpoint of history and of the true interests of Christianity itself. If an institution claiming to be Christian, he said, could not be maintained without having the support of the civil arm, it would better go down as having demonstrated itself a fraud.

It remains for the Congressional Committee on the District of Columbia to decide, from the report made to them by the sub-committee, whether or not the bill shall be favorably reported to Congress.
