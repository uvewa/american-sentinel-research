The Sunday-Rest Bill, upon which a hearing was recently given at Washington, was, it is said, a part of the annual output of the "Churchmen's League"—an organization representing the Episcopal Church. According to a spokesman of the League who writes in the Washington Post, of March 3, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison were members of the Episcopal Church. It is not claimed that they were the founders of the League; but it may appear that they were after the Catholic and other churches shall have finished revising history.
