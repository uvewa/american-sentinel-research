THE Iowa Clinton County Advertiser, says the Sabbath Recorder, "reports the arrest of H. N. Schuler, of Belleview, Iowa, on the charge of 'Sabbath desecration,' for keeping his store open on Sunday. The case was fixed for trial on February 10. The Advertiser says that the arrest is the result of a 'revival' at Belleview."
