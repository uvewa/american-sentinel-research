Read, on another page, the article "In Holy Russia," and as you read, reflect that the atrocious invasion of sacred personal rights of which the Russian government is guilty as described, is defended simply and solely by the principle that the state ought to be united with religion. Reflect also that this principle has numerous and influential advocates in the United States.
