It is easy to shut one's eyes to anything and everything; and it is almost as easy to miss seeing things of importance by giving them only a casual, careless glance. Those who have given more than a casual glance to developments now taking place in this country know that the nation has reached the greatest crisis in its history. But their knowledge will not help you unless you can be induced to give your earnest attention to these things. What means the great "Christian Citizenship" movement, to the principle of which the greatest and most active church forces in the country now stand committed? Is this feature of the times worth considering? If not, what do you deem worth considering?
