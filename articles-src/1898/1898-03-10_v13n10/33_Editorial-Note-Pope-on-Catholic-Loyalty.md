The pope, it is said, has given out as his "express wish," that Roman Catholics "should be loyal to the country in which they live, and in the event of war rally to their country's support." We give the pope credit for better sense than such a statement implies; but after all, the spectacle of Catholics of Spain fighting Catholics of the United States by order of "the church" would not be more incongruous than that of Methodists of the North fighting Methodists of the South under sanction of the church, as was witnessed in this country not long since.
