"The most murderous weapon ever invented" is a thing that is frequently being invented in these warlike days. The latest thing of the kind is a gun for throwing an aerial torpedo, and is devised by Mr. Hudson Maxim, brother of the inventor of the well-known Maxim gun. The projectile fired from this new gun can be filled with half a ton of high explosive, and be hurled—so it is said—as far as a shell from a modern high-power gun. Mr. Maxim is so anxious to try his new invention that he is trying to persuade the Government to let him use it against the Spaniards in Cuba, at his own expense for transportation and necessary preparations. He came all the way from England for this purpose. That is always the way with men who invent weapons of destruction, or who carry them around. They are always itching for a chance to try them; and if they can have a human target to experiment on, the affair simply becomes so much the more interesting to them.
