As stated in another article, the Catholic News is so elated over the fact that an individual was led into the Catholic Church through the exclusive reading of the Bible that it gives over a column in the telling of it. After saying, "This man read no Catholic books, heard no sermons, was influenced by no living examples of the excellency of the true faith, but by the serious and unbiased reading of the Holy Scriptures discovered the pearl of great price," the News continues, "Yet the majority of adherents of Protestantism believe that the Catholics remain such merely because they are forbidden to read the Bible, and if once they could be induced to take it up and read there would be an overwhelming exodus from Rome."

If it is possible for a man to find his way to the Catholic Church through the exclusive reading of the Bible, why would not a careful reading of it keep him in the church after he gets there? If the reading of the Bible is not inimical to the Catholic Church, why are its members forbidden to read it? Yet everybody knows that the Catholic is forbidden to read the Bible, unless it is the Catholic Bible which has Catholic annotations.

Such confidence does the News have in this matter of reading the Scripture that it says, "The church may appropriately use to these outside her fold the challenge which her divine Founder uttered to the Jews on one occasion, 'Search the Scriptures, for ye think in them to have eternal life, and they do give testimony of me.'"

It is all very well to express such confidence in the reading of the Bible in this country which for the present is professedly Protestant; but it is an entirely different matter in countries which are dominated solely by the Catholic Church; for instance, Spain.
