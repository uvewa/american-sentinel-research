A CENTRIFUGAL gun, discharging 30,000 bullets a minute, has been invented by an English engineer. The bullets are poured into a case from a hopper and guided into a disk, three feet in diameter, revolving in the case at the rate of 15,000 revolutions a minute. They are discharged from the edge of the disk.
