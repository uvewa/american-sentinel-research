JULIA thought a great deal about the question her teacher had promised to answer. She had already made up her mind that the man who yielded moral principle to the force of circumstances, even to save his neck and his credit, was at least not the kind of man she should call a moral hero, even if he were a great preacher. Still, she was a little anxious to know how the teacher would decide the question. So when Tuesday afternoon came again, Julia was on hand a little more promptly than usual, and listened attentively to every word, as Professor Carman arose and began:—

"Before we begin the regular study to-day, I will answer Julia's question as to whether it is right to yield a point even to save life, when Christian principle is at stake. The good Book certainly admonishes us to live peaceably with all men as much as in us lies, but that does not warrant us in weakly yielding to evil. We have the example of many noble characters in the Bible, and also of Christ himself. Who can mention any of these instances? let's see the hands."

"The three Hebrew worthies," replied Joe Palmeter, quickly. "They ran the risk of the king's displeasure, and even when they knew it meant death to them, they would not yield."

"Well, teacher, seems to me there's a text somewhere about being in subjection to the powers that be," said Milly Brown, who could never bear to offer any opposition to anything for fear of hurting some one's feelings.

"But the very case that I have mentioned proves that this text doesn't apply in matters of conscience, isn't that so, professor?" urged Joe, earnestly.

"I am certain it is so, Joseph. Now who can think of another case to the point?"

"I believe Daniel would insist upon praying with his windows up, when it meant death by the lions if he did it," said Max Smith.

"Seems to me, professor, it's almost a question of religious liberty, isn't it?" said Joe Palmeter—Joe never could hold his peace whenever that point was touched.

"Yes, I think so; for certain it is that to force anyone to make a statement which is known to be both false and unjust is not allowing him liberty of conscience. Now I think we may consider Julia's question answered.

"The quarrel for supremacy between the houses of Burgundy and Orleans did not end with the murder of the duke of which you learned last week. However, the Orleans party now came to be called the Armagnac, because of the marriage of the murdered duke's eldest son to a daughter of the Count of Armagnac. The next seven years was one period of unrest and trouble. First one and then the other of the contending parties was in the ascendancy.

"The worst class of society made this condition of things an excuse for all kinds of debaucheries and riots. If a villain wanted anything which he could not get by fair means, all he need do was to don the hood of blue worn by the Burgundians, or, if the other party happened just then to be the stronger, the white scarf of the Armagnac."

"I should imagine that the king of England would have taken advantage of the awful fix France was in, and have come over for a finger in the pie," said Florence Ray.

"Precisely what he did do, Florence. You are quite a strategic general. Yes, Henry V., of England, and many Frenchmen of royal blood met in the battle of Agincourt. The English were victorious; for the French were hot-headed and impulsive, while the English king took every advantage. After a while Normandy was entirely under the English rule.

"It was thought best, finally, to try to unite the two opposing French factions, and thus be better able to drive back the English. Finally, John the Fearless, the murderer of Orleans, met the young Dauphin Charles, son of the crazy king, on a bridge, where, under a pavilion raised for the purpose, terms were to be agreed upon whereby to ensure the greater peace and good of France. But while the duke was bending his knee to his sovereign's son, one of the king's attendants treacherously struck him on the head with a hatchet."

"I supposed that deed only aggravated the Burgundians," said Harry Ray.

"Of course; they did not seem at all to remember that God has said that vengeance was his, but they strove to mete it out themselves to their enemies, and a dreadful time they had of it; for now, instead of the two factions being united, Philip, son of John the Fearless took the side of the English, hoping thus to be better able to wreak his vengeance upon the hated Amagnacs.

"Queen Isabella, who hated her son, the dauphin, also joined the English, and the poor insane king signed a most shameful treaty, agreeing that he would give his daughter Catharine to England's king, and that after his death, Henry should be the king of France—thus virtually signing away his people and his country to England. Still the trouble does not end between the French people—they fight as desperately between themselves as ever.

"At last, after about two short years more, both the poor crazy Charles and King Henry die, though the latter dies first, and is constantly mourned for by King Charles, in whose wild fancy he takes the place of his own children, and when he died shortly after, it was with the name of 'dear son Henry' upon his lips. Then, as Edward Barnaby has told us in his essay, the people of France mourned for their hapless king, and when it was too late, arose to do him honor."
