It is a curious fact which this religious proclamation brings to view, that the Government should feel bound to obey the fourth commandment, while it feels at liberty to break the sixth. If it is so essential to observe the one commandment, why is it not also essential to observe the other? The Government disregards the commandment which says, "Thou shalt not kill." It is held, of course, that it is all right for governments to do this; it is wrong for individuals—acting in a private capacity—to kill; but in war the killing is held to be justified because done by the government. But if breaking the sixth commandment is justifiable because done by the government, why is not breaking the Sabbath also justifiable when done by the government? While neither of these commands—or any others of the moral law—are as we believe addressed to civil governments, this fact does not relieve the inconsistency of the Government's attitude in this matter.
