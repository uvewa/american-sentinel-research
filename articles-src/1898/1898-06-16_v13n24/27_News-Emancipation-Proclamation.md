But on the first day of January, 1863, the President issued another proclamation—not a restrictive measure, but one of liberty—the Proclamation of Emancipation. The hand of the chief executive had at last touched the plague spot which had long been poisoning the body politic, and the beneficial effect was felt at once. When it was decreed that the image of God in man should no longer be degraded to the level of the brute creation, as a thing to be bought and sold, but that there should be "deliverance to the captives and the opening of the prison doors to them that were bound," the right chord was struck at last which gave forth the tones of victory. Almost from that day success came to the Federal arms. In the early spring General Grant moved against Vicksburg, and before the middle of summer the fall of that stronghold and the decisive defeat at Gettysburg sounded the knell of the Confederate cause.
