John the Baptist was the forerunner of Christ. His work was to "prepare the way of the Lord," to "make straight in the desert a highway for our God." All things which John spake of Christ were true as even the Jews admitted; while our Saviour himself declared that "among them' that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist." Therefore no doctrine can come to us with any higher sanctions than the teaching of John.

It was John's work to prepare the way for the new dispensation, therefore he spoke not alone to the Jews but to us as well. The morality which he taught was the morality, not of pagan philosophers, nor yet of self-righteous Pharisees, but the morality of Christ. The duties which John enjoined may not be neglected; the rules of conduct which he prescribed are in force to-day. What, then, did John declare to be the proper course of action for one who being a soldier would become also a Christian?

"And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages." Luke 3:14.

Obs rve that John did not say, Do violence to no man privately, or until commanded so to do by your superiors, but "Do violence to no man." The marginal reading is, "Put no man in fear." It must be evident that a "war" conducted on such principles would be even more peaceful and bloodless than Mr. McKinley's peaceful blockade of Havana which has caused no little dissatisfaction to the advocates of an energetic prosecution of the war with Spain. And not only would it be more peaceful than a peaceful blockade, but it would be likewise infinitely more effective, for only the Christian is capable of waging such a war; and his weapons "are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds." 2 Cor. 10:4.

Of course, from the standpoint of the world, the soldier who would heed the inspired admonition, "Do violence to no man," would be of no use as a soldier; but this only shows that Christianity, as taught in the Scriptures, and the spirit of war are irreconcilable. The follower of the Prince of Peace cannot and will not fight with carnal weapons; his weapons are mighty but not carnal. He wields a sword, but it is the "sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Eph. 6:17), he has a defense—not indeed bags of sand, walls of granite, or armor of nickel-steel, but the breastplate of righteousness and the helmet of salvation. The rule of the Christian's life is "Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God." 1 Cor. 10:31. The Christian must be Christlike. Christ lives and works in and through him. Gal. 2:20. The Christian fights, but his enemies are not his fellow men, creatures of the same divine hand, bound to the same judgment bar; but the devil and sin. Like the Master his mission is not to destroy men's lives but to save them.

Such is the work and the only work of the Christian soldier, for "as he [Christ] is so are we in this world." 1 John 4:17. And again, "He that abideth in him [Christ] ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked." 1 John 2:6. Notice, the text does not say, "As He is so we must be in the future kingdom of God, but it does say, 'As He is so are we in this world.'" "If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his." It is not what one hopes to be in the future, but what he is at the present moment that determines his standing in the sight of God. The Christian can engage in no business, occupation, or calling in which Christ himself might not engage were he living as a man here upon earth, even as he once lived.

These things being true, will those who are engaged, or who are proposing to engage in Christian work among those who have enlisted to fight against Spain, will these Christian teachers, I ask, teach the soldiers and sailors of the United States these vital truths from the Word of God? Will they seek to make them real soldiers of Jesus Christ—to walk as he walked, to do in all things as he did, to revile not when reviled, to threaten not when they suffer, to retaliate not when smitten? Or will they teach them the gospel of force, of revenge, of destruction? To teach the first would be to disqualify for military service as many as received it; to teach the second would be to misrepresent Christ and to destroy souls for whom he died.

Christianity is opposed to war. True an apostate church has caused men to lose sight of this truth; but during all the years that it has been covered up it has not ceased to be truth; and to-day the word of Christ to each of his followers is, "Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." To obey this injunction requires courage, and that of a higher order even than to face the foe upon the field of carnal strife. Moral courage, the courage of Christ himself, will alone enable any man to be a Christian indeed in a time like this when God's word to every man is, "Choose ye this day whom you will serve."

The choice to be made is between the sword of Caesar [the civil power] and the sword of the Spirit. The same individual cannot wield them both, for "no man can serve two masters." It is not for Christians to right wrongs. "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." God will in his own good time "Remember the 'Maine'"; he will also remember the oppressed in every land, the poor, the down-trodden of every age, and will visit with swift and terrible retribution all the guilty not only in Spain, but in every land. Let God's people bide God's time.

C. P. B.
