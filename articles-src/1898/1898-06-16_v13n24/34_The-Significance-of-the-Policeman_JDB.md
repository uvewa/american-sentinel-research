THOSE persons who seized with such avidity, and who are constantly reiterating, the assertion of the Supreme Court "that this is a Christian nation," and who insist that civilization will soon produce the millennium, will do well to ponder carefully the following words by Editor Ridpath in the May Arena:—

"There is more in a policeman than appears on the surface. He is not so much a person as a fact. He is representative of much and expressive of little. He is said to stand for the state. If so, the state has a remarkable manner of revealing herself to the senses. This is true in particular of the Christian state. The Christian state is a sort of a professional entity that ought for the sake of consistency to be represented by something different from a bluecoat, a leer, and a billy.

"It seems, however, that civilization demands a policeman. If we are to reason from the facts, the higher stage of the civilized life requires an increased supply of policemen. This is what I am trying to explain. The more we civilize, the more we enlarge the Department of Public Protection. The Indians had no policemen. The seventy thousand inhabitants of Iceland have only one. A small Christian town in America requires several. The city must have many; the metropolis, an army. New York requires five thousand to keep her from robbing and killing herself."

And no larger "force" was required on the 28th of February, 1892, the day before these cities and towns were made(?) Christian by the declaration of the Supreme Court than has been required every day since. The policeman does mean something. He means for one thing that the authority which he represents is in no sense Christian. He is the living and substantial contradiction of the whole "Christian nation" fallacy. And if he means so much, what shall we say of armies and navies?
