ANOTHER curious thing—which looks inconsistent to us—about the war is the fact that the Government holds an indictment against General Calixto Garcia, a prominent Cuban leader, for aiding the Cubans against Spain, while it is now actually joining hands with him in carrying on that very work. The troops of the Government, acting under the orders of men who represent the Government, are coöperating with General Garcia's men in the attack on Santiago; and at the same time the Government holds this same General Garcia to be a criminal, he having "jumped" bail after having been indicted as above stated. The judicial authorities of the Government have refused to quash the indictment against him, while at the same time the military authorities of the Government are coöperating with him, and that in the very work for which he is held under the indictment. To comprehend the ethics of such matters is beyond our power. We can only fall back upon saying that "all is fair in love and war."
