"The universal education of successive generations" in the science and ethics of alcoholic beverages was Mrs. Hunt's burden, and she saw the public school as the medium by which this must be accomplished. Every boy and girl was due some time for a longer or shorter term at the public school-house, and here at this gate of entry she would station the representatives of truth. She would appeal to the boyish pride of strength, and the girls desire for grace and beauty; she would make nature itself cry out through these instincts that are as universal as life, against that indulgence which destroys the fine proportions of the growing animal; dwarfs, deforms, and degrades all loveliness. She would pit science as well as revelation against custom and appetite and see what it would do for the race after the third and fourth generation.

She began the discussion of her great theme in her home Union, and from thence worked out to the National, which in 1880 created for her the Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction in Schools and Colleges, and made her its superintendent (which position she still holds), and promised to stand by in her arduous undertaking.

Her's was the dream of a prophetess. All that she saw ought to be soon, will be by and by in the restoration of all things; but by "faith she brings it nigh," at least near enough to keep her in perpetual courage. No more practical woman can be found among us; none stronger nor more God-reliant as she keeps working away at her part of the great problem.

Mrs. Hunt recognized at once the relation of law to public school education, and with the habit of directness which is peculiar to her, she went for the legal end of the question at once. Since it was the law that fixed the school curriculum, she would make the law the friend of her client, the child of to-day, and those that should be of him.

She drafted a bill, and with such limited help as the National could give her, succeeded in persuading the legislature of Vermont to make it a law in November of 1882.

This law provided that all pupils in every school should be instructed in physiology and hygiene with special reference to the effect of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system; and that no certificate should be granted any person to teach in the state who "shall not pass a satisfactory examination" (after a certain early date which I cannot recall) "in physiology and hygiene, with particular reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants and narcotics upon the human system."

The legislature of Michigan passed the same or a similar law in '83, and from that time Mrs. Hunt and her heroic band of state superintendents have been bringing state after state into the temperance educational procession, until at this date but four remain to be persuaded.

The National Congress quite early in her campaign passed a law making this line of instruction a part of the regular course in the District of Columbia; in all territories, and all naval and military schools; this being the extent of their power to legislate in school matters. During all these years Mrs. Hunt has almost lived in state legislatures personally watching every bill on its passage and all for the sake of the growing children in your home.

We are now far enough away from the first starting point in the Cold Water Army movement to begin to reap samples of the harvest, and while some of us know from the statement of the Word which is given for our counsel that these dreams of a reconstructed and purified society cannot be realized in this age of the world's history, yet we do know that the labor is not in vain in the Lord, because of results which have already been harvested. Thousands of men have grown up under this better teaching to be strictly total abstainers who under the influence of their natural environment would otherwise have necessarily been left untaught to fall a prey to the same evils which had slain their fathers; and thus the fact is attested that God was in the principle of "Prevention" as it had been revealed to us, that it was an essential part of that All that is in Christ, and that he was pleased to honor the efforts, which if not perfect, if not even the best that we ought to have done, were yet so honest in the motive which was behind them that he could recognize and use them in bringing men to the knowledge of his Son.

I have myself had many beautiful surprises in the years that have passed since the organization of that first Cold Water Army, and they are still coming in the nature of firstfruits of the harvest which shall be reaped by and by. The personal correspondence and experiences of all our women are full of just such tokens of the truth that "Ye shall reap if ye faint not."

I was invited to a certain western city for evangelistic work. Upon my arrival I was met in the most cordial manner by four bearded men who greeted me almost like sons, and in explanation told me that they had been in my first Cold Water Army; had taken that "oath" on the Court House Green, and had been kept by it from falling into the drinking habits of their associates in the new West, for they had determined never to break that solemn promise. They had all become Christians; were members of the three churches, and honoraries of the one W. C. T. U. of the town, and had united to invite me to bring the gospel to their neighbors.

Will you wonder if I tell you that I looked at them through wet eyes out of a laughing heart? And that I enjoyed the two weeks of service in which I was constantly supported by these four men and their wives, pastors, and associates in church work? The memory of it has always been refreshing, and also has served to illustrate the principle with which we started out, that all truth leads to Christ.
