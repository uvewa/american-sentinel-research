The following letter was sent to the editor of the *Christian World*. It can hardly be wondered at that Christianity is regarded by so many as a sham when those who appear in public as its advocates and adherents manifest so inconsistent a disregard for its principles of kindness and all-embracing love. If not a sparrow falls to the ground without the notice of the Father, how must he regard the slaughter of his creatures for the adornment of those who profess to be his servants?

"Sir,—It is an extraordinary thing that, despite all that has been said on the subject of 'murderous millinery' and the proved and reiterated statement that every graceful 'osprey' plume nodding in a woman's bonnet means the slaughter of a whole family of birds, under circumstances peculiarly revolting, Christian women, some of whom are leaders in Christian work, still wear these barbarous adornments. At the May meeting of the different religious societies, ospreys are everywhere—even on the platform. At one meeting a woman pleaded for self-devotion—with ospreys in her bonnet! At an important ladies' missionary gathering the lady who presided, and one of the missionaries who described the cruelties of Indian life, both wore ospreys. It is hardly conceivable that, after all that has been said and written on the subject, any woman can be unaware of the barbarity of the trade in ospreys. Perhaps some comfort themselves with the idea, sedulously fostered by drapers and milliners, that their ospreys are only 'imitations.' But in nineteen cases out of twenty the plumes are real, and are only called 'imitations' in order to salve the easily soothed consciences of the women who buy them. As Ruskin says, a woman who will wear relics of murdered birds in her headgear would almost make her dead baby into an ornament if fashion demanded it.

"Yours truly,

"A MAY MEETING WOMAN."

A letter to the *Chronicle* states that—

"Setting aside the sales in all cities and the sales that are made in towns and villages, and taking only the auctions in the city of London, there were recently sold the feathers or skins of 11,000 ospreys, 35,947 humming birds, 16,107 jays, 1,327 kingfishers, the aigrettes from 20,000 herons, and thousands of other birds."
