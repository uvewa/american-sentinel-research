The last war between Russia and Turkey was undertaken by Russia in behalf of the Bulgarians, who had become the victims of Turkish atrocities. Of the result of this "war for humanity" the following is said in a recent number of the Review of Reviews:

"To avenge the Bulgarian atrocities the Russians invaded Turkey, and for every Bulgarian man, woman and child who had been massacred by the Turks, two Russian soldiers fell in battle or died of disease, and probably at least double that number of non combatant peasants—Bulgarian, Armenian, Turkish—were done to death between the contending armies. The Bulgarian atrocities were avenged, no doubt; but at a very low computation it cost five lives to avenge one."

Upon which a London journal makes the pertinent comment that war, as a remedy for the ills of humanity, is worse than the disease. Must this not be the thought that is to day in the minds of many of the starving Cubans?
