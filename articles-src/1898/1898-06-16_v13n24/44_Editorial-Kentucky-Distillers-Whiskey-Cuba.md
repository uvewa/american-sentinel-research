KENTUCKY distillers, it is said, propose to send 50,000 "one drink" bottles of whiskey to Cuba for the use of the American soldiers when they occupy the island. As the soldiers in Cuba evidently do not need anything beyond what the climate provides to keep them warm, at this season of the year, it is explained that the purpose of the whiskey is to put them in good fighting trim. That whiskey will do this for a soldier or any other person, is a perfectly sound claim; but it would be sad indeed if the men who went to the war under the inspiration of patriotism and love for humanity—as it is supposed the men of the army have gone—should have to fall back on whiskey to be enabled to prosecute the campaign. It is to be hoped the Government will not lend itself to any such scheme.
