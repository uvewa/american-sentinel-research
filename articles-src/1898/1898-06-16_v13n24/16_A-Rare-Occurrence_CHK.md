It is not often one hears of a person accepting the Catholic faith through the exclusive reading of the Bible. But that such a thing is possible seems to be the case according to the *Catholic News*, of April 2, 1898.

Even to the *News* it must have been an incident of rare occurrence, for it makes the most of it that it can, devoting exactly a column to the narration of the fact.

The *News* is careful to state that the one who did this "read no Catholic books, heard no sermons, was influenced by no living examples of the excellency of the true faith, but by the serious and unbiased reading of the Holy Scriptures, discovered the pearl of great price."

But the convert himself in giving his testimony as to how he was led to embrace Catholicism, says: "I profited by the warning of St. Augustine, 'Fly to the tabernacle of God, the Catholic Church.'"

If this man "read no books, heard no sermons, was influenced by no living examples of the excellency of the true faith," where did he ever learn of St. Augustine, and in what part of the Bible did he ever read St. Augustine's warning, "Fly to the tabernacle of God, the Catholic Church?" The writer has several versions of the Bible, including a copy of the Douay Bible. In none of the former has he read such a warning, nor has he any recollection of seeing it in the Douay version.

This convert is so glad that he has found the "pearl of great price" that he says, "The English language is inadequate to express my gratitude to many kind friends who lent me a helping hand to bring me into the true fold, especially Father Wagner, of Champaigne, Ill., for his unremitting kindness throughout my instructions."

Notwithstanding we are told that the man "read no books, heard no sermons," etc., from the fact that he knew of St. Augustine and his warning to flee to "the tabernacle of God, the Catholic Church," coupled with the fact that there were many kind friends, especially a "Rev. Father," ready to help him, it is not clear by any means that the New Testament is responsible for the man's conversion to the Catholic Church. C. H. K.
