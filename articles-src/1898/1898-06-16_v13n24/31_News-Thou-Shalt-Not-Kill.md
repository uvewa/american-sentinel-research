THERE is a popular belief that the command "Thou shalt not kill," does not apply to the case of the man who goes to war. Seeing this view set forth in a recent letter from a correspondent, we fell to pondering the question as to which act is really the worse—to kill your private enemy in time of peace, or to kill one or more of the "public enemy" on the field of battle?

In the one case the individual kills a person against whom he has some grievance. His victim may be one who has done him a grievous injury. He has a reason in his mind which to him seems sufficient, for taking the other individual's life. But in battle, on the other hand, men shoot down other men who have done them no injury at all,—men against whom they feel no personal animosity, and with whom, under any other circumstances, they would be on terms of cordial friendship. We make some excuse for the man who acts in the heat of passion. Without at all justifying his deed, we recognize that there is a difference—all laws relating to murder and homicide recognize it—between such a case and that of the person who takes life with cool, deliberate calculation. In battle men take the lives of their fellows deliberately, urged neither by the heat of sudden passion nor by the sting of real or fancied injury. In which case is there shown the most cool disregard of human life and of the divine image which God has stamped upon his creatures?
