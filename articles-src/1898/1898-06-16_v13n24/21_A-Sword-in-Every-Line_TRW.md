THAT is what King Olaf of Norway called for according to Longfellow, a song that should have "a sword in every line." Olaf was a heathen in spirit though a Christian in name. He had advanced toward the religion of Christ only far enough to wear the title of Christian, but his heathen blood still leaped at the sound of clashing steel and his ears tingled with pleasure at the singing of war songs.

When we think of the literature that has been fed to the people of the world for ages, for all the ages so far, we cannot wonder that the war spirit so easily rouses to life, and that men crowd the martial ranks at the call of the bugle and the drum. You can scarce find a poet of fame either in old times or later, whose most popular lines, the verses into which the utmost energy was thrown, were not a war poem. English and American young men attending college have been exercised in Homer's Siege of Troy, or "Cæsar's Commentaries on the Art of War," or have been given Shakespeare to read, full to the brim with deeds of strife and bloodshed, or Scott with his talents all sounding out notes of battle, or Moore, or Byron, or Campbell, or Macaulay, and history itself is but a succession of descriptions of fights—Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander, Cambyses, Scipio, Pompey, Antony, Marlborough, Wellington, Napoleon, Washington, Grant.

These are the names that are spoken again and again, that histories are lighted with, and that the young male sex have always idolized, and do yet idolize. And the hosts of war always glare and blare in gold and blue and yellow and scarlet and feathers and brass.

And telling of these things, the literature of the world, history, poetry, or oratory, has through all time, like the song that King Olaf wanted, gleamed with a sword in every line. If a militia company is formed in a country town, they must, forsooth, march to a church, every once in a while, in full uniform, and have the minister preach to them, and set the eyes of the young all gazing with envy at the show of color, and glint of cloth and steel.

The military must have the place of honor every where, in a civic parade, in an agricultural fair, where stock and merchandize are supposed to be the chief attractions. And the crimes or misdeeds of a soldier, plundering, pilfering, marauding, are so covered over with glamour and splendor that they become deeds to imitate and emulate, rather than things to avoid.

Oh that people, especially young people, would learn that it takes just as much steady, honest, and honorable manhood to faithfully face irksome tasks day after day, at a continual plodding pace, as it does to storm a breach or to sink a fleet. It is the steady effort, continued through years of toil, either at study or at muscular labor, that builds the true heroic manhood.

Some time after the pension list of the last war had begun to grow large, a great laugh went the rounds at a joking pension claim, printed in the newspapers, that asked a pension for a crippled and ruined character, as a result of the war. The claimant urged that he had gone into the army a sober, modest, honest young man, and that in the service he had learned to drink, to smoke, and chew, to steal, to swear, and to be unchaste, and he thought these were as grievous hurts as if he had received a gunshot wound.

This may have been—presumably was—put out for a joke; but it was really no jest at all, and it will be repeated in this present war and in every war the world may ever see. That is what war does for its servants, its soldiers. That is war's natural teaching and tendency. I wish it were otherwise, or I wish it might be popular and pleasing to good people everywhere to tell them these things; but alas, people see heroism, where there is in addition to heroism all debasing circumstances. In active life the soldier is a marauder; in his quiet camp life he becomes an idler. And the accompaniments of his idleness are, in every camp, liquor, tobacco, gambling, and the other vices.

At home a man may have a wicked man for a neighbor, but he need not associate with him. In camp you have such for tent mates and for file comrades, for such men get into every company.

War draws such, and it makes more of the same kind.

Oh let us all pray that the day may hasten when the nations shall learn war no more.
