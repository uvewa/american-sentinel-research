In the first chapter of Romans, sixteenth verse, the Apostle Paul declares: "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."

The reason for this statement is that Christ is the sum and substance of the gospel, for Christ is the "power of God." 1 Cor. 1:24.

Any gospel that has no Christ in it does not have the power of God, and is a worthless thing.

Therefore the preaching of the everlasting gospel by the angel of Rev. 14:6, 7, is the preaching of the everlasting power of God, which is Christ.

That being so, that which Christ has to say to us in this everlasting gospel is: "Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters."

As said last week, anything that detracts from this cannot possibly be the gospel, and therefore must be opposed to Jesus Christ.

What the result must be in such a case may be seen from 2 Thess. 1:7, 8: "But to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."

The gospel requires all to "Fear God." It must be perfectly plain that those who fail to do this do not obey the gospel, and therefore it must be on such that Christ will come to take vengeance.

How shall we fear God? The failure to do this as shown above is no light thing. No human authority is sufficient to answer this question. It must be settled by the Word of God, than which there is no higher authority. "For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven." Ps. 119:89. "Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name." Ps. 138:2.

Before answering the question "How shall we fear God?" let us remember that all that the gospel requires of mankind is that we "fear God and give glory to him" . . . and worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters." When man does this he does all that God himself can possibly require of him.

Now let us appeal to the Scriptures in finding the answer to the question "How shall we fear God?" The answer is found to be: "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man." Eccl. 12:13. Put this scripture by the side of the one in Rev. 14:6, 7, and let the reader point out the difference between them. There is none. But we read further: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do his commandments." Ps. 111:10. And yet again: "And unto man he said, The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding." Job 28:28. If to keep the commandments of God and to depart from evil are both "understanding," then to depart from evil is to keep the commandments.

Thus from all these texts it is plain that to "fear God" one must keep his commandments.

As therefore the everlasting gospel calls upon "every nation, kindred, tongue and people" to "fear God," and as to fear God one must keep his commandments, it is as plain as language can make it that the everlasting gospel calls upon all to keep the commandments of God; and it is equally plain that he who does not keep the commandments does not obey the gospel of Christ.

Another thing is equally plain. As has been already pointed out, anything that detracts from the fear of God cannot be the gospel, and as to fear God one must keep the commandments it is everlastingly true that anything that detracts from the commandments of God cannot possibly be the gospel of Christ. Still further: As Christ himself is the substance of the gospel, and anything that detracts from the commandments of God cannot be the gospel, it is absolutely certain that in the thing that so detracts there is no Christ.

The warning of the third angel could not be proclaimed until the time had come for that to be fulfilled against which the angel lifts his voice. And no one can deny that that against which the angel warns the people is the work brought to view in the prophecy of Rev. 13: 11-18.

Concerning this prophecy it has been shown that the beast that had the deadly wound and was healed (Rev. 13:2, 12) is the papacy; and that the two-horned beast (v. 11) is the United States. It has also been shown that the first beast mentioned above is identical with the "man of sin" (2 Thess. 2:4), who was to "exalt himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God."

That being so, the enforcement of the mark (Sunday) by which all are to be made to worship the papacy, would be a work carried on in this country ostensibly that worship may be rendered to God. In other words it would be represented as being genuine gospel work.

It has been further shown that that work has been going on for upwards of forty years, and it has been and still is being represented as gospel work. But as the prophecy shows, its success does not exalt God, nor does it result in causing him to be worshiped.

When therefore this work is carried on professedly as gospel work, and when the third angel lifts his warning voice, it is perfectly fitting that the first angel should be present with his message showing what the gospel of Christ really is. It could not be that which results only in causing the papacy to be worshiped; it could not be that which would enforce upon the consciences of the people that which the prophecy calls the "mark of the beast;" but it would be that which calls upon all to "fear God, and give glory to him;" it would be that which calls upon all to keep the commandments of God; and it would be that which furnishes the power in order that those commandments might be kept.
