FONTAINE was a model soldier, so far at least as his conduct in battle was concerned. It is always desired that soldiers in battle shall take life coolly and deliberately, just as he took it; nor is it desired that they shall feel any conscientious scruples against it, for that would seriously detract from their value for military purposes. But we do not believe that such a condition of mind can be regarded as normal, much less Christian. In its normal condition there still remains in the human heart enough of the uprightness implanted by the Creator to cause an instinctive aversion to the taking of human life, whether for personal or political reasons.
