The Ministerial Association of Reading, Pa., are conducting a prosecution of the Reading baseball club for Sunday ball playing. A press item says: "The regular city ball ground was not used, but another ground two miles from the city, far away from any houses. The games were quiet and orderly, and pleased thousands."
