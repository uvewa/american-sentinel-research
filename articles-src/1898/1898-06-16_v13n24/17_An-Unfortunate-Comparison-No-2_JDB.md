While we are absolutely certain that if America must depend upon the character of her sports as the evidence of her civilization she must at once take her place on a level with Spain, we are no less certain that in all lines of material and intellectual progress she far outranks Spain. We are fully conscious of the blessings and enlightenment of liberty; we recognize the ignorance and barbarity of Spain. But never shall we seek to explain that difference by such a piece of puerile sophistry as a comparison of ball and bull-fight. We are thoroughly convinced that that difference is due, not to "the manner of spending the hour of recreation" (for as we have seen there is here essentially no difference), but to the facts stated by Macaulay more than fifty years ago in language which no one may misunderstand. He says in his essay on Von Ranke:

"It cannot be doubted that, since the sixteenth century, the Protestant nations have made decidedly greater progress than their neighbors. The progress made by those nations in which Protestantism, though not finally successful, yet maintained a long struggle, and left permanent traces, has generally been considerable. But when we come to the Catholic land, to the part of Europe in which the first sparks of the Reformation were trodden out as soon as it appeared, and from which proceeded the impulse which drove Protestantism back, we find, at best, a very slow progress, and on the whole a retrogression. . . . Compare the history of England and that of Spain during the last century. In arms, arts, sciences, letters, commerce, agriculture, the contrast is most striking. The distinction is not confined to this side of the Atlantic. The colonies planted by England in America have immeasurably outgrown in power those planted by Spain. Yet we have no reason to believe that, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Castilian was in any respect inferior to the Englishman. Our firm belief is, that the North owes its great civilization and prosperity chiefly to the moral effect of the Protestant Reformation, and that the decay of the Southern countries of Europe is to be mainly ascribed to the great Catholic revival."

Again, in his *History of England*, chap. 1, par. 22:

"During the last three centuries, to stunt the growth of the human mind has been her (the Church of Rome), chief object. Throughout Christendom, whatever advance has been made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth, and in the arts of life, has been made in spite of her, and has everywhere been in inverse proportion to her power. The loveliest and most fertile provinces of Europe have, under her rule, been sunk in poverty, in political servitude, and in intellectual torpor; while Protestant countries, once proverbial for their sterility and barbarism, have been turned by skill and industry into gardens, and can boast of a long list of heroes and statesmen, philosophers and poets. Whoever, knowing what Italy and Scotland naturally are, and what, four hundred years ago, they actually were, shall now compare the country around Rome with the country around Edinburgh, will be able to form some judgment as to the tendency of papal domination. The descent of Spain, once the first among monarchies, to the lowest depths of degradation, the elevation of Holland in spite of many natural disadvantages, to a position such as no commonwealth so small has ever reached, teach the same lesson. . . . On the other side of the Atlantic the same law prevails. The Protestants of the United States have left far behind them the Roman Catholics of Mexico, Peru, and Brazil."

Whatever has been, or is now, the enlightenment of the American people, we confess that we have little heart to congratulate them upon it, when the very moment they are denouncing another people for their ignorance, and barbarity, and general lack of all humane principles, past and present, they are themselves yielding to the control of the very power of lawlessness to whose domination is due the blackest pages of that history and the largest share of the present deplorable conditions. When the people of this country have so far forgotten the great Reformation and its benign influence upon their own destinies; when they have so far forgotten why their fathers came to this continent and why they established the American government; when they have so far forgotten the great and eternal principles of justice and liberty pronounced at the formation of that Government and which have ever been its true glory; when they have so far forgotten all the lessons taught both by the history of their own country and of Europe; when, in fact, they have so far forgotten everything that is worth remembering, as on the one hand to ascribe their national greatness to the fact that they "match human against human—not man against brute," and on the other to allow themselves without a word of remonstrance and almost with sycophantic complaisance to become "enclosed in the coils of the insidious diplomacy" of a power whose history for upwards of thirteen centuries has shown it to occupy "the highest place among the contrivances which have been devised for deceiving and oppressing mankind,"—we say when all this occurs with them, their condition stirs indeed with deep emotions the heart of every true patriot, but they are emotions not of pride and congratulation, but of pity and despair—of pity for them and of despair of their future freedom. Madison and Jefferson, were they living to day, would exclaim with even more vehemence than in its original utterance, "We know no name which will too severely reproach our folly!"

Would it not be vastly wiser and better in every respect, for the Times-Herald, instead of attempting to make capital out of Spanish bull-fights, and publishing laudations on "the patriotism of the Roman Catholics," and accounts of Archbishop Ireland's wonderful "peace efforts," to awake to the real danger to this country and speak accordingly—speak as would Jefferson, Madison, Macaulay, and every lover of liberty who has ever lived, were he and they alive to-day?
