A PROCLAMATION has been read in the camps of the United States troops calling attention to an order by the President directing that no Sunday work be done by the military forces except work of necessity. Has the President forgotten about Manila? In view of what recently occurred there, it would seem very inopportune to overlook Sunday as a day suited to the successful prosecution of military operations.
