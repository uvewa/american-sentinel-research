PROHIBITIONS of Sunday work are wont to exempt "works of necessity and mercy." This is the usual provision in the Sunday laws of the States. Now, since the war with Spain is, as we are told, a work of mercy in behalf of the suffering Cubans, who are doomed to starve while they wait, why should it not be considered proper to prosecute the war as vigorously on Sunday as on any other day of the week? If it be true that the war is one undertaken in the cause of suffering humanity, why is it not at all times a work of necessity and mercy? Is the President's proclamation to be taken as a denial of the necessity or mercy of this war?
