What are you doing to educate the people of this country in the principles of religious liberty? What do you purpose to do during the remainder of this year to help preserve the freedom which has been the heritage of the American people? Nothing—did you say? Then do not fall into the error of thinking there will be nothing done on either side of this controversy. There are people in this country who are not so indifferent toward what they regard as their opportunities and duties in the matter. The other side are doing something. They are doing a great deal more than they ever were before, to create public sentiment in favor of the rigid enforcement of religious laws. They believe in a campaign of education, and they have begun such a campaign in earnest. If you do nothing to educate the people, they will be educated, nevertheless; but it will be just the opposite of the education they ought to receive; and a heavy load of responsibility and of consequences will fall upon you who know the evil and the danger of the modern "reform" movements which involve a union of religion with the state. The activity and earnestness of the church and state party proclaim that the hour has come for the decisive effort in setting the truth before the people. The wise man is he who sees the opportunity when it comes and grasps it. Don't merely say, "I'm going to." The good things you are going to do never gave the devil any concern.
