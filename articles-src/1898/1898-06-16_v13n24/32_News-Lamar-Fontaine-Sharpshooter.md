A good illustration upon this point is furnished by an incident of the civil war which devastated this country back in the sixties. The incident is that of the feat of a Confederate sharpshooter, Lamar Fontaine, in killing sixty men in sixty minutes. Mr. Fontaine carried after the war a written certificate of his deed signed by General Robert E. Lee, who witnessed its execution. The following mention of it was made not long since by a New York City paper:—

"It was in the battle of Waterloo Bridge, just below Warrenton, Va., in August, 1862, and immediately before the second battle of Manassas, that General Lee witnessed Fontaine's feat of killing 'sixty Yankees in sixty minutes.'

"Stonewall Jackson, under whom Fontaine served, was flanking Pope. The Confederate sharpshooters had possession of a long frame building, and were pouring death into Pope's ranks, when Lee rode up.

"The general had heard of Fontaine's wonderful ability as a marksman, and paid him a visit. A Federal battery was then directed on the sharpshooters.

"'Train your glass on No. 1, at gun No. 1,' Fontaine said to General Lee, 'and you will see him jump up in the air in a minute, and another man will have to take his place.'

"Then he went on and killed sixty men, one after another, each in about a minute, until Lee told him to stop.

"'Doesn't your conscience ever hurt you when you do work of this kind?' inquired Lee.

"'Why, general,' replied Fontaine, 'when I enlisted in the army it was with the understanding that I was to kill as many of the enemy as I could. If I had any conscientious scruples against it I would quit the army. Don't you expect us to kill?'"

AND thus, minute after minute for an hour, this man went on cooly taking the lives of his fellowmen, making widows and orphans, inflicting the most cruel suffering upon innocent people, taking away the natural protector from innocent little children, leaving them to suffer for want of the things the father would provide for their comfort,—and all this was a matter of no more concern to him than the killing of game by the sportsman; it did not cause a ripple upon the surface of his conscience. We cannot avoid querying if this represents the normal condition of the human mind. To us it appears monstrously abnormal, fully as much so, certainly, as that condition in which an individual does that which the law calls murder or homicide.
