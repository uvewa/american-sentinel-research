The New York Sun is authority for the statement that on June 9 the Western University of Pennsylvania conferred the degree of LL.D on Admiral Dewey, in consideration of the fact that Dewey's ships have Pittsburg armor plate on their sides, and that a member of the faculty manufactured some of the "range finders" used on Dewey's guns. It seems there are various ways in which a university degree may be gotten hold of these days.
