This proclamation, of course, reflects the Sunday-observance sentiment that it is always seeking for recognition in governmental affairs. It has for a precedent the proclamation issued during the civil war by President Lincoln, which enjoined "the orderly observance of the Sabbath by the officers and men in the military and naval service." This proclamation was issued November 16, 1862, and was followed in December by the disastrous battle of Fredericksburg, and by other misfortunes to the Federal arms which made the close of that year a time of marked depression and gloom throughout the North. If any attention was ever paid to these instructions by the armies in the field, it has not become a matter of history. But whether there was or not, it is certain that this document contributed nothing to the success of the national cause.
