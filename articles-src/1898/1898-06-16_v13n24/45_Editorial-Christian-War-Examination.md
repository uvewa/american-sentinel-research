As has been stated frequently and at considerable length in the press reports, the volunteers for the army have been subjected to a rigid examination to ascertain their fitness for serving in the war. So rigid has this examination been that a large percent of the number failed to secure enlistment. But there is one thing that seems to have been strangely overlooked. It will be remembered that this is a Christian war—a war not only perfectly justifiable but actually demanded from the Christian standpoint. This has been declared so many times and with such positiveness by men in the pulpit as well as out of it that it is not to be supposed any question can be raised on that point. And yet we have not seen, so far, any intimation that a single one of the applicants for enlistment has been examined with reference to his Christianity. Apparently no interest whatever is taken by the authorities in the question whether the men are qualified from a Christian standpoint; but how can a Christian war be conducted by men unqualified as Christians? What is the explanation of this seeming oversight?
