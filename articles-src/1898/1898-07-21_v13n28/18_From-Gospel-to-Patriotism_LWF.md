Jesus said, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;" but one might be led to believe at the present time, judging from the popular oratorical efforts called sermons, that the great commission had been revised to read as follows: "Go ye into all the world, and preach patriotism to every creature."

"God forbid," exclaimed the apostle, "that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ;" but the cross has been placed in the background, and the flag is the supreme object of adoration.

The truthfulness of the above was witnessed in Kansas City, Mo., Sunday, July 3, when the different ministers seemed to vie with each other in the effort to work their audiences up to the highest pitch of patriotic excitement. One said, "God has placed his choicest vine, the Anglo-Saxon race, in this most fruitful of all hills—America. The race is the foremost in the world, and if but combined can dictate and enforce universal peace in the present and future."

But peace which has to be enforced is not the peace of the gospel. That is the "peace of God which passeth all understanding," which is in the heart and life, and keeps everyone who possesses it at peace with all mankind. But the peace which has to be enforced is like a caged tiger, ready to tear and destroy the moment the restraint is removed. Surely ministers of the gospel should preach the peace of the cross and not of the sword.

Another statement was, "The other stones that he has removed are slavery, bigotry, and religious persecution—all gone, forever gone." That was a pretty bold statement to make in the face of the fact that within the last few years there have been something like one hundred and fifty cases of religious persecution under the shadow of the much-lauded emblem of liberty—the stars and stripes. Does this minister not know that as high as eight men at one time have been worked in the chain-gang as common criminals just because their religious ideas and practices happened to differ from those of their persecutors?

These apostles of patriotism do not agree concerning the course the nation should pursue. One says, "No nation ever had a more noble cause than that which led us to the Philippines, to Cuba, Porto Rico, and will soon lead us to Spain, where the thunder of our artillery shall strike terror into the hearts of the proud Spaniards, our shells shall silence her batteries and lay her cities in the dust," encouraging the spirit of conquest; but another chimes in with, "A righteous purpose should not be endangered by patriotic ambition. America should not make territorial conquest. To do so is to bring upon us sin's reproach. I make no objection to reimbursing ourselves for actual outlay but to make conquest for one penny additional is to belittle ourselves before God and men."

And thus it goes, confusion upon confusion, and that too at the very time of all times when the ministers should stand as faithful watchmen on the walls of Zion, sounding the invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb. "Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments."
