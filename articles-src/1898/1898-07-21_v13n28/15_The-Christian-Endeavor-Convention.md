This convention—the seventeenth annual convention of the united societies of Christian Endeavor—was held in Nashville, Tenn., July 6-11.

In one respect the convention was a disappointment to the friends of the Endeavor movement,—the attendance fell far below the number that had been anticipated. Those in attendance were only about one third of the number that had been counted on by those in charge of the gathering. But the usual zeal and enthusiasm which has marked the Endeavor work hitherto, was manifested on this occasion, and the president and other leaders betrayed no doubts, if they felt any, that the convention was in every way a grand success.

Two large buildings on the grounds of the recent centennial exposition held in Nashville were utilized for the large general meetings of the convention, and at other times meetings were held in the various churches, which were plentifully scattered throughout the city. It is proclaimed as a cardinal feature of Christian Endeavor that the movement aims to teach loyalty to the church, and to closely identify itself with the regular church work in the respective denominations which it represents.

It would not take an observer long to discover what was the spirit of the convention. Fraternity was the uppermost thought in nearly every speech, and the verse of the familiar hymn beginning "Blest be the tie that binds" seemed liable to be called into use at almost any moment. There was fraternity between North and South, there was fraternity between white man and negro, and fraternity between American and Canadian, the latter being represented by a delegation from Toronto. In fact there was a very fraternal feeling for the people of all nations and countries, with one exception. That exception was a marked one; namely, the poor Spaniards who were in resistance to the arms of the United States. Whatever brotherly feeling for them might and doubtless would have been manifested under other circumstances, was on this occasion swallowed up in the tremendous enthusiasm felt and shown for the success of the national arms.

This indeed was the dead fly in the ointment of Christian love which seemed to be so prominent a feature of the gathering. In all justice to the rank and file of the Endeavor army, it must be said that one cannot long associate with them without receiving the impression that they are as sincere as they are earnest. They simply do not see that the spirit of Christianity and the spirit of nationalism do not harmonize with each other. The idea of working for Jesus in fulfillment of the great commission by him to his disciples, was made to blend completely with that of working to further the interests of the United States Government; and if there was in the minds of the speakers any conception of a difference between Christian warfare and the warfare of American soldiers before Santiago, there was nothing said or done to indicate the fact.

The report of the secretary, Mr. Baer, showed that there are Christian Endeavor societies in nearly every land, not excepting Spain. Indeed, it was mentioned in the report that Spain stood at the head of all countries in point of the proportionate increase of Junior societies; so that it is plainly to be inferred that the Endeavor movement has made considerable progress in that land. It was mentioned also that there are Endeavor societies among the troops now at the front fighting the battles of the nation in Cuba; and this statement led us to query whether there might not also be some societies among the troops on the Spanish side, and if so, what would become of the "tie that binds" when two societies should meet and stand opposed to each other in arms. It is strange that with such considerations plainly before them, Christian people should fail to see that "patriotism," which calls to the defense of the national flag, in Spain as well as in every other land, cannot harmonize with a work which embodies the divine principle of love to all men, without distinction of class or nation. We cannot say that we love those whom we are trying to kill.

An incident related by one speaker at the "Sabbath Observance" meeting, held in the First Presbyterian Church of Nashville, on Sunday, the 10th, illustrates how the spirit of "patriotism" tends to substitute itself even for religion in the unguarded mind. A teacher of a youthful Sunday-school class was questioning his pupils on the subject of the ten commandments. Coming to the fourth, he asked who could repeat it, and no one responding, he thought it might be well to prompt them a little, and so he began with "Remember," when with a look of sudden confidence one boy with upraised hand signified his readiness to answer.

"You may tell us," said the teacher.

"Remember the Maine!" was the prompt reply.

And one would have thought, from the prominence given at the convention to the glorification of the war spirit, or rather, of the spirit of nationalism which at that time was finding its fullest expression in the war, that "Remember the Maine" was accounted even there as having almost the moral obligation of a command of God.

There was no manifest move made on this occasion in the direction of influencing legislation for the promotion of religious ends, or of exercising the power of the society through political channels; though it is not to be supposed that the society has changed its attitude toward such projects from that shown at previous conventions. The ideas which have been put to the front by the war with Spain and the projected Anglo-Saxon alliance, overshadowed others which, had the situation been different, would no doubt have been given some prominence. It was evident that the society considers itself an important factor in the solution of problems of national and international importance. It will lend its power in this way to the Government, and—what would naturally follow, though perhaps not now contemplated—will receive in return the exercise of governmental power and authority for the promotion of its ends. The society takes to itself—rightfully perhaps—no small credit in bringing about the happy obliteration of sectional animosity between North and South, and it was affirmed by one speaker that had the society been in existence previous to 1861, the Civil War would never have occurred.

The prominence given to the idea of Anglo-Saxon fraternity was indicated by draping the speaker's desk in the auditorium with the English and American flags and with the various military airs which were rendered, the convention did not forget "God Save the Queen." The statement was made by a prominent speaker that at the convention of 1900, which is to meet in London, Eng., there will be drawn up, signed and sealed, through the influence of Christian Endeavor, the long-talked of international alliance between Great Britain and the United States. This was received by the audience with great applause.

And thus, by its blending of Christianity with nationalism,—with the aims and purposes of civil government, carried forward by carnal agencies, as is the present war with Spain; by its adoption, in short, of the idea of national Christianity—does the great Christian Endeavor movement lend itself—unconsciously it may be but none the less truly—to the general movement so widespread throughout the religious world, which aims at the establishment of an earthly, political, sensual, impossible, kingdom of God.

The convention of next year will be held in Detroit, Mich., and will no doubt be largely attended, not presenting the objection of a long journey to the South which seems to have been mainly responsible for the absence of so many expected delegates from the convention of 1898.
