The report of the committee of Congress appointed to investigate the character of the transaction by which the Methodist Book Concern at Nashville, Tenn., and its hired lobbyist, received $288,000 of the people's money, severely scores the agents of the Book Concern and the attorney who was given 35 per cent. of the collected claim. It absolves the M. E. Church, South, from blame. The agents and the attorney claim that it was none of the business of Congress as to what use was made of the money after Congress had paid it over to the Methodist institution; and in this they are clearly right. The suit was for damages, and as such was no more subject, properly, to a restriction upon the use to which it might be put than would be any claim for damages paid in any other suit. If the claim was just at all, the money was the absolute property of the claimant, and Congress could have no more right to say what should be done with it than it would have to dictate in such a matter to any private citizen. The fact that the committee of Congress did assume the right to dictate upon this point shows that they recognized that the claimants had not a clear right to the money paid them.

The party most deserving of censure in this affair is the party by whose vote this church claim upon the people's money was recognized as valid and the principle of separation between church and state violated. That deception was practiced upon Congress in such a matter was only a natural incident in connection with a transaction thoroughly bad and thoroughly unamerican in principle.
