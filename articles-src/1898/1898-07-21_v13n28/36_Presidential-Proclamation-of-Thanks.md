The President, by recent proclamation, directed that the nation's thanks to God should be mingled with their rejoicings in view of the great successes achieved by the national arms against the Spanish. In the nature of things this amounted to a request upon the church, to which of course they were willing enough to respond. It being a poor rule that will not work both ways, we may look for the churches to be making requests of the President one of these days.
