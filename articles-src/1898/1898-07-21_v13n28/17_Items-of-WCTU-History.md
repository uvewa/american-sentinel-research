It has seemed the rule among our departments that one very soon called for another; and in giving these items of history I must adopt the method that is often employed by story tellers; breaking suddenly off in one scene to introduce another for the purpose of maintaining the real connection between incidents and revealing the true line of progression.

The scheme of departments as it has been perfected leaves them grouped under six general heads—Organization, Prevention, Education, Evangelistic, Social, and Legal. From the beginning the Evangelistic was in the lead of all our methods, as I have endeavored to show in articles already written, and it still remains as the heart and soul of every line of work. We all agree that no department can get on without an intimate relation with the truth as given in the Word of God, and it is generally recognized that the inspiration of every line of work must be from the source of all power, which is the Holy Spirit. In addition to this there is recognized the necessity of correct methods. Each department grew out of some urgent necessity, which arising in some little corner became recognized as universal, and as soon as discovered the question would be asked, "What shall we do about it?" and immediately that question would become as universal as the need, and the effort to answer it would engage the attention of the entire body. 'What shall we do?' 'How shall we go to work?' 'How shall we meet this obstacle?' 'How shall we carry forward this important truth?' were always live questions to every white ribbon.

Trained workers was one of the earliest necessities realized among us,—women skilled in dealing with souls, in giving practical help of all kinds such as would meet all sorts of needs. It was in the Evangelistic Department that this necessity first became urgent, and, I think, in '76 or '77 at the Temperance Convocation held at Lake Bluff, Ill., I made the first effort to organize a Training School, at which we discussed principles and methods, as well as needs, and how to bring about the very best application of the one to the other.

We began in the little hall which had been erected by the W. C. T. U. of Chicago for their meetings on the Assembly Grounds. The beginning was small and all the efforts were of an experimental nature. None of us had any really definite idea as to what we should teach, or how to teach it. We only knew it was necessary to learn from some source how to do our work; and with a profound sense of our dependence upon God, we came together for our first session. Among the number present and interested was Mrs. Jennie F. Willing, not at that time especially active in the W. C. T. U., because her time was fully occupied as wife of a city pastor, but she had been one of that company at Chautauqua who took the initial steps toward the organization of the National, and being interested in everything pertaining to W. C. T. U. work, she became one of the most faithful and earnest attendants and helpers in this first training school, and is at present in her widowhood superintendent of the last and best result of this growing idea, which is to be found in the Home and School for W. C. T. U. evangelists and missionaries located in "Hell's Half Acre," New York City.

The advantages to accrue from trained workers became at once so apparent, that the Training School was adopted and made a department of the National at the next convention, with the writer as superintendent. I could not, however, possibly accept this addition to my responsibilities, since I already had the superintendency of the Evangelistic Department, and my work as evangelist also. This was not an easy department to fill, but after a while Mary Allen West, of most blessed memory, a practical teacher, and for many years superintendent of public schools in Galesburg, Ill., was induced to take the work of organizing in this important line, and the "School of Methods" grew up under her forming hand into a power that was felt far and wide. She gave to this effort her most earnest service, and accomplished for the untaught and untrained in our ranks what can never be adequately appreciated. Her work was of the same character as that which is to be found in the silent forces of atmosphere, gravity, sunshine, cause and effect; things which are so necessary, so unconsciously appropriated, that sometimes we even forget to say thank you for them. Mary Allen West was a woman whom we could not afford to lose, but in the midst of her most arduous labors she died after a short illness in Japan.

The Evangelistic Institute was one of the developments of the new department, and was my own special field. In prosecuting the work of this institute, my plan was to occupy the early morning hour at conventions with an Institute drill, taking up each department, and teaching the gospel principles as related to it, and the methods required for its successful operation. Local unions would also call for an institute, sometimes two or three combining for a week's study. Sessions of two hours each would be held during the morning and afternoon, with a public lecture in the evening. The women were enrolled, and came to the work like pupils in school. We would study together everything that was involved in the departments grouped under the six different heads which I have already given. These institutes were always occasions of great spiritual growth and power. They were not confined to members of the Union. Ministers, teachers, members of churches, and all who were interested in philanthropic work would come and study methods with us. Many times beginning in a small room in some church, we would be obliged after two or three sessions to take our school into the Auditorium, and it not infrequently developed into a regular revival in which souls would be converted, and workers brought out into a rich experience, in both truths and methods, such as they had not known before, by which men and women were rescued from vice.
