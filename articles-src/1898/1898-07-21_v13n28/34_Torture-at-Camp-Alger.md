The report comes from "Camp Alger," one of the military camps of the volunteer army of the United States, of a proceeding under military authority which would disgrace any nation laying claim to civilization. It is quite proper, of course, to maintain camp discipline, even by rigid regulations; but in this case a private named Cooper, belonging to the 159th Indiana volunteers, was punished for being absent without leave, by being made to sit astride a sharp-edged "saw-horse," with hands and feet tied, for four hours underneath a burning sun, and subjected the while to the jeers and taunts of his companions. His sentence, which was by court-martial, called for eight hours of this torture; but upon being taken down at the end of four hours the victim was unable to stand, and was carried to his tent, where for several days he remained in a critical condition, the account stating that he would probably "pull through."

Such a mode of punishment is one that rivals the tortures of the Inquisition. It was once practiced in the British army, but was long since abolished as a relic of media-valism unfitted to survive among the customs of an enlightened age.

The Constitution of the United States declares that "cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted" upon any persons subject to the laws of this Government. But the tendency of militarism is to override all other power and authority. In its very nature it is essentially arbitrary and despotic.

And this is done in the army by whose agency the Government is conducting a "holy war." Verify the incident savors of the "holy wars" of former times. Let us talk less loudly about the cruelties of Spanish rule which the Government is waging war to displace with our own high civilization. And as for a "holy war," it need only be said that such a war can be conducted only by a holy agency; a holy war cannot be waged with carnal weapons, or by other than holy men.
