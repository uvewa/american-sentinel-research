The "National Christian Citizenship League" has published a "Declaration of Dependence," for which it would like to have the indorsement of all American citizens, or at least of a sufficient majority to give it national recognition. It was written by President M. Woolsey Stryker, of Hamilton College. It reads as follows:—

"God alone is the author of being and the head of nations. His service alone is liberty. Law has its authority and its sanctions in him. Freedom, security, truth, concord, peace, are his gifts. Obedience to him comprehends and guarantees all personal and all public blessings.

"Therefore we, the citizens of the United States of America, do pronounce this Declaration of Dependence upon his gracious care and government.

"We acknowledge his revelation of human duty and hopes, declared in the Son of man as the Redeemer of all souls and of all peoples, and we affirm that the gospel of God has been and shall increasingly be the light of the world.

"We avow our singular history to have been an exhibition of his merciful providence, and we hold our land, our government, our resources, to be a holy trust for the blessing of all mankind. The peoples of the earth are the wards of God's love, and their enlightenment and responsibility to God alone must be the goal and true glory of nations.

"We implore this Supreme Ruler to vindicate Himself anew in overruling the forces of unrest and hate, and in hastening the abolition of war with its attendant cruelties and burdens.

"We declare that the law of Christ is the only solvent of false conditions, and that its application to all relations affords the only security against social disaster and international catastrophe. Whatever is unmindful of God's one Fatherhood, and man's one brotherhood thereunder, is the foe of order, of justice, and of the freedoms so hardly won.

"We confess our personal and national sins against this Blessed and only Potentate. We deplore our unmindfulness of his promises and his patience. We entreat his pardons and his gracious recovery of our alienation and his merciful succor that we may yet abide his whole decree.

"We humbly supplicate his grace that our rulers and magistrates may become such as fear him, and that in all our communities a new spirit of righteousness may live and abound. And therefore we do pledge ourselves to seek those ways which exalt a nation, and to resist the selfish and corrupt forces which lie against the Creator and frustrate the common good.

"That 'his will may be done on earth' we will unite our hearts, our thoughts and our hands; and to this Declaration and testimony we offer our lives, our fortunes and our honor. So help us God!"

This "Declaration of Dependence" says, in principle, exactly the opposite of what is said in the Declaration of Independence. This will be evident upon examination.

The Declaration of Independence asserts that all men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, to preserve which governments are instituted among men; and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.

But this Christian citizenship document asserts that citizens of the United States must be Christians. "We, the citizens of the United States, do pronounce this Declaration," etc. It denies to all others the right to be citizens of this nation. And thus denying to them participation in the affairs of the government, it denies that all men have those rights which are affirmed in the Declaration of Independence. Only "Christians" participating in the government, and applying the "law of Christ" in governmental procedure, the "consent of the governed" would become the consent of "Christians" only; and all others might be governed without their consent and forced to conform to "Christian" laws of the government, or they could emigrate to some distant and more hospitable land.

The government founded upon the principles of the Declaration of Independence gives equal rights to all persons, without distinction of race or sect. By those principles it has grown great, and by them its greatness, if not lost, will be maintained.

It is strange that many people do not see—or profess not to see—that what would be proper and fitting for an individual, or for a church, in respect of an acknowledgment of dependence upon God, would be an utterly improper policy for a civil government. The government represents force, coercion, and cannot combine with religion without bringing coercion to bear upon some at least in religious matters. And this is directly contrary to Christianity.
