In following these articles, and noting especially what has been said with reference to the Sabbath, it may still be possible that some one will contend that we are attaching too much importance to this question—that we are making one's loyalty to the whole gospel hinge upon the keeping of the Sabbath. With regard to this last point we confess that it is logical and accept the conclusion.

But the reader will please bear in mind that we are not alone in this. The logic of this whole question was seen long ago by National Reformers and their allies.

Leaving out for the moment the question of which day is the Sabbath, we could not put the matter more definitely and clearly than they have done it. To show this we will recall a few utterances that have already been quoted in these articles, and which were made by National Reformers. Speaking of Sunday, Dr. Everts says: "It is the test of all religion." Again he says, "The people who do not keep the Sabbath have no religion." These statements are strong, but the climax is reached when it is said, "He who does not keep the Sabbath does not worship God; and he who does not worship God is lost."

Keeping these quotations in mind we will now read from the Scriptures as to how sinners are saved. The apostle says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek." Rom. 1:16. The gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation, because the gospel of Christ is Christ himself, for he is the power of God. 1 Cor. 1:24. What this salvation is, we are told in Matt. 1:21: "And thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins." It is not necessary to multiply scriptures on this point, but we will quote one more to show what the result will be to the sinner who rejects the gospel: "And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." 2 Thess. 1:7-9.

From these scriptures it will be seen that he who rejects the gospel is lost. Now place by the side of this the words of Dr. Everts, "He who does not keep the Sabbath does not worship God; and he who does not worship God is lost." No one will fail to see the argument of Dr. Everts. If his proposition is true, then it is true that he who does not keep the Sabbath is lost. But those only are lost, as we have seen from the scriptures, who reject the gospel. That being so, it is as clear as day, according to Dr. Everts, that he who does not keep the Sabbath rejects the gospel. It is therefore the truth that those who are laboring so earnestly to have Sunday enforced by civil enactment hinge one's loyalty to the gospel upon the keeping of that day, supposing it to be the Sabbath. And it is because of this that they call Sunday a mark or sign.

The logic of the whole situation therefore is this: no matter on which side of the question one stands—whether he believes the seventh day or the first day to be the Sabbath—he is bound to the conclusion that one's attitude to the Sabbath determines his attitude to the gospel. From this there is no escape.

But the seventh day and the first day cannot both be the Sabbath any more than the mark of the beast can be the mark of God. And as one's attitude to the gospel is determined by his attitude to the Sabbath it is impossible that too much importance can be attached to the question. And that being so, it is of the highest importance that we know which day is the Sabbath. And further, it is of the highest importance that we know the relation that the Sabbath sustains to the gospel.
