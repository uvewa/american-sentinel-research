"But what about the verse that says 'God's glory shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea'? asked Charlie. 'I'm thinking of the millennium,'" said Charlie, as Mrs. Ross looked up inquiringly.

"But that verse will be fulfilled after the millennium."

"How, mama? The last we studied about was the fire coming down from heaven and devouring Satan and his hosts. I want to ask you a lot of questions about that too."

"Let me answer your first question first. The fire that falls on the evil hosts will also consume from the earth itself, the curse that has caused it to wither and decay. Peter says, 'The elements shall melt with fervent heat.' Isaiah says, 'It is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion. And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.'"

"Where will the city be during the terrible fire?"

"I believe it will be in the midst of the fire. The prophet asks, 'Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?' The answer is, 'He that walketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.' The prophet tells what such people will see. He says, 'Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty; they shall behold the land of far distances. . . . thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down.'"

"Everlasting burnings? Will the city always remain in the midst of fire? Is the earth to be hell? I keep getting mixed up in my ideas, mama."

"No; the burnings will cease when all that will burn is consumed. Malachi says, 'Ye shall go forth, and tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under your feet.' When speaking of the burning of the earth, Peter says, 'Nevertheless we according to his promise look for new (or more properly, renewed) heavens and a new (or renewed) earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.' John saw just how it would appear in its renewed state, and says, 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no more sea.' Isaiah says, 'The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them, and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.'"

"How beautiful!" exclaimed Charlie. Will it really be the earth, the solid old earth?"

"It will be a solid earth then, my boy; but not an old earth. It will be the earth as it was when it first came from God's hand in its primeval glory."

"How long will we live in the earth then?"

"Always, Charlie. The earth was given to the children of men."

"Well, I always thought the earth was all right if the people in it were only well, beautiful, and good."

"They will be there. 'The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick, the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.' As for the beautiful, John says, 'It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but when He shall appear, we shall be like him,' and you know he is 'altogether lovely.' And 'God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;' and 'the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.'"

"There will be no oppression in the new earth, mama."

"No indeed. God's glory, and his glory is love, will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.

"They won't need any prisons. No one will be looking for heretics. Those who dwell there will have no check put on thought and love. They will follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, and there will be no Calvary in the path."

"Do you suppose we will live as we do here, mama?"

"Isaiah says we 'shall build houses and inhabit them, plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.'"

"Why, mama, eternal life never looked more delightful to me. Will we do just as we please?"

"Yes, because we shall delight in the law of God."

"Will we keep the Sabbath there, mama?"

"Yes indeed. God's memorial is from generation to generation. The memorial of his creative power will stand forever. Isa. 66:22, 23, says, 'For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord."

"Then the time will come when all on earth will keep the Sabbath."

"Yes, Charlie."

"What will the Sunday keepers think about it mama? for many will be saved who here always kept Sunday."

"Yes, through ignorance, believing it to be the Sabbath of the Lord. Oh, how glad they will be to go up before God on his blessed holy day. They will call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable."

"What glorious worship we shall be able to give to God then! How the beautiful city will ring with our praises! How good it will be to be there, when the glory of the Lord covers the earth as the waters cover the sea," said Charlie.

"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," said Mrs. Ross, reverently.
