Give the child a chance. Suppose he has not done exactly right. Perhaps he sees his error, and is sorry for it, but has not come to the point of expressing his repentance. Wait a little. Do not nip the tender bud of regret by the harsh breath of blame. Think how patient God is with you. Think how all the laws of his great household are made with a view to his children's development, their growth in all spiritual perfections.

"But," says the father, "the child's got to obey, and that's the long and short of it."

"Is that the way men talk about their corn and their potatoes, their wheat and their grass crops? No, indeed! Soils, methods, fertilizers, are studied anxiously, carefully; but alas, in what haphazard fashion is the precious human product cultivated.

Make the child happy when it is possible. See what plans God has made for his children's happiness. In the sunshine of joy the little human heart develops naturally, harmoniously. In grief, and anger, and sullenness, he is repressed, chilled, thwarted, distorted.

A child should be allowed to have "his own way" whenever that way is innocent. The child's natural, innocent ways are the Maker's ways. Do we not thwart God when we thwart the impulses that he has put into little children? If we would become children with them, we might enter into their heaven. Becoming one with them in love, our knowledge and experience would be available for their safe and tender guidance.
