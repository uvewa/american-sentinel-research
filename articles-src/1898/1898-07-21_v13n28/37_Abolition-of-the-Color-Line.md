One of the many pleasant things to be observed at the meetings of the late Christian Endeavor convention in Nashville, Tenn., was the abolition of the "color line" which is supposed to exist in every section of the South. Negroes and white people sat in the same seats, and no discrimination against the former was visible in any way. Two prominent speakers at the convention were negroes, and the finest music to which the audiences listened was furnished by the Fisk Jubilee singers, all colored. Jesus Christ died for all; hence there is no color line in Christianity and in Christian endeavor. And to deny to one of dark color equality with those of lighter hue in point of natural right, does not tend to the uplifting of the former in the scale of moral and social worth.
