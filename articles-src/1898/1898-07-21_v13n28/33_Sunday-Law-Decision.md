Another Sunday-law decision is at hand, and it comes from the Supreme Court of the United States. The case is that of a New York City barber, Henry Havnor, who in 1895 refused to obey the barber Sunday law of this city, which prohibits barber work on Sundays after one o'clock p. m. The case was appealed to the State Supreme Court, then to the Court of Appeals, and now comes the decision of the Federal Supreme Court affirming the opinion given in these lower courts. Mr. Havnor's counsel contended that he was deprived of the equal protection of the laws by being forced to close his shop on Sundays, and that such interference in his business was an unwarrantable exercise of the police power. Upon these points therefore a contrary verdict has been given by the highest court.
