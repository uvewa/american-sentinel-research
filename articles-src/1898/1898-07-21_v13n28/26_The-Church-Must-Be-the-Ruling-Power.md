REFERRING to the political attitude taken up by the Council of Churches, the Australian Christian World says: "The day has come when the Christian church must be the ruling power in the State." "The Council of Churches is working toward this end, and we wish it success."

But Jesus has said, "My kingdom is not of this world." "Be subject to [not rulers of] the powers that be."

To see the world ruled in righteousness by the Lord Jesus Christ is a consummation devoutly to be desired, but to see it ruled by any set of men who may assume to themselves the right to govern as his vicegerents and to interpret his law, is another matter altogether.

The former is to be brought about by the coming again of the Lord in the clouds of heaven. The latter, with its attendant dangers is all that can be expected from religio-political agitation.

Let no one be misled into hoping to see the kingdom of heaven advanced by political schemes.

The gospel, and not the ballot box, is the power of God unto salvation.
