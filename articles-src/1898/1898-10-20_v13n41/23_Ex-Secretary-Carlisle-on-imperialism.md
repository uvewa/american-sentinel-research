Ex-Secretary of the Treasury Carlisle, in giving expression to his views on the policy of imperialism, says that the gravest question now before the American people is the question "whether they shall allow a war prosecuted ostensibly for the independence of a foreign people be made the pretext or occasion for changing the very essence of our national character and for converting their own Government into a great war making, tax-consuming, land-grabbing, and office-distributing machine."

And referring to the fundamental American principle of government by the consent of the governed, set forth in the Declaration of Independence, Mr. Carlisle said further:

"So far as the example and influence of our republican institutions have educated the minds and encouraged the aspirations of mankind, a repudiation of the United States of the principle that all just governments must be founded upon the consent of the governed would set the world back more than a century, and all the arguments that have been presented, all the battles that have been fought and all the progress that has been made in the long struggle to emancipate the people from the domination of self-constituted and hereditary rulers will be lost by a single false step taken in the delirium of triumph over a prostrate and dying monarchy. Better a thousand times that monarchial Spain should continue to rule a people against their will than that the United States should usurp her place and hold them in subjection in the name of liberty and humanity."
