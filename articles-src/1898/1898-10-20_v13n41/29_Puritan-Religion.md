### Puritan Religion.

A description of the old New England Sunday is calculated to make restless children of the present day, and possibly some of their elders, thankful they were not born two centuries ago.

Sunday morning a horn was loudly blown to announce the hour of worship; service began at nine o'clock and lasted for eight hours, with an intermission of one hour for dinner and conversation. In the earliest days the congregation sat on rude benches, their seats being assigned them at town-meeting. The service consisted of several parts, which are chronicled in an ancient diary as follows:—

"Preliminary prayer or invocation; chapter of Bible read and expounded; Psalm in metre, read out line by line by Deacon S.; long prayer on various matters, one hour and a half; sermon of one hundred to one hundred and fifty pages. At close of service, baptism; sinners put on trial, confessed before congregation. Minister C. bowed right and left, no person stirring till he had passed down and out of the meeting-house."

An attempt is to be made on a certain day not yet selected in the year 1900 to take an exact census of the population of the earth, the reports to be sent in to a central establishment at Berne, Switzerland. The distribution of those who take the census will be made upon the estimates of population made by John Bartholomew, F. R. G. S., of Edinburgh. These are that, in round numbers, the population of the world is 1,525,500,000, divided as follows: Indo-Germanic, or Aryan, 545,500,000; Mongolian, or Turanian, 630,000,000; Negro and Bantu, 150,000,000; Hottentot and Bush, 150,000,000; Malay and Polynesian, 35,000,000; and American Indian, 15,000,000.
