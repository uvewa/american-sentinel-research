The Spanish nation has undertaken the gigantic task of restoring its annihilated navy. At a public meeting held in Madrid the plan was adopted setting each province and the leading cities and town to the task of providing one or more ships of the first, second, or third class of naval vessels, or some of each. The project provides for the construction or purchase of eighteen first class battleships, twenty-one of the second class, and forty-six of the third class,—eighty-five in all. If Spain has the energy, patriotism, and perseverance to accomplish all this, she will become a naval power not to be overlooked among the leading military powers of the earth. But the money spent in this way must be taken from the channels of peaceful industry and advancement in civil pursuits, leaving the nation stranded upon the shoals of financial distress. What Spain wants—what every nation wants—is not a larger navy, but more of the principles of just government in the hearts of rulers and of the people.
