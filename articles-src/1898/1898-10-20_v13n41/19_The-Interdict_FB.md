# The Interdict.

BY FANNIE BOLTON.

Black Flags hung from the windows, ominously,
A gloom swept thickly through the sunbeams' mesh
As though the wings of hell's battalions waved
Across God's benediction. Black cowled priests
Frowned from beneath their tosiars. Children clung
With piteous fear upon their mothers' skirts,
And men looked stern and stony with despair.
Maidens as pale as ashes grasped their beads,
Involuntarily muttering rosaries. In vain
The crowds wailed wildly at the iron-barred doors
That shut the great cathedral to their feet.
The shrines were vacant, and no pitying priest
Delayed to hear a soul's confession out.
No absolution waited for men's prayer,
No blessing for love's marriage, and no font
Whose holy water made baptismal rite.
Men looked in one another's eyes in fear,
And women wailed and shrieked, and children sobbed.
Black death and plague, war, famine, feud and blood
Was nothing to the soul's damnation sure,
And heaven shut away and locked from men
By him who held the keys in Peter's place,
Vicegerent of the Son of God on earth.

Horror took hold where superstition reigned.
Men lost their manhood, and lay prone in dust
Before a man. Women were faint with fear,
Not for themselves so much as for their babes
Denied adoption to the home above
Then devils raged, exultant in their glee,
Delighted at the torture of the soul;
Their Inquisition chamber crowded full
Of souls on racks, thumb-screwed and in the stocks,
'Neath iron pinchers, in the iron boot,
And clasped and spiked within the cruel breast
Of the unfeeling virgin. Men wizened
And grew old, and shrieked the more
When from a door a corpse was carried out,
And laid as Judas in a Potter's Field,
Lost, lost—forever lost!

Then such a wail rose from the stricken town
That nought but demons could withstand, and he
Who sat in Peter's chair received again
The humble suppliants that kissed his toe,
And put their necks beneath his jeweled foot,
And heaven again was opened, bells were rung,
Cathedrals crowded, and the holy font
Sprinkled its drops upon the innocent.
Marriage was blest, the dead were laid away
In consecrated burial ground once more,
Nor was the mass denied the soul in pain.
Men smiled and women kissed their babes, and said
The heaven is not brass to us to-day,
For lo, the pope has rolled our guilt away.

We in the light of better days look back,
And smile and weep and wonder at old Prague
Under the interdict. Yet stay
Are we so far from such a scene to-day?
What means the clamor for the arm of state
To give the church a power to wield such sway?
What means the clamor for a Sunday law
To hold the weak in thrall, the bad in awe?
And add to sin hypocrisy, that so
Our nation may the curse of heaven know?
What! Can human law make righteous? Can
Compulsion change the heart of any man?
Hath God left souls to utter derelict
And given us over to man's interdict?
Who shuts up heaven, but each man for himself?
Salvation is not won by power or wealth.
No arm of law that bids men wail, can bring
The soul to Christ, and make him the soul's king.
Away with laws religious on our books!
Keep to the Pattern. See how mild He looks.
Render to Cæsar Cæsar's, and to God
That which is his, and bring on men no rod
Man made, else will man be the fool of man,
And hell exult to spoil high heaven's plan.
Shall we go back a thousand years to-night
In face of history's torch and heaven's light?
Nay. By all means watch, work, sleep not, lest quick
Hell steal a march on us in interdict.

O sorrow! Helpless falls the pen away.
'Twill come. 'Tis coming at no distant day.
The world shall mourn, and devils shall deride,
Their wings the glorious light of heaven shall hide
Save from the wise who will look up, and be
Bound by all earth, but by all heaven set free.
And from that interdict, no pope shall free;
The King of kings himself shall bid it flee;
And when hell falls beneath his high advance,
And evil falters at his lightning glance,
Then interdict shall ne'er fill men with pain
And nought but love be known to souls again.
