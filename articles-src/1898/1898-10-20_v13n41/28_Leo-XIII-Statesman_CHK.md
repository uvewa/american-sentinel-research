### Leo XIII., Statesman.

The eyes of all Europe are turned towards this country, anxious to know what the Americans will do with the Philippines.

Not the least interested are the Catholics of the Old World on account of the vast interests of the Catholic Church in those islands, for the United States has demanded that there should be a separation there of church and state.

One thing is evident: the Catholics expect to be the gainers in the end, by such a step, though they may lose somewhat, even to the confiscation of their churchly possessions.

There is something however, which the Catholic Church regards more than these. What it is will appear from the following, in a letter by W. T. Stead, in the Sunday *World*, of October 2.

Mr. Stead reports a conversation had with a Catholic official of high rank in the Belgian government, but of pronounced liberal views, even to the extent that he thought it would be a good thing for church and state in the Philippines to be separated.

Having recently come from the Vatican whither he had been called for counsel by the pope and the cardinal Secretary of State, he was asked if the pope shared his view with reference to the religious liberty question in the Philippines.

Note the reply: "You cannot expect the pope to make any declaration in that sense. He could not do so without *repudiating doctrines* affirmed by his predecessors. *But he is a statesman*: he is a practical man, and Rome is swarming with American clerics who have considerable influence at the Vatican. . . . Of course as a *matter of principle* no pope can declare in favor of any refusal to enforce religious uniformity. But if you ask me what I really believe I must tell you that if the Americans establish religious liberty in the Philippines, the pope will *find his compensation* in the increased liberty which he will enjoy in dealing with the clergy without the *intermeddling of the civil power*."

Of course it goes without saying that the Catholic Church is intolerant—it is eternally opposed to religious liberty; and the pope, from principle, could not declare himself in favor of any such thing as religious liberty. To do so would indeed be to deny his church of which he is the head.

But, and mark the word, "the pope is a statesman and a practical man." Of course he is, and there is none better: and therefore Leo XIII. can be relied upon to exhibit his statesmanship by hoodwinking other statesmen (and Americans at that) into the belief that he is not opposed to religious liberty. Any loss to the papacy in the Philippines will, it is expected, be compensated for by the increased liberty the pope "will enjoy in dealing with the clergy without the *intermeddling of the civil power*." And this compensation Leo III., pope and statesman, can be relied upon to get.

That is so. For years the popes have been restive because of the restraints imposed upon them by the "intermeddling civil powers." In his encyclical of Jan. 6, 1892, to the hierarchy in America, the pope says of the Catholic Church: "She would bring forth more abundant fruits, if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority."

This is what she is after; this is the compensation looked for, and to get it, Leo XIII., pope and statesman, would be willing to lose a good deal in the Philippines. And furthermore, there is no question but what he will get it.
