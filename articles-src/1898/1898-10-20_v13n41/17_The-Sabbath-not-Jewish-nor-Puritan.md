### The Sabbath not Jewish nor Puritan.

ADVOCATES of a Puritan Sunday are wont to refer in very disparaging terms to the "Jewish Sabbath," not stopping to consider that it is a fact that the Puritan Sunday and the real Jewish Sabbath are in their natures almost identical. Both are man-made institutions claiming to be based upon the Sabbath commandment of the Decalogue, and the same narrowness of conception appears in each. The following words from J. L. Hurlburt, D.D., in the Classmate, state some essential truths upon this subject:—

"The Jew was very strict in the observance of the Sabbath. He would not leave a grain of corn on the ground after feeding the hens; it might take root, and that would be planting. He must not bruise the grass with his feet; that would be threshing. He had a solemn law prohibiting him from catching a flea, for that would be hunting. He could not wear heavy nails in his shoes, for that would be carrying a burden; nor wear false teeth for the same reason. The Puritans thought it a sin for a boy to whistle on the Sabbath. One minister in those days would not allow his wife to wash dishes on Sunday. Another whipped his wife for borrowing eggs on that day.

"Such an irksome, restrictive Sabbath Jesus did not advocate. One Sabbath, Christ and his disciples were walking along the path that frequently ran through the fields of growing grain. They were hungry; and, as they often do in that country still, some of them pulled off the tops of the wheat, rubbed it in their hands, and ate the grain. This was against Jewish law. Plucking it was reaping; rubbing it together was threshing. The Jews immediately charged the disciples with breaking the law. Jesus replied that he was Lord of the Sabbath. That it was a day set aside for blessing, not for hampering, men. He gave man, not the Jewish nor the Puritan Sabbath, but a day of freedom, rest and cheer. He wants it kept a holy, but not a gloomy, day. Of all the days of the week he intended the Sabbath to be the brightest, the most cheerful, the most restful, and the most profitable. He bids those who are his to keep the day, not according to the Jewish rigid rule, but according to the rule of love to him. How can I spend the day so that I will please him whom I love?

"What work shall be done on the Sabbath? Jesus went into the synagogue to worship. There was a man present whose arm was all withered up. Now, by the law of the Jews a man must not take a dose of medicine on the Sabbath, nor have a broken bone set. Jesus believed in helping others on any day, so he said to the man, 'Stretch forth thy hand.' The man did so, and in the act found his arm made just as well as the other one. Before this miracle Jesus had asked the Jews if there was one present who would not pull a sheep out of a pit into which it had fallen. Of course they would. How much better then is a man than a sheep? They could say nothing against this. God made the Sabbath for you to enjoy. Do all the good you can and it will become the day of all the week the best."

Christianity recognizes neither the Puritan nor the Jewish Sabbath, but only "the Sabbath of the Lord"—a day of spiritual refreshment. And "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."
