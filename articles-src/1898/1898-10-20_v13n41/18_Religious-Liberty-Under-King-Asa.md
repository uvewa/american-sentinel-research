### Religious Liberty Under King Asa.

"Present Truth" (London, Eng.)

AFTER Asa's accession to the throne of Judah, there was a period of ten years of unbroken peace. The time was spent in clearing out of the kingdom of Judah the idolatrous relics of King Solomon's apostasy. The altars of the strange gods were taken away, and the images of the sun were destroyed out of all the cities of Judah. A royal proclamation was sent throughout the country, commanding the people to seek the Lord and obey his commandments.

There are many nowadays who think that because such proclamations as these are recorded in the Scriptures, it was right to issue them, and that it is still right to enforce matters of religion by the law of the land. But, although Asa was a reformer, he showed by this edict that he did not fully appreciate the character of the worship which God requires of his people. God's law is a law of love. By his loving kindness he draws men to himself, and his commandments are given, not as rigid, autocratic requirements, but as a word of life, promising to all who hear and live the righteousness they set forth.

Christ was the law of God in life and action, for love is the fulfilling of the law, and Christ was perfect love. Whoever would get correct ideas of the law of God will find them in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, who said, "Thy law is within my heart." He came not to condemn but to save. "If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law." Gal. 3:21. But "what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son . . . condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us." Rom. 8:3, 4.

God's Word is strong enough in itself to accomplish the thing whereto he sends it, and if the Word prove weak through the flesh, the flesh does not improve matters by promulgating a supplementary law of its own. The only effect of this is to hide from view the efficiency of the divine Word, and thereby diminish faith in it.
