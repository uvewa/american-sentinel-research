## Sunday-Law Prosecutions Again.

An outbreak of Sunday-law intolerance is reported from Ford's Store, Md. One of those upon whom this intolerance has fallen gives us the following facts:—

> "About the middle of September Mr. John Curlett and myself were arrested for working on Sunday, cutting the tops off of corn. We had our trial before a magistrate. He fined us, but we took an appeal to the higher court, which will be heard on November 7.
>
> "Yesterday, October 9, Mr. John Plevenger was arrested for Sunday work, but he appeared before a magistrate and secured a postponement of his trial until Thursday, the 20th. He was working in the employ of a man not an observer of the seventh day, but the employer was not arrested. He was cutting off corn tops in a secluded field, not near to any house, and those who procured his arrest had to spy upon him to get their information.
>
> "Each of those arrested is a member of the Ford's Store Church of Seventh-day Adventists.
>
> "J. H. Rhodes."

The religious intolerance of such proceedings is too plain to need pointing out to any candid observer. The spirit of it is not the spirit of Christianity; and that such an inquisitorial spirit of spite finds its desired opportunity in the Sunday law, is a fact which speaks volumes in condemnation of the law.
