## Union of Church and State Condemned by History. — No. 1.

*By B. W. Noel, M. A.*

No truth is more prominent in the New Testament than that we are saved by faith in our Redeemer. But faith, according to the doctrine of the same book, is not genuine, unless it leads to an open confession of Christ in the world; and, therefore, Christ required from all his disciples that they should openly confess him by baptism; which, becoming the test of a true faith, was therefore connected with the remission of sins. Thus, as the Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to bear witness to the truth, though it cost him his life, so his disciples must bear witness to it.

Since his doctrine has been preached men can no longer receive the creed of their fathers or of their country without investigation; but each one is bound to search after truth, to receive it, to maintain it, and to promulgate it in the world, in opposition to all error, however venerable and popular. Our Lord predicted that this novel exercise of conscience in matters of religion, this independent inquiry and resolute profession, would disturb society everywhere to its very foundations. "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law: and a man's foes shall be those of his own household. And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake."

The Christian principle of individual inquiry, belief, and profession, was exactly the opposite of the pagan principle of unexamining conformity. The gospel made conscience everything, declaring, "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. . . . Whatsoever is not of faith is sin." Heathenism made it nothing. According to the gospel, everyone was bound to reject the religion of his country if false. According to heathenism, everyone was to conform to the religion of his country in all things. Christianity invited men to form a voluntary society, upon conviction as men; heathenism herded them, by law, as animals, within the inclosure of a national ritual.

The Greek legislators, wishing to secure for the republic the greatest military force by means of the most complete social unity, forbade dissent from the popular superstition. A man who disbelieved the power of fictitious and corrupt deities was thought to be a bad citizen, and was as such condemned. Draco punished dissent with death; Plato would have it denounced to the magistrates as a crime; Aristotle allowed but one established worship; and Socrates was sentenced to death as a non-conformist. In the Greek republics the union between the state and the religion was so complete, that the rights of conscience were wholly disregarded. Men did not inquire what was true, but what was politic. The republic must be a great unity for attack or defense, and the religious independence which would break that unity must be exterminated.

Heathen princes had yet more powerful motives than republican magistrates to unite themselves strictly with the priesthood. Despotic rulers have ever sought to extort from their subjects all possible advantages for themselves, and for this end to retain them in the most complete servitude. They have chiefly depended on their armies; but the fear and the hopes excited by superstition have been too obvious a support not to be largely employed. Well-paid soldiers have been their first instrument of power; their second has been a well-paid priesthood. Priests have lent to despots, in aid of their selfish designs, the portents and the predictions of superstition; and despots have in return invested the superstition with splendor, and punished non-conformity with death.

Heathenism presented no obstacle to this union. The superstition being a corrupt invention, offered nothing which was disagreeable to corrupt rulers; and the vices of rulers were not uncongenial to an equally corrupt priesthood. Nebuchadnezzar exalted himself when he compelled his subjects of every creed to bow down to his golden idol; Belshazzar, amid his revels, felt no objection to "praise the gods of gold and silver;" and it seemed to Darius excellent policy to establish a royal statute that no prayers should be offered to any god but himself for thirty days. The famous Tarquin could, without any inconvenient restraint upon his passions, build temples to Jupiter; Caligula and Nero felt no remorse at their wickedness, excited by the fulfillment of their functions of supreme pontiffs; and, on the other hand, the Brahmins of India found nothing in their Vedas and Purannas which made them blush at the vices and the tyranny of the rajahs by whom they were enriched. By the aid of the superstition the despot fortified his tyranny, and by the aid of the despotism the priest gave currency to his falsehoods. Thus the union of the state and the priesthood was an alliance of force and fraud. Neither party was strong enough to rule alone. But when the priest preached for the despot, and the despot governed for the priest, both the more easily kept their feet upon the necks of the people; and made the universal degradation subservient to their greatness.
