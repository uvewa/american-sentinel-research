## "Ecclesiastical Shop."

The following sensible words on the subject of the ecclesiastical assumptions made by clergymen and others in connection with the military operations of so-called Christian nations, are from Mr. J. S. Nisbet, of London, Eng., to a London journal:—

> "Is the manner in which the name of God is associated with Sir Herbert Kitchener's victory in the Soudan quite seemly? I mean on the part of our ecclesiastical authorities. I am not particularly squeamish, I trust, but I confess to being shocked by a phrase which occurs in a sermon preached on this subject by the Bishop of Carlisle. Said the bishop: 'While they praised the general, they must remember that God was behind in the shadow—they must not forget the controlling hand and the armor of the Lord.' This, if I may venture to say so, is the merest ecclesiastical 'shop.'

> "Everybody knows—no one better than the bishop—that had not Sir Herbert Kitchener adequately provided himself with men and guns, the victory would have been a defeat. Where was the 'controlling hand' when Gordon, a good and pious man, animated with the best intentions, perished miserably at Khartoum? What became of the armor of the Lord on that occasion? The divine government of the universe is a fact before which the proudest head must bow; but this assumed familiarity with the plans of the divine Ruler, the partizanship assigned to him in human affairs, is not in the best of taste, surely. In fact, in my ears it sounds dangerously like profanity. Let us not forget that the poor Dervishes (who did not happen to be adequately equipped) rushed into battle shouting the name of Allah.

"Perhaps the climax of absurdity or profanity in this direction is reached when two Christian nations cross swords, both claiming the support and direction of the Most High in their military operations. The Kaiser, as is well known, has enlisted God on the side of the Fatherland, constantly alluding to the Deity as an august ally of his own; but, needless to say, this did not prevent us, on the occasion of the famous Kruger telegram, from hastily equipping a flying squadron by way of countermove, thereby showing practically what we thought of the young emperor's alleged supernatural alliances.

"The fact is that this sort of appeal by Christian nations to the Lord of Hosts is a survival of the old Pagan notion of a tutelary divinity, i.e., a tribal deity watching over the interests of its tribe. With the Christian ideal, according to which all war is sinful, it is wholly inconsistent, and, as it tends to fortify the scoffer, it had better, I think, be dropped. Military and naval operations have no more claim upon the divine favor than a war of tariffs, or the triumph of party principles at a general election, in favor of which no bishop ever prays."
