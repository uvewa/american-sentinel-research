"Every Young Men's Christian Association secretary I have met for eight months," says the Rev. W. F. Crafts, "agrees that more of his active members are Sabbath breaking on pleasant Sabbath afternoons than are at the Men's Meeting. The church and associations will have to unite to save the Sabbath, if only to save themselves."

***

But if the Sabbath cannot save itself, what power is there in it to save anything else? and how can those who are not saved themselves save something else that needs saving by taking it along with them? That is the trouble with the Sabbath (Sunday) of which Mr. Crafts speaks: a lot of unsaved people have it in charge and are trying to bolster it up by legislation and other worldly props, when they themselves have no foundation beneath their own feet. They cannot furnish a foundation for the Sabbath, when they have no foundation for themselves. As well might two persons in the water who cannot swim, try to save themselves by grappling each other. If the Sunday were divine, it would not need saving. The seventh-day Sabbath is divine, and will prove a sure support to those who lay hold upon it.
