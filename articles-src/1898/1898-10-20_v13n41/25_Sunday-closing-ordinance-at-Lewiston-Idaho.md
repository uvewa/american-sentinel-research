A Sunday-closing ordinance which shuts up all business places except saloons, drug stores, and confectionery shops on Sundays, is in force at Lewiston, Idaho, according to the statement of the Lewiston Tribune. Usually the Sunday laws close the saloons, but leave tobacco shops open, on the ground that the people must be supplied with the necessaries(!) of life. But at this Idaho town it appears that the opening of the saloons is also deemed a necessity. The simple truth is, of course, that the sentiment necessary to enforce the Sunday laws must be largely secured from people who are addicted to tobacco and other forms of selfish indulgence, and who are not willing that the law shall cut these off. The "Lord's day" has to be enforced by the sentiment of people who do not care how other folks are affected so long as their own indulgences are not curtailed.
