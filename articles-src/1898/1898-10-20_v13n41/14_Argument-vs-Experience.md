## Argument vs. Experience.

In *The Defender*, a New England organ which advocates compulsory Sunday observance, appears this defense of the popular disregard of the seventh day:—

> "The consecutive 'seventh day' has not come to us, because the Creator has established the length of our solar year to be 365 days and less than six hours. If this problem is put on a slate, it will be seen at once that the last day of the first year of 365 days will have to be the same day of the week as the first day of that year. Hence the first day of the second creation year will be the second day of the week, *i. e.*, Monday, and that would throw the seventh day forward to Sunday.
>
> "By this jump it will take seven years before a year will begin on the same day of the week as the first creation year. Thus the consecutive 'seventh day' was lost the first creation year, and so for every year since, making it lost 6,000 times—very much lost."

> "Truth is stranger than fiction." We would not have believed it true, without having the fact thrust before our eyes, that any person of average intelligence would seriously argue that there could not be a consecutive series of seventh-day Sabbaths.

As a matter of fact the seventh-day Sabbaths could not possibly occur in any other way than consecutively.

Here is an individual who has all his life been observing one seventh-day Sabbath following another in consecutive order, yet who seriously tries to argue himself and others into the belief that what he has been all this time observing cannot possibly exist in fact! There is only one thing that will explain it, and that is that it is done in support of Sunday and compulsory Sunday observance.

Because there cannot be a consecutive seventh day, all people should turn from the observance of the seventh day to that of the first day! There can be a consecutive first day, as you will soon discover if you do not observe it consecutively, wherever there is a Sunday law in force!

Presumably the author of this argument—Mr. T. M. Merriman, by name—presents it as the best to be had in support of a compulsory Sunday Sabbath. And really, it is as good as any other that we have seen.
