## Studies in French History.—43.

### THE MASSACRE OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW.

"I think," exclaimed Joe Palmeter, indignantly, that I would have held the reins of my own government, if I were king."

"Well, poor Charles was only a weakling—too weak to resist the appeals for the annihilation of the despised Protestants, which came raining in upon him—every appeal seconded and urged by his own mother. At last, desperate and nearly crazed, he signed the fatal document, and cried, 'Kill them all! let not one live to reproach me!' The horrible work was begun at a little past midnight."

"I wonder they didn't get confused and kill each other," said Julia March.

"Undoubtedly they would have, Julia," replied the professor, "had it not been for the white badges they wore—a white scarf and cross."

"The idea!" exclaimed Maggie Palmeter. "White is the emblem of purity."

"But on this terrible night it was the emblem or badge of violence and murder. The dreadful work was not confined to any class—high and low, young and old, the grey-haired man and the innocent babe—all were alike forced to submit to the baptism of blood."

"Didn't King Charles begin to repent when he saw what he had done?" asked Milly Brown.

"No; on the contrary, the sight of the bloody corpses seemed to enrage him, and he brutally shot the poor fugitives who passed the palace window."

"I wonder what became of the King of Navarre?" asked Bert Mathews.

"Well, Bert, he professed Catholicism to save his life. All this was done in the name of religion—in the name of Him who said, 'Put up thy sword into its place.' After he had escaped from danger, he became a Protestant again. Perhaps you would all better write in your books: Massacre of St. Bartholomew, Aug. 24, 1572, when about 25,000 to 30,000 Protestants perished."

"Wasn't England a Protestant country?" asked Joe Palmeter, "and if so, how could she help showing displeasure?"

"England, as well as other countries, was highly displeased. Queen Elizabeth expressed her indignation in no mild terms, and Germany lifted her hands in horror."

"I suppose all this pleased the pope very well," suggested Fred Green.

"He appeared pleased, and even gave thanks in public over the horrible victory, but in private it is said that he wept, as well he might. This was Pope Gregory XIII., and by the way, he is the one who gave us our present method of reckoning time."

"I think that all the kings could not have been displeased with the massacre," said Edna Phillips, for Uncle Jack said this morning when we were speaking about the Spaniards that the Spanish king was real glad over it, and declared it a great victory."

"Your uncle is right, Edna; but Spain was the only country under the sun that did rejoice." Even King Charles was wretched and unhappy afterward, and imagined that he was haunted by bloody apparitions. There was blood often found in the bed where he slept, which of course added to his horror. But as he was subject to weak lungs and hemorrhages, this was probably the reason of it. Finally, King Charles the Ninth, whose name will go down to history as the king who sanctioned the most horrible wholesale murder on record, died at the age of only twenty-four—young in years, but old in crime."

"What a different record he might have made for himself!" said Julia March, "it seems to me that kings have a great chance to do good if they will. I hope his son who came after him had more principle than he."

"He had no son," answered Professor Carman, "and was succeeded by his youngest brother Henry, who at this time was over in Poland, having been made king of that country, but now he hurried home to enjoy the greater distinction of being king of France. The people were anxious to welcome him, but he did not appear in public in France after his brother's death, for a number of months, and when he did, his people were much disappointed in him, because he seemed to care more for the basket of puppies which he carried with him everywhere than he did for his people or their needs."

"What did the people of Poland do when their king left them?" asked Maggie Palmeter.

"O, they hurried around and found some one else, and I do not think their choice could have fallen on a more foolish fellow than King Henry proved to be. He associated with the vilest characters in his kingdom, and then, by way of cancelling his sins, he would take these wicked companions, whom he foolishly called 'darlings,' and repairing to the church, they would thrash each other; this must have been very painful, for they wore sackcloth at the time, which in itself must have been torture."

"I suppose when they had punished themselves enough, they were ready for more wickedness," suggested Joe Palmeter.

"Certainly; and all this folly comes from the mistaken idea that man can atone for his own sins. But we who have God's Word to read, learn that it is only the blood of Jesus Christ which cleanses the soul from sin," said Professor Carman.

"I believe I understand that the Protestant leader, Henry of Navarre, escaped from Paris, did he not, after the dreadful massacre of St. Bartholomew?" asked Max Smith, "did anyone ever hear from him after that?"

"O yes, Max; when he found himself safe from his persecutors, he rallied a large number of Huguenots, and prepared to fight for their principles to the bitter end. But alas, the weapons of their warfare were carnal, and nothing but trouble could result. There was a very powerful party called the League which opposed them bitterly, and were determined they should have no religious rights at all. Yet these same people knew well that if their present king Henry III. died without a son, that this Henry of Navarre would be the rightful monarch. At last the king joined the League against the Huguenots. but Henry of Navarre was a brave soldier and a good commander. He gained a great victory at Contras."

"I wonder if King Henry III. left playing with his puppies in the midst of these troubles," smiled Fred Green.

"O no, and that is about all he did do. But he was insanely jealous of the Duke of Guise, and the influence which he exerted over the people; so, to make a long story short, he sent for the duke, and as he was entering his room, some assassins fell upon him and stabbed him to death. Then the king declared he felt better, for he could be king of his own country without fearing the popularity of Guise."

"I suppose then that the son of the duke took up the quarrel, likely, didn't he?" asked Florence Ray.

"No; but his brothers did, and as the duke had been much beloved by the Catholic element, he was sincerely mourned, and in fact the pope was so stirred up about it that he excommunicated the cruel king. And yet it was the Duke of Guise who assisted in the murder of the innocent old Admiral Coligny. So it seems that his violent dealings came down upon his own pate, in the words of the Psalmist.

"Next week we will learn about the death of Henry III. and something of his successor, Henry of Navarre, who reigned until the year 1610."
