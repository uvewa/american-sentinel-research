The late Ambassador Hay, who is now Secretary of State, is reported as having expressed a determination to settle finally the long-pending issue between this country and Turkey, growing out of the claims for damages suffered by Christian missionaries during the Armenian troubles. The precedent on this point, recently set up in international usage by Germany, when two German missionaries were murdered by the Chinese, would allow the United States to demand a substantial indemnity and also a slice of Turkish territory, or a coaling station at the very least. But whether Turkey is brought to terms by this Government or not, is a question that will not in the least affect the progress of Christianity; unless, indeed, the effect is to prejudice the Mohammedans more bitterly against it.
