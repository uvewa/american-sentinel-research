THE Wesleyan Grove Association, which has charge of the Northport camp-meeting grounds on Penobscot Bay, Maine, at a recent meeting decided to permit no people on the grounds who came on Sunday excursions; so says the Bangor Daily Commercial. Of course the association has a right to do this; but it is strange Christian doctrine which shuts sinners out at any time from the camp of Christ. And the sinners who are thus shut out will not have much confidence in the religious pretensions that are made within.
