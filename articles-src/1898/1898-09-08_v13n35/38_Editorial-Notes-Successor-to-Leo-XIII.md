There is much talk over the prospective successor of Leo XIII., and among the names that are mentioned is that of Archbishop Ireland, of this country. American friends and adherents of the Catholic Church are pointing out that it is time a pope should be chosen from the Western world, and that the transfer of millions of Spanish Catholics to the control of the American Government makes the present time especially fitting. Whether such an argument will weigh with the college of cardinals or not remains to be seen. Judging from what the Catholic mind has been on the subject for centuries past, it would seem that only an Italian is endowed with the mental and spiritual powers necessary to properly qualify one to be the "vicar of Christ."
