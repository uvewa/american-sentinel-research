### BY C. H. KESLAKE.

JESUS CHRIST is "the truth;" the gospel of Christ is the truth; the law of God "is the truth;" and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth. Each is the sum of all truth. There is not more truth in one than there is in any one of the others, or all of the others combined.

Truth being always consistent and harmonious with itself there can possibly be no conflict between Christ, the gospel, the law and the Holy Spirit.

As therefore the law is "the truth," and that law says the seventh day is the Sabbath, it is absolutely impossible that either Christ, the gospel, or the Holy Spirit can teach that any other day is the Sabbath.

Of course this has been set forth in previous articles, and in various ways emphasized. But it will do us no harm to have it repeated again; especially as by the invincible force of logic, the last great battle for truth is to center around this question of the Sabbath.

Religious factions, which have been bitterly opposed to each other in the past over what is now regarded as minor points of doctrines, will be willing to bury their differences in a general rally around the Sabbath, which here must be understood to refer to Sunday. In other words it will make no difference what is taught, provided only they are orthodox upon this one question.

In their eagerness to maintain the cause of Sunday the Protestants have shown themselves to be perfectly willing to join hands with the Roman Catholic Church, notwithstanding the bitter hatred in which she has been held by them in the past.

From Luther's time down to within a recent period Protestants have regarded the papacy as antichrist. But now a different spirit is being cherished toward her.

Instead of being the "woman arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold, and precious stones and pearls [and], having a golden cup in her hand" full of all kinds of abominations (Rev. 17:4) and "sitting upon a scarlet colored beast" (verse 4) she is now spoken of by Protestants as "our beautiful mother," thereby confessing themselves to be her daughters. And claiming to be Christian churches themselves, and being the daughters of this "beautiful mother," thus being of one blood, it could not be otherwise than that she be recognized by them as a Christian church. Hence they can bless now what they once cursed; as a Methodist minister in Ohio once said, "God bless the Roman Catholic Church of to-day."

But as surely as Protestant churches, or individuals in these churches, shall so speak of the Catholic Church, so certainly do they, in that thing renounce the principles of Protestantism, notwithstanding they may still bear the name of Protestants. And what does a name amount to anyway if the principles represented by that name are renounced?

It is idle for one to contend that the papacy is different now from what it was three hundred years ago. Surely Cardinal Gibbons, the highest prelate of the Catholic Church in this country is entitled to speak upon this point.

In exhorting Protestants to return to the fold of the Roman Catholic Church he says, "In coming to the church you are not entering a strange place, but you are returning to your Father's home. The house and furniture may look odd to you. But it is just the same as your forefathers left it three hundred years ago."—"Faith of Our Fathers." Introduction, page 17.

Yes, indeed! the Catholic church is exactly the same as it was three hundred years ago; and the claim that she makes, preposterous though it be, of infallibility; that the church in faith and morals never erred, nor ever can err, utterly precludes the possibility of the Catholic Church being any different now from what it has always been.

Notwithstanding all this at this time when this Sabbath question, regarded by all who are intelligent upon the question, as being the test of all religion, so that it is claimed, and justly too, that "he who does not keep the Sabbath does not worship God, and he who does not worship God is lost," the logic therefore being that he who does not keep the Sabbath is lost—at this time it is perfectly natural that Protestants should be willing to join hands with the papacy regarding the Sunday.

And why not? Is not Sunday the child of the papacy? As a professedly Christian institution does not Sunday find its origin in the Catholic Church? Does not the Catholic Church set forth Sunday as the sign or mark of her power to do all that she claims to be able to do? Let any one read any of the Catholic Catechisms, and see for themselves.

The advocates of Sunday observance for a long time have been hard pressed for divine proof that Sunday is the Sabbath. But they must have it. It is essential for the support of their tottering institution.

True there are many people who would be satisfied to keep the day on the strength of its being enjoined by the State; but there are thousands who would insist upon having stronger proof.

In vain will the Scriptures be appealed to. The only day that can be found enjoined there as the Sabbath is the seventh day. And Sunday advocates long since found that out, and have, in spite of themselves, been compelled to acknowledge the complete silence of Scripture with reference to Sunday as the Sabbath.

But the difficulty would be surmounted when the Catholic Church shall be acknowledged as a divine institution and clothed with authority from Jesus Christ, and guided by the Holy Spirit, to make the change.

Will Protestants do this? They will as surely as they continue to seek to have Sunday enforced.

Already concessions have been made by Protestants. Here is a statement by Rev. Sylvester Scovell—a National Reformer, and an ardent Sunday law advocate, in 1881, "This common interest [of all religious people in the Sabbath—Sunday] ought both to strengthen our determination to work and our readiness to cooperate in every way with our Roman Catholic fellow citizens. We may be subjected to many rebuffs in our first proffers, and the time has not yet come when the Roman Church will consent to strike hands with other churches—as such; but the time has come to make repeated advances, and gladly to accept cooperation in any form in which they may be willing to exhibit it. It is one of the necessities of the situation."

Yes, and for the complete success of their work it will be found to be one of the necessities of the situation to acknowledge the divine authority of the Catholic Church.

For this the Catholic Church has long waited, and soon will come her triumph.
