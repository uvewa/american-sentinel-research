The political world in both hemispheres has been profoundly stirred by the surprising manifesto from the czar advocating national disarmament with a view to establishing conditions of universal peace. The true significance of this remarkable proposition is a question upon which political authorities are divided. Come believe the czar has spoken in sincerity, and others see in it only a political stroke to help along Russian schemes in Asia. We think the czar spoke from a sincere desire for peace; but is peace by national disarmament practicable? Many who have commented on the czar's proposal deny that it is, and there is no lack of argument to support their view.

Disarmament does not get to the bottom of the difficulty. No nation keeps an armament for the mere sake of having soldiers and a fleet. The nations are covetuous; they want all the territory they can get, and will take each other's territory if they can. That is the real trouble. The real question is, whether Russia is willing to stop extending her empire in China, France willing to give up Alsace-Lorraine, and England, France, Germany, and other powers willing to stop their encroachments in Asia and Africa. Are they willing to practice the Golden Rule toward each other? If not, then the conditions will remain by which the armaments of the powers were created, and effective disarmament will remain an impracticable project.

Real and lasting peace in this world comes only from a change of heart. "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."

But one point of significance must not be overlooked. From such a document strong support will be drawn for the idea which many advocate, that we are nearing a millennium of peace. It goes far to suggest the cry of "peace and safety." But "when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them." We are witnessing the thrilling events of the last days.
