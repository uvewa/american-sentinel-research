There is a lesson in this which may well be heeded by the American people; and that is that a government, whatever its form, and whatever its constitution, cannot be any better than the persons by whom it is administered. If people in this country become corrupt, selfish, regardless of the rights of others, the fact that this is a "free government," republican in form and with a grand Constitution, will not save the people from the evil consequences. The rights of people will be denied here as grossly and arbitrarily as under an absolute monarchy.
