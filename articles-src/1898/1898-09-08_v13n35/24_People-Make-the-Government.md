THE government does not make the people, but the people make the government. Where each person desires to respect the rights of his neighbor—to apply the principle of the Golden Rule—bad government would be impossible, whether it were called a republic or a monarchy. And when men are corrupt and selfish, seeking always to advance their own interests whether at the expense of their fellows or not, good government is impossible, though it may have all the forms of free government, and the strongest constitutional guaranties of individual rights.
