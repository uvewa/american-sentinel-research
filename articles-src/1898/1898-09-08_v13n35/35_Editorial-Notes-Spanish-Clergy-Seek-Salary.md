It is reported, says the Kansas City Star, that Archbishop Crespo of Santiago and the other Catholic clergy of the city, presented their bills for salary to the American military governor, and that he has forwarded them to Washington to get the opinion of the Government as regards the advisability of their payment. That is carrying an absurd matter a long way. An American military governor ought to be sufficiently acquainted with fundamental American principles, and sufficiently in harmony with them, to have dealt with the question effectually at first sight. The Star appropriately remarks that the decision to be given at Washington "involves the character of the government established at Santiago, whether it is an American government, or whether we are continuing to the best of our ability the old Spanish government."
