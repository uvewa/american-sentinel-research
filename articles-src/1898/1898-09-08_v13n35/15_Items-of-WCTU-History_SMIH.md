BY MRS. S. M. I. HENRY.

The process by which a legal department became incorporated into the plan of W. C. T. U. work will be readily apprehended from what has already appeared in these items. But this department deserves more than a passing notice.

From the very beginning of our acquaintance with the saloon we were compelled to recognize it as a creature of the law, a product of corrupt appetites, which met together, with only the bar of the saloon between them, the lust of gold and power on one side, and of sensual indulgence on the other.

At every turn we were confronted with the apparition of greed, serving sensualism and doing so under the protection of and for the advantage of the same law-making power to which the weak and the illtreated must look for protection against oppression. The saloon for revenue was the monstrosity of American legislation.

Furthermore, we could but see that this law was in itself but a criminal product of some power that had openly defied the law of God. We believed in the eternal integrity of that law, and that no body of men could in anywise legally legislate that, which would either teach or enforce anything contrary to it. We read in the Bible that the law was a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; and believed that, in a peculiar sense, the law of the land should be that schoolmaster; or, if not quite that, that it should never be an incorrigible truant authorized to run at large, and beguile and capture the weak and unwary, and prevent them from finding the great Teacher from whom they must learn all truth.

We boldly charged the law which licensed the saloon as a criminal, judged and condemned by the pure law of the Golden Rule, and treated it accordingly. We, however, from the knowledge which we then had, were compelled to believe that those who had brought forth this criminal were yet innocent of actual moral transgression, for certainly they were good men! They must, we thought, be ignorant of the standard by which all legislation must be measured. "My people perish for lack of knowledge," said the Lord, and we concluded that for the same reason the Lord's people often produced conditions which were as destructive as Satan could wish, in which their fellow-creatures became so entangled that there was no way of escape.

Then there came upon us a sense of obligation. Woman had through all the generations been shut in with the Bible by a peculiar environment which had contributed to make her more or less a student of the Word, or at least to cause her to be a willing listener to those who taught its precepts; and the teaching had been of a nature to make her come to detect this legal traitor which stood on the statute books of the nation in direct antagonism to the divine law. And the world had now to take the consequences both of having left woman so long shut in with this Word of truth, and of afterward thrusting her so suddenly out into the wide open places where the Civil War left her stranded.

The light that had filled the home with the sweet and hallowed radiance of the gospel, and which the most worldly man loved to remember, and which he coveted for his son, suddenly, brought forth in three hundred thousand womanly hands, even if the tapers were small, burst upon the questions of the day with startling power, and every eye was offended at the hideousness which was revealed. The saloon keeper said, "It is a mean business that I am engaged in, and I would get out of it quick if all I had was not locked up in it." The lawyer who defended the saloonist, of course did not hesitate to say that he despised his client, but he was in court for a living, and must do the best he could to serve the man who paid him the best.

Then we realized how the power of the Holy Spirit must be brought to bear upon all these men who were "under the law" before they could be delivered from this bondage of "time serving."

I do not believe that any one class of worldly men ever have been more earnestly prayed for and labored with than the politicians of this nation. They certainly have had the gospel message taken to them through one legal department as patiently and persistently as it has ever been carried by any missionary in any portion of the field of the world. Men who had never been in the habit of church-going, who had no use for temperance, were compelled to sit and listen while some earnest, motherly woman, whom they could but reverence, whom they could but choose to hear, poured out of a burning heart the most sublime truths of the gospel, as she made some appeal for purity of life and law in the name of, and for the sake of, the home, the growing boy and his mother. As they have many times confessed since those days, men's hearts failed them before these appeals, and it was not a strange sight to see them bow their heads and drop tears upon their beards.

We had yet, however, much to learn about political trickery, ambition, and strife. We had yet to learn that the ability to weep like a father, and to vote like a politician—things as far removed from each other as the east from the west—were often found in the bosom of the same man.

It will be seen from these statements that the legal work of the W. C. T. U. has always been quite as much evangelistic as anything else. The mission of the department was that of a teacher of righteousness to those who had the responsibility of government in our nation. The "legal women" were personally gospel workers to a remarkable degree. The difference between them and their sister evangelists being more in the class of people to whom they went than in the truth which they taught, with perhaps this exception,—that they made a special point of the most practical applications of the gospel that it was possible to make to ordinary affairs. Equality between man and man, fair dealing, purity in living and in legislation, were the special points upon which they hinged gospel truth.
