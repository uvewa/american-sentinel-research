BY MRS. FLORENCE A. BARNES, M. D.

We, he living in Spanish American countries of South America, my attention was drawn to the condition of the Indian and mixed population of the country.

I found in cities of many thousands, that only a few were able to gain a livelihood by other means than by manual labor. That the services of the Indian were held almost as a right, by many, and that consequently, their wages were little more than would suffice to keep body and soul together.

In the outskirts of the best of the cities, many live with only a thatched roof to keep off the rain, having neither siding to their houses, nor a rag of clothing to cover the nakedness of all the younger members of the family.

In the interior, the women carry burdens over the mountains for a rehla day (3 cents) and on the coffee plantations men and women labor for about the same rate.

I noticed also, that although the Catholic Church has existed there for the four hundred years that the Spanish have inhabited the country, only a few had been taught the first rudiments of an education, by which they could have hoped to better their condition.

The native woman will give herself body and soul to the white man who seeks her, and having been taught no better, is proud of her shame. Vice and shame go hand in hand with the church, openly and unrebuked.

The poor die without help. They may lie sick, without medical assistance, for months, and finally die, no one outside the family the wiser, until the priest is called to bury them in the "holy ground."

Looking for a cause, it was not hard to trace backward to the time when the South American Indian was held as a slave by the Spanish invaders, and remembering the mode of warfare adopted by Spain in conquering unbelievers nearer home, I soon found that in the history of the Catholic Church in Spain, cruelty took the place of mercy, and that to convert, with them, meant to conquer and enslave.

In proof of this, before looking at the work of the church in South America, let me go back to Spanish warfare nearer home. For under Ferdinand and Isabella, the same cruelties were practiced, in the name of religion, as were practiced under Charles the Fifth a few years later in South America.

**METHODS OF CHRISTIAN(?) WARFARE BETWEEN 1482 AND 1492.**

From history we learn that in 1482, all of Spain was under the control of the church with one exception. The territory of Grenada was still under the dominion of the Moors. It was well situated for protection, being washed on one side by the Mediterranean Sea, and traversed by chains of lofty mountains, naked, rocky and precipitous, rendering it almost impregnable, but locking in deep rich valleys of great fertility.

Alhama was one of the Moorish towns near to the capital of Grenada, and has been called the key to the capital. The marquis of Cadiz conceived the idea of taking this town. Having sent out a spy, who on returning assured him of the practicability of taking it by surprise, the marquis called together several commanders with their troops, and set out promptly, with three thousand light cavalry, and four thousand infantry. None but the leaders knew the object of the enterprise. The march was accomplished by night, while they remained hidden in secluded places during the day. They chose routes rarely traveled. No one was allowed to speak. No fires were built, lest the smoke should betray them. On reaching a small deep valley only half a league from Alhama, they made a halt. Not till then was the object of the expedition made known to the army. After explaining their purposes, the leaders now endeavored to rouse them to brave action by telling them it was for the glory of the most holy faith, and for vengeance; and "that there was great spoil in the town."

They then pressed on, arriving close to the place two hours before daybreak. There the army remained in ambush while three hundred men were sent to scale the walls and get possession of the castle. Silently they climbed the height and reached the shadow of its tower, undiscovered. Not a light or sound was in the village. The whole place was in deep repose. Fixing their ladders, they mounted the battlements. Moving stealthily along the parapet, toward the citadel, they came upon the sentinel by surprise. Seizing him by the throat he was ordered to point the way to the guard room. The man obeyed, and was instantly dispatched. There a scene of massacre, rather than of combat, occurred.

Some were killed while sleeping, others were cut down before they could resist; all were killed.

But the alarm had spread. The garrison awoke to find the enemy master of the towers. Meanwhile the army in ambush, knowing by the uproar that the fray had begun, now rushed from their place of concealment, with sound of kettledrums and trumpets, to increase the confusion. A violent conflict ensued. At length the postern was thrown open, and the Marquis of Cadiz, with his hosts, took possession of the castle. But the town below was in arms. The inhabitants were chiefly merchants and trades-people, but possessed some knowledge of arms. They fought well and long. But the marquis, seeing that the city gate was in command of the city's artillery, ordered a breach to be made in the wall, rousing their courage by telling them that the place should be given up to plunder and its people made captives. Though the Moors fought valiantly, in the streets, from the windows, and from the tops of the houses, they were not equal to the *Christians* (?) in strength, being for the most part peaceable men of industrious callings.

They fought at their thresholds and their hearths, with the shrieks of their wives and children ringing in their ears. They paid no attention to their wounds nor the death of their companions, but continued fighting until they fell. When they could no longer fight, they would block the thresholds of their once happy homes with their mangled bodies.

They fought for their homes, their wives, and their helpless children, while the so-called Christians fought for glory, for revenge, for the "faith," and for the spoil of the wealthy people.

From morning till night the contest raged, when the Moors began to yield. They retreated to a mosque, but the Christians set fire to it. When the smoke and flames rolled in they gave themselves up for lost. Many made a last desperate rush on the enemy, but were slain; the rest surrendered. Male and female became slaves to their captors. The town was given up to plunder. Gold, silver, jewels, silks, and costly stuffs, of all kinds, together with horses, beeves, grain, oil, honey, and all the fruits of a rich country, was appropriated by the Christians. What they could not carry off was wantonly destroyed. A Spaniard who had helped the Moors was hanged on the highest part of the battlements. And all this was done under the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, in the name of the "Christian religion"!

Not satisfied with victories of war, Ferdinand availed himself of the times when Grenada was troubled by internal factions, making inroads into the very heart of the kingdom, sacking and destroying towns and castles. The poor peasantry were never safe from the attacks of these pious (?) warriors, not even in their watch towers and fortified hamlets. They were stormed with fire and sword.

In speaking of those conquests one of the pious (?) fathers of the church said: "It was a pleasing and refreshing sight to behold this pious knight and his followers returning from one of his crusades, leaving the rich land of the unbeliever in smoking desolation behind them; to behold the long line of mules and asses, laden with the plunder of the gentiles, the hosts of captives,—men, women, and children,—droves of sturdy beeves, lowing kine, and bleating sheep, all winding up the steep acclivity to the gates of Alhama, pricked on by the Catholic soldiery."

A large portion of the spoil was always dedicated to the church, and the good friars were ever ready at the gates to hail and receive their allotted share.

Speaking of the city of Ronda, which was taken by them in a horrible warfare, in which they threw balls of tow, steeped in pitch and oil and gunpowder, which, once on fire, could not be extinguished, and which set the houses in flames, this "father" says: "Thus was this nest of warfare and infidelity converted to the true faith, by the thunder of our artillery."

To convert by force or superior might, to the "Christian faith" as then represented in the Catholic Church, was the way approved by the church.

After the taking of Malaga, the great mass of its people implored that they might not be scattered, or sold into captivity, but might be permitted to ransom themselves by paying a certain amount within a given time. King Ferdinand took the advice of his counsellors, who said: "If you hold out a prospect of hopeless captivity, the infidels will throw all their gold and jewels into wells and pits, and you will lose the greater part of the spoil; but if you fix a general rate of ransom, and receive the money and jewels as part payment, nothing will be destroyed."

So it was arranged that all should be ransomed, at the average rate of thirty doblas in gold, for each, male or female, large or small. That all their gold, jewels, and other valuables should be given immediately, in part payment of the whole amount, and the remainder be paid within eight months; that if any died in the meanwhile the ransom should be paid just the same, and if the whole amount were not paid in eight months, they should all be held as slaves.

The poor unfortunate people caught at this straw. They were numbered by houses and families, and their names taken down. Their most precious possessions were made into parcels and sealed with their names. Then they were driven like cattle to large corrals or enclosures, and there confined until they could be distributed among the Spaniards. They were scattered far and wide, each family taking one or two to keep as servants, until the term fixed for the payment of the remainder of the ransom expired. A few were allowed to beg for aid, to purchase their liberty, amongst the adjoining Moorish towns. But these places were too much impoverished by the late wars, and engrossed with their own distresses, to lend a listening ear or helping hand.

So the time passed with the ransom unpaid, and fifteen thousand people became slaves to the cruel conquerors. "Never," says the "father" of the church, "never has there been recorded a more adroit and sagacious arrangement, than this made by the Catholic monarch, by which he not only secured all the property and half the ransom of the infidels, but finally got possession of their persons in the bargain."

Catholic holiness is this! Of course such a continued warfare was not without losses to the Spaniards. Thus after the siege of Baza, which lasted six months and twenty days, their loss amounted to twenty thousand men, of whom seventeen thousand died of disease, and not a few of cold. "A kind of death peculiarly uncomfortable," says the historian; but the pious "father" adds: "As these latter were chiefly of ignoble rank, baggage carriers, and such like, the loss was not of great importance."

This was the mode of warfare then, which immediately preceded the invasion of South America by the Spanish; and the cruelties practiced far from home, were in keeping with those in common usage under Ferdinand and Isabella, and Charles the Fifth.
