"RENDER TO CÆSAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CÆSAR'S, AND TO GOD THE THINGS THAT ARE GOD'S."—Jesus Christ Announcing the Principle of Separation of Church and State.

THE Pharisees, thinking to entangle Christ in his talk, came to him and asked whether it were lawful to give tribute to Cæsar. "But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he said unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him, Cæsar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Matt. 22:15-22.
