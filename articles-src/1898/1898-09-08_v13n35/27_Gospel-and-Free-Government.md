IT WAS the power of the gospel in the great Reformation that made possible the free Government which was set up in America, a beacon light to the world, at the beginning of the nineteenth century. But there can be no perfect government while there remains any opposition to gospel principles in those who participate in it. Perfect government is the government of the kingdom of God.
