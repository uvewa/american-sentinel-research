SPAIN sent her soldiers to Cuba and kept them there for years, and at the end they were in condition to make a good fight against the troops of the United States; but the latter return from Cuba after a campaign of only a few weeks almost completely shattered by disease and privation. There is something about this that calls for explanation.
