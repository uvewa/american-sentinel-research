TO HAVE better government, we must have better people. What then will make the people better? Can it be done by law, or by vote? What is needed is that which will feed the nobler impulses and cultivate the spirit of the Golden Rule, and this can be supplied only from a source that is superior to man himself. That source is the grace of God. The gospel alone supplies the conditions under which bad government will be impossible.
