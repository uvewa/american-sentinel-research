"RECEIVE ye the Holy Ghost." In these words, addressed to sinful flesh, God appeals to his people on the earth, to his church, to be filled with unlimited power; for such is the power of the Spirit.

But while God is thus beseeching men, the very ones who profess to be his followers here are beseeching the legislatures of earth for the power needed to advance the cause of righteousness.

Was there ever a stranger or sadder spectacle before heaven and earth—God beseeching the church to receive unlimited power from on high, which he is ready to bestow, and the church, all unmindful of his words, be seeching the world for the power that belongs to earthly things!

The church could not be guilty of greater folly.
