REPUBLICAN government—"government of the people, by the people, and for the people"—is right. The Constitution of the American Republic, the Declaration of Independence, are right. But all these are but the forms, the proper instruments, of good government. The good government itself depends upon the character of the people. It must come from the people themselves. And if the people are corrupt, if they put corrupt men in office, these instruments become of no avail, and might as well be exchanged for the proper forms of despotism.
