The Dreyfus case has again forced its way to the surface of French affairs. The head of the army intelligence bureau has confessed to the forgery of a letter which was of great weight in securing the conviction of Captain Dreyfus, and while under arrest committed suicide, some say by the orders or at least with the connivance of other high officials. The French people are said to be in a terrible state of excitement over this revelation of dishonor in the highest circles of the army.

The army was the last place where they believed dishonor could exist, and now that it has been found there, and amongst the highest officials, a feeling of dismay is mingled with their surprise and indignation.

It seems to be one result of militarism that the army comes to be in the eyes of the people the one high repository of personal honor. What an individual says "on his honor as a soldier" is considered as safeguarded by every possible guarantee of truthfulness. It is the end of all controversy, the limit of all appeal to personal integrity.

But what should there be about the business of learning to kill people that is calculated to develop high personal qualities? To us, there appears nothing very strange in this forgery by a high army official directed against a fellow-officer. It is not strange from the standpoint of Christianity. For the same law which says, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," says also, "Thou shalt not kill;" and he who does the one need not depart out of the pathway he is in to do the other. It is the same pathway of disobedience to the moral law.

The incident strips away the disguise from the false idea of honor which men have set up apart from the precepts of God. The only honor that can be depended on is that that aims always at fulfilling the law of righteousness.
