It is plain enough that this state of affairs is due in the main to selfishness and red tape. The question of blame is one to be settled by the national authorities, though it may be observed in passing that the responsibility naturally rests with those who have direct oversight of affairs where the evils exist. These should if necessary cut red tape in order to provide a prompt and efficient remedy. It is plain also that the blame cannot be all laid upon one or two individuals. No one or two individuals should have it in their power in this country to inflict suffering and death upon innocent persons.
