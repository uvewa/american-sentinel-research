THAT individual rights are denied here in almost numberless instances through official selfishness and red tape—two things which go well together—is a fact. No one can doubt it who takes account of the incidents that are noted in the news columns of the daily press. And in that which the soldiers have experienced there has only been manifested on a large scale the selfishness and red tape which inflict unmerited suffering upon the private individual. In the latter case little or nothing is thought about it because it involves only one individual, or but few individuals at the most. But it is a symptom nevertheless,—an indication of serious disease in the body politic; and a people intent upon the preservation of their rights would do well to heed it.
