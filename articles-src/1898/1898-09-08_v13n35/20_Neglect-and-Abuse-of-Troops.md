The American people have manifested much surprise and indignation over the revelations that have been made of the neglect and abuse of the troops. There is no doubt just cause for the feeling which has been aroused. While hardships and privations were naturally to be expected in the prosecution of the campaign, only base principles of conduct can account for the fact that delicacies sent to the troops were not distributed among them, and that sick and wounded soldiers were transported long distances without any adequate provision for their comfort during the journey. The provision made for the care of the Spanish prisoners in this country seems actually to have been better than that made for the care of those who were fighting for the nation and not against it.
