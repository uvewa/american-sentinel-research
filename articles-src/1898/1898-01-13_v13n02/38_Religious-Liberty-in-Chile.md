In July, 1897, the Roman Catholic bishop of Iquique, Chile, published and caused to be posted on the doors of the Catholic church in that city, a circular, of which, says the *Converted Catholic*, the following is a translation:

> "TO CATHOLICS:
>
> "Those married persons whose marriages have not been performed by the church, until this is done:
>
> "1st—Cannot receive the sacraments;
>
> "2nd—Nor be god-parents;
>
> "3rd—Nor be witnesses in marriage ceremonies;
>
> "4th—Nor be inscribed as members in the religious societies, nor receive the scapulars;
>
> "5th—Nor have charge of any duty in the church;
>
> "6th—Nor can funeral honors be celebrated for them;
>
> "7th—Their names shall be erased from every society and religious association;
>
> "8th—In the baptismal records, their children shall be counted illegitimate;
>
> "9th—They are public sinners;
>
> "10th—Their names shall be recorded in an especial book for the preceding end."

And this same church poses in America as the champion of civil and religious liberty; and what is stranger still, a great many Protestants seem actually to believe that it is the truth.
