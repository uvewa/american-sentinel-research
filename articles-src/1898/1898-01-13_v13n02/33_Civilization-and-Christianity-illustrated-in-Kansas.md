The difference between civilization and Christianity, which seems not to be very clear in many minds, has been illustrated in a melancholy way out in Kansas, by the recent action of four Pawnee chiefs, or as perhaps it might be better to say, by the actions of their wives. Just what the conduct of the latter was in every case, we are not informed; but it was such as to bring their husbands into the United States Court with a petition for divorce. What an unwonted incident is this to be chronicled in the history of the red man!

One of the strongest cases, we are told, was that made out by Pipe Chief, who averred that his conjugal partner wanted to spend all his money on fine dresses, and refused to associate with squaws who were not in her set. The untutored mind of the chief probably did not understand the high precedent which Mrs. Pipe Chief had for her conduct in this respect. He did not comprehend the fact that in this she was only imitating the conduct of ladies in the highest circles of civilized society. Perhaps it would have made no difference to him if he had. At any rate, the fact remains that from his point of view, such conduct was more intolerable than anything which belonged to the ways and customs of savagery. And who can say that his point of view may not be nearer the truth than the highly artificial standpoint from which is derived the unwritten social law of the "best society"?

It may not be that "society" would be willing to admit it, but it is a fact susceptible of proof that this most "sacred" and carefully followed part of the code of "high society," stands or falls with the case of Mrs. Pipe Chief, of the Kansas plains. For if it be right for the ladies who move in the circles of civilized society to spend money regardlessly for fine dresses and refuse to associate with people not in their set, as everybody knows that they do, who can take exception to a similar course on the part of those with whom their own civilization comes in contact? Is not a good example worthy of imitation? If it be proper to have a social "four hundred" in New York City, why is it not proper to have a social four hundred, or forty, as the case may be, in Pawnee society on the Western plains? It really seems as though civilized "society" were bound to come to the rescue of Mrs. Pipe Chief, and vindicate the propriety of her conduct in this matter.

The divorce court, it is almost needless to remark, is a necessary adjunct of civilization. The nearer we approach the dividing line between civilization and savagery, the less do we see of this institution. In making use of it for the purpose of annulling the matrimonial relation, the Pawnee chiefs have taken a step which distinctly savors of transition from the ways of barbarism to those of civilization; and in developing a passion for fine dresses, and "cutting" squaws not in her set, Mrs. Pipe Chief shows a still further advance toward civilization's "higher" ideals. But what have fine dresses, social "sets," and divorce courts to do with Christianity?

Contact with civilization in many instances marks the red man's decadence. But contact with Christianity can never be otherwise than elevating and ennobling.
