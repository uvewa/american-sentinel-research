For instance, the pastor of a church in Oakland, Cal., is quoted as having addressed the following to the managers of the race tracks at the neighboring town of Emeryville: "I request you to consider and inform me of your opinion as to the possibility of having a Christian day at the races. This, of course, would preclude drinking and gambling." It would seem that this pastor is bent on supplying the floating phrase, "pious horse race," with a definite basis of fact.

It may be that this California pastor has been wrongly quoted; but the words are so well in accord with the religious spirit of the times that there is little reason to doubt the correctness of the report. There is a "pious" way of conducting fairs, lotteries, "donkey" sociables, etc., in the basements of the churches, and why, on the same principle, should there not be a pious way of conducting a horse race? There are worse things than horse racing, which it is commonly believed can be done in a Christian way; for instance, the taking of human life in the heat of battle. Certainly it is worse to kill a man convicted of no crime than it is to race horses. And if Christian people can do the one, and remain Christians while they are doing it, there can be no reason why they cannot, as Christians, engage in the other.

The only thing really surprising about the pastor's request is that he should think it necessary to exclude drinking and gambling. No one questions, of course, that drinking and gambling are wrong, as ordinarily indulged in. But if they are done not in a worldly manner, but in a pious, religious way, can any one object to them then? Why have a "Christian day" at the race track, and not also a "Christian day" at the bar and gaming table? In the fairs and lotteries which are now so frequently held inside church doors, we have an illustration of how gambling can be done in a "Christian" way; and if a bar were set up inside the church edifice, where everything would be very respectable, and people of good church standing might come and drink in a quiet and moderate way, would this not also be compatible with Christianity? If a thing can be made very respectable, is there anything to hinder its becoming pious?

In all ages of the world, men have sought to shield the workings of their carnal propensities behind the idea that such acts were all right and even laudable when done in the name and under the cloak of religion. It was considered proper to hate people, and even to kill them, if it be done from a "pious" motive. If a person had committed an offense against religion, he was given a religious trial, conducted by prelates of the church, and then, if convicted, it was deemed quite proper even to burn him at the stake, care being taken to keep up the religious appearance to the last by holding a crucifix before the condemned and filling his ears with religious exhortations. It was even thought quite proper to execute "heretics" without the formality of a trial, when the church or the pope approved such work as being a "pious" undertaking. And since it is true that men have often found a way to "sanctify" the passion of hatred, even as manifested in the taking of human life, it is only natural that they should find ways to "sanctify" other carnal passions whose outworkings are less serious in their results.

But the truth which is invoked by every manifestation of this baneful delusion, is that such passions of the natural heart as prompt men to indulge in horse racing and gambling, or any other form of worldliness, are never so dangerous, never so wicked, never so detestable, as when clothed with the forms of piety.
