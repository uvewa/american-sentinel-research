BY C. H. KESLAKE.

The Constitution of the United States is in perfect accord with the Protestant idea of church and state contended for in the Reformation. One reason why such separation was provided for was because it was then recognized that it was "impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects that profess the Christian faith without erecting a claim to infallibility which would lead us back to the church of Rome."

With but few exceptions, the people comprising this nation are either Catholics or Protestants—the large majority being Protestants.

Every well-instructed Catholic knows how and when Protestantism originated. He knows that in the sixteenth century there were those, who, loyal to the Word of God, in the strength and power of Jesus Christ, dared to stand up and protest against the Romish doctrine of the union of church and state.

But it is a question as to how many of those who call themselves Protestants know how and when Protestantism originated. For certain it is that at this present time there are millions of professed Protestants who are stultifying themselves and denying the principle from which they derive their name.

That they are not conscious of this is evident, for there are many already who have come to a true understanding of the work in which they were engaged, and have renounced it.

Now, if a person does not know what Protestantism really is, how can he possibly know what Romanism is?

That being so, when such a thing happens, and it has happened, that Roman Catholics and Protestants work together for the same object, one may depend upon it that the Romanist will decidedly have the best of it, for he is not working in the dark. He knows exactly what his principles are, and he knows, too, that Romanism and true Protestantism cannot possibly agree any more than it is possible for light and darkness to mingle together. The one is the inveterate foe of the other.

Consequently, when a professed Protestant unites thus with the Catholic, the latter knows full well that the former has ceased, in reality, to be a Protestant, if indeed he ever was one-more than in name.

When it is remembered, as stated above, that the one reason why the union of church and state is forbidden in the Constitution, is because it is impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects that profess the Christian faith without erecting a claim to infallibility which would lead us back to the Church of Rome; and when it is remembered, too, that Protestantism is a protest against the Catholic principle of union of church and state, the question may well be asked, Can a person be a Protestant and indorse any effort that might be made to have the Constitution changed with reference to this matter of church and state? Decidedly not. He may be a Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, or anything else, but he would not be a Protestant.

Now there are in this country millions of Protestants (so-called) who are laboring hard to have the Constitution changed, and to have the Christian religion incorporated into the fundamental law of the land.

Year after year, Congress has been besieged and petitioned to legislate in behalf of religion, notwithstanding that Congress is expressly forbidden, by the Constitution, to have anything to do with religion—for or against. For in the very nature of things it could not legislate in favor of one religion without legislating against some other.

Will those Protestants who are thus engaged in this work stop and consider what they are doing before they get so far along that they cannot retrace their steps? Will they take the Word of God and ponder its pages upon this particular question? for God has spoken plainly regarding it, and pointed out the inevitable result of such a movement as that they have undertaken.
