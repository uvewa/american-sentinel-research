"The National Christian Citizenship League," we are officially told, "aims to do two things. One is to unite all who believe the will of God should be done on earth in practical opposition to the enemies of his will. The other is to teach the people that society, business, industry, and all government must be obedient to the law of Christ."

From a Christian standpoint, there are two objections to these two things at which the Christian Citizenship League aims. One is that Christianity does not oppose men, even the enemies of God's will; it opposes only sin. The other is that the law of Christ is not a law of force.

"Bear ye one another's burdens," wrote the Apostle Paul to the Galatians, "and so fulfil the law of Christ." But what is it that leads us to bear one another's burdens? Is it force or love?

To say that "society, business, industry, and all government must be obedient to the law of Christ," is to say that all these must be actuated by the principle of love. But in such a case, force is powerless. Love does not come in that way.

To use force in fulfilling the law of Christ, would at once rob that law of all its divinity.
