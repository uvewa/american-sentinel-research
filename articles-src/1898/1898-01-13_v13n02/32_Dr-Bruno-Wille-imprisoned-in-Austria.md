Dr. Bruno Wille, a "free thinker," of Berlin, was recently sentenced to a week's imprisonment at Gratz, Austria, for "publicly holding up to contempt the Christian religion." It is safe to say that the act of imprisoning a person on such a charge does more to hold the Christian religion up to contempt than anything that was done by Dr. Wille.
