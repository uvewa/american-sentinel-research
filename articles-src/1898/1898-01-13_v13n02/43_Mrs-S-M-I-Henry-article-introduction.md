THE article on page 19, by Mrs. S. M. I. Henry, is the first of many of which we have the promise for our readers during the coming year. The writer's wide experience as National Evangelist of the W. C. T. U., enables her to speak from the standpoint of what she has seen and felt of the needs of the masses along the line of instruction in religious liberty topics, and we feel sure her contributions will prove a valuable addition to the feast of good things which our readers will enjoy during 1898.
