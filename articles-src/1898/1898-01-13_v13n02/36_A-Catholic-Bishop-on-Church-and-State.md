New York Independent, December 22.

BISHOP SPALDING, of Peoria, is one of the ablest and best equipped bishops in the American Catholic Church. We therefore listen with especial interest to what he has to say of the effect in the Catholic countries of Europe of having the church supported by the state. Speaking of the religious and moral lapse of the Italians who come to this country, he says:—

> "They have been led by unfortunate circumstances into indifference and even antagonism to the church. In the first place, the means and opportunities of public worship have been provided for them without their being called on to bear their share in the expense. And, since what costs us nothing we care little for, they have become callous, and have relaxed somewhat their hold upon the vital faith which is nourished by generous deeds and unselfish devotion."

This is sound American doctrine; and we cannot understand why Catholics and Anglicans who find the absolute divorce of church and state so admirable in this country should so deprecate religious independence in England or Italy.
