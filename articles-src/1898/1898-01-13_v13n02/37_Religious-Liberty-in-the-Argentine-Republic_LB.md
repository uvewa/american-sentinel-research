BY L. BROOKING.*

THE following is an article from *El Faro*, a periodical in the Argentine Republic, under date of Nov. 1, 1897:—

"LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE.

"The national Constitution will shortly be submitted to a constituent convention with the object to effect in it certain urgent reforms. Among these reforms figures that of liberty of conscience, which until now has been prevented by the second article that says, 'The Federal Government sustains the Roman Catholic apostolic religion.' There is being signed with much enthusiasm a petition asking for the suppression of the said article. This petition says very judiciously, 'The separation of church and state is to day a constitutional precept of the most civilized new countries. The United States of America, a model religious country, owes to it a great part of its strength, its freedom, and active ideas; and Brazil has adopted it conjointly with (the formation of) the Republic. The separation of church and state is a guarantee that we owe even among ourselves to liberty of conscience, and a highly needful measure in this country to which flow men from all schools and of all religions. If they are to be fertile for our intellectual and moral development, it will not be by the privileges which some of them enjoy, but by the necessity which all see to strengthen themselves with the practice of good and truth. The abolition of the calculated cost of worship is a wage of liberty for the actual official church, and a sign of respect to the right that the Catholics have of paying the cost of the religion in which they alone believe."

Noble words these because they are true; and had that been the principle since their independence, how much purer and nobler would the lives of many of our brethren in those countries have been, as they would have had a purer standard than that of the state-supported clergy. I say "brethren" because "God hath made of one blood all nations," and they can accept the word that brings comfort to us; "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life."

* Late missionary to Argentina.
