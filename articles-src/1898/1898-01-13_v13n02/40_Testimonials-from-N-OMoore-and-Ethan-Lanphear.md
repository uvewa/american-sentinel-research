MR. N. O'MOORE, of Highland Park, Ill., writes: "Inclosed find $10, for which send the SENTINEL one year to each of the accompanying names, and credit my subscription five years in advance."

MR. ETHAN LANPHEAR, of Plainfield, N. J., in renewing his subscription to the SENTINEL, says: "Among all the papers that come to my table, there is none that speaks as much truth in so few words as does the AMERICAN SENTINEL. May it continue to live until the end comes and righteousness triumphs."
