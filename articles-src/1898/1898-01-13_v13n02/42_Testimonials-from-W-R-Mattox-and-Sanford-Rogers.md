MR. W. R. MATTOX, of Terre Haute, Ind., to whom the SENTINEL was sent by some friend during our late special offer, in renewing the same, says: "The SENTINEL has been a welcome visitor to my office for three months, and I find the time profitably spent in reading it. The work of the SENTINEL in the cause of religious liberty is so ably and earnestly pursued that those who read it cannot fail to be convinced by it. Both reason and experience, history, and Bible teaching, support the SENTINEL in its position on this question. . . . I like the SENTINEL, and must have it a year."

THE following, addressed to the AMERICAN SENTINEL, with $1 inclosed for renewal of subscription from Mr. Sanford Rogers, Coopersville, Mich., is appreciated: "We have found you always true and can trust you still. The first numbers ever folded were for me to distribute on the train from California to Ohio."
