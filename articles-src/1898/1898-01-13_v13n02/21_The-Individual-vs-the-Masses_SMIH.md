**BY MRS. S. M. I. HENRY.**

WHENEVER we lose sight of the divine ideal, we begin to drop below the level of success, especially in handling the Word of God and dealing with souls. Satan is always anxious to make us think that we can improve on the old methods which Christ employed, or that the times have so changed that the old ways must be changed to suit them. He is very anxious that the "good things" which are ground out in the study of the average preacher should get before the people; he believes in a gospel that will draw and a crowd that can be drawn this way and that. He has so far succeeded in popularizing the gospel that it has come to be a serious problem how we can get rid of the crowd, to which the truth can never mean anything, and find the individual who is starving for it.

We hear a great deal about "reaching the masses." "The masses" is as illusive as a swamp full of will-o'-the-wisps. It may seem to be just within reach, but "when you put your hand on it, it isn't there." What belongs to "the masses" belongs to no man.

To send the gospel to the masses is like shoveling sand into the sea. Before any man can become a true witness for the truth or a soul winner, he must get the idea of the masses out of his head, the word out of his vocabulary, the hunger for the crowd out of his heart, and come to recognize the individual in all his aloneness. Truth is a turnstile that has a way of its own of dealing with the crowd. It may pack up against it by the thousands, but must come through one by one.

Christ came to save a lost world by saving the lost individual. The multitude followed him and hung upon his words, but were reduced to individuals by the glance of his eye and the touch that healed. It was always one by one that he reproved, comforted, and pardoned. No man is ever truly saved until he recognizes himself, in his relation to God, as entirely separate from every other individual, and that Christ died for him alone; that he is the man who made necessary all the expensive work of redemption. He will never be "firm in the truth" until he learns to stand alone with God and be strong and glad in his companionship and satisfied with his approval, until in fact Christ is to him "all and in all." To have the witness of the Spirit that his ways are pleasing to God must be to him the end of desire, his crowning joy, before he is ready to meet the Lord, either at resurrection or by translation. It is very necessary that this should be thoroughly understood by any who are called to promulgate any great principle. The broader the principle the more necessary that it should be firmly planted and rooted in the individual mind and heart. I heard a minister say once, "I did not preach the sermon I intended this morning because it was too important to throw away on the small congregation." He had utterly lost sight of the ideal congregation in this popular craze for the crowd.

We need, in these last days, for the promulgation of the momentous principles which have been committed to us as a people, to cultivate the mother instinct which never can see more than one at a time, and that one for the time being, as long as her eye is on him, to her, like his Lord, "the chiefest among ten thousand, the one altogether lovely."

Just as long as a man thinks of himself as a part of a crowd he is useless, if not dangerous; for he will never be able to pass through any crisis where manhood and integrity are needed. A series of evangelistic temperance services had brought a throng of men out of the saloons into the church; they came almost in a body; it was a wonderful thing to witness. All went well for months, but on the Fourth of July one of the number in a little town where he had found work was tempted to drink, and fell. The word was carried quickly to the rest of "the crowd" who were "celebrating" in a decorous manner, suited to the day and the new life they were living. It struck them, as a ball might strike a row of bricks standing on end. Before night a large proportion of them were lying around drunk in the old haunts. They had gone down one after the other, until, at last, one who had learned what it was to be a man in his own right and to stand alone with God, refused to go down; and stood as a kind of break-water to a remnant who were yet sober, and so gave them time to rally their senses; and also gave them a testimony that salvation personally applied meant something.

To come into the church for the purpose of getting help is, sooner or later, to become disappointed, discouraged, and to apostatize in heart if not in outward appearance. There is no help in the church, excepting for the man who comes into it as the arm has come into the shoulder, by natural growth, and for service to the whole body. Then nothing can hinder him from being helped. As he exercises the gifts that are in him for the edification of the body of Christ and for the rescue of the lost, he must thrive, and grow up into spiritual manhood.

As time passes on rapid wing the need grows that we should each find the soul that we must win,—that we should seek out the lonely and desolate ones, who are, here and there, waiting for the truth with which we have been so richly laden, to the end that we may dispense it as liberally as we have received.
