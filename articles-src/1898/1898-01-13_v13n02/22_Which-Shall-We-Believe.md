The Christian Citizen, for December, in speaking of the prospective time "when the initiative and referendum are applied to municipal and State politics," says:—

"Then the voice of the people, which is the voice of God, will be heard."

So said the old pagans of ancient Rome, and to them, as far as it can be traced, the statement owes its origin. Upon their authority it rests. But the Bible says that the voice of God is heard through "holy men of old," who "spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."

Which shall we believe, the pagans of ancient Rome, or the Bible?
