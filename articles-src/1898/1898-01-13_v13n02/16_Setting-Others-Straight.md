We have been criticised for speaking against the work of the "Societies for Setting Others Straight;" the ground of the criticism being that the SENTINEL is seeking to do this very thing itself.

Our critics are mistaken. One man cannot set another man straight, nor can any set of men do this. This the SENTINEL knows and is trying to get the people to see.

An individual can be set straight only by the Word and Spirit of God.

And what the SENTINEL aims to do is to persuade those who think they can and ought to set other people straight, to leave this work in the hands of the agencies God has established for that purpose; and to warn the people of the results which will follow if this is not done.

This is why the SENTINEL opposes religious legislation, and any effort to unite church and state.

If it were not for the continuous efforts made by religious societies all through the country to set other people straight by legislation, the SENTINEL would have nothing to say.
