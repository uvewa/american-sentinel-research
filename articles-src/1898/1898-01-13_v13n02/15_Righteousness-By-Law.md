The Jews sought righteousness by the works of the law—so the epistle to the Romans tells us—and they failed to obtain righteousness. And the fact that they sought righteousness in this way is the reason, we are told, why they failed. Rom. 9:30–32.

Yet there was nothing the matter with the law. It was the law which God gave them, and was just as good a law as God himself could make. It cannot be claimed that any legislature of men can enact a better one.

If, then, the Jews, who were scrupulous observers of God's law in outward conduct, and had great zeal for it, could not through it become righteous, how can it possibly be that righteousness can come through a human law which is imposed upon people against their wills?

Is righteousness to come by the law, or can it come by faith only? It really seems as though the situation warrants the asking, in all seriousness, for an answer from the churches to the question.

If the churches still believe that righteousness can come only through faith, why are they uniting their forces in a great movement to control the politics and shape the legislation of the country?
