The following from the Catholic Standard and Times, of January 8, ought to be interesting reading for all Protestants:—

"M. C., on behalf of a Protestant friend, asked: 'What proof have we that Christ was born December 25?'"

"St. Chrysostom, in a Christmas sermon, December 25, 386, says: 'The Romans who have celebrated this day as the anniversary of our Lord's nativity have transmitted it to us (the Greeks) from ancient tradition.' Ancient authorities are not agreed on the date; the church has, however, the right to appoint any day for the special commemoration of a mystery or great religious event. The acceptance of the Roman date by all Christians shows not only the supremacy of that church, but also the fact that tradition must be relied on in many cases. The name of the festival itself is Catholic in the extreme, made up, as it is, of the words of Christ and Mass."

Probably there are few, if any Protestants so ignorant and superstitious as to believe that Jesus Christ was born on December 25; and even if that were the correct date for the event, no logical reason could be drawn from the fact for celebrating the day in the manner which is followed throughout Christendom. This, as may be easily shown, is based upon ideas distinctly pagan. The whole institution, as it now stands, is a monument of tradition. And in following tradition, the religious world is following Rome. Of this there can be no question.

The "reasons" which this papal authority gives for the celebration of December 25, are as good as any that can be given; indeed, they are the only ones that can be found for it. But what Protestant is willing to accept them as a basis for his own practice? It is pleasant to give and receive gifts; but why should this not be done according to Scripture rather than according to tradition? It is high time that every person who takes the name of Protestant should cut loose from tradition, and cease from any practice which declares the supremacy of Rome.
