It is admitted on every hand that a union of church and state in this country would be a very bad thing.

That is, it would be very bad if the state should become joined with one of the churches or denominations professing the Christian religion.

But the surprising thing in connection with this is, that while the people are against this thing, as constituting a union of church and state, they are quite generally in favor of a union of the state with religion, as represented by the churches in general.

If it is wrong for the state to unite with one church alone, is it right for the state to unite with all the churches?

If even marriage between church and state is wrong, what must be said of church and state polygamy?
