"Medical Record."

Professor Vincenzi, of the University of Sassari (in Italy), has investigated the holy water from "one of the most popular churches" of that city, with the following results: A single drop taken a few hours after the water was renewed and spread upon gelatin yielded in forty-eight hours about 2,350 bacterial colonies. This drop was taken on a Saturday evening, when the water had been little used. The next evening, after numerous and crowded services, each drop of the water tested yielded innumerable colonies. Four cases of diphtheria were notified at Sassari while these investigations were proceeding, and it being the custom there for persons to touch their lips as well as other parts with holy water, the possibility of infection is obvious. The bacillus coli, though possibly directly introduced, was, according to Professor Vincenzi, probably present in the church dust, which, he remarks, was copious.
