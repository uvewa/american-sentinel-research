**NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT**

It is reported that the military authorities in Washington have determined to institute the unusual proceeding of forming a board of inquiry to find out who is really entitled to the credit of sinking the Spanish fleet at Santiago. Ordinarily, there is no occasion in naval combats for any question as to the rightful claimant of the glory; but it appears that in this instance there are a number of parties who are willing to take all the credit for the victory that the public can be persuaded to give them. In fact, each one of the ships engaged is reported as being, in the minds of the captain and crew, mainly responsible for sending Cervera's fleet to the bottom; while Rear-Admiral Sampson, who was not present at the engagement, reports that the victory was won by the "ships under my command," in pursuance of orders left in anticipation of such a move as was made by the Spanish fleet. The Board of Inquiry will sift the contending claims, and if possible ascertain which one of the candidates for superior honors is not making a bigger claim than is justified by the facts. These facts do not seem to reflect very favorably upon the reputed Christianity of the parties concerned.
