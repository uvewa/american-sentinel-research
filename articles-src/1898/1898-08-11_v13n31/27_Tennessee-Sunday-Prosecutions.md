READ THE REPORT ON PAGE 492 OF THE ARRESTS FOR SUNDAY DESERCATION IN TENNESSEE; AND AS YOU READ, ASK YOURSELF IF REAL CHRISTIANITY EVER LENDS ITSELF IN SUPPORT OF A PROCEEDING SO UNFAIR, AND SO FULL OF PERSONAL VINDICITIVENESS. AND IT IS THE SAME STORY WITH ONE AND ALL OF SUCH PROSECUTIONS, —THEY ARE PROMPECTED BY ANOTHER SPIRIT THAN THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST.
