**A Word for Our Illustrations.**

EDITOR SENTINEL: The cut on the front page of the SENTINEL for July 28, is very striking, and preaches a telling sermon.

One thing I notice is that the clergyman who is using the civil law whip to force people on to the narrow road is himself down in the broad road. Of course, seeking to drive them, he could not very well be anywhere else. In that case it appears to me that he is as bad off as those in whose midst he is. If they are in the wrong place—and undoubtedly they are—then so must he be.

No one—not even a clergyman—can be on both roads at one and the same time. Only those who are worldlings, whatever their profession may be, are ever on the broad road. And the fact that anyone is there, even though they are trying to drive others off, is proof that they are still of the world. If it is wrong for the others to be there, it is just as wrong for the clergyman, and if the means that he is using for their conversion (?) is necessary, why would not the same be necessary for himself? And in that case why does he not lash himself before he lashes the others?

The truth is, the place where the minister ought to be (and the minister of Jesus Christ will always be found there) is in the narrow way. There he would not be driving people; he just couldn't. All he could do would be to stand with outstretched arms, pleading with the worldling below to come up into the heavenly places, and show that the only means by which they could be transferred from the one place to the other is by faith, not law—not even by divine law.

Jesus says, "Follow me," "The Spirit and the Bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come." Let all ministers do likewise, and not try to drive. It is to be hoped that all such ministers who are urging the civil law method of conversion will see themselves in the picture, and learn that they too are certainly in the wrong place.
