"MAMA," said Charlie, "we read that when Christ comes with his holy angels, he will raise the righteous dead, that those who are alive and remain will be caught up by the angels to live in heaven, and to reign with him a thousand years. Why is this necessary? I always thought that as soon as people die their souls go straight to heaven. Does Jesus bring their souls back at the resurrection to put them again into the body, or how is it?"

"I will ask you some questions," said Mrs. Ross. "What did God tell Adam and Eve about eating of the forbidden tree?"

"He said, 'In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,'" said Charlie.

"The margin says, 'dying thou shalt die,'" added Mrs. Ross.

"Well, but mama, what does it mean, that the body dies? The soul, you know, cannot die."

"What does God say about that, Charlie? Please read Eze. 18:4."

"'Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall die.' Does the New Testament say that too, mama?"

"Yes. Jesus himself warns us to 'fear Him who hath power to destroy both soul and body in hell.' One of our hymns recognizes God's power to destroy as well as create; it says,—

'Before Jehovah's awful throne, Ye nations bow with sacred joy; Know that the Lord is God alone; He can create, and he destroy.'

"Let us reason a little, Charlie, so that you may see how this links into the principles we have been studying. What is the result or wages of sin?"

"Death," said Charlie.

"How did sin originate?"

"By doubting that God was Love."

"In whom do we have life?"

"In God, in Christ. 'In him was life, and the life was the light of men,'" quoted Charlie.

"How could that life that was in him benefit his creatures?"

"By partaking of it."

"But if the wages of sin is death, mama, and Adam sinned, how is it that the human race has been perpetuated generation after generation?"

"Through the unmerited mercy of God. When Adam sinned, a plan was devised in heaven to give the human race a chance to return to allegiance to God. The brief span of life granted to every human soul has been purchased for him by the cross. 'God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' The days that we use so carelessly have been blood-bought, and furnish us with probation in which we may make sure our calling and election for eternal life. But how do we partake of eternal life?"

"'He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life,'" said Charlie. "It is by faith."

"Paul says, 'our life is hid with Christ in God,' and that 'when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory.'"

"Then if faith in God as a God of love secures for us eternal life, what is the result of doubt?"

"Death."

"That life comes to us by faith has many illustrations in the Word of God. The woman who touched the hem of Christ's garment received life, and Jesus perceived that virtue had gone out of him. He said to her, 'Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath saved thee.'"

"And yet, mama, Christians die. Does the text we read about—the soul that sinneth it shall die,' apply to those who have faith as well as to those who don't?"

"The death of the righteous is always pictured as a sleep. You know, Charlie, that when we sleep, we are unconscious; we do not note the passing of time. Paul says, 'Those who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him,' and argues that if Christ had not been raised from the dead, then those who sleep in him would be perished. Solomon says, 'The dead know not anything.' David says, 'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts perish.' 'He giveth his beloved sleep.'"

"But how is that having eternal life? It looks to me as if there was an interruption."

"You forget that Christ has the life laid up in him. The names of the candidates for that eternal life are written in the Lamb's Book of Life, and when he shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory."

"Then are there none of the human race in heaven to-day?"

"O yes. Elijah was translated to heaven without seeing death. Moses was resurrected. When Christ rose from the dead many of the saints rose too, and Paul tells us that when he ascended on high he led a multitude of captives with him. But the great mass of his children are sleeping in the grave, and when he comes he will wake them out of sleep. We which are alive and remain will be changed in a moment into immortal beings, while those who come up from the grave will be raised immortal, incorruptible."

"Well, that seems consistent. It always seemed as though there would be a great distance between those who had lived in heaven for centuries, and the latest comers. It seems to me Enoch, Elijah, Moses, and that multitude will be ahead of all the others. But, mama, how is it that we have thought that we did not die, but that our souls went to heaven?"

"Satan started the doctrine when he said, 'Thou shalt not surely die;' and out of it has grown the 'beast' and his 'image.'"

"How, mama?"

"Self-exaltation is the very foundation of all the inhumanity that has caused man to mourn. And it is out of the idea that man is immortal in himself that systems of pride and torture have originated. The Hindoos teach that the soul goes through millions of years of transmigration before it is fit for heaven. The car of Juggernaut, the throwing of babies in the Ganges, the Chinese worship of the dead, the fires of purgatory, the tortures of the Inquisition, and the seeking to compel men to be righteous by law, all have their logical starting point in the falsehood of Satan, 'Thou shalt not surely die.'"

"Why, mama, how is the Inquisition in the doctrine?"

"As a means of saving an undying soul from eternal torture, St. Augustine, one of the old Catholic fathers, said, 'That it was better to persuade men to become Christians that their souls might be saved; but if they would not be persuaded, it was better to compel them even by the employment of torture, so that if they lost this life in a brief torture, they might not spend eternity in the tortures of hell."

"But, mama, didn't he know that men were to be saved by faith in God's love, and that no amount of torture would make men believe?"

"I'm afraid he did not know God at all. His theory, rooted in Satan's falsehood, encouraged men in torturing the body, that by so doing they might save the soul. This is the outcome of righteousness by law instead of by faith, and all of this satanic scheme is wrapped up in the doctrine that man has an undying soul, that lives on independent of God's love and life."

TIME has detracted nothing from the power of God unto salvation, embodied in the gospel.
