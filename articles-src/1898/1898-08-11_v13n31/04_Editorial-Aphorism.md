THERE is in the human heart a natural love of freedom, a natural aversion to arbitrary restraint.

A tired laborer, let us suppose, comes to his room and lies down upon his couch to rest. Leave him at liberty to lie there or get up as he chooses, and he will remain quiet in the enjoyment of refreshing rest; but strap him to the couch, and though he is in no pain he will do his utmost to get up from the couch at once.
