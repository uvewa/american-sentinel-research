BY C. H. KESLAKE.

In our last article it was shown that the law of God, the gospel of Christ and Christ himself, are each spoken of in the Scriptures as being "the truth;" and that consequently any thing that is opposed to any one of the three must be opposed to all. Of the law it was also pointed out that it could not be "the truth" only as each one of the commandments comprising that law was truth. Now to change this law in any way would certainly be to change the truth. But to change truth in any way would be to change it into a lie.

In further considering this question it might be well to enquire: In the plan of salvation which phase of "the truth"—the law, the gospel or Christ—has priority of claim? While they are essentially one, they are spoken of as being separate and distinct, and especially is it so regarding the law and the gospel. And it is only as they are thus presented in the Word that we would ask the question:—Which has priority of claim in the plan of salvation?

That which has made the gospel necessary is sin. The gospel is intended to save men from sin. But what is sin? The primary meaning of the word is "a missing the mark." What mark has one missed by sinning? We learn this from the general definition the Bible gives of the word "sin." Here is what is said of it: 1 John 3:4: "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law." The same truth is expressed thus: "By the law is the knowledge of sin." "Where there is no law there is no transgression." "Sin is not imputed when there is no law." See Rom. 3:20; 4:15; 5:12. These scriptures (a few of the many that might be quoted) shew wherein man has missed the mark; he has come short of that which is set forth in the law.

Now as the gospel is the means ordained of God to save man from sin—from missing the mark—it must be manifest that it is only another way of saying that the gospel is the God-ordained means of lifting man up to the level of that law, so that he will be in harmony with all that the law requires. Now which is the truth—must the law conform to the gospel? or must the gospel conform to the law? The answer is obvious; the gospel must conform to the law, which is in effect to say that the law has priority of claim. But the law is "the truth." Any gospel therefore that affects to make a change in the law of God, does not simply seek to make the law conform to it, but in the very nature of things is an enemy of the law, and cannot therefore be the truth. Such a gospel would in itself be sin, and the only effect it could have would be to confirm man in his sin, and if possible make him more than ever an enemy of God.

Again let it be repeated. The law is "the truth." Now whence came this law? Jesus Christ is "the truth." Every manifestation of truth therefore is from him; hence the law is from Jesus Christ. Of him it is said, "He cannot deny himself;" also that he is "the same yesterday, to-day, and forever."

This is not simply spoken of Christ at the time he was here on the earth and subsequently, but previous to his advent in the flesh also. This being so, it must be that Christ's relation to the law, so far as he himself is concerned, while on the earth must be the same as before he came. But that is not all. As the Saviour of men, made in the likeness of sinful flesh (Rom. 8:3), and becoming our example (1 Peter 2:20), he must himself be subject to that law. Hence it is seen that in the plan of salvation the law is superior. It was therefore utterly impossible for Christ to teach anything contrary to the law. Had he done so he would not have been "the truth."

In view of these things how is it possible for Sunday to be the Sabbath? It is no part of the law other than that it is included in the expression, "Six days shall thou labor and do all thy work;" which proves it to be a common working day.

For Sunday ever to be the Sabbath the seventh day must be displaced; but this could not be done but by annulling the Sabbath commandment. As we have seen that the truth contained in the fourth commandment is necessary for the law, as a whole, to be the truth, to annul this commandment would simply cause the law to cease to be "the truth."

The fourth commandment states a fact concerning the creation. It tells that in six days God created the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that in them is. Having accomplished this, we are told, he rested the seventh day, wherefore he "blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."

From the commandment itself we find that the seventh day is inseparably connected with, and finds its source in, the creation. And because of this the seventh day could no more be destroyed than could creation itself.

God does nothing arbitrarily; there was no exception in the matter of the seventh day. God instituted it, because for the good of his creatures he saw it was necessary. Man's safety ever depended upon his remembering his Creator, and so long as man remembered "the Sabbath day to keep it holy"—from week to week, so long would it be impossible for him ever to forget the God who made him.

Furthermore, the Sabbath day is God's rest day. The only day that could possibly be his rest day is the day upon which he rested. But God never rested upon Sunday. To say that he did is to say that which is not true. Therefore it is utterly impossible for Sunday to be the Sabbath. To substitute the first day for the seventh day, is to change the law; and the law being "the truth" it would be changing the truth into a lie.

In the very nature of things then Sunday is in opposition to the law which is the truth; and that being so, it is in opposition to the gospel and to Jesus Christ.

This is all true; and as surely as this is true so surely is it true that this nation is to be so manipulated that its power is to be directed against the gospel, and therefore against Jesus Christ, by compelling the people to accept and keep Sunday in opposition to the fourth commandment.

An ounce of prevention is not worth a pound of cure to the one who is sick; and the gospel is the only cure for sin sickness.
