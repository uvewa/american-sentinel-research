It is a warm Sunday morning, and the workingman, with his family, are taking what comfort they can within the confines of their own premises. They would like to go outside to some place of recreation, but a strict Sunday-law regime has been put in force, which has suppressed all Sunday trains and prohibited all "worldly" amusements on the "Sabbath" day. Entrance to the public pleasure grounds is barred, and the policeman stands ready to resist any attempted violation of the law; while the clergyman stands by and suggests to the workingman that there is one pathway open to him—that leading to church. He has no business, says the clergyman, to want to go anywhere else on Sunday. But the workingman does not care to go to church, because, as he says, there is so much preaching of political and war issues, and so little of the gospel.

It may be said that worldly recreations are not yet prohibited on Sunday, but it is at this that the agitators for Sunday enforcement aim for they no more approve of Sunday amusements than of Sunday work; and there is no logical stopping place for the law this side of it.
