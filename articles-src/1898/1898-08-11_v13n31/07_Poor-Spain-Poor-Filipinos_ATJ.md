The following "Pastoral" of "The Most Excellent and Most Illustrious Archbishop of Manila," was addressed to the people of the Philippines after Dewey had smashed things there on May Day. We copy it from a Hong-Kong paper of May 19, 1898:—

"My Dear Sons: The dark day broke when the North American squadron entered swiftly into our brilliant bay, and despite the heroism of our sailors destroyed our ships, and succeeded in hoisting up the flag of the enemy on the blessed soil of our country. Don't forget that in their anger they intend with all their pride and vanity to crush our rights under their feet. It is a stranger who tries to subject us to his hard yoke. He is a heretic who tries to bring down our religion and drag us from the holy family of our Catholic Church. He is an insatiable merchant who tries to make his fortune out of the ruin of Spain and of her possessions.

"Poor Spain, if these invaders succeed in their unholy intentions! Poor Filipinos, the day on which these North Americans establish their government on your soil! Poor Indians, subjected by a country which has not the Catholic faith of Spain, nor the maternal love, nor her high nobility, nor the community of interest and history which Spain has had with the Philippines during the last three centuries, nor the infusion of blood which a good many of you carry in your veins in this country, and which has been shed for the common defense in a good many great hazards. Tied with fraternal ties, sons of the metropolis and the colonies, very soon you will see an insuperable will put between you and your haughty masters.

"For you there will be no more public offices, nor employment in particular in the government and administration of the country such as you had during the government of Spain. You will soon be formed into a sort of civil republic, at the low level of the pariahs, exploited like miserable colonists, reduced to the condition of slaves, even of beasts or machines, fed with a handful of rice or maize which they will throw in your faces as your daily rations in order that they may take advantage of the products of your labor. They will soon become the masters of the fruits and treasures of your estates, which are yours by right, and cannot belong to another. But that is not all, nor the worst! Your temples will soon be in ruins, your chapels will be converted into Protestant churches, where there will not be the throne of God, the God of the Eucharist, nor the holy image of the Virgin Mary, your sweetest Mother. The cross of your cemeteries will disappear, the crucifix of your schools will be soon gone, the dear ministers of God who have made you Christians and baptized you, and have absolved you so many times from your sins, and who have always tied you with the tie of holy matrimony, and who have administered consolation to you during your troubles and assisted you in your last moments and applied after death the suffrages of the Holy Church—these will soon disappear.

"You will, perhaps, with heroic faith and valor, retain in your heart the Catholic faith as before and be more firm. Who knows? But what will become of your children, your most delicate sons and daughters, more especially after their parents have gone, and their lot has been cast amongst a Protestant nation, strange legislation, the culture, education and customs of Protestants and in full view of the propaganda of all their vices and errors. Ah, who knows by the time this century has elapsed there won't be any of those religious practices in Christian faith in this country, nor will there be any men who will even know how to make the sign of the cross of salvation on their breasts.

"Poor Filipinos! unfortunate in this life and unfortunate in the life eternal. Fortunately, dear Philippine people, the roars of the cannon of the enemy and the cries of alarms which they have raised have awakened you to the sense of danger in which you are at present. As one man we know you are preparing yourselves to defend your country, and as carrying one harp raised to the heavens are your most urgent wishes for success. That is the only resource to salvation. You must all have recourse to arms and prayer at once. To arms, because the Spanish population, though extenuated and wounded in its patriotism, when defending its religion is capable of attempting the greatest hazards; to prayer, because victory is always given by God to those who have been tyrannized, but have justice on their side. But not only the prayer nor the fight; the military forces and the virtue of God joined together; God will send his angels and his saints with us, and he will fight with so much force on our side with us.

"But in order to make our prayer more in harmony and more efficacious we must have the prayer of the whole general public. To us the holy inspiration has come to dedicate the whole Philippine Archipelago to the Holy Heart of Jesus, and offer him when we see we are free from these tribulations some exceptional act of devotion which will be performed on the coming 17th of June if it is possible, and if it is not possible on that day at some other more opportune time. And besides this private consecration, on the first Friday of the previous month, in order to show the God by the Holy Mesa dedicated to the holy body of Jesus Christ we are not alone working in our name or in the name of the prelates of other dioceses, we will be assisted by the governor general, who is as firm a Christian as he is a prudent patriot and military chief, in order to offer to God triumph through the medium of Spain. And thus we shall interpret the wishes of the mass of the population of these islands, who are so devoted in their religious faith, and invoke the intercession of the patron saints of this country and principally the queen of all the virgins, the holy rozary in the sincerest hope of absolution from sin this consecration and offer to God, we give you our holy children our best benediction in the name of the Father, etc.

[Then follows the special prayer and instructions to parish priests.]

"For the salvation of the volunteers who have taken up arms against the Americans every battalion of volunteers shall be provided with a special chaplain, who will have full faculties of administration of the spiritual offices of the church. Full power will also be granted these chaplains to hold public services in military camps, and they are also to be authorized to grant absolution from sin."
