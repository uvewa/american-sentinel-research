WE NOTE WITH PLEASURE A STRONG TENDENCY ON THE PART OF METHODISTS, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH, TO REPUDIATE THE ACTION OF THE CHURCH REPRESENTATIVES IN THE MATTER OF THE $288,000 CLAIM COLLECTED FROM CONGRESS BY THE METHODIST BOOK CONCERN, OF NASHVILLE. WE WILL BE GLAD TO GIVE CREDIT TO ANY DENOMINATION FOR ANY MOVE TENDING TO REPUDIATE THE PRINCIPLE OF UNION OF CHURCH AND STATE.
