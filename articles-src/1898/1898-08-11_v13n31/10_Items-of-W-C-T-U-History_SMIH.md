BY MRS. S. M. I. HENRY.

Work for the children, as we have seen, led to the homes in which they lived, and this to many discoveries that aroused the hearts of our women, as women had never been aroused before.

It is perfectly safe to say that it was because of the ignorance of women concerning the conditions which had been at work in human affairs, that so many evils had been able to grow up and entrench themselves in law and custom, and from these strongholds command business, politics, and religion all over the world.

Among the new surprises that continually awaited us was the widespread evil of child labor, and its horrible abuse of everything sacred to the young, the innocent and helpless. No sooner was this condition discovered than we began to make efforts to abolish it. We had by experience learned that abolition was a slow process, and while we had to wait for that, we kept ourselves busy with efforts at amelioration.

It seemed to us that we could not afford to stop short of the destruction of the system; that while we were dallying with palliations, the race of boys and girls must become extinct, or only be preserved among the rich and well-to-do. The power of life as it was manifested in a frail child who had to earn the living for a whole family, was beyond all comprehension, and can find no solution outside of the fact that God is in it, and that "He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things," and yet so keeps his hand on it, that while "no man hath power over the Spirit to retain the Spirit," neither has he power to discharge any from this war of life. It was the grip of the Eternal God on the delicate machinery of the half-starved body that kept it going long after every reasonable conclusion would be that it ought to stop and lie down in the grave to rest.

I have before me in Scribner's Magazine for this month an article by W. A. Wykoff, which I wish every Seventh-day Adventist, at least, might read; but feeling sure that but few of them will see it, and since it gives an up-to-date view of the conditions which bore so heavily upon our hearts, I beg leave to quote at length from it an account of a visit to a Chicago "sweat shop." I have many times attempted to picture these things in public addresses, and have been distressed to see how little many good people, who know so much about God and truth know about those who are in such terrible need of deliverance. I now quote this, however, because of the bearing which it has upon a certain department of the National W.C.T.U. about which more than ordinary interest clusters in these days.

Mr. Wykoff says: "As we neared the door there was the usual sound of the clattering rush of sewing-machines going at high speed—starting and stopping abruptly, at uneven intervals and giving you the impression, in the meantime, of racing furiously with one another.

"The open door revealed the customary sight of a room perhaps twenty feet square, with daylight entering faintly through two unwashed windows, which looked out upon the level of the street. The dampness showed itself in dew-like beads along the walls and on the ceiling which I could easily reach as I stood erect. In spite of it being winter, the dingy walls were dotted with black flies, which swarmed most about a cooking stove, over which, stirring a steaming pot, stood a ragged, disheveled woman, who looked as though she never could have known any but extreme old age. In the remaining floor space were crowded a dozen machines or more, over which, in the thick, unventilated atmosphere, were the bending figures of the workers. Oil lamps lit up the inner recesses of the room and seemed to lend consistency to the heavy air. From an eye here and there which caught his in a single movement, the Unionist received a look of recognition, but not a head was turned to see who had entered, and the whirr of feverish work went on unchecked for an instant by our coming.

"While the Unionist was talking to the sweater, I walked behind the close line of machines over a floor covered with deep accumulations of dirt and shreds of cloth and broken threads, to where, in a corner, a group of girls were sewing. The oldest among them may have been twelve and the youngest could have been a little over eight, and their wages averaged about 75 cents a week for hours that varied widely according to the stress of work.

"Near the corner was a passage and through it I could see into a small room which had no window nor any opening but the door; there, in perpetual darkness lit up by one oil lamp, was a man who, for twelve (and sometimes fifteen) hours a day, pressed the new-made clothing for a living. . . .

"We were on the point of leaving when a heavy foot fall sounded on the wooden steps and the door opened to the touch of an inspecting officer, whose glowing health and neat, warm uniform were as though a prosperous breeze were sweeping the stagnant room. The work, however, was as unaffected by his coming as it had been by ours. Not a sewer noticed him, and the stitching of machines went racing on with unabated swiftness. Only "the old man" watched nervously the movements of the officer as he walked about the shop making note of the bad air and the filth upon the floors and the group of little girls, and the dark, unventilated chamber beyond." . . .

"Look here," I could hear him say, "You've got to clean up here, and right away. The first thing you know you'll start a fever that will sweep the city before we can stop it."

"The young Hebrew had stopped his work and turned half round in his chair until he faced the officer. There were deep lines in his haggard, beardless face, and his wolfish eyes were ablaze with the sense of sharp injustice.

"You tell us we've got to clean up," he answered in broken English, lifting his voice to a shout above the clatter of the machines. "What time have we to keep clean when it's all we can do to get bread? Don't talk to us about disease; it's bread we're after, bread!" And there sounded in the voice of the boy the cry of the hungry for food, which no man who hears can ever forget.

"The officer passed, speechless, up the steps, and we followed into the clean, pure air, under the boundless blue of smiling skies."
