Can you not make good use of a few extra copies of this SENTINEL? Try it and see.

The truly wise man will take no chances with the Lord. At the bar of eternal judgment those who have not taken God exactly at his word will feel ill at ease.

Nothing that you see around you to-day is to last beyond a few years of time. The only enduring things are the "things invisible." They are the most truly substantial.
