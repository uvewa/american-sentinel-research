**The Tennessee Arrests.**

AS MENTIONED in our last issue, two recent arrests for Sunday desecration have been made in eastern Tennessee. In reply to a letter of inquiry, we have received a letter giving details of the affair, as follows:—

"In Briceville, Anderson County, is situated the Knoxville Iron Company's coal mine, where hundreds of men find employment. Here a number of men are at work every Sunday; and up to July 25, no case is on record of any person being molested for so doing. But when Messrs. Bates and Cash, young men, who about a year ago commenced the observance of the Sabbath of the Lord, went to work Sunday, July 24, the judge (who had on a number of instances openly violated the same law for which he issued a warrant for their arrest), saw Mr. Bates and Mr. Cash going into the coal mine, or going toward it rather, in their bank garb, and on the strength of that, and a little encouragement by the way of intimidation from a few of his Baptist(?) associates, he was led to issue a warrant for their arrest.

"In the complaint the judge swore without any qualification whatever, that those two men worked in his presence, when, in fact, if they worked at all, it was not less than two thousand feet back under the mountain; and his house is, at least, three hundred yards from the entry of the mine. Yet he swore the work was performed in his 'presence.' And the main witness—a Mr. Russell, who appeared for the prosecution, had, on that day, worked hard in full view of the 'squire's' house and in a direct line too toward where Bates and Cash were seen to enter the mine, or were supposed to have entered."

"The charge brought against them was that of 'breaking the Sabbath' contrary to the dignity of the State.

"A lawyer, Mr. Wood, kindly volunteered his service to defend the accused, although the judge had approached him previous to the trial asking him to prosecute the cases, which he politely declined, saying he did 'not want to be mixed up in a piece of dirty spite work.'

"The judge called the boys up and without trial or motion fined them three dollars and costs, to which Mr. Wood objected, stating that they had not been convicted yet of a misdemeanor, and waived the examination to the circuit court, to which the judge objected, refusing them the right of appeal. He also absolutely refused to accept a certified bond for their appearance at the next term of court.

"They refused to pay the fine and the judge issued a mittimus for their confinement, whereupon Mr. Wood notified his honor, that if that was his ultimatum, he, Mr. Wood, would prosecute him, the judge, for denying them that which the law accorded to any and all defendants. So after a few hours' consideration the judge permitted them to give bond, which they did at once, and now are free until the first Monday in September next.

"We hope to quash the thing at the Grand Jury sitting. We have friends but many times they are afraid to stand against a popular tide.

"The boys are of good courage and exercise good judgment in the matter.

"We might add that not less than thirty men were at work within a mile of the Judge's door that same day, and nothing was said to them.

"We will keep you posted as to the matter.

"GRANT ADKINS."
