**Observations.**

BY CHAS. L. MANNING.

The wretched temporal, mental and moral condition of the populace of Spain and her colonies, which have for centuries been united with the Roman Catholic Church, is incontrovertible proof that that religion does not elevate.

When the pope said, "What the papacy has done for other countries, it will do for the United States," he unwittingly presented the best possible argument against the papacy and its supremacy in this country.

The principles of the United States Constitution or those of common honesty are of no consideration and are brushed aside when they stand in the way of those who are devoted to the self-imposed work of "national holiness" by law.

If the church had sufficient faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and should say unto the mountain of Infidelity, "Be thou removed," it would be removed.

The Sunday "Sabbatarians" content themselves with asserting that "Jesus changed the Sabbath day," but offer no Scriptural proof to support the assertion. The Lord is unchangeable—"the same yesterday, to-day, and forever."

With religious fidelity the Sunday schools gather regularly on the first day of the week, and repeat in unison the commandment which says, "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

God says, "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord:" the church people claim the first day is the "Christian Sabbath." Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity and "Lord of the Sabbath," kept the seventh day "according to the commandment," that the "law might be fulfilled." The Christianity that insists upon keeping holy a day not commanded by the "Lord of the Sabbath," must be a different brand of Christianity from that instituted by Christ, for it makes him a liar, by denying his teachings.

The Roman Catholics deny that they worship idols but say that instead, they worship the object which the image symbolizes. They, however, fail to explain why it would not be just as easy to worship the object in the first place without the aid of the images as beads. A religious principle which requires that something be fashioned by the hands of man to keep him reminded of the object of his worship, certainly cannot have much power of spirituality inherent within itself.

"This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world," . . . "and the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it not."

"Equal rights to all"—there is no broader liberty under heaven than this.

"War is hell," and it is hard to comprehend why the churches have any part in the fray, outside of relieving the distress of the combatants.
