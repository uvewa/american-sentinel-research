NOR does it appear that the captain of the "Texas" was himself under any necessity of fighting on the Sunday when the Spanish fleet came out of Santiago harbor; for the Spanish were only bent on escape, and the American ships might have allowed them to do so without themselves suffering any harm. That, to be sure, would have called for a court-martial by the military authorities; but if battles are to be fought with due regard to the supposed will of God for the observance of Sunday, that will and not the will of the naval board or other human authority, must, in case of conflict, be regarded. In this case the captain must assume that he was justified in fighting on Sunday merely to prevent the enemy's escape.
