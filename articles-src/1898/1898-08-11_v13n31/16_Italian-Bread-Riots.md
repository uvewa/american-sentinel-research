THE late "bread riots"—so-called—in Italy, had, it appears, a deep significance. They were, it is said, nothing less than an effort of the clerical party to produce a revolution, inaugurate a republic, and by it reëstablish the temporal sovereignty of the pope. A German paper of Leipsic states that the Italian government holds the Catholic Church responsible for the disturbances, and that the relation between church and state will be even more strained than it has been for some years past. Thus the pretended vicar of the "Prince of Peace" appears in the character of a disturber of the peace, a promoter of discord and revolution; for the action of the clerical party stands for the action of the pope.
