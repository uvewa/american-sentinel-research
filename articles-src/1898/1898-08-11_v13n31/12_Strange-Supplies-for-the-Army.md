Not long ago this statement appeared in the Cincinnati Evening Post: "The quartermaster of the commissary department on Third Street, Friday, gave Father Pustat's Catholic Supply House the contract for making 5,000 rosaries for the army." Amazing as this statement is, it may well be credited in view of the strong tendency in this nation, attested by indisputable facts, toward union of church and state.

If, as is asserted upon high legal authority, "this is a Christian nation," it is the proper business of the nation to observe all Christian practices; and if rosaries are necessary to any such observance, it is the duty of the nation to provide them. The Catholic Church says that they are necessary, and Roman Catholic "Christianity" has as good claim to be called the religion of the nation as has any other. Providing the army with rosaries is a proceeding that comes in naturally enough behind the "Christian nation" decision of the Supreme Court.
