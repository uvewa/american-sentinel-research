The following words, sound, and good, and true, are an extract from a sermon by W. L. Pickard, Cleveland, Ohio, taken from the Baptist Reflector. May there be many thousands of such speakers:—

"I believe that the living God rules in the historic march of the ages. He was present to bless the 'Declaration of Independence.' I think he was guiding the intellect that thought out and framed the Constitution of these United States. But I hope that we, as a people, will never put God in the Constitution by congressional enactment. Why not? you ask. Because I believe in the everlasting separation of church and state. And whatever is put in the Constitution by legislative enactment may become the subject of further legislation. Then in the far-off years, or perhaps not so far off, some dominant influence in the name of religion might define the God who is in the Constitution and decree the form of worship to be rendered him. Then would come again the awful struggle between church and state—the struggle between conscience, freedom and legal tyranny. Putting God in the Constitution of the United States will not put him in the hearts and consciences of the people. Christians are not made by legislative enactments of parliaments and congresses, but by the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit."
