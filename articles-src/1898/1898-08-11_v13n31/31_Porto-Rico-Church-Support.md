THE CONTACT OF TWO SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT SO OPPOSITE IN CHARACTER AS THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES AND SPAIN, IS PRODUCTIVE OF CURIOUS INCIDENTS. ONE OF THESE HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY IN THE ISLAND OF PORTO RICO, WHICH IS NOW COMING UNDER AMERICAN RULE. THE BOSTON HERALD, OF AUGUST 2, MAKES THIS MENTION OF IT:

"Chaplain Chidwick, of the 'Cincinnati,' formerly of the 'Maine,' introduced to General Wilson this morning two of the leading Jesuits of Ponce, representing a thousand churches and their dependents in this province. The priests wanted information regarding their support, and General Wilson said that under the Constitution of the United States it was not possible to apply any governmental money for church purposes. Father Chidwick said it would be all the better for the church if its own people learned to contribute to its support."

Perhaps General Wilson has not heard of the late $288,000 gift by Congress to the Methodist Church, or of other appropriations to the Catholic and other religious bodies in this country. But he stated the constitutional principle correctly.
