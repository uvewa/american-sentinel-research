UNDER THE NEW LAW OF PENNSYLVANIA WHICH MAKES IT A FELONY TO INSULT OR DEGRADE THE AMERICAN FLAG, THE FIRST VIOLATION, SAYS THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, OF AUGUST 3, WAS COMMITTED BY THE "FAITH HEALER," FRANCIS SCHLATTER, WHO TORE DOWN AND DESTROYED A FLAG AT THE KEYSTONE HOTEL, IN THAT CITY; FOR WHICH CRIME HE NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING MOBbed. THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF HEALING BEING DONE THESE DAYS THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SPIRIT OF HOSTILITY TO AMERICAN PRINCIPLES OF FREE GOVERNMENT, FOR WHICH "OLD GLORY" STANDS. THE TRUE RELIGION WILL NEVER PROMPT AN INSULT TO THE FLAG.
