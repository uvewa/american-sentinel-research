THE RELIGIOUS DEMONSTRATIONS MADE ON BOARD THE BATTLESHIPS BEFORE SANTIAGO, IN CONNECTION WITH THE VICTORY OVER THE SPANISH, HAVING GIVEN RISE TO SOME INVIDIOUS COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE COMMANDERS, ONE OF THESE, THE CAPTAIN OF THE "IOWA," HAS FELT CALLED UPON TO EXONERATE HIMSELF FROM THE CHARGE OF AN APPARENT LACK OF PIETY. HE GIVES THE FOLLOWING REASON FOR NOT SUMMONING HIS CREW TO A RELIGIOUS SERVICE OF PRAYER AND PRAISE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SANGUINARY ENGAGEMENT WHICH DESTROYED THE SPANISH FLEET:

"I found my ship surrounded by boats carrying dying and wounded prisoners and others of the crew of the 'Vizcaya' to the number of 250. To leave these men to suffer for want of food and clothing while I called my men aft to offer prayers was not my idea of either Christianity or religion. I preferred to clothe the naked, feed the hungry, and succor the sick, and I am strongly of the opinion that God has not put a black mark against me on account of it."

Beyond question the captain of the "Iowa" is fully qualified religiously to command his ship.
