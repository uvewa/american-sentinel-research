This illustrates, the difference between real rest and that "rest" which is forced upon people by law. The law makes a man rest by refusing to let him work. It binds him so that he can do nothing else, just as the man strapped to his couch could do nothing else but lie on it. But is there any real rest in that? Experience answers, No. The uppermost feeling is not that of rest, but of restraint.

Let it be optional with an individual either to rest or work, and he will rest if he feels like doing so; but forbid him to work, merely to make him rest, and instinctively he will feel a desire to work. We are not supposing the case of an invalid, but of a man in ordinary health.

The Sabbath comes each week to bring man rest; but Sabbath rest does not mean a condition of enforced idleness. The Bible Sabbath is "the Sabbath [or rest] of the Lord," and is therefore spiritual; and being spiritual, it can be enjoyed only by the spiritual mind. So plainly is this true that it is recognized even by some zealous workers for Sunday enforcement. They have said, Take religion out of the Sabbath, and you take the rest out. And they still affirm this to be true.

The Sabbath rest, then, must be voluntary, both because religion must be voluntary, and because there is no rest in restraint. Hence all "Sabbath laws" upon human statute books are but sources of evil.
