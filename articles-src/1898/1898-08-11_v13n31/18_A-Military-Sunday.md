"Signs of the Times." July 28.

THE Christian Work has the following suggestive note:—

"Still another special Sunday—a temperance Sunday—has been set aside by the General Assembly. With fifty-one special Sundays, we shall still have one Sunday left for the stated preaching of the Word. We hope it will be a clear, bright, radiant Sunday, where the blue of the sky and emerald of the grass greet each other in ecstatic joy."

Why not make that Sunday a special day for patriotic services? Do not our Sunday friends know that all the telling events of the war thus far have occurred on Sunday? May 1, Sunday, Commodore Dewey won his victory at Manila; July 3, Sunday, Commodore Schley won his victory at the mouth of Santiago harbor; July 10, Sunday, the joint bombardment of Santiago by army and navy began; on July 17, Sunday, Santiago surrendered to General Shafter; and on the same date, Sunday, the Cabinet met and laid their plans for the invasion and capture of Porto Rico. Surely, why not have in the "church calendar" a military Sunday? Providence does not seem to be against the Sunday fighting of Americans. Why should there not be a military Sunday set apart for a memorial of these victories? The idea is absurd, of course, but not more absurd than many other things in this military-religious-political régime which so many enthusiastic "reformers" are endeavoring to have the country adopt.
