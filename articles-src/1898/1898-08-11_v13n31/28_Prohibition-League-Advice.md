THE ORGAN OF THE PROHIBITION LEAGUE OF WILLIAMSPORT, PA., heads the first article in its issue of July 15 with the words, "Don't swear! Fight!"

From a financial standpoint, this is good advice, at least for this locality; for profanity is punished by a fine, while fighting to kill is something that stamps one a hero. But from the Christian standpoint, it is to be observed that the same law which says, "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain," says also, "Thou shalt not kill."
