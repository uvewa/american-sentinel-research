CAPTAIN PHILIP, of the battleship "Texas," who said that the combatant who begins a fight on Sunday always gets defeated, is reported as defending his statement by the assertion that at Manila, the first shot was fired by the Spanish admiral, and not by Commodore Dewey. But what was the Spanish admiral, under such circumstances, to do? His ships were at anchor in the bay, as a good Sunday-observing fleet should have been, and the American fleet was bearing down upon him under full sail, and only waiting to get within range before sending a broadside against him from their loaded guns. Commodore Dewey had given word to Captain Gridley, of the "Olympia," "You may fire, Gridley, when you are ready." Was he waiting for the Spanish admiral to fire the first shot? These points only need be mentioned to demonstrate that the responsibility for that Sunday battle lay wholly with the victorious Dewey.
