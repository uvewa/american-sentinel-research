I wonder how many of the youthful readers of the SENTINEL can really tell for what reason the Creator gave them a conscience.

And how many can tell what a person ought to do with his conscience?

Ought you to be master of your conscience? or should your conscience be master of you?

Some people try to quiet their conscience when it reproves them for a thing they have done, instead of correcting the wrong as conscience tells them. They seem to think they will be better off with a sleeping or a dead conscience than with one that is alive and wide-awake. But what is the right condition for every conscience to be in?

Of how much value do you think conscience is to you? Did you ever see a person who had no conscience at all, or almost none? And if so, did you envy him? Try to imagine what this world would be like if the people in it possessed no consciences.

Like every other thing that is of great value, conscience ought to be carefully cherished. And being a faculty of the mind, it must grow and become educated as the mind develops. But how ought it to be educated? Should it be by what men say; by the maxims of the world and the traditions that have come down to us from the past? Or is there some other and better way for it than this? and what is it?

When you go contrary to your conscience, because some person tells you to do so, what are you really giving up? If a law should be passed telling you to do a certain way, and your conscience should tell you differently, how much would you really surrender if you should yield your conscience?

How much do you think any person could serve the Lord without the aid of his conscience? Could any one who should surrender his conscience exercise faith?

The Bible tells us that whatsoever we do, we should do it not merely unto men, but unto the Lord. Now if you should surrender the conscience which God gave you, could you do anything unto the Lord? What do you say to this?

But is your conscience, or anybody's conscience, the standard of right and wrong? Could you say that your conscience told you to do a thing that interfered with some one's rights? Some people have said this, but it did not justify them. It was really not their conscience, but something else, that led them to do such things. God is the author of both conscience and rights, and he never made two things that conflict with each other. When conscience and law come in conflict, an appeal must be made to an authority which is higher than either, and that is the Word of the Creator.

The principle of the Golden Rule will always settle any seeming conflict between conscience and individual rights.
