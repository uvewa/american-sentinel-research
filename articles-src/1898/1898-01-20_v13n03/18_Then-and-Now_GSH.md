When Peter took the sword to defend his Master, the first and only thing he did was to cut off the high priest's servant's right ear. When Christians take up the sword to-day in defense of their Master's cause, the first and only thing they can or will do is to cut off the High Priest's (Christ, Heb. 6:14) servant's right ear, which is the ear of faith; leaving the church deaf to the things of God: as it is written, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." But it was the work of Christ to restore that important member. "Now, then, we are ambassadors for Christ;" and as such, we should be found "laborers together with God."
