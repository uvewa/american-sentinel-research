LORD CHARLES BERESFORD, one of the most prominent men connected with English naval affairs, is quoted in the London papers as saying on the subject of fighting and fighters:

"The best fighting men were the 'scallywags' of society, amongst whom he placed himself. He did not wish to be misunderstood, and he therefore mentioned that in his youth he was a boy who robbed orchards, who hated the idea of life at the desk, and to whom the prospect of a career in the army or navy was always most attractive. It was such men, he believed, who made soldiers and sailors."

This eminent authority on the subject no doubt tells the truth.
