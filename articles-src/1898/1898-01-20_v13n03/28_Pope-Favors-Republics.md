THERE is news just now of a rather strange and startling character from Italy. The pope, it is said, has made a pronouncement in favor of republics. This is contrary to the traditional policy of the papacy, which has always favored monarchical government. This pronouncement is made in the *Civilta Cattolica*, the official organ of the papacy in Italy, in an article which is referred to as "evidently inspired."

THE article says that the co-existence in Rome of the Vatican and the Italian monarchy is not possible, and that one or the other of them must go. Which means, of course, that the monarchy must go, since the pope has no intention of going himself. The article says that there are many examples to prove that national unity may exist in other forms, and cites the republics of Switzerland and the United States as illustrations. There is in this no flattering significance as regards this "land of the free."

AT this date, looking back at events which have transpired within recent years, it is not very difficult to see why the papacy has come to look with favor upon a republic. Traditionally, as stated, the policy of the papacy has been in favor of monarchy. The republics which are upon the earth to-day are of comparatively recent origin. They represented, at the time of their rise, a movement of the people away from long standing despotisms which had come down from the Middle Ages, in the direction of popular liberty. A republic—a "government of the people, by the people and for the people"—contained the promise of liberty for the people, both civil and religious. For this reason the papacy feared such a form of government, and stood against it.

BUT the papacy has discovered that things were not really so bad as it feared. It has discovered that even a republic may be "run" upon papal principles; that indeed the greatest republic of modern times is conducted upon lines which afford no real guaranty of that religious freedom to which she stands opposed. She has discovered that the United States Constitution, as now interpreted, is not the formidable document she thought it was; so that she has instructed her adherents to go forth to the spread of papal principles, bearing a copy of this Constitution in their hands. The pope was not long since assured by Mr. Burke Cochrane, a Catholic and one of the most prominent of American politicians, that church and state are not really divorced in this country, but are in fact firm supporters of each other. He sees too that an untiring effort is being made in this republic to secure as close a union of church and state as was ever known in the papacy's palmiest days. What wonder then that Rome has lost her fear of republican government. But how will the suggestion of an Italian republic be received by the crowned heads of Europe? This remains to be seen; though we may be sure that the papacy always feels her ground before she treads on it.
