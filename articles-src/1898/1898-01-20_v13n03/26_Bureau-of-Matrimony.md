Among the various schemes and ideas which have of late been sprung upon the public in the name of reform by law, is that of the establishment by Congress of a "bureau of matrimony," to rest upon a law to be passed making marriage compulsory upon all persons of marriageable age. As yet, this innovation has not a very strong backing, the visible power behind it consisting of one determined woman, by name Mrs. Charlotte Smith. Just what reasons the latter is able to set out in support of her proposition, we have not yet learned; but doubtless they are as numerous and quite as weighty as those urged in behalf of other proposed reforms with which the public have long been familiar.

It might be said in its support, for instance, that man was not created to live by himself, and that the married state is the one ordained for him by the Creator; and this is certainly true. Therefore it might be argued that, as a general rule, it is the duty of all persons of marriageable age to get married; and this being so, that there ought to be a law to make them do it. Statistics might be invoked to show—as they unquestionably do show—that criminals are proportionately more numerous among the unmarried part of the population than among the married; and hence it would be clear that by increasing the proportion of married people there would be secured a diminution in the amount of crime. And it will not be questioned that the prevention of crime is one of the chief ends of civil government.

THAT is the way people argue in support of some other and quite popular reforms, and the argument holds just as good in the one case as in the other. It is upon just this line of argument that the great movement for "Sabbath reform" rests. It was ordained that man should keep the Sabbath; and if all men would do this, the benefit to society would be incalculable. Crime and the evils which spring from human depravity would disappear as if by magic. Therefore, say the promoters of the movement, let us have laws which will oblige all people to keep the Sabbath. Their "logic" involves the same mistake that is involved in the idea of a compulsory marriage law,—a mistake which is fatal to the success of the scheme as a means of promoting the welfare of mankind.

THE mistake turns upon the point of compulsion. Marriage was not ordained as a state to be entered into by compulsion; and neither was the Sabbath so ordained. A person who marries under compulsion makes the poorest kind of a marriage partner, and the poorest exhibition of Sabbath keeping is furnished by the one who observes the day against his own free will. Unless his heart and soul are in it, the individual himself is not in it; and then the thing itself, whether marriage or Sabbath keeping, becomes only hypocrisy and sham.

THE trouble with Mrs. Smith's scheme of reform by enforced matrimony is not in the scheme itself, but in the principle on which it is based. It would be all right to compel people to get married, if the principle of reform by the force of law were a sound one. But it is not; and whenever this principle is embodied in a scheme of reform, things are made worse than they were before. This is the only result that can ever follow in such a case.

BUT although this is as plain as a b c, the efforts made to reform the city, state, and nation by law still keep up, and are becoming more widespread than ever. Morally, the world is moving backward, not forward.
