THE state of Ohio has just passed through an acute attack of politics, which, while it has not furnished the rest of the country with a very edifying spectacle, has given the observer a fair idea of what politics can become under the developing influence of nineteenth century civilization.

THE most conspicuous thing in this contest was the open and specific charge of bribery made by the leaders of one political faction against the successful candidate for the office of United States senator. The latter having escaped defeat by a single vote, the President says that in his victory "all right-minded people will rejoice;" whereupon a prominent politician of the state makes reply to the President that his words are an "insult to every honest man in the United States." This is bad enough, certainly; but what would it have been if all the preachers in the state had been involved in the contest, imparting to it a distinctly religious character? Certainly it would have been worse, in such a case, than it was.
