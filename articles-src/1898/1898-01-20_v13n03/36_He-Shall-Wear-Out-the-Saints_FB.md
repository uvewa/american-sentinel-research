"WELL, Charlie, what is the next specification in the prophecy concerning the papal power?"

"He . . . shall wear out the saints of the Most High," read Charlie.

"What does it mean to wear out anything, Charlie?"

"Why, mama, I should think you would know when you have a boy like me. See here, my knees are almost coming through my pants, and they will soon need another patch."

"Well, how did you wear them out?"

"Why, just by wearing them out, by giving them a knock here, and a scuff there, by tumbling, climbing, and scuffling at school, by straining and tearing, you know, mama."

"Then you did not do it all in a minute?"

"No. I did it by slow processes, as it were."

"All right. How did the papacy wear out the saints of the Most High?"

"By keeping at them. By all sorts of persecutions. I'll show you," said Charlie, taking "Foxe's Book of Martyrs" from the shelf. "Look at these pictures, and you'll see. Here is a man on the rack. They would rack him for awhile, and then if he would not recant, and be a hypocrite, they would put him in a cell for a few days and rack him again. They hung heretics up by the thumbs, burned them at the stake, baked them in slow ovens, sealed them up in the walls of buildings, flayed them and rubbed them with salt, pulled out their tongues, and seared out their eyes. O mama, it is dreadful to think of the way in which men used to be tortured. The martyrs must have had a living connection with God, and have known real help, or they never could have stood true to truth. How glad I am it's all over."

Mrs. Ross sighed and looked troubled. "All you have described is wonderfully real and vivid to me; for I have visited places in London, and in other parts of the world, where men were burned at the stake, and where these very tortures were enacted. I stood on the very spot at Smithfield, London, where some of the most godly men were burned at the stake for their faith, and entered the old Norman cathedral opposite the spot, at the door of which the priest stood holding up the crucifix, and urging the martyr to recant ere the flame touched him."

"I should think the sight of Christ dying on the cross would have helped the martyr to die for him. How very inconsistent it was to hold up the crucifix for such a purpose!"

"After visiting Smithfield I went to Madame Tussaud's wax-work exhibition, and there in 'the chamber of horrors' saw a very realistic representation of the Inquisition.

"For weeks after seeing that horrible sight, I felt nervous and frightened when alone; but now I am glad that I visited the chamber of horrors. There are many places in the world where you may still see frightful instruments of torture. At Nuremburg is a building given up to a diabolical display of torture instruments. Even in this generation buildings have been torn down in Spain, whose double walls were found packed with the skeletons of martyrs. The whole earth is sprinkled with the graves of those who died because they chose Christ for their heart's king, and would not permit self in any form to wield the scepter."

"Mama, how many martyrs do you suppose there were?"

"The very lowest estimate given by history is fifty millions. But I think with others that it is more than likely that they never will be numbered till the earth discloses her dead. Now I want you to read a few scriptures just to see by what figures the prophet describes the blotting out of the saints of God. What is to cover the earth? Read Isa. 62:2."

Charlie read: "For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people."

"When darkness covers the earth, what do we call the time?"

"Night time," said Charlie.

"The darkness spoken of here is spiritual darkness, or spiritual night.

"What appears in the sky at night?"

"The moon and stars," said Charlie.

"Why do the moon and stars give light?"

"The moon and the planets reflect the sun's light; the stars are suns in themselves."

"For carrying out the figure, we will call the moon and the stars or planets that reflect light, the people of God. Our Saviour is the Sun of Righteousness, and the moon and stars of God are those who shed his light into earth's spiritual night.

"What does the prophet declare shall be seen upon God's people?"

"The glory of God."

"What is God's glory?"

"You told me once," said Charlie, "that it was his love. Moses prayed, Show me thy glory, and God said he would let his goodness pass before him."

"Then what is to appear on the people of God?"

"The goodness or character of God."

"What did Jesus say his people were to be in the world's darkness?"

"The light of the world."

"But if the spiritual condition is one that may be compared to darkness or night, what may God's people be compared to?"

"To the moon and stars."

"Now, Charlie, you may read in the eighth chapter of Daniel another prophecy that brings out the manner in which the horn was to war against God's light-bearers."

Charlie read the 10th verse: "And it waxed great even to the hosts of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground. Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host."

"You can see how the horn warred against the stars of God, and gather from the violence of the figure that there was a deep-set malignity back of its action. What does the name 'Lucifer' mean?"

"Light bearer," said Charlie.

"Yes. You remember in one of our first talks how Lucifer shed the light of God's glory throughout heaven, and that through self exaltation he lost his light and his position, and was cast out. You can see by the scriptures we have read that God has chosen us, who have been the captives of Satan, to become his light bearers, and take the place of the great angel who lost his first estate. O how Lucifer hates us when we shed abroad the glory of love, of which he is now incapable,—when we believe God's Word and follow the footsteps of Him who is meek and lowly in heart. It is this malignant spirit of jealousy that is behind all persecution, that bids the horn tear down the stars of God, and stamp them out."

"But persecution did not blot out the people of God," said Charlie. "I read somewhere that the fagot was like a taper that lit up other stars, and that when a martyr died, his ashes were like seed that sprang up in a great harvest of souls."

"That is true, Charlie, praise God. No one can do anything against the truth. But the object of the persecution was the blotting out of God's people. The privilege of becoming God's light bearers is too sacred, too dear, too full of heavenly joy, to be lightly given up. Once let a soul catch a glimpse of the glory of God, and realize that that glory may be seen upon him, and death itself loses its terrors. Besides the promise is sure that we shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck us out of the hand of omnipotent Love."

"But, mama, how was it that the papacy had power to persecute the people of God? It doesn't have that power to-day. Why, there's liberty everywhere. You know our Constitution says that Congress shall make no law respecting religion, or to hinder the free exercise thereof. What could any church do in the way of open persecution in the world to-day?"

"It certainly does not look as if it could do anything; but in the Dark Ages the Catholic Church could command the power of the state. God's plan is to keep the state and church separate; but Satan's plan is to put into the hands of the church the power of the state, so that he, through a perverted church, can control the faith of men, or at least make them conform to certain outward standards. Satan would like to run the world through one mold, — the self-mold. Whenever the world consents to his scheme of government, and he is always alert to push it on the world, then persecution can be carried on under the sacred name of law, and then God's saints are treated as was their Master, who was known as one of the malefactors."

"But, mama, why is it that the people of the past had to endure all this, while to-day we have things so pleasant? It doesn't seem quite fair."

"Every generation has its own test. But we will answer this question more fully at another time. I will give you one text, however, to think about. The apostle says, 'Yea, and all who will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.' The image of Christ is too faintly traced in those who profess his name to provoke enmity from him who was the murderer of the Son of God. When the image is clear, your question will receive the answer of ages. But we have talked a long time; let us close with prayer."

Mrs. Ross prayed fervently that they might reflect the glory of God, and be strengthened to bear all the consequences. Then they sang together—

"Be Thou my pattern, let me bear,
More of Thy gracious image here;
Then God the Judge shall own my name,
Among the followers of the Lamb."

"There is just one thought more, Charlie. The great day of vindication is at hand. Very soon the martyred hosts will hear the voice of the Life-giver. John saw these hosts of God, and said, 'These are they who have come up through great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.'

"Let us wash our robes, my boy, and be made white; then we shall be tried, and after the cross will come the crown."
F. B.
