THE Cradock Register (South Africa), in a recent issue printed the following item of "reform" news:—

"THE SABBATH.—The Rev. Mr. Murray, Moderator of the Dutch Reformed Church, in Natal, has addressed a letter to Afrikanders, expressing his sympathy with those who have suffered great losses through rinderpest. He considers the plague as a punishment for sins; the main transgression of the country being the violation of the Sabbath. 'Not only is the Sabbath considered as a "visiting" day by many, but even inoculation of cattle is being performed on that day.' The Transvaal Volksraad has decreed that officials shall in future be compelled to attend divine service on Sundays."

The Transvaal legislature is noted for its "whole-souled" way of doing things, and the present instance is no exception. Having set out to reform the community by law on the point of Sunday observance, the members of this body do not stop with any half-way measures, but decree that "officials shall in future be compelled to attend divine service on Sundays." They see that attendance at the churches is the ultimate step in this reform, and this is just what is seen by the promoters of the Sunday-observance movement here; but the latter are governed less by logic and more by policy.

But the logic of the Sunday law movement is the same here that it is in South Africa. The logic does not stop short of a decree compelling the people "to attend divine service on Sundays."
