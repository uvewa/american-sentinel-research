The Constitution of the United States declares that "neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."

This being so, the millions who are in the bondage of "Sunday slavery," about which so much is now said by the advocates of Sunday laws, have a plain remedy for their situation in an appeal to the fundamental law of the land.

Why, then, is not the Constitution invoked by somebody for this purpose? For that it never has been appealed to as a remedy for "Sunday slavery" is an evident fact, although the agitators for Sunday laws are not in ignorance of its provisions.

The plain reason is that these agitators know very well that the Sunday work about which they are talking is not slavery at all. They know that there is not a court in the land that would for a moment sustain the idea that the anti slavery provision of the Constitution had any application to such labor.

This "slavery" is a myth. There is a great deal of moral slavery in the land, but only the gospel of God can deliver any person from that.
