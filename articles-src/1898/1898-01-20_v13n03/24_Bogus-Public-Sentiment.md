On this subject the Detroit Free Press, in a recent issue, speaks as follows:—

"One of the most pronounced nuisances in either branch of Congress is the 'petition fiend' who devotes himself to 'creating public sentiment' by sending out great quantities of blank petitions for various purposes to religious and other organizations for signature. Upon being filled out, these forms are returned to the sender who dumps them in on the senators and representatives from the districts in which the signers reside. Just for present Senators McMillan and Burrows are suffering from an inundation of petitions ostensibly from Michigan religious organizations urging reforms in the morals of the people of the District of Columbia, including the abolition of the sale of intoxicating liquors in public buildings, the raising of the age of consent, and the observance of a puritanical Sabbath. A large number of these petitions are regularly put in circulation, collected and delivered to the senators by Wilbur F. Crafts, a gentleman who seems to find the employment most congenial. As neither branch of Congress regards the question covered as pertinent, and citizens of the District of Columbia regard them as exceedingly impertinent, the senators hope the flow of petitions can be diminished somewhat by an exposition of the methods employed in obtaining them."

Our correspondent who sends us the above adds the following by way of illustration:—

"I was present at a Sunday evening service in a town in Michigan several months since, when one of these petitions referred to was presented. The minister read it. The motion was made and seconded. The house was full. About six, or such a matter, voted in favor, none against. Result, as declared by the pastor in charge, 'Carried by the unanimous vote of the members of the First M. E. Church, at Memphis, Mich.'"
