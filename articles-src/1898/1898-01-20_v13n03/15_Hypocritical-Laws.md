The New York World, of the 12th inst., alludes to the operation of the excise and Sunday laws under the new Tammany administration, and says that "President York, of the Police Board, expressed the true idea in saying that the excise and Sunday laws should be 'broadly construed and liberally enforced.'"

We want no laws that have to be construed and enforced in this way. We want laws that are plain in their meaning, that mean what they say, and that will be enforced in exact accordance with their wording. Anything less than this can be only hypocrisy and fraud.
