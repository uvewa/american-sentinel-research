The people of the Friendly Island Kingdom claim that their constitution grants religious liberty. Doubtless those who framed and adopted it aimed to have the principles on which governmental action is based, such as would be restrictive to the rightful liberties of none. It is evident that the design was to exclude all class legislation, and permit the enacting of only such laws as could be enforced alike upon all. It reads:—

"There shall be but one law in Tonga for chiefs and commoners, for Europeans and Tongans. No law shall be enacted for one class and not for another class, but the law shall be the same for all the people of this land."
—Declaration of Rights, Art. 4.

This constitution then declares religious liberty for all in the following terms:—

"All men are free to practice their religion and to worship God as they may deem fit in accordance with the dictates of their own conscience, and to assemble for religious service as they may appoint."—Art. 5.

The remainder of this article prescribes the limits of this freedom. It says:—

"But it shall not be lawful to use this freedom to commit evil and licentious acts, or under the name of worship to do what is contrary to the law and peace of the land."

Any government has a right to restrict all acts that are an infringement on the rights of others. While the framers of this constitution, doubtless, intended that it should grant to all full religious freedom, yet it is apparent upon close examination that it falls somewhat short of this. Let us see. The article immediately following the one quoted above, is restrictive of religious freedom. It reads:—

"The Sabbath day shall be sacred in Tonga forever, and it shall not be lawful to do work or play games or trade on the Sabbath. And any agreement made or document witnessed on this day shall be counted void and shall not be recognized by the government."—Art. 6.*

Why cannot legislators see that the Sabbath is a religious institution, and that a man has a right to keep it as such or to disregard it entirely? True religious liberty involves the right to be a Sabbath-keeper or a Sabbath-breaker. Is it not the privilege of every individual to keep any day he chooses? It certainly is. If, then, he chooses to keep some other day than the one declared to be forever sacred by the constitution of Tonga, must he in addition to it observe the day enjoined by that constitution? If so, he by no means enjoys religious freedom. Should he labor on the day that the constitution declares sacred, and on which it says that no work shall be done, then he would be charged with doing that which is unlawful and contrary to the peace of the land. So we see at once that the exercise of religious freedom is curtailed by the highest law of the land. It is very evident that no such law should compose a part of any governmental constitution. It is civil power entering the domain of God given individual freedom.

If the individual conscientiously observes another day than the one enjoined by the government, and then is compelled by the civil power to observe in addition the one commanded by its constitution, he is taxed fifty-two days per year for his religious convictions, without the least benefit to the government. Counting his time at the moderate sum of one dollar and a half per day, he virtually loses seventy-eight dollars each year, and all because he chooses to worship God according to the dictates of his conscience.

No, no; any government that enjoins Sabbath observance upon its constituents does not grant religious liberty. The Lord gives a man the liberty of choosing between good and evil; but civil government does not propose to do this in the matter of Sabbath-keeping. The Lord says: "See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil." "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve." Deut. 30:15; Josh. 24:15.

The lack of knowledge as to what constitutes true liberty has made the martyrs' graves. A man may know considerable about religious liberty; that is, about the privileges granted by the civil power respecting the practice of any religion; and he may live under a government that grants him this liberty to the fullest degree; and yet he may be an absolute stranger to true liberty. True or Christian liberty does not come from civil government. It emanates from a higher source. The choosing or rejecting of it involves life or death. Christ, the author of life, is the only one who has power to give life. The Word, in speaking of Christ, says, "Whoso findeth me findeth life." Prov. 8:35. This liberty, which is the freedom of soul from the slavery of sin, is within the reach of all. All are born into this world the servants of sin. Said the patriarch David: "Behold I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me." Ps. 51:5. Said the Saviour, "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." John 8:34. Reader, are you in the slavery of sin? Do you desire to be set free? Here is the remedy. "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." John 8:32. It is the truth brought into the inner sanctuary of the soul that sets the captive free.

Now, when the divine law enjoins the observance of the seventh day of the week, and civil government demands obedience to the first, which will the Christian obey? He has tasted the pardoning love of the Infinite One, his soul is free, and he feels that he must stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made him free. Gal. 5:1. It matters not whether he dwells in a dungeon or a palace, he will maintain his allegiance to the divine government, and through obedience to the immutable law of God keep his name recorded in the book of life.

How unjust and cruel for earthly governments to enforce a law upon their constituents which is diametrically opposed to freedom of soul, and squarely in opposition to the divine law of God! O that those who are laboring in the interest of such a law could see from the light of God's Word what an evil thing they are doing. We trust some, at least, who are engaged in this wicked work, will find it hard to "kick against the pricks," and, like Saul of old, will be brought into harmony with the mandates of heaven, and find true liberty through the blood of Christ.

Tonga, Friendly Islands, South Pacific Ocean.

*This constitution was framed by Europeans, and adopted by both the European and native elements of the government. The European element, however, is the power behind the throne.
