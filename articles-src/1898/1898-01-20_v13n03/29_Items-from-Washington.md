UNDER date of January 15, our Washington correspondent sends us the following:—

"The prospect is good for the defeat of the Sunday bill in the Congressional Committee.

"The three daily papers in this city have declared themselves in favor of opening the National Library on Sunday.

"No bill for the 'God-in-the-Constitution' amendment has yet been offered. Such a bill would have no chance of passing."
