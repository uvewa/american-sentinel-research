These are days for laying bare the foundations, as well as making careful note of building material, that the actual relation between man and God, and man and his fellow man, may be determined and adjusted before the day of final examination dawns.

There are a few principles which were spread by the hand that framed all things, in unbroken layers of bed rock under the entire surface of humanity. Some of these have been "discovered" by social speculators; mined, quarried, and sold in the market to the loss of many, and the selfish gain of the few; and so perverted in their use that they have often become a source of despair instead of a basis of hope.

The more necessary anything is to the individual, the more that it is personal in its application, the more capable it is of arousing all the selfishness that is in human nature. If it is incapable of being safely divided into unequal portions, it is incapable of any safe division or apportionment, except such as naturally follows each man's appropriation for himself of what he needs.

This is true of air, water, heat, cold, food, love, happiness, liberty, salvation.

Among the greatest of these, because it is that upon which depends the power of appropriation and use, is that of liberty.

No other principle has been more diverted and perverted—in fact, it has ceased to be recognized as a principle. It has been made over into a luxury which only a favored class can afford, and in the enjoyment of which they do not hesitate to afflict the helpless.

This is not peculiar to our times. Paul saw the same evil, and gave warning when he said, "Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to them that are weak;" and Christ saw it, and made it the especial mission of his gospel to adjust these disputed claims which have been staked out over the world-wide field of personal liberty, and sold to the highest bidder, regardless. It is the work of the gospel to reveal that magnificent truth, that the personal character of liberty makes it as universal as life itself, and as sacred as the right to be.

A man may be so incapable of using, or may so abuse, his liberty as to forfeit it; but when this forfeiture takes place it must be to that individual or power that has suffered from such misuse.

Every human being is between two stones of responsibility,—his responsibility to God, and to man,—and if he has his rights, must be left alone to adjust his relations to each in his own way, and must take the consequences upon himself.

Whenever man, by law or undue influence of any sort, undertakes to interfere with man's relation to God, he assumes a prerogative which God has most sedulously avoided, for he does not attempt to meddle between man and man, except as he furnishes light to live and work by, and in his tender. Fatherly way gives instruction in principles, and gives help when it is desired in executing every benevolent purpose.

Imagine a family of children taking the law of the home into their own hands, and punishing each other for disregard of the father's requirements. Such conduct would be a reflection on the father's intelligence, to say the least. The only conditions that could warrant interference upon the part of one child between another one and the father, would be incapability in him to perform the duties of his office.

A great deal of human legislation is in the nature of this kind of selfish interference upon the part of one portion of the family between a strong, competent, and magnificent father, and other of his children. He has delegated all the power that men have any right to exercise over each other, and given plain instructions for its use between man and man; but as concerns all relations between himself and each individual, he has held everything in his own hands.

As between man and man, man must have certain limited rights of legislation, and all human relations can be safely adjusted and controlled by the power which God has delegated for that purpose if properly used, but our Father is still the Father in his own house. He has not delegated to any man or government the right to legislate between him and his. He is perfectly able to attend to each individual case; and for man to undertake to make laws which touch upon matters of conscientious belief, is the height of presumption.

A conviction of these truths was at the foundation of the recent effort which I made to call attention to the inconsistency of "Sabbath legislation" by any organization of Christians.
