The daily press has announced that the question of Sunday legislation will shortly be raised at Albany, by a bill to be introduced by Assemblyman Harburger.

This proposed bill will so amend the sections of the code which relate to the observance of Sunday as to permit baseball on the National League grounds, and almost every kind of show and sporting contest "between the hours of 8 and 11 o'clock in the evening."

This of course is simply to say that those whom the bill represents do not care a fig for any principle that may be involved in Sunday legislation, but only for the dollars which such legislation may shut out from their pockets. They are willing that honest business should be prohibited, and also innocent sports and pastimes except in such a way as will affect their own pecuniary interests.

It is not at all certain that the bill will pass; but it may be taken as a straw that shows which way the wind is blowing. It is clear that the cause of religious liberty has nothing to expect from this so-called "liberal" element on the ground of principle.

That cause has nothing to gain from a law which would wink at injustice, ignore consistency, and rest upon no foundation but that of selfish policy.
