THE war is ended; but the slaughter of the troops continues. There are some things that seems to be even more fatal to the troops than the guns of the enemy.

ALL accounts of army movements are full of tales of sickness and death from disease, exposure, and improper food, and the general impression is that there has been gross if not criminal incompetence displayed in the management of affairs relating to the health of the soldiers. Where the blame properly rests is of course a disputed question. No one has yet been found who is willing to shoulder the blame which, like Noah's dove, is seeking a resting place.

THE situation, however, has become too serious, and public indignation too strongly aroused, to be passed over in silence. The highest commanding officer, General Miles, is understood to have made serious charges against the Secretary of War and his assistants, and an investigation by court martial is expected to result. This is a phase of the war that does not seem to have been anticipated at the start.

THAT scores and perhaps hundreds of lives should have been sacrificed to official incompetence and military red tape is certainly a fact which reflects seriously upon the men in charge of the campaign. It has been affirmed that the United States was waging a Christian warfare; but the spirit of Christian helpfulness which was to be manifested toward the Cubans seems to have been quite absent in the treatment accorded the American troops themselves by the military authorities. And this only goes to show, with many other things, the hollowness of the claim that Christianity was exemplified in this carnal warfare.
