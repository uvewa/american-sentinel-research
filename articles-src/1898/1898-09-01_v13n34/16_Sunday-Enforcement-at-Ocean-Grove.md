Press reports state that at Ocean Grove, a summer resort on the New Jersey coast, a new commandment has gone into effect, namely, "Thou shalt not bathe on Sunday."

The Ocean City Association is the power behind this regulation. Its members have decided that bathing on Sunday is wrong, and have served injunctions on the proprietors of bathing establishments, restraining them from renting any bathing suits for Sunday use.

By what authority, higher than their own opinions, they justified such a course of action, it is not stated. In truth, there is no higher authority which could be cited in support of it. The Sunday enforcement movement can proceed just as far as bigotry and fanaticism are pleased to carry it, since it rests on nothing but the will of its supporters. The authority to take the last step in the enforcement of Sunday observance is exactly the same as that which was behind the first step. The heaviest penalty has the same justification as has the lightest.

This prohibition of Sunday bathing illustrates the real spirit of the whole movement. It is not for the "benefit of the poor workingman," but for the exaltation of a religious institution which depends upon human power for its support.
