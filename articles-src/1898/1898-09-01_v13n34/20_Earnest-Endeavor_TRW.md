THERE'S nought too great or noble for an earnest boy to do.

Just try as if you meant it and you'll push your project through.

However hard your task may be in this one truth confide,

Only try as if you meant it and you'll join the winning side.

Out of your youth you'll grow full soon to manhood's riper years;

Hold fast this trusty saying then, no odds what foe appears.

Make every effort count toward some pure and lofty aim,

Nor think true honor ever comes from any deed of shame.

A boy that tries with all his might to do good honest deeds

Shall keep his life and conscience white and God will fill his needs.
