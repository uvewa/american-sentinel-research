HE WHO IS HARSH IN GOVERNING OTHERS, SHOWS THAT HE HAS NOT YET LEARNED TO GOVERN HIMSELF.

WHEN JESUS CHRIST REPROVED HIS DISCIPLES FOR DISPUTING AS TO WHICH OF THEM SHOULD BE THE GREATEST, HE REBULKED POLITICS IN HIS CHURCH.

AN INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW WAS HELD RECENTLY AT THE HAGUE, HOLLAND, WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY MOST OF THE EMINENT AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE. ONE OF THE MOST NOTEWORTHY SPEECHES WAS THAT MADE BY THE PRESIDENT, IN WHICH HE DWELL UPON THE PROSPECTS FOR INTERNATIONAL AMITY. WE QUOTE FROM THE N. Y. SUN'S REPORT:

"IT COULD NOT BE DENIED, HE SAID, THAT THE DESIRE SHOWN BY ALMOST ALL STATES TO RENDER THEMSELVES INDEPENDENT OF THEIR NEIGHBORS AND INSURE MONOPOLIES TO DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES AND AGRICULTURE BY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE EXCLUDING FOREIGN PRODUCTS, DID NOT HALLY WITH THOSE SENTIMENTS OF SOLIDARITY WHICH MAKE AGREEMENT AMONG PEOPLES ON DIFFERENT POINTS POSSIBLE. BUT WHAT WAS STILL MORE SERIOUS AND AFFECTED THE OBJECTS OF SUCH BODIES AS THE INSTITUTE MORE MATERIALLY WAS THE FEVERISH DEVELOPMENT AMONG ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS OF THEIR ARMAMENTS. . . . WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE a pledge of peace, but, in any case, these means of defense developed to such a degree of perfection, denoted a feeling of mutual distrust and showed that the fear of violent solutions intensely occupied men's minds."

Such is the latest pronouncement from eminent authorities of the world upon the world's outlook for peace. Out of the carnal nature, out of the covetousness for territory and the lust for power, out of the arming for war, there cometh not peace. The world cannot know true peace because it knoweth not Him who is the Prince of Peace. But the Christian knows Him, and is at peace.
