**MR. EDITOR—**

Sir: I proceed to offer a few remarks on the office of the civil magistrate. This is an office of great antiquity and of great importance to the prosperity of society. All those persons in every State, who are appointed to execute the laws of the State are, in our language, called civil magistrates. Emperors, kings, presidents, and governors have been called the chief magistrate of the States over which they severally presided; justices of the peace and judges of courts have also received the name of magistrate. In all countries they are, or should be, men of excellent character, and fathers of the people. In a word they are, or should be, men selected and authorized by the people, to execute the laws under which they wish to be governed. The preservation of public tranquility, of life, liberty, reputation, and property, are the great purposes which originated this office. The civil magistrate is a State officer, and as such obliged to take into consideration the interests of the State, as far as this can be promoted by the most faithful execution of the laws committed to him.

In every State the powers of the magistrate should be, and commonly are, prescribed and limited in the commission which he receives, or the laws which institute the office. The corruption of men renders the existence of this office necessary, and consequently should define the duties of it.

Civil government and the church are institutions intended for the good of mankind; the one to promote his temporal, the other his eternal, good. The one to minister to his fleshly comforts, the other to advance his spiritual interests. They both emanate from the same fountain of authority (Rom. 13:1), and were dictated from the same principles of philanthropy. They are, however, as distinct as soul and body, and should be considered as distinct in their nature, properties, and operations. The office of the civil magistrate has existed in all countries, with and without an established religion. Savage nations, Mohammedans, pagans, and Christians have their civil magistrates, and, among all such, the office is a divine ordinance. Where there is, and where there is not, a church, the ordinance is the same. In Rome the constituted governor and magistracy, though heathen, and persecuting Christianity, was called, in Paul's time, even when a Nero and a Domitian sat on the throne, an ordinance of God, by that Spirit that can denominate nothing wrong. Yes, in the New Testament the heathen magistrates are called God's ministers, and he that resisteth them is said not to resist man but God.

Yes, the civil magistrate in all the nations upon the earth is appointed by God, "to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil" to his neighbor, and to be a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well. For this purpose he bears the sword of power, and is invested with authority. He is, in the same record which denominates him a minister of God to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil, prohibited from using his authority, which is always compulsory, in anything pertaining to spiritual concerns. For this purpose the sword of power is never to be unsheathed. It was once wielded for this purpose even in the presence of the Founder of Christianity; but it was returned to its scabbard, with these memorable and effective words: "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword"—that is, not to defend the State, but to support the church. He who is the Author of Christian faith, also said that if His kingdom were of a worldly nature, His servants would use violence in support of His cause. But such was not its nature.

My creed on this subject is the following, viz.: That, as the civil magistracy is in all nations alike the appointment or ordinance of God, whether they are pagans, Mohammedans, or Christians, it is never to be employed in support of any religion whatsoever; nor are civil rulers on any account whatsoever to use any of that authority which they have received for and from the State, in support of Christianity; nor ever directly or indirectly to use compulsion in anything pertaining to religion; but they are to use all their authority in keeping good order in society, or in preserving the public peace, the life, liberty, reputation, and property of the citizens of the State.

Those who differ from me on this topic, I request to consider three things:—

1. That if the magistrate in the United States, for instance, proceed officially to support or defend the religion of this country, the Turkish, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese, or any other magistrate has the same power and right (being equally a divine institution there as here to accomplish the moral government of the world) to defend and support the religion of their respective countries.

2. That swords, cannons, guns, powder, lead, prisons, gold, silver, or bank-notes, cannot make the conscience bend, renew the soul, spiritually illumine the human mind, nor give a new moral sense. That rack, gibbets, wheels, whips, or even the mild punishment of four dollars' fine, cannot promote piety or benevolence.

3. That all such efforts on the part of the magistrate are prohibited in the institutes of Christianity.

I am aware that not a few model both the church and the state after the "commonwealth of Israel," and would have something like the Jew in civil and ecclesiastical concerns. I have yet said nothing respecting the civil magistracy of the Jews, which seems to be the copy after which the "moral associations" would, if they dared, model their little Sanhedrims and their young St. Giles.

With regard to the Jews I will say, there was no office purely civil. Their government was a pure theocracy, and all their officers were under the immediate appointment of their king, who was none else than their God. Hence, when they sought a king like other nations, the Lord charged them with having rejected himself as their king. Civil and religious offices were reposed in the same hands; hence Moses performed offices civil and religious. The seventy elders, selected to assist him in judging and awarding, took under their cognizance things civil and religious. The Jews cannot become a model to any nation in the world, either in their civil government or in their ecclesiastical; for this plain reason, that no nation ever stood in the same relation to God, nor received their political institutions in the same manner. I would remind those who are so eager to imitate them that the punishment the Jewish rulers inflicted on those who transgressed the letter of the first table of the law, was only death. The Sabbath-breaker and the blasphemer were only stoned to death. There was no commutation of the crime; for, if the sins against God are to be punished as such, there is no temporal privation that can be considered as such. Let those who are zealous of punishing Sabbath-breakers and of executing what they call the law of God, be consistent with themselves and their precedents, and stone to death the Sabbath-breaker and the blasphemer.

Since the Jewish religion became obsolete, there never was a tribunal on earth appointed of God to take cognizance of, or to punish, sins against God. This power God has committed to none on earth; he has no representative on earth.

In regard to the Sabbath day and the institutes of religion, I except them entirely from the jurisdiction or cognizance of the civil magistrates, in any sense whatever.
