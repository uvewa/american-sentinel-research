The New York *Sun*, which may be considered good authority on matters relating to papal policy, says that "the separation of church and state in the Philippines, which, it is said, will be insisted upon by the Americans, will present grave difficulties with the Vatican."

This must be so, since, as is well known, the Vatican steadfastly maintains the principle of church and state union. This is a cardinal principle in the papal system, and is put in practice wherever the papal church holds sway. In the colonies of Spain it was, of course, firmly established.

Being contrary, however, to the whole system of American government, it could not without a flagrant violation of the principles of this system, be maintained under American rule. But violations of these principles—even flagrant ones—have not been unknown under American rule at home, and will be less surprising under that rule abroad. The papacy well understands this, and is prepared to strongly contest the introduction of such a change in the Philippines. Indeed, the papacy sees in the situation a favorable chance for recognition of herself and her institutions by the United States Government. She will make it appear that any interference with the church in the Philippines would be religious persecution, and will invoke the principles of religious freedom, which utterly forbid union of church and state, in her support. It is said that she has already secured from the Government a promise that the religious orders—the monks, etc.—in the islands shall not be disturbed.

The Government will have not only to settle with Spain, but with the Vatican. And if American principles are to be maintained in the settlement, the Vatican will present the chief obstacle to be overcome.
