An effort was made at the May term of the Queen Anne County (Md.) Court by some Sunday law zealots to indict a Seventh-day Adventist of Ford's Store for keeping open his store on Sunday.

The witnesses against the Adventist were Sunday observers, and they verily thought and hoped for the grand jury to do something with the "pestilent" and "disturbing" Sabbath keeper. But they were doomed to disappointment, for the foreman of the grand jury on the day set for inquiry upon the matter propounded several questions which revealed the animus pervading the whole thing.

These were the questions in substance addressed to witnesses:

- *Foreman*—"How long has Mr. Neal been in the habit of keeping his store open on Sundays?"
- *Witness*—"For several years."
- *Foreman*—"Have you or other Sunday observers visited his store and made purchases on Sunday?"
- *Witness*—"Yes, sir."

With a few mild words of remonstrance the inquiry was closed and no further notice given the matter.

There is something about the Sunday institution which causes its devotees "unrest," and leads them to disregard the rights of others. In this frame of mind they are ready to cast their fellow creatures into jail, or if need be, snuff out their lives in behalf of their darling idol, in place of trying to lead by the law of love and liberty those who may differ from them.

Be it said, however, to the credit of those like the foreman of this Maryland grand jury, there are some who are having their eyes opened to the possible iniquities furnished by the Sunday law, and who are having the courage to refuse their aid in the Satanic scheme of religious persecution. The SENTINEL in large measure is responsible for the many adherents of religious liberty in this day and time. Its sterling worth and candor constantly improves as a weapon of and for good. Keep on with the good work.

S. B. HORTON.
