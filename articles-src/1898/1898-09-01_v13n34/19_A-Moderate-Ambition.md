A prosperous florist in New Orleans used to tell to his friends the following incident of personal experience, which may contain a suggestion for other fathers and sons:

> "My father," he said, "was a shrewd Swiss; a mechanic. He died when my brother and I were lads. Finding that his health was such as to give promise only of a few months of life, he said to us one evening, 'I have but little money to give you, only enough to educate you and start you in business in a humble way. Let me advise you to become florists, or vegetable or bee-growers. For this reason: I foresee that there will be a great competition in most kinds of business in this country, and because of this competition, men working for wages will be forced to accept low returns for their work. In the occupations I have mentioned you will not need to employ many men, and you need not necessarily be employed by anyone. You can, if you are wise and not eager to get rich, be comparatively free and unshackled.

> "Another reason is, that if you do your work mainly yourselves there are few temptations in these employments. You are not likely to squabble with pears, or strawberries, or potatoes, and if your principal companions and friends are bees and roses they will not tempt you to drink or to gamble.'

> "I have never regretted," said the man, "that I followed his counsel and chose a quiet, obscure career in which there are small profits and a reasonable degree of independence."
