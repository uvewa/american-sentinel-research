THE Holy Spirit is the divinely-appointed representative of Christ upon earth.

A part of the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to lead the follower of Christ "into all the truth." John 16:13. (R. V.)

He who has the Holy Spirit dwelling in him fully,—he who has completely surrendered himself—body, soul, and spirit—to the guidance of the Holy Spirit,—need not fear being taught anything but the truth. The Holy Spirit is the "Spirit of truth," and could teach nothing contrary to the truth.

But the Holy Spirit is not the only spirit that is in the world, and there is danger of one's surrendering himself up to a spirit claiming to be the Holy Spirit, but which is in reality a lying spirit. In that case the soul would inevitably be led into error, and at the same time believe it to be the truth.

Of this danger God has warned the children of men, even as he warned our first parents in the Garden of Eden of the enemy who would attempt to beguile them away from God. Hence we read: "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world." 1 John 4:1.

This being so, it is our imperative duty to challenge every spirit that comes to us, even the Holy Spirit. In the Scripture quoted above, we have divine authority for challenging every doctrine that is taught us by any of these spirits. We must try them all.

But to do this we must have some standard of truth, and to that standard even the Holy Spirit must conform. This is not because the Spirit of God could in any way lead us astray, but it is to safeguard us against false spirits and false teachers whom they might use.

But whatever that standard is it must be the truth; and it must be so plain that the dullest mind can understand it. If this were not so, those only of the keenest intellects would be safe.

What this standard is, is told us by the Prophet Isaiah, chap. 8:20: "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them."

In previous articles we have shown that in the plan of redemption the law of God is above Christ and the gospel. They are both subject to it in the sense that whatever they teach cannot be right unless it is witnessed to by the law. Rom. 3:21. Just so it is with the Holy Spirit.

Concerning this law the Psalmist says, "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness; and thy law is the truth." Psa. 119:142.

Any spirit therefore, which, claiming to be the Holy Spirit, shall teach anything contrary to that law, is not to be received as the Holy Spirit.

The Holy Spirit is of the light, and there is no darkness in him, but God says any one who speaks contrary to the word of the law does it because there is no light in him.

It must be plain that even the word or the letter of that law must be truth; for if such were not the case then the wording of the law would be false and misleading. Therefore whatever true knowledge one might have of the law, it can never be contrary to the wording of the law. Therefore we may know that any spirit that would teach contrary to what the law says is not the Holy Spirit. From this it is not hard to see what spirit it is that teaches that Sunday is the Sabbath day.

The fourth commandment, the only one that has anything to say with reference to the matter of the Sabbath, says in the plainest way, so plainly that the dullest mind can comprehend it, that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." That is the truth; therefore whatever the Holy Spirit would teach us concerning the nature of the Sabbath, he could never teach anything contrary to that statement—"the seventh day is the Sabbath." If he did he would not be the "Spirit of Truth."

But everybody knows that Sunday is not the seventh day. All know that it is the first day of the week.

What then becomes of the claim of the Catholic Church that it changed the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day of the week under the direction of the Holy Spirit. It is a false claim in every particular, and proves conclusively that the spirit by which it sought to effect the change was not the Holy Spirit. Clearly then, not being the work of the Holy Spirit, it must have been the work of the spirit of antichrist.

But ascribing the work of the spirit of antichrist as being that of the Holy Spirit is nothing short of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (see Matt. 12:22-32), and therefore stamps the papacy as the "man of sin." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.
