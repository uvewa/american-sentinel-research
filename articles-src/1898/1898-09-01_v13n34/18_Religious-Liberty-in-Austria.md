Until recently, the people in Austria were required by law to belong to one of the several churches recognized by the State; but this requirement has been removed, and the people may now belong to any church or no church, as they see fit. Under this condition of things there has been there a rapid development of a sect which dissents from the Orthodox State Church. Because of this dissent they are termed by their enemies religious anarchists, though it is admitted that in their lives they are quiet, industrious, and peaceable. The following character sketch of this noteworthy religious movement is given in *The Independent*, of this city:

> "The indications are increasing that the 'Rascol,' or religious dissent movement, which in Russia has estranged millions from the Orthodox State Church, is proving contagious in neighboring lands also. Recently the movements of the Nazarenes, a peculiar sect in Hungary, have attracted widespread attention, their official confession having been published in a number of leading church papers on the Continent, notably in Germany. It is stated that their organization is the outgrowth of a destructive anti-State Church propaganda, and that they are pronounced religious Nihilists, characterized by non-confessionalism. They are found chiefly in Western Hungary, the agitation being particularly successful among the working classes. In Southern Hungary it has spread among the peasants, especially in those districts where the gospel of Agrarian Socialism has found such a ready acceptance.

> "The recruits to this new sect are secured mainly from the Greek Oriental Servians and the Calvinistic Reformed Magyars. The motives for severing their connection with the State Church are not always of a religious kind and origin. This step is frequently taken in order to escape heavy taxation for church and cultus purposes. Sometimes it is the result of disagreement with the priests and the clergy.

> "The growth of the sect has been advanced materially by the law of religious freedom that was promulgated in Hungary in 1895. Before that time the law required every citizen to belong to one of the churches recognized by the State; but now the status of 'non confessionalism' or non-membership in any religious communion is acceptable to the State. When the adoption of this law was under consideration, it was urged that it would result in great harm to the historical and established churches and give rise to ecclesiastical anarchism and radicalism. The rapid spread of the Nazarenes shows that these fears were fully justified. In the case of the Agrarian Socialists there non-confessionalism was developed into a full-fledged atheism.

> "The Nazarenes, too, are very radical. They entertain principles antagonistic to the existing social order of things; they refuse under any circumstances to take an oath; refuse also to enter the army and prefer to subject themselves to the severest punishments rather than take weapons of war into their hands. The military authorities of Austria have had as much trouble with the Nazarenes as those of Russia have had with the Mennonites.

> "The Nazarines have no priests; their 'elders' perform marriage ceremonies, conduct services, and the like. In this respect as in others, e. g., their exemplary moral life and industry, they closely resemble the Russian Stundists. Their conduct is marked by its peacefulness, willingness to help each other and their neighbors, and by a religious zeal for the spread of their peculiar teachings and tenets that borders on fanaticism. The church authorities, high and low, are considerably perplexed at the phenomenal growth of this religious dissenting movement, in which they recognize a great danger to church and state."
