This is a time when momentous changes follow rapidly upon each other in the march of passing events. It is a time of great national activity, and there is a meaning in this both for the statesman and the private individual. It is not enough to make note of these events from the standpoint of a mere looker-on. That is not the true or safe role for any individual to play now. Activity is demanded of him also. He is to get ready for the crisis which these things portend, and to make haste. "The end of all things is at hand."
