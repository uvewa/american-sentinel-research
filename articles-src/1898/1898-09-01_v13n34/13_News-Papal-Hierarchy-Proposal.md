ANOTHER way in which the papacy is reported to be bidding for recognition from the American Government is through a proposal to the latter to join with it in appointing a new hierarchy in the captured islands. This is the announcement made in a dispatch from Rome to a Vienna journal, the *Politische Correspondenz*. The Government, of course, can have no concern whatever with the appointment of hierarchies anywhere, papal or otherwise.
