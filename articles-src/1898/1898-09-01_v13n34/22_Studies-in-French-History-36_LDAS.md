"We will begin to-day where we left off last week, if some one can tell us where that was," smiled Professor Carman.

"The dwarfish king, Charles VIII., had just died, from bumping his head, I believe," promptly responded Edna Phillips.

"Yes; this was in the year 1498. Now a new king ascends the throne, under the name of Louis the Twelfth."

"I suppose he was Charles' son, wasn't he?" questioned Bert Mathews, opening a neat note book and preparing to write.

"Oh no; the poor king died quite young and left no children; so it was to his cousin Louis, duke of Orleans, that the crown fell."

"Then I presume he had never had any idea that he was going to be king of France some day," said Milly Brown; "just think what a surprise it must have been to him! imagine my waking up some fine morning and finding myself queen of France or some other country!"

"Well, I sincerely hope you would take the change as sensibly as he did; you know it was quite unusual for a French king to take a sensible view of anything. But you can judge something of the affection of his subjects for him, when I tell you he was called 'The father of his people.'"

"It seems very restful, doesn't it, professor, to tell about a good, kind king, once in a while," smiled Julia March, with a sigh of relief.

"Just so, Julia; and if restful to us who merely learn a few facts concerning him, how must it have seemed to the poor people who were used to being treated as if they were little above the brutes! You see Louis the Twelfth was not a bit in character or disposition like Louis the Eleventh. He had known what it was to have a hard lot in life. His marriage was a forced one, and consequently a most unhappy one. Louis XI. had compelled him to marry his daughter Jeanne; and then, when Louis XI. died, and his daughter Anne was regent of France until Charles VIII. was old enough to take his father's throne, Anne had put the unfortunate fellow in prison."

"What!" exclaimed practical Jack. "Put her own sister's husband in prison! What had he been doing?"

"Anne thought he had been plotting against the government. But now he has the very power that his stern sister-in-law had only a few years before, and so everybody expected him of course to wreak his vengeance upon her and all those concerned in the affair."

"I'm so glad he was made of better material than that," said Fred Green.

"Yes; and the people were glad and respected him all the more. In fact, it is said that he had not a single enemy in all France at this time."

"Were there any who tried to get him to revenge himself, I wonder," said Maggie Palmeter.

"O yes; there always are some people, you know, who enjoy a quarrel much better than they do peace. But Louis said that he did not think it would be becoming in him—king of France—to avenge the wrongs of the duke of Orleans, which you remember was his own position at that time. So he nobly forgave his relatives, which was far better. Then, also, he was extremely careful in spending the people's money. He was very prudent and saving."

"I imagine that the nobles and courtiers would not like that sort of thing so well as the common people," commented Edward Barnaby.

"O no, they did not; so they accused him of being mean and stingy, but he said he would much prefer that charge; in fact, he would rather the rich would laugh at him for not spending more money, than for the poor to weep over his spending so much.

"However, the king had his faults, and he determined now that he would no longer be bound by the hateful ties which years before had made him the husband of the daughter of Louis XI."

"I don't see how he could honorably free himself, though," said Joe Palmeter.

"Well, you see, he applied to one who did not know the meaning of the word 'honor,'—that 'infamous pope,' as he is called in history, Alexander VI.,—granted him a divorce without a protest; leaving him free to marry whom he chose. He at once selected the widow of his predecessor, Anne of Brittany."

"You haven't told us anything of her at all, I think; did she make a good queen?" asked Harry Ray.

"I am sorry if I neglected to mention something of her kindness of heart and real beauty of character; for it gives me much pleasure to do so. On account of the good sense of Queen Anne, the French court which was almost always noted for its gayety and dissipation, became, as history says, 'a model of propriety.' The happy people began to think that prosperity had at last come to stay. The king was kind and paid his own debts, lowered, instead of increasing the taxes, and all things seemed to indicate a long reign of prosperity."

"O I hope there didn't anything dreadful happen to spoil it all," sighed Julia March.

"Ah, but there did, Julia, there did! King Louis was proof against the wicked suggestion to revenge himself on his enemies, and he nobly bore the temptation to squander the people's money as other kings had done, but against the whispers of the 'demon of ambition,' he was powerless. So, even as his foolish predecessor had done, he too, went over to Italy with an army, only to return after a while as badly beaten as Charles had been. King Ferdinand, of Spain, under whom Columbus made his wonderful discoveries, joined with Louis in a shameful raid against Naples. The pope was on hand to 'give' the country away, as usual, which of course he had no right to do. But though the king of Naples was driven out of the city, the pope treacherously formed a 'Holy League' against France, though he had only a short time before befriended her king, and so of course the humiliated Louis was glad to seek peace. Another pope, however, had ascended the papal chair, Julius the Second, and it was he who did this."

"The League must have been more 'holy' in name than in fact," remarked Joe Palmeter, as his teacher dismissed the class.
