ANOTHER thing about which much has been said, and which has a bearing in this direction, is the army "canteen." This word stands for a system by which intoxicating drinks is served to the soldiers in camp, who both drink the liquor and are obliged to furnish bar tenders. Imagine a Christian young man forced to serve as bar tender in one of these drinking places, or be disciplined for insubordination. It is a very plain truth that a Christian who would go to war must either make a god of his superior officers, or expect to be subjected to military discipline. The military code provides no place for conscience in the life of the soldier.

HOW MUCH of the disease that is making greater ravages among the troops than was made on the battle field, is due to this army "canteen"? The close relation between spirituous drink and bodily disease is well enough established to warrant the conclusion that the canteen is by no means guiltless as regards this dreadful loss of life. And as the canteen system is permitted by the Government, we have the strange spectacle of the Government joining hands with the enemies of its own troops, to destroy their lives. We believe it is no stretch of the truth to say that strong drink is the greatest and most dangerous foe of the American Government. It is the deadly enemy of all government. It is anarchy in liquid form.
