FROM STATISTICS RELATIVE TO THE MORTALITY CAUSED BY THE CIVIL WAR, AS WELL AS THAT DUE TO THE WAR JUST ENDED, IT APPEARS THAT DISEASE IS A FAR MORE FORMIDABLE ENEMY TO THE SOLDIER THAN THE BULLETS AND SHELLS OF HIS ADVERSARIES. THUS, IN THE CIVIL WAR, WHILE ABOUT 95,000 DEATHS WERE CAUSED BY GUN FIRE, 186,000 WERE CAUSED BY THE FEVERS AND OTHER DISEASES INCIDENT TO THE HARDSHIPS AND UNSANITARY CONDITIONS OF CAMP LIFE. EVIDENTLY THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF REMOVING THE CAUSES OF THIS DREADFUL MORTALITY, IS A THING THAT NEEDS TO BE EARNESTLY AND THOROUGHLY CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE IT IS AGAIN CONFRONTATED WITH WAR.
