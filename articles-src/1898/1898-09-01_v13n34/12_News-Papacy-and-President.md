THE papacy has, it is said, asked and obtained of the President the assurance that there will be no interference with the Catholic religion in the Spanish territories which have been surrendered to the United States. And now the papal Secretary of State, Cardinal Rampolla, sends word to Archbishop Ireland instructing him to call on the President and thank him for this declaration. In view of which a leading daily of this city observes, quite truthfully, that this "is doubtless gratifying to the President, but unnecessary. The President can do nothing to call for thanks. He can simply do his duty under the Constitution, which is to give every religion a fair show. If he did more he would be usurping authority; if he did less he would be guilty of neglect of duty. When he observes the principles of the Constitution he is entitled to recognition as a faithful servant, but not to thanks."

THERE is something a little singular however—suspiciously so—about this asking for a "fair show" for the Catholic religion and this show of thanks for the President's assurance. Why should it be thought necessary to ask merely for a fair show? The Catholic Church has that here, and has always had it; she has boasted of her freedom and opportunities under the American Government. Why then should it be feared that she will not enjoy that freedom—why necessary to ask that it be assured—under American rule elsewhere? Why, unless it is something a little more than a "fair show" for which the Catholic Church is really asking? But anything more than this will be in violation of fundamental American law.
