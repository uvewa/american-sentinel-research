TOM:

They're going to fence the common in,
They say we're getting tough,
Because we play on Sunday
When week days are enough;
But we must work all through the week,
And never see the sky;
But they're going to fence the common in
And can you tell me why?

I'll loiter round the alley, Joe,
Or mope round in the room,
Or with some fellers find a way
To some back-door saloon.
For Sunday folks who go to church
Don't have the whole to say;
Why will they fence the common in
And spoil our little play?

I know we shout—and run around;
It does us good I'm sure;
The game is harmless, we have found
The air is good and pure.
We hear the singing from the church,
It doesn't bother us;
But oh, the church folks fume and sigh,
And make a fearful fuss.

JOE:

They're going to fence the common in,
But that is not the whole;
They're going to fence the human in
And quite corral his soul.
They're going to have a Sunday law
That will not brook pretense;
You'll have to stand in solemn awe
Inside the Sunday fence.

You'll see a day, dear comrade, Tom,
That'll take you off your perch,
For a "cop" will see, if you don't come
That you are brought to church.
No alley foul, or gloomy room
Will give a place to stay,
And nary will there be saloon
To open on that day.

The folks must do their drinking up
Inside of Saturday night,
For on a Sunday everywhere
The law will keep 'em right.
Pious as priests, you'll all go in
Beneath a rein and bit;
And if you are not pure from sin
You'll be a hypocrite.

TOM:

But, Joe, we're not the only ones
This will not suit a bit;
Will Robert Ingersoll go in
And be a hypocrite?
Then, there are Jews who keep *their* day
And Baptist seventh dayers;
Will they have Saturday laws as well
To keep down all ball-players?
What's fair for one is fair for all;
Let the Sunday folks be pious;
Why should they take the shears of law
To cut love on the bias?
Let them have if they must a Sunday law
That'll keep them on their knees;
But let Infidels and Israelites
And other folks do as they please.

*Why shouldn't they?*
