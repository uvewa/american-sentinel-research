"Look here, Edna," said Will Barnaby, on their way home from school, "how in the world do you manage to remember facts in history so well—dates and things—that are important, you know? I never could, and I just try and try like a good fellow, but they will slip away from me," he added ruefully.

"Well, Will," said Edna, smiling, "I presume my memory is my strong point, but I do make lots of awful blunders; but I'll tell you what helps me more than anything else, it's talking the thing over that I want to remember, you see. We talk about the things professor tells us when I get home."

"That's a good idea!" exclaimed Will. "I guess we'll try it over at our house."

Will studied every history he could find, through the week, and he gathered a considerable amount of information about the destruction of the Knights Templars, so on the next Tuesday afternoon, at the request of Professor Carman, he arose and read:

"As near as I can make out, King Philip IV. used a great deal of meanness and deceit in this cruel massacre of the Templars. He sent word to the grand master to come over to France and unite with him in preparing to begin another crusade. But the deceitful king had no intention of waging another 'holy war,' as they were called, and one day after the grand master had got over to France, the king gave the word, and every Templar in the kingdom was forced into prison. Then they were tortured to make them own up to things they never did at all. Of course they were bad enough, but they didn't like to admit doing things they were not guilty of doing.

"But the cruel king was on their track like a bloodhound, and it didn't make a bit of odds to him whether they confessed or not, fifty-four of them had to die at the stake, and Philip took possession of their temple, where were immense stores of wealth. Finally after a few years, Pope Clement abolished the entire society, and the king took a large share of the private valuables of those who had been killed. It was a common story in France, for a long time, that the grand master prophesied while burning at the stake, that both the king and Pope Clement would die within a year. Whether this story is true or not, the fact is that these two wicked men did die very soon after."

"This is all I had time to write, professor," said Will, taking his seat.

"You have certainly brought out a great many facts regarding the abolishing of the Knights," said the teacher, as Will folded his manuscript. "You must have given the subject careful thought and study. I think you will find the practice of writing your thoughts a good and helpful one.

"Well, at last Philip IV. died, and his three sons, Louis X., the Quarreler; Philip V., the Long; and Charles IV., the Fair, one after the other ascended the throne. But as none of these sons happened to have any boys in their family, the kingdom passed over into the hands of Philip VI., of Valois. He was a nephew of Philip IV., the Fair."

"Didn't Philip IV. have any daughters?" asked Will Palmeter, "it seems as if I read that he did."

"O yes; his daughter Isabella married the king of England, Edward II."

"Why didn't she take the throne after her brothers died?" asked Florence Ray, raising her hand.

"Because of a certain law of France, which forbade a woman's aspiring to such a position.

"I wonder if that was what Aunt Eunice meant, this morning, when she spoke of the 'Salique law.' I intended to ask her what she meant, but it slipped my mind," said Julia March.

"I presume it may have been, at least that is what the law of which I was speaking, was called. During the reign of these three kings, the people were reduced to a state of great wretchedness and poverty; for the barons were very busy getting back their rights as they called them, which during the life of Philip IV., had been denied them. So, of course, this meant trouble for the poorer people.

"There was a class of miserable fellows called Lepers, who were falsely accused of poisoning people's wells. So these poor creatures were caught and burned alive; in fact, history says they were burned 'by hundreds.' Then it was reported that the Jews were in league with the Lepers. This was enough. They were not even allowed a trial. Once there was a large, deep hole dug in the ground, and the cruel Frenchmen threw one hundred and sixty Jews of all ages and both sexes into it, having first lighted a fire at the bottom. But the richer ones were kept in prison long enough for the king to take their property. Then they were taken from prison and sent out of the country."

"What! Were the poor fellows not allowed to live at home even when they had become poor men for the sake of the king?" said Robert Billings.

"No, Robert; people were very selfish in those days as well as now, and kings were no exception to the rule.

"Next week we will learn something of French history during the fourteenth century, when the unfortunate family of Valois first took the throne.
