The following conversation occurred near this place a short time ago between two intelligent persons—one an Infidel and the other a Catholic—which is worthy of more than passing notice:—

Catholic.—"Old Boozle Jim is most always drunk; he is a poor citizen."

Infidel.—"Yes, John, I would hesitate to call a drunkard a good citizen."

C.—"By the way, Harry, what do you think of the citizenship of a good Roman Catholic; of course, you know there are some bad Catholics who cannot be taken into account."

I.—"Well, I think a bad Catholic, that is, in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church, is a good, or at least a better citizen of the United States than a good Roman Catholic."

C.—"What makes you think so, Harry?"

I.—"I have so far failed to see how a man obeying the dictates of a foreign potentate, can be a good citizen of any nation, for that matter."

C.—"But have Catholics not done much to build up the welfare of the United States?"

I.—"A favorite maxim of the Roman Church is, 'The end justifies the means;' if that was not the principle ruling in this case, it was probably because these Catholic philanthropists were more liberal in their views."

C.—"But they were in good standing, I assure you."

I.—"John, will you answer me a few questions honestly?"

C.—"Certainly, Harry."

I.—"Supposing an election to be held between two political factions, say in three months hence; the platform of the first party being to the interests of the Catholic Church, but inimical to the welfare of the United States, whereas the platform of the second party is just the reverse—inimical to the Catholic Church, but for the welfare of the nation. Now, the pope hearing how matters stand, issues a 'bull,' causing it to be read in all the American churches, forbidding all loyal members to vote for the party who, on coming into power, would work against the church, and commanding all to vote for the party whose platform is in the interests of the Catholic Church, but inimical to the national welfare; would you obey?"

C.—"Yes; and every good Catholic would obey; for we should by right obey the holy father."

I.—"Yes, John; but a good citizen seeks the welfare of his nation; but if Catholics do as you say, they work against the welfare of the nation, and are therefore not good citizens, but traitors. Why, according to your testimony, Catholics would betray this nation if it would benefit their church. How can a traitor be a good citizen?"

C.—"They are good citizens because they are subject to the higher powers. The pope is higher than any nation composed mainly of heretics; and when we get contro—"

(Exits quickly in anger.)

I.—(Calling after) "John, you are a good citizen of Rome, but an alien in the United States."
