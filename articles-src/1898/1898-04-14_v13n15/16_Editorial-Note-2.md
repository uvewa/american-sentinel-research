In a paper treating on the subject of privateering, written in 1812, Thomas Jefferson made this statement of the nature of war:—

"What is war? It is simply a contest between nations as to which can do the most harm to the other. Who carries on the war? Armies and navies that are made up of individuals. How is a battle gained? By the death of individuals. What produces peace? The distress of individuals occasioned by the conduct of war."

This is true, and this is what war will be to day when it comes. The worst suffering and distress occasioned by war is not felt by those in the field, but by the people at home.
