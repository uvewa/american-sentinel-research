At the recent Methodist Conference held in this city, the Committee on National Affairs reported to the assembly "an indictment demanding the expulsion of Spanish rule from Cuba." Among the reasons set forth in the report for this action is this:—

"8. Its sacreligious pretense of claiming to be a Christian nation."

Yet this same Methodist body indorses the declaration of the Supreme Court that the United States "is a Christian nation;" and that decision, in laying the groundwork for such a declaration, goes directly back to the history of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Spain, and cites the religious auspices under which Columbus set sail for the New World, as one of the proofs that from the very first, the nation has been Christian in character. And as the religion of Spain has not changed from that day to this, it is perfectly plain that if it can be cited in proof that this nation was inaugurated under Christian auspices, it can be cited in proof that Spain is to-day a Christian nation. If Spain be not a Christian nation to-day, then it is absolutely certain that the commission given to Columbus by Ferdinand and Isabella in the name of religion, had nothing to do with Christianity in this country, and constitutes no evidence whatever in support of the Supreme Court's decision. But no Methodist body have dissented from this finding of the Supreme Court; or if they have it has been done so secretly as not to come to public notice. The Methodist Conference might just as well declare war on the Supreme Court as favor war against Spain for claiming to be a Christian nation.

The truth is that Spain is just as much a Christian nation as is the United States, or any other nation on the globe.
