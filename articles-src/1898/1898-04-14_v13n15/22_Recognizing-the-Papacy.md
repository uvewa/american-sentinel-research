The efforts of the pope to mediate between the Government and Spain have not been regarded with complacency by some of the religious bodies of the country. Among these is the New York Conference of Baptist ministers, who at their customary weekly meeting in this city, April 4, gave expression to their sentiments in the matter by the following resolution:—

"In view of the published suggestion from Madrid that the pope mediate between Spain and the United States in the Spanish and Cuban difficulty, we, the members of the New York Baptist Ministers' Conference, desire to utter an emphatic protest against any present or future recognition of the pope by our Government. We regard such recognition as in direct violation of the principle of separation between the church and the state which has been thoughtfully adopted by us. It would be a precedent likely to be used in future to our discomfort, if not to the disturbance of our civic affairs.

"While appreciating the propriety of his counselling the church which recognizes him as its religious instructor and head, we do not regard him as having any office with which our Government should hold official relation."

But the worst form of recognition of the papacy is the recognition of the principles which underlie the papal system; and that is done in every instance of religious legislation. It is much worse to imitate the papacy than to recognize the pope as an earthly sovereign.
