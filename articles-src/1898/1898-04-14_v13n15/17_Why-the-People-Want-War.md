It seems clear enough that the great majority of the people want war with Spain, but there is evidently a considerable diversity of sentiment among them as regards the reason why war should be declared. The New York Christian Advocate comments upon this fact and gives a number of illustrations, which are worth considering by sober-minded and peace-loving people. The Advocate says:—

"There have been some remarkable conversations of late. One citizen of good standing was heard to say to another, 'The government must interfere, or it will not succeed in the next election; prosperity lags; any government that starts a war is bound to be supported; that issue takes precedence of everything else; it has always been so in this country; it has been so in other countries; it always will be so.' 'Yes,' said his friend, 'and for that reason we free silver men have got to shout for war.'

"This explains the unanimity. 'Do you not remember,' said the first, 'what a mad race both parties ran after Cleveland issued his threat respecting Venezuela? Hardly a man dared to lift up his voice in Congress for some weeks, and it was clear as the nose on your face that party competition produced some of that unanimity.'

"Another conversation was on this wise: 'We want war; war makes business; thousands of people will be better off very soon if we have war.' 'How is that?' said his companion. 'Every man that leaves any kind of business to go to war makes a place for another. A great deal of work has to be done in the shipyards now, and everything that is likely to be destroyed by war has to be replaced. If you will stop and think you will see that nearly every kind of business would be improved by it.' Just before the 'Maine' sailed to Havana two men employed in the navy were talking in a hotel. One said to the other, 'If there is a war we will have a chance to show what we can do; pretty dry time we have had lately.'

"It has been said that the Spaniards' dispatching their flotilla justifies an immediate declaration of war on the part of the United States. Some of the most astonishing remarks have been made in the pulpits of the country, if they are properly reported. One minister is said to have called on God, in prayer, 'to wipe Spain from the face of the earth.' Another, between fifty and sixty years of age, and sure not to be drafted in case of war, used still more extravagant language and declared that he would head a regiment. Whether the amens that his remark elicited arose from sympathy with the cause or from a certainty that in such a case he would take his departure from those parts, it was impossible to determine, but that he evoked much enthusiasm is undeniable. Some ministers invited to preach to students in colleges, having one, and but one, opportunity to say something that would prepare the young men for their high destiny as citizens and Christians, ejaculated vehemently the fiercest war sentiments.

"Returning from a service where the pastor displayed more energy than he had done for a long time upon any subject relating to the ordinary work of a minister, the reformation of men, the edification of believers, and the salvation of -ouls, two members of the congregation were conversing. One said, 'I believe that our Government should now notify Spain to withdraw all its troops from Cuba and publicly declare that it will leave the people to govern themselves, withdrawing all claim; and if they do not at once declare they will do it, and begin to vacate the island, the government of the United States should declare war and wipe Spain from off the face of the earth.' The other said, 'Suppose that two hundred thousand of the citizens of the United States were to be killed in the war, do you think that (considering what the greater part of the population of Cuba are), they should be sacrificed to bring about that result?' The citizen hesitated, and finally said, 'No, it certainly would not be wise to kill two hundred thousand American citizens to bring about that.' 'Well, should the United States sacrifice one hundred thousand to do it?' He thought that would be too many, but finally said he would not stop for fifty thousand. 'You would,' said the other, 'if you were to be one of them.'

"Some of these conversations we heard; the others were reported to us by participants or auditors."

Yes, indeed; we wonder if, in most cases, the individual who has been shouting for war would not consider even ten United States citizens too great a number to be sacrificed in wiping Spain off the earth, if he himself were to be one of them. A great many people are willing to be patriots and kill the enemies of their country who are not willing to die themselves unless it can be by proxy.

But he who goes to war and he who calls for war, must then and there surrender his own life to his country. If the would-be soldier is not willing to do this he cannot consistently don the military uniform. And he who calls for war is only a hypocrite if he is not willing to put his own person into the forefront of the battles which war must bring.

It will need a higher patriotism than is indicated in the conversations quoted to sustain the country in the event of war. To want war for the sake of political success or to revive business is one of the most foolish as well as the most criminal of sentiments.
