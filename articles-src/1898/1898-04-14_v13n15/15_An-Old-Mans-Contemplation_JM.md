I'm growing old, my sight is dim, my memory doth fail
To bring to mind the good old times, in every small detail.
But yet, there's one thing that can ne'er my recollection slip,
'Though tempests fierce have well nigh sunk my weather-beaten ship.

Our old-time preachers used to talk of Jesus and his love,
Nor did they fear all kinds of vice to manfully reprove:
The cross was their attraction every erring soul to win,
Since well they knew the Spirit's power alone could cleanse from sin.

We never thought in years gone by to ask the civil power
To help our churches, rather we made God our strength and tower:
Believing He could best convert the sinner from his way,
We were content to let the Lord bring in those gone astray.

But to convert the people now strange methods are employed,
And some, the much-prized privilege which we have long enjoyed,
Would violate, and under foot would tread the rights of man,
To execute what they would call their glorious God given plan.

The one great message preached to-day from pulpits one and all,
Is to seek legislative powers, to force both great and small
To become Christians, and if some to this will not consent,
Why whips and stocks—Rome's weapons old—must help them to assent.

The National Reformers too have aspirations great,
Since they, into a paradise our nation would translate:
So they petition Congress with an ill directed zeal,
To decide that all are Christians, though made against their will.

To me these methods all seem strange, I cannot understand
The deep designs these "reverends" have within their wise heads planned.
But then, I am old-fashioned, I suppose behind the times:
And my music too discordant to mix with modern chimes.

But still I'm half inclined to think the ancient way is best,—
To convert the individuals; they'll then show interest
In seeking other souls to gain, by methods all divine,
Their weapons—love, nor can they e'er on government recline.

Avaunt! ye vile usurpers of man's rights, divinely given,
Would ye by human laws attempt to annul the laws of heaven?
Do ye profess to daily learn within the Saviour's school?
Strive then to practice in your lives his glorious Golden Rule.

By human statutes ye can ne'er regenerate our land,
The Spirit's sword alone should ye wield with a mighty hand.
Would ye be faithful to your Lord? place politics aside
And seek the heavenly power to preach—Christ Jesus crucified.
