ROMAN CATHOLICS of Corning, N. Y., are incensed by a decision received from Superintendent of Public Instruction Skinner, prohibiting the Sisters of Mercy in St. Mary's School, which is one of the public schools, from wearing their religious garb during school hours. There can be no reason why a religious garb should be worn by instructors in the public schools. The desire for such a thing can be prompted only by a desire to utilize the public schools for sectarian purposes.
