The following extract from the pen of R. G. Ingersoll, in an article entitled, "How I would amend the Golden Rule," but fitly represents the prevailing idea of true Christianity and its relation to civil organizations. "People called Christians—or rather nations called Christians—are the most warlike of the world. Christians now have armies amounting to several millions of men. They have hundreds of iron clad monsters filled with missiles of death floating from port to port, ready to destroy and kill. Every Christian nation is guarded by fortifications to prevent other Christians from cutting their throats."

Now the simple fact is that Christians do nothing of the kind. The fact that the man is a Christian forever forbids his taking a single step in the direction above mentioned. A Christian is one who follows Christ, or does as Christ did and taught. The whole tenor of Christ's teaching is that of love—love to God and love to man. Not merely love toward our friends, but love, actual love for our enemies. Did our Saviour retaliate for the indignities heaped upon him? No. We do not read of his having so much as a body guard to protect his person from the blood thirsty Jews who ever sought his life, much less of his sending out troops of trained soldiers to destroy the property and take the lives of those who opposed him in his work.

A Christian nation would be a nation composed entirely of Christians—men, who, when they were reviled, would revile not again, when smitten upon one cheek would turn the other also; but this we fail to find. Where among the great powers of earth is there a nation composed of such men as our Saviour was? The fact is they do not exist. We find Christians, as individuals, scattered all over this wide world; but Christian nations, as such, exist only in the vocabularies of writers and speakers who but superficially study the Word of God. The mere fact that a nation depends upon its own strength or that of some other earthly power for protection, also that it provides itself with aggressive means of warfare, shows conclusively that it cannot, as a nation, be Christian, or Christ-like.

Jesus said to Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight." John 18:36. Mr. Ingersoll truly states what the nations of earth are to-day doing; but when he attempts to make Christianity, or the teaching of God's Word, responsible for the present preparations for war, also the merciless shedding of innocent blood by nations falsely called Christian, he falls far short of the true conception of the relation of Christianity to civil governments,—that of entire separation.
