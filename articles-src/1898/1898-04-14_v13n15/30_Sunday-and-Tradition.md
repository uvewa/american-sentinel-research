One of the most open avowals of the decay of faith in the sacredness of Sunday, on the part of Baptist leaders, is found in the records of the Baptist Congress held in Detroit, Mich., in 1894. A prominent theme in that gathering was this: "Tradition as a Formative Force in Baptist Doctrine and Church Life." Five prominent Baptists took part in the discussion of this theme. It goes without saying that such a theme must induce a consideration of the Sunday question. Rev. Augustine S. Carman said: "It is doubtful whether, if we were left to the scanty indications of the New Testament alone, unaided by the light thrown on the New Testament from subsequent times, we should have been able to arrive at that observance of the Lord's day, which has been the priceless possession of Christendom. At any rate we owe a large debt to tradition for facts which aid us in the interpretation of the scanty intimations of Scripture on this subject."

Rev. Levi D. Temple made a full surrender of the Sunday to tradition. He declared that tradition was a source of the introduction of the Sunday into the Bible creed. It had been placed in their Standards like, "Philadelphia Confession," dating from 1784, without biblical support. He averred that the Baptist creed which claimed that Sunday has taken the place of the Sabbath "has almost as little justification in the teachings of Christ and the apostles as the itinerancy of the clergy, or the Catholic doctrine of confession and absolution."

Doctor A. S. Hobart said that if Baptists give up tradition as a source of authority they must give up worship on Sunday, to begin with. Here is a representative sentence from Dr. Hobart: "I tell you, you may stand up in any pulpit in the land and quote the Bible, and it wont make any impression at all toward changing the practice of the church, for they would say grandpa did it that way, and it is good enough for us."

These men told the truth. Sunday has no ground except tradition.
