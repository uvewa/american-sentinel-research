Kansas City, Mo., March 22.—The ministers of Kansas City, under the leadership of Dr. W. A. Quayle, of the Independence Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church, have declared war on Sunday baseball and theaters, and promise to have both abolished within a few weeks. The first move was the circulation of a petition to the city council asking for a stringent Sunday ordinance, and this will be followed by bringing every possible influence to bear toward the passage of such an ordinance. It is hoped to induce the Civic federation to take the matter up. "We do not want to boss the city, and do not think regulating the government is the mission of the church," said Dr. Quayle to-day. "Sunday theaters and baseball have been abolished in New York, Buffalo, and Indianapolis, among other places, and Easterners are shocked and scandalized when they come out here and find everything open."
