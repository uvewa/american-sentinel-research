The Roman Catholics, it is said, are calling for more Catholic chaplains in the navy. There are in the navy twenty-four chaplains, and only three of these are Roman Catholics. We believe the proportion is not far different in the army.

The Presbyterian Synod in Pennsylvania are petitioning Congress for an increase of military chaplains. Do they want an increase of Catholic chaplains? This can hardly be. Yet it would seem that the Catholics can reasonably claim to be favored in this respect, if any increase is to be made at all. Is there no preference among other denominations as regards the particular religious source from which such an increase shall be made? Are the Presbyterians willing that the new chaplains shall be all Episcopalians, or Methodists, or Catholics, or Baptists? These are questions that should be considered before Congress is asked to increase the number.

The Catholics, it is said, in this instance are trying to make capital out of the services rendered by the Catholic chaplain on the "Maine" on the occasion of the great disaster in Havana harbor. Other denominations frown on this action, but it rests upon just as good principle as does the appointment of chaplains by the Government at all.

We would suggest that if any increase is to be made, as prayed for by the Catholics and the Presbyterians, in order to avoid stirring up denominational strife, such chaplains be chosen as are strictly "non sectarian"!
