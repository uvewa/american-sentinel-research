Dr. Hirsch, of the University of Chicago, correctly states the aim of Christianity, as follows:—

"In strict theory Christianity's aim is to establish a kingdom which is not of this world. The sermon on the mount preaches the principle of non resistance which the state cannot adopt, for one of its functions is to punish the hand that strikes and the thief who has taken the outer garment."
