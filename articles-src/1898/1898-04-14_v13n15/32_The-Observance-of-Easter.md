### A DISCREPANCY IN COMPUTING THE DATE.

"The observance of Easter dates back to about the 68, at which time there was much contention among the Western and Western churches as to what day the church should be observed. It was finally ordained at the Council of Nice in the year 325 that it must be observed throughout the Christian world on the same day. This decision settled that Easter should be kept upon the Sunday first after the fourteenth day of the first Jewish month, but no general conclusion was arrived at as to the cycle by which the festival was to be regulated, and some churches adopted one rule and some another. This diversity of usage was put an end to, and the Roman rule making Easter the first Sunday after the fourteenth day of the calendar moon was established in England in 669. After nine centuries a discrepancy in the keeping of Easter was caused by the authorities of the English Church declining to adopt the reformation of the Gregorian calendar in 1582. The difference was settled in 1752 by the adoption of the rule which makes Easter day always the first Sunday after the full moon which appears on or next after the twenty-first day of March. If the full moon happens upon a Sunday, Easter is the Sunday after."—April Ladies' Home Journal.
