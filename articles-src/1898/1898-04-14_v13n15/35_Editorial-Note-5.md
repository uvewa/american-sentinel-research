THE Bishop of London recently expressed his mind on the point of the propriety of the term "Christian" as applied to nations and countries. He said:—

"There is no Christian country in the world. Because a certain number of persons are Christians, it does not follow that the country deserves the title. England is not a Christian country."

There is scarcely anything better calculated to lower Christianity in the eyes of the world than the idea that the nations of earth, with all their quarreling and greediness, and their expenditure of time and money in getting ready to fight each other, are Christian.
