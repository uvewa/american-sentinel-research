The impropriety and injustice of the Plainfield, N.J., Sunday closing ordinance, under which a crusade is now being conducted, is well set forth in the following contributed by Dr. A. H. Lewis, a prominent Seventh-day Baptist of that place, to a Plainfield journal:—

"Since the city of Plainfield has announced its determination to stop all Sunday selling, it will be well to get a correct idea of the situation. Carbone's case is the first under the ordinance, and as it is to go to the Supreme Court for review, much may be involved. The ordinance under consideration is eminently religious. It makes two or more distinct religious tests. It forbids nothing which is criminal in itself. The acts prohibited are necessary and commendable on all days except Sunday. According to the ordinance when the clock strikes twelve, and Sunday comes into legal existence, time is sacred and selling is criminal. Thus, certain particular twenty-four hours in each week are sanctified by the city of Plainfield and 'secular' business becomes a crime. When the clock strikes twelve twenty-four hours later, time is no longer sacred and men may resume secular affairs without fear of punishment. The ordinance creates crime and inflicts punishment on the basis of a legally sacred period of time.

"Next, it creates an arbitrary standard of righteousness by declaring that the man who chooses to regard another twenty-four hours in each week as sacred time, for reasons other than the ordinance, shall not be a criminal. It goes farther still. This interpretation declares that he who Sabbathizes at a time not designated by the city must do so from pure religious motives and not 'for revenue only.'

"Carbone is now condemned because he is not religious enough to be a legal Sabbath keeper. But since the ordinance has not been fully tested no accurate standard of religiousness has been laid down by the city, and that duty is forced upon the jury. It is a delicate duty.

"It is in evidence that Carbone has outwardly Sabbathized according to the law. But twelve men have determined that he has not added to this outward observance sufficient pureness of motive, to be entitled to exemption under the religious provisions of the ordinance. If it was criminal in Carbone to sell gum on Sunday because he had not religiously complied with the law, how about the other parties in the criminal act who purchased on Sunday in the ordinance 'secular' way without any pretence of Sabbathizing on the previous day?"

It is hardly necessary to add that all Sunday-closing ordinances are essentially the same in character.
