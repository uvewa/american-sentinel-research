There was at first no definite plan in any human mind by which we should proceed. All through the years since, as the work crystallized into form there have arisen those who have claimed to have "originated," "organized," or "named" it. There has been in later years system and method, but no one person organized the W. C. T. U., nor was its name the result of any one brain's cogitations.

Some have of late undertaken to prove that we are giving Miss Willard a place which belonged to some one else, in that she did not organize the W. C. T. U., but we do not claim that she was the organizer of the Union. She was the instrument by which the organization was perfected, but it was in existence while she was yet Dean of the Woman's College at Evanston, and it was the organization that voiced the call of God to her.

At first there was in the work no thought of continuance. It was an emergency effort. I suppose that every woman of us expected to do our part quickly, and then return to the same quiet lives which we had always known (for the W. C. T. U. was composed of home-keeping women).

The Crusade had been such a surprise to saloon men that they did not know how to stand before it. They were also intimidated by the thought that, at last, the sin of their business had found them out to such an extent that the whole Christian world had conspired to destroy it. They supposed that the Woman's Crusade was the advance guard of the church which was about to follow the voice of prayer with that of the ballot; and so, with apprehensions of the judgment of man as well as of God, and touched by the pleadings which were poured forth by heart-broken women, they closed up, all along the line.

Very soon, however, they found that the votes of the church were not behind the women. We were, to all human appearance alone, and therefore, although tears and prayers were very uncomfortable to endure, they were not to be allowed to "interfere with business;" and the saloons began to open up as rapidly as they had closed, and with a power of defiance before which it was impossible for any woman to stand, unless she was filled with the power of a conviction greater than had as yet come upon many of us.

We believed that the saloon was to be closed by faith and prayer; we had faith in God and also in man, and when we saw that the saloon still existed, believed that the lack was in our praying. We believed that God chose human means through which to operate, and that, therefore, when we had found and employed the right means for closing out the saloon business, it would cease to exist, and the world be free from its curse.

My readers will understand from this, the earnestness with which, when we met failure in one direction, we turned in another.

We had believed that since saloon-keepers were men, —that all that was necessary was to make them understand what their business was doing to the women, children, tempted men, and the homes of the land.

When a woman one day came and poured her complaint into my ears, I said, "Have you told that saloon-keeper what he is doing to you through John?"

No, she had not done that. "Then," I said, "go and tell him just what you have told me, and he will stop." I believed it, and my faith was no greater than that of the average woman.

For the sake of the fathers and brothers with whom we had grown up; for the sake of the lovers who had won us to their own homes, and for the sake of the little boys about our knees; all of manhood from the cradle up to old age was sweet, was noble, true and honorable; we believed that we could always trust it.

This was the confidence we had in men, and there is no sadder chapter in human history than the disappointment with which the men of that generation, Christian voters as well as saloon-keepers, disappointed the praying women. We still believed it was a question of faith and prayer toward men as well as God, but it was evident we must pray to another class of men.

We thought we discovered at length that it must be the man who drank, instead of the man who sold, who should close up the saloon. If the drinking man could but be persuaded to drink no more, then the traffic must cease for lack of patronage, and the evil would be wiped off the face of the earth. We wondered that we had not thought of that before.

The thing that remained therefore, was to pledge all men and women to total abstinence. To do this as quickly as possible would require systematic and united effort, and we began to organize all over the land. In almost every city and village organized bodies of women under many different names sprang into being almost simultaneously.

They were known as Woman's Temperance "Associations," "Leagues," "Societies," as "Crusade Unions," etc., etc.

The city or village was districted; the women, armed with pledges, would meet each day for prayer in some central place and then go out for the house to house canvass for signers. Everybody was asked to sign the pledge; the man best known as clean and upright in all things was asked to give the support of his name to the poor victim of drink, who would not like to advertise his "failing" by such a promise, made only by drunkards. He might stagger boldly on the street in company with other drunken fellows, but to sign the pledge with them alone we felt would make him "too conspicuous" altogether, and so we tried to make a shelter for him in this confession behind the respectability of the "very best."

To this pledge-signing work we found no opposition. The poor victims of drink seemed only to have been waiting a chance to sign; saloon-keepers smiled to see us take "dead beats" off their hands, and the roll of names ran up into tens and hundreds of thousands.

We said to each other that it was the beautiful old story of the prodigal son over again, only there was "so many of him," and the joy over one sinner that repents was so multiplied that the world was not large enough to hold it.

How our rejoicing filled all the spaces between the oceans with songs that echoed and reechoed from every mountain and valley!

It was a time of triumph such as the world had never known. If only it might not have ended in such bitter mourning!
