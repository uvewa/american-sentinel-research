That tendency which is so common among people of this day to meddle in the personal affairs of their neighbors, and to seek to regulate the same by law,—as if there were in legislation a panacea for all evils, real or supposed—is illustrated by a bill lately introduced in Congress by a representative from Ohio. It is the same spirit which prompts the efforts to regulate personal conduct by Sunday laws. The New York Christian Advocate takes note of this proposed measure and makes the following pertinent comments thereon, under the head "Microscopic Legislation":—

"A representative from the State of Ohio has introduced a bill in the Legislature, which seeks to prescribe who shall and who shall not marry. The measure provides for a State Board of three managers, to be appointed by the Government, and a member in each county appointed by the Probate Court. Under this bill, if it becomes a law, the parties who make application for a marriage license will be required to submit to a physical and mental examination by the board of the county in which they live. The examination will touch the following subjects: Strong tendencies of the applicants to hereditary insanity, habitual drunkenness, criminal record, tendency toward crime or a liability to inherit a criminal inclination, imbecility, mental or physical constitutional diseases that might be transmitted to the progeny, skin, blood diseases, etc. The presence of any of these diseases, or the discovery of hereditary liability to them, will bar the applicant from the right to marry.

"Is not this list somewhat defective? Should there not be a careful examination as to whether there is any strong hereditary tendency to Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, or Mormonism; whether there is a tendency in the family to borrow money without any probability of paying it; whether any person stutters or stammers, or any of the family for three generations has done so? Is it not desirable that the County Board should decide whether the family has an hereditary tendency to what is known as 'quick temper' or 'to answer back;' whether the persons applying have come of a family using tobacco or excessively inclined to drink strong coffee or tea, and it might be well to add, whether the pedigree craze has struck them? And as it is well known that snoring and also a bad breath have separated thousands of ardent lovers and produced no end of domestic trouble, the board should be instructed to pay special attention to both these things. Some provision also should be made to examine the board, for it is obvious that if any member of it has 'a liability to inherit a criminal inclination,' he would be prejudiced and might corrupt the rest of the board, and forbid a worthy person to marry on account of the prejudices of those interested to secure a denial of the application."
