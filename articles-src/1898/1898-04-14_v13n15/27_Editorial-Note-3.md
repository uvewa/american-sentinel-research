In lamenting the loss of the "Puritan Sabbath" Dr. Leonard Woolsey Bacon truly says:—

"The law of the Westminster divines on this subject, it may be affirmed without fear of contradiction from any quarter, does not coincide in its language with the law of God as expressed either in the Old Testament or in the New. The Westminster rule requires, as if with a 'Thus saith the Lord,' that on the first day of the week, instead of the seventh, men shall desist not only from labor, but from recreation, and spend the whole time in the public and private exercises of God's worship, except so much as is to be taken up in the works of necessity and mercy. Westminster Shorter Catechism, Ans. 60. This interpretation and expansion of the fourth commandment has never attained to more than a sectarian and provincial authority; but the over-mastering Puritan influence, both of Virginia and New England, combined with the Scotch Irish influence, made it for a long time dominant in America."

It is high time that a religious thing that has no authority either in the Old Testament or the New, and which rested only upon overmastering Puritan influence, were repudiated forever. Such a thing deserves only to be lost forever.
