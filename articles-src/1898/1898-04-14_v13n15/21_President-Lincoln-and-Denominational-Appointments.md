Mr. F— (a prominent historical writer) went to President Lincoln to get an appointment, and being asked of what denomination he was, answered that he was a Presbyterian. "Well," said President Lincoln, "I will have to look at my books to see." He further said, "I am not sure but the Presbyterians are full. I have to do this."

Mr. Lincoln then proceeded: "Bishop Simpson was here the other day complaining of my Cabinet's giving all the appointments to Episcopalians. I did not know anything about my Cabinet. I thought Blair a good old Presbyterian name, and as for Seward, I didn't know until I went to church with him that he was an Episcopalian." President Lincoln had said to Bishop Simpson, "You wait here; we are to have a Cabinet meeting here directly, and I will see to it," and when the Cabinet came, he said, "Here is Bishop Simpson making a complaint of our giving all the appointments to the Episcopalians." Said Seward, "That is not true in my department. I never give an appointment to any man because of his denomination, nor even know what he is." Said Bishop Simpson, "There was Dr. McClintock, appointed to go to Paris, a good Methodist, and Bishop Hughes was put in his place. I suppose you didn't know, sir, who Bishop Hughes was?" "O, I had forgotten about him." "Well," said Blair, "you've got him there, bishop, but there are not two in my department that are Episcopalians." "Sir," said the bishop, "there are not two that are not."

"Why," said Blair, "that is not true, and you may come to-morrow morning and look for yourself." "I will be there at such a time," and he was there. As he went in Blair said, "Ah, bishop, you got Seward splendidly yesterday; how the fellow lies!" Bishop Simpson said, "I do not come to hear about him, but about your department."

"I haven't time to see about that." "Sir, it is of more importance than you know. Yesterday you said there were not two who were Episcopalians, and I said there were not two that were not Episcopalians;" and so he forced him to look at it, and he found that the bishop was correct, and that there were not two that were not Episcopalians.

All this Mr. Lincoln said to Mr. F——, who communicated it to one of the best known citizens of this country, a man of unimpeachable veracity and equal accuracy, who communicated it to us. After listening to it, we summoned a stenographer, to whom, at our request, our informant dictated it.

Denominational distinctions should never be recognized in such things, or all denominations are entitled, and will be driven, to protect themselves. Nor is it beneath their dignity, for presidents, governors, etc., to consider whether there is a tendency on the part of members of Cabinets to give an unusual proportion of appointments at their disposal to those who are of their own communion.
