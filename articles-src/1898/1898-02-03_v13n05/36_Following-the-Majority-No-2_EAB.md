"Good evening, Tom!"

"Why, good evening, Will! Come in! Take a seat by the fire. You are just the boy I've been wanting to see. Where have you been keeping yourself of late?"

"At home, Tom. You know I told you I believed I would take my circus money and buy me one of those pocket Bibles like yours?"

"Yes, Will, I remember."

"Well, I did it, and I have been putting in my spare time of late in studying it."

"Good for you, Will! How are you getting on?"

"Well, that is just what I want to tell you. I need a little help."

"What is the matter, Will? Is it hard for you to find the texts you want?"

"No, Tom. I tried your way. Learned the names of the different books, and the order in which they come, and when I know the reference now, I can find it easy enough."

"Well, that is good! Now what is the matter?"

"Why, it's these verses here in the fifth chapter of Matthew—the 17th and 18th: 'Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.'"

"So you are studying of the law, are you, Will?"

"Yes, Tom. I wanted to see if there is any reason for people's thinking it has been changed. Jim Drake says he heard his father say that there was no need of people getting their mind all confused in the study of the old law, because it had all been changed when the Saviour came, and all we had to do now was to believe in Christ.

"But, Jim," said I, "how are we to believe in Christ unless we are acquainted with him; and how are we to become acquainted with him except through his laws? Did you ask your father to explain the matter, Jim?"

"No, indeed," said he. "He wouldn't have done it if I had. He don't think such things belong to children."

"But they do, Jim," said I, "for I remember reading a verse in my Bible the other day that said, 'Those things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children,' so if there was any change made, we boys have as good a right to know it as the older people.

"Why, Jim," said I, "your father is quite an active man in church work, isn't he?

"'Well, yes,' said he, 'if talking politics and keeping people straight on Sunday can be called church work.'

"'But, Will,' said he, 'are you certain that the Saviour's coming didn't change the law?'"

"'Yes, sir, Jim, I am,' said I.

"'Well, now, look here, Will,' said he, 'it isn't very likely that the majority of the people are in the wrong, and only now and then one right.'

"But, Jim," said I, "don't you know that the way that the majority travel is called the broad way, and doesn't lead to heaven at all, and but just a few find the road to eternal life? It doesn't make any difference, Jim, if all the world says a thing is so, if God says it isn't so, why, it isn't!

"'Well, Will,' said he, 'just show me where He says it isn't so.'

"Well, Tom, do you know that I couldn't do it? I had heard it talked of lots in the Sabbath-school, and thought I understood it real well, but I hadn't realized how necessary it was that we know just where to find the proof of what we say, and I began to see why our teacher considered it so very essential that we boys learn the references for ourselves. I said, 'Jim, I don't know just where to find it, but I know it says so, and I'll look the matter up.'

"'Well, yes,' said he in his sarcastic way, 'it strikes me, Will, that that will be about the thing for you to do, and may be when you find it it won't read just as you thought it did.'

"But I knew it did, so I said, 'I mean to do it, Jim,' and walked away, fearing he might aggravate me to say something to be sorry for. I went home and began at once. My father smiled and said, 'If you keep on, my son, I don't know but you'll be a preacher yet; but if you are,' he added, 'I hope you'll stick to your profession and not try to be preacher and politician too, as some in these days seem endeavoring to do.'"

"Your father don't belong to the church, does he, Will?"

"No, Tom; but do you know I believe he has got more good religion in him than some who do, and that isn't saying that people shouldn't belong to the church either. But now, Tom, I'm ready to begin. What does this *jot* and *tittle* mean in this text, that the Saviour says shall in no wise pass from the law?"

"Why, Will, 'jot' is the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The Saviour is speaking to the Jews here and says that there shall not even so much as the smallest letter of their alphabet ever pass from the law till all be fulfilled."

"And the 'tittle,' Tom, what is that?"

"Why, that is just a little corner of a letter that makes it different from another that is very nearly like it. For instance, Will, you know how nearly alike our capital O and Q are? Just that little quirl taken from the Q would leave it an O; but the Saviour tells them that not even the smallest letter nor the tiniest part of a letter shall ever pass from the law while heaven and earth remain. Turn to the 111th Psalm and read the last clause of the seventh verse and the first clause of the eighth."

"'All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever.'"

"For how long, Will?"

"For ever and ever."

"How many of them?"

"All of them."

"Now turn to Ecclesiastes, third chapter. Read the first two clauses of the fourteenth verse."

"'I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever; nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it.'"

"How does this text agree with the idea of the law's having been changed, Will?"

"Not a bit of agreement about it, Tom."

"So I say. You see the Saviour knew there would come a time when it would be taught that he changed the law, and he says, Think not that I have done such a thing. If you want to find what he did do, turn to Isaiah the forty-second chapter and twenty-first verse."

"'The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honorable.""

"He will do what to it?"

"Magnify it."

"Now let me bring the magnifying glass, Will, and we will hold it over the page and see what it does."

"It enlarges and brings out the parts more clearly! It makes it lots plainer, Tom!"

"Now Will, isn't that just precisely what the Saviour did when he said that not even the corner of a letter should ever pass from the law?"

"Well, truly it is, Tom. I don't know of any way by which he could better have done it."

"Nor I. From what we have already gone over you would n't judge the study of the law so *very* confusing to the mind, would you, Will?"

"No, indeed!"

"Well, it's too late to study further to-night; but come over again, Will. I just enjoy an evening like this."

"I too, Tom, and I am sure I thank you ever so much for helping me this time, and shall be only too glad to come again."
