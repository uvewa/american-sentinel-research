**New York, February 3, 1898.**

It is expected that a hearing will soon be given upon the Sunday bill now before the Albany legislature.

The California Association of cycling clubs has been "outlawed" by the League of American Wheelmen because the former sanctioned Sunday racing; but the League has, it seems, signally failed in an effort to get its course in this matter sustained by the International Cyclists' Union.

Loud protests from printing concerns are being made out in Michigan against the awarding of a State printing contract to the Seventh-day Adventist establishment at Battle Creek, the latter having made a bid which was below all others received. Many of the objections are based upon religious grounds.

We are not the only persons who dissent from the "flag salute." Read what the New York Journal says (p. 69) of the flag salute in the form proposed for the schools in this State, which is not nearly as objectionable as that form which calls for a profession of allegiance to God.

In reply to a Christian Endeavor petition from Hackensack, N. J., to Washington, asking the government to discontinue Sunday delivery of mail at that place, the postmaster-general has replied that "the running of mails is for the benefit of the majority of the people," and that the Sunday delivery "will stand."

A committee of clergymen of Omaha and vicinity, appointed for the purpose of persuading the directors of the "Trans-Mississippi Exposition" to close the exposition on Sunday, were recently refused a hearing on the subject by the Board of Directors. Of course the clergymen will not let the matter drop thus easily, and a determined fight may be expected over it between this and the time for inaugurating the exposition.

Concerning the difficulty raised by the "flag salute" in Colorado, the latest information is that State Superintendent Patton "has sent orders to the school board in Boulder to settle, if possible, the difficulty over the salute to the flag which exists between it and the Seventh-day Adventists. She considers the salute of not enough importance to antagonize a whole sect, and therefore suggests that the school board do away with the salute if peace cannot be restored by any other means. At Victor, where the same state of affairs exists, the board will probably be given the same directions."
