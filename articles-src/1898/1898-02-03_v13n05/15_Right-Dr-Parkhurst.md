*New York "World," January 24.*

The Rev. Dr. Parkhurst's sermon yesterday was on the personal need every one has of accepting the atoning blood of Christ for his salvation.

After the doctor had closed his manuscript, he said:—

"My ideas on this subject in all its phases are very different now from what they were a few years ago. They are very different from what they were when I first preached to you from this pulpit. I have come to the conclusion that it is unsafe, for me at least, to trust any man who is not openly and confessedly a Christian, not only theoretically but in his life.

"A new heart is needed by individuals. Unless individuals are changed and reformed we cannot have reformed cities and governments. For that reason, more than ever before in my life, I feel the necessity of personal pleading with you for your soul's good. To that work and that work only I shall devote all my sermons and all my efforts this winter."
