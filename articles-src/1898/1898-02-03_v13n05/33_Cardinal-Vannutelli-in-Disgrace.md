A DISPATCH from Rome says that Cardinal Vannutelli is "in deep disgrace" at the Vatican, on account of having been present at a grand dinner given in honor of the American ambassador to the Quirinal, Mr. Draper. To thus openly seek the good will of the Italian government, is to violate a stringent rule of papal policy; but it seems that the cardinal, who is a prominent candidate for the tiara, thinks the good will of the Italian government worth more to him than the friendship of the Italian cardinals.
