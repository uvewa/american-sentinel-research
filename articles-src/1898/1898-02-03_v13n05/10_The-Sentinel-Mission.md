It is easy enough to see now that Jesus Christ had a great mission to this earth—the greatest that could be imagined. But how many saw this at the very time when Christ was upon the earth?—Only a few, even of his own disciples. So if you do not see that the SENTINEL has any mission, or if the people generally do not see it, it may still be true that it has one, and a very important one too.
