There happened not long ago in the State of Pennsylvania, an incident which, while trivial in itself, stands so related to other facts as to be by no means insignificant.

In one of the public schools of Tidioute, Warren County, the youthful pupils had been taught by their teacher a little song or verse for recitation, the purpose of which was to teach them temperance and inculcate patriotism. This of course is entirely proper and laudable, provided only that it is done in the right way, so that temperance and patriotism are taught, and not something else.

But in this case it was something else than patriotism that was being taught; in fact, it was something quite the opposite. And it is to the consideration of the question of whether this is so or not, and of what true patriotism is, that we especially invite the attention of the reader in this issue of the AMERICAN SENTINEL.

But here is the song, or verse, which the youthful pupils were taught to recite in concert:—

> "We are temperance children,
> Growing for the cause;
> We will vote down alcohol,
> And enforce the Sunday laws."

Now what kind of patriotism is it that is represented in the enforcement of Sunday laws? What kind of patriotism do the Sunday laws embody? History can give us an answer to this question. For it is a well known fact that we must go back into history to find where and how the Sunday laws that are upon our statute books, and which the children of to-day are to "enforce," had their origin. These Sunday laws have been handed down from one generation to another, and date far back of the time when the thirteen colonies became the United States of America; back of the time when the world heard proclaimed the Declaration of Independence; back of the time when civilized mankind made the last great world-wide movement for the realization of civil and religious freedom.

They date back to the Dark Ages; and the "patriotism" they embody is the "patriotism" of those times. And what is that "patriotism"?

Anybody who has read history knows what it is. It is a "patriotism" which was in harmony with the civil and religious despotism in which the masses of mankind were then sunk, and from which, since that time, they have made long and heroic struggles to be free.

It may be said that Sunday laws have been enacted all along from the time when church and state were united down to the present; and this is true. But it is not to the point. It would be more correct to say that they have been re-enacted. In substance, they have simply been handed down from century to century, till they have come down to us. The spirit which enters into them,—the "patriotism" which they embody—is that of the times in which they had their origin.

And now, the children in the public schools are being taught to pledge themselves to "enforce the Sunday laws," as soon as they shall be big enough to do so. But this is not all of the story, and the remaining part of it illustrates what has been said regarding the spirit and purpose of such laws.

In this school was a young lad, Victor Robbins by name, whose parents were observers of the seventh day. He told his seat mate that he was not going to sing the song, because it was not right. His seat mate informed the teacher. The teacher noticed that he did not sing, and, calling him to account, a dialogue ensued which was substantially as follows:—

"Victor, why don't you sing?"

"I don't want to sing that song."

"Why not?"

"Because I am not allowed to."

"Who does not allow you?"

"My parents are Seventh-day Adventists, and they don't want me to sing that song. It means persecution to them."

The outcome was that the boy was detained after school and compelled to sing the song.

He was compelled to endorse, in principle, the persecution of his own parents, and to say that he would do that which he knew in his own heart he would not do at all.

And all this was done in the name of Christian Endeavor. It was a Christian Endeavor song, and the teacher was an active member of the Christian Endeavor society.

Now the incident is before the reader in its full significance. Only let this line of work be taken up and pushed by the Christian Endeavor body, so that the children in the public schools everywhere shall grow up committed to the idea of enforcing Sunday by law, and what would we have in this country a few years hence? How much liberty would there be left for all those whose convictions of duty did not harmonize with the idea of Sunday observance?

We have no desire to make more out of this incident than is really in it; and we do particularly desire to give all parties concerned in it credit for the best intentions. It is quite possible that this little song was meant only as a temperance song, and that its authors had in mind only the Sunday closing of saloons; though it is to be noted that when alcohol is really voted down, there will be no occasion for Sunday laws so far as temperance is concerned, since there will then be general prohibition. Certainly the voting down of alcohol could not be done by merely closing the saloons on Sunday; for a Sunday closing law, as applied to the saloons, means the sanction of law for a business which is by nature an outlaw. For it is impossible to close the saloons on Sunday only, by law, without sanctioning them by the same law on all other days of the week.

It is sufficient to observe that however this little song may have been intended, the actual enforcement of Sunday laws means persecution to those who stand opposed to Sunday on religious grounds. History teaches it, logic demands it, and recent experience in this very land abundantly confirms it.

"Straws show which way the wind is blowing;" and the prudent man is he who foreseeth the evil, and prepareth himself to meet it.

We oppose these innovations only because they should never first have been proposed.
