"New York Journal," January 24.

The Department of Public Instruction of this State is sending out "Suggestive Programs" for the observance of Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays—anniversaries which by all means should be observed in schools and all that they stand for impressed upon the children.

The opening feature of the program is the "Salute to the Flag." We quote the grave recommendations of the department verbatim:

"At a signal from the principal the pupils in ordered ranks, hands to the side, face the flag. At another signal every pupil gives the flag the military salute as follows: 'The right hand lifted, palm downward, the forefinger touching the forehead above the eye.' Standing thus all repeat together slowly: 'I pledge allegiance to my flag and the Republic for which it stands, one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.' At the words 'to my flag,' the right hand is extended gracefully, palm upward toward the flag, and remains in this gesture till the end of the affirmation, whereupon all hands immediately drop to the side."

This seems to be another example—they are already innumerable—of the unfortunate tendency of well meaning persons to mistake flag idolatry for patriotism. It were better to teach frankly to the boy that the flag is now what his fathers made it, and will be what he and his fellows make it; that it waved over slavery until his fathers purged it of that stain; that it waves now over political corruption, judicial injustice, and industrial distress, and will continue to spread its folds over these evils unless he and his fellows with stout hearts, pure minds and honest purpose toil in their youth and in their age to sweep away the abominations which have grown up under our flag as under others.

There is a wide difference between flag patriotism and true patriotism. The latter includes reverence for the flag, the former is apt to include nothing else.
