In a discourse given at the Rev. Thomas Dixon's church in Brooklyn, January 24, Mrs. Mary E. Lease, the well-known lecturer, made this allusion to the spreading spirit of militarism which is mistaken in these days for patriotism and even for Christianity:—

"The modern parson is too often identified with the military. Visiting the other day a fashionable church not one hundred miles distant from this spot, crowded with well dressed people, I was shocked to see one of the side rooms stocked with firearms. They sang of the Prince of Peace, but with those loaded arms near by I thought a more appropriate song would be 'Johnny, get your gun.'"
