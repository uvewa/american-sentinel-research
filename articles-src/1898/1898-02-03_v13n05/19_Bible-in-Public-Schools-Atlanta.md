In Atlanta, Ga., the question of using the Bible in the public schools has been before the school authorities for some time past. A Bible text-book was first submitted, but was objected to by the Catholics and Jews. The Catholics demanded that the text-book give the Catholic version of the Ten Commandments, and also teach the Catholic doctrine on the subject of marriage and divorce. These changes were made, and others to satisfy the religious opinions of the Jews; and whether the text-book will now be acceptable remains to be seen. It should be evident, however, that attempts to teach the Bible in the public schools must be a fruitful source of religious controversy; while it cannot be denied that a book of religious teaching which is satisfactory to Protestants, Catholics, and Jews alike, must come far short of teaching religious truth as the Bible teaches it. It would of necessity be like the play of "Hamlet" with Hamlet left out.
