*George M. Steele, D. D., in Northwestern Christian Advocate.*

THAT the teachings of Jesus tended to the rectification of social wrongs there is no doubt. There is just as little doubt that this was not the primary object he had in view. A considerable class of teachers in our day hold the directly opposite opinion. Not all of them agree with what one frankly said: "We are to make men comfortable in this life without their concerning themselves much about the future." But to this complexion does all such teaching come at last.

"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added." This was the keynote of Christ's campaign for the reformation of humanity. He never adopted nor taught any social theories that were not primarily ethical or religious. We may safely challenge the production of a single utterance that must necessarily be interpreted as having an economic, political, or otherwise social character. These topics were utterly foreign to his intentions. When one came asking him to interfere in a case of alleged injustice as to a division of an inheritance, he exclaimed, in a tone of resentment, "Who made me a judge or a divider over you?" and proceeded to deliver a discourse on covetousness.

**HE IGNORED "SOCIOLOGY" AS SUCH.**

Jesus has been claimed by all sorts of reformers as an advocate and exponent each of his own particular cause. The socialists cite him as an authority; so do the labor reformers of all types; the land reformers; and even the anarchists. The communists of this day represent him as their first great advocate; though the communists of a century ago designated him as *Le scelerat*, "The infamous." But he had no word which can be tortured into an approval of any of the doctrines held by the parties in question, nor had he one word in condemnation of them. There is absolutely no teaching by him on any branch of sociology as such. The few elementary principles that were accepted in all civilized communities of that age and are nearly self-evident, he took for granted. So he did certain principles of physics, and meteorology, and chemistry, and astronomy. Many of the prevailing notions concerning these subjects were glaringly wrong, but he did not undertake to correct them.

We may search in vain through all the teachings of Jesus for any advice respecting the relations of employers and laborers, on the treatment of the criminal classes, on pauperism, distribution or exchange, on taxation or finance, on a system of education or the management of a family. He did not even organize a church, though unquestionably he expected his followers to do so, and he laid down no form of church government. He simply and sternly demanded of all men in all social relationships and in all callings and industries, righteousness and love. It was God's righteousness, founded on God's law and coming in God's way; not that which comes from human culture or tends to merely temporal welfare. The love was that which is "shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost," and which impels the subject of it to do to others as he would have them do to him. Once get man permanently fixed in this experience and there would be a solution of all the moral and social problems of life.

## LABOR AND TAXATION.

It may be said that there were at that time no such gigantic evils as now afflict human society. But this is as far as possible from the truth. Bad as the condition of certain classes is now, it was at that time incalculably worse. It is hardly credible—the statement of the oppression and degradation of the masses of the people. Take one particular, that of the taxes. We are told by competent authority that from two thirds to three fourths of the whole product was collected by the tax-gatherer. Those to whom the taxes were farmed out amassed enormous fortunes by extortion and robbery of the people. Laboring men, when not slaves, were crushed down into the most appalling poverty. There were frequent revolts and desperate insurrections, which were put down with such violence and cruelty as are never heard of in our time. Out of these came the formation of robber bands, roaming about the country and committing all manner of depredations; and those engaged in these outlawries justified themselves on the ground of the exaction and tyranny of their superiors. It was this that made the publicans so hated and execrated. It was because Jesus treated these and some other disreputable characters as proper subjects of his saving influence and capable of becoming members of the kingdom of God that he was at times distrusted and bitterly maligned.

But was he indifferent to this great mass of human misery? Was there in him no sympathy and no desire to mitigate this wretchedness? Assuredly this was a part of the incalculable burden which he bore. He looked upon those sufferers with infinite tender pity. He bore the griefs and carried the sorrows of the oppressed and afflicted. He was described as "a man of sorrows." "He had compassion on the multitude."

Why, then, did he not organize a crusade against these abuses and more explicitly and directly denounce them? It was certainly not because he regarded them of minor importance. Their removal was an essential part of his program for the emancipation of humanity. But he regarded them and all other social evils as the effects of certain causes, and to attack the former to the neglect of the latter would have been unreasonable and nugatory. He recognized sin and selfishness deeply entrenched in human nature as the source of all these moral and social disorders, and he preached a gospel which, if accepted and lived, would destroy those foul springs of evil and cure the wrongs which spring from them. He laid the ax at the root of the tree instead of pruning among the branches. "First make the tree good." It was spiritual regeneration of the individual at which he directly aimed. This and nothing else would save society.

## THE INDIVIDUAL, NOT "SOCIETY."

Many who are engaged in social reformatory work are urging the rectification of society as such. They claim that there has been too much attention paid to the conversion and salvation of individuals. There is no sanction for any such method in Christ's ministry. Indeed, it is preposterous in itself if the method is to be taken literally. Society is composed of individuals, and though individuals associated are something vastly more and greater than a mere aggregated mass, yet society can never be reached except through its members. It is not to be understood that Jesus placed no value, or small value, on the increase of power that comes through association. Society is one of the chief facts of humanity, and no one can, without great disadvantage, ignore or underrate it. But it must always be understood that individuals in society are of more importance than society itself. Society is a means not an end; and the means can in no case be regarded as greater than the end. Says F. W. Robertson: "It is easy to be a warm lover of England and yet not love one Englishman. Easy to set a great value on a flock of sheep and yet have no particular care for one sheep or lamb. If it were killed, another of the same species might replace it. Easy to have fine, large, liberal views about the working classes or the emancipation of the negroes and yet never have done a kind act to one."

## THE MISSION OF JESUS THEN AND ALWAYS.

The mission of Jesus, then, was ethical and religious and nothing else. Whatever wrongs of any sort existed then or exist now, their removal could be effected only by moral and spiritual agencies. Subsidiary to these agencies are all studies and investigations of a social and scientific character; these latter are of great importance and not to be ignored or neglected by religious men; but they are subordinate and not paramount or preëminent. This appears to have been the method of Jesus. He evidently expected his successors to do many things—he asserts even "greater things"—that he did not do. They were to be under the direction of the Holy Spirit, who was to "bring all things to their remembrance"—guide them as he himself had done, only on a broader scale.

What the church and Christianity want, then, to-day, is not a new economical or political or hygienic gospel, but the original gospel of Jesus, which calls for repentance and faith as conditions of regeneration and which insists on the characteristics laid down in the Sermon on the Mount and the other teachings of Jesus. This will include doing good to all men and in all ways, rectifying all wrongs whether industrial, commercial, domestic, or political. That this is not more fully done—and heaven knows how great is the lack!—is not because we need a new religion, but because we do not apply that which we have.
