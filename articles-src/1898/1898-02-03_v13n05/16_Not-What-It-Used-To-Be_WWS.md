WANTED—A Law that will make men seem good,
That will make a Sinner do as he should;
That will make him walk in the good old path,
Make him go to church and keep the Sabbath;
If he don't want to pray, make him pray, by force;
Each day from his Bible at least read a verse.
Such a law is needed just now, for you see
Religion is not what it used to be!

*Brantford, Ontario.*
