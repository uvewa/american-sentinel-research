Editor SENTINEL: The bill introduced in the Ontario Parliament, at the request of the "Lord's Day Alliance," to amend the "Lord's Day Act," and make it more stringent than at present, has been withdrawn. This was largely brought about by Sunday keepers themselves, who viewed with alarm the prospective workings of the bill, and vigorously protested against it.

The law as it now stands leaves the way open for religious persecution, and it was shown that should the amendment pass, very many of the industries of the country would be seriously menaced, if not entirely destroyed.

It is proposed, however, in the future to take up the matter again in a form that it is hoped will meet with popular approval.

Those who favored the bill severely censure the government for its action in withdrawing it.

As the country is on the eve of an election, the present government is accused of yielding because of political expediency.

Thus it may be seen that Sunday laws abound in innumerable difficulties, both to those who make them and those on whom they are enforced.

How much trouble would be avoided in this world if the matter of the Sabbath and religion in general were left between God and man.

M. C. GUILD.
