It will be good news to some Americans, that there is a prospective decline in the price of titles of royalty. The Italian government, says the New York Sun, intends to submit to parliament a bill which provides "that any one desiring the title of prince shall pay $8,000 therefor. Five thousand dollars will be the sum necessary to obtain the title of marquis, while $4,000 will buy the title of count. Any one may become a baron who is willing to pay $1,000 for the honor."

This is far below the price that American heiresses,— or their papas—have been in the habit of paying; and we know no reason too why these titles are not just as good as any.
