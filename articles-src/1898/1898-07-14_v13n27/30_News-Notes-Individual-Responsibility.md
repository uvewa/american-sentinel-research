THE question is, Do you realize what duties and responsibilities are brought to you by the swift procession of events? Do you stand as an individual? or do you stand as one of the mass? To do the former means more than to do the latter. Do you act upon your own judgment? or upon the judgment embodied in public sentiment? Are you willing to stand, if necessary, upon your own convictions of right, against a multitude who hold different views? These are questions that an individual may properly propound and answer to himself at any time after he has arrived at years of discretion.
