CHARACTER is the essential thing; not the character of a state or government, or of a body of men taken together, but individual character. Upon individual character depends national character. But whether politicians and legislators recognize this truth or not, it is important for you to recognize that your own character is, for you, more important than all things else. It is more important for you, that your own character should be upright, than that the like character should belong to the nation.
