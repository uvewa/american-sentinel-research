You are one of the people. The events which are transpiring upon the fields where the honor, prestige, and power of the Government are being put to the test, have an effect upon you, as they do upon others. The nation is developing national character, and this must affect, sooner or later, the fortunes of every individual under its jurisdiction; but more important to you is the fact that you are developing individual character, either through the influence of public sentiment around you, or from some other source. No one is an idle spectator of the great change that is in progress in national policy and sentiment. It affects in some way every person who dwells under the national flag.
