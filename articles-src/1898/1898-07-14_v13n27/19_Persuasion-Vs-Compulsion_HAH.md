BY H. A. HELLIER.

It is the duty of the State to protect liberty of conscience, and in matters of religion the extreme limits of its authority have been reached when it does that. It was because they recognized this principle clearly that the evangelical princes of Germany uttered that memorable protest, when in answer to the decree of the papacy, demanding the suppression of the Reformation, they said, "Let us reject this decree. In matters of conscience the majority have no power."

The annunciation of this principle is made more significant when we remember that when the princes said that, they realized that they were fighting against the powers of earth and hell, and that they would probably pay the penalty with their property, freedom, and even their lives. It is in the footsteps of these noble men that the Protestants of the world to-day profess to be following, yet how far have they strayed from that path! All over the land they have organized societies that have as their object the domination of the State by the Church. This they deny, and say, "We merely wish the State to put on righteousness," or "We wish to see Christ enthroned as King of the Commonwealth."

Now, religion has nothing to do with the State, or the State with religion if they both keep in their proper sphere, and only when religion has lost its vitalizing principle, and has become but a form, does she seek union with, or aid from, the State. Therefore, those, the majority who are clamoring for Sunday laws, and insist that the minority must observe their Puritanical Sabbath in deference to the majority, have, in this age of enlightenment lost sight of the vital principle of freedom of conscience, which was so clearly recognized by the evangelical princes amid the moral darkness of the sixteenth century.

How strange it is that these people cannot see that the State cannot put on righteousness, and how strange that they do not realize that this movement betrays the print of Satan's cloven foot, inasmuch as it is, like everything else emanating from him, the antipodes of the teachings of Christ; for he never attempted to legislate righteousness onto the State, or on the individuals composing it. No, indeed; his gentle voice of entreaty sinks into the hearts of individuals, saying, "Come unto me, alye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," and "Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely." Again, "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."

In everything Christ leaves the individual to choose whom he will serve; but his professed followers instead of following him and presenting his righteousness, thus persuading the sinner individually to accept it, must needs make(?) the sinner righteous by legislating righteousness onto the State. How they can make the State holy without first converting every sinner composing the State, they do not undertake to explain, for they cannot. If those who are doing this work of Satan, but who do not realize it as such, and who honestly think as did Paul, that they are doing God's service, would only go on bended knees before the throne of grace with hearts humbled by Christ's Spirit and ask for light on this question, God would flood them with light, and his Spirit would show whither their feet were tending, and lift them from the groveling ranks of the arch-enemy to the mighty ranks of the Omnipotent Prince who will soon vanquish all intrigue and sin, and rule the universe in peace and righteousness.
