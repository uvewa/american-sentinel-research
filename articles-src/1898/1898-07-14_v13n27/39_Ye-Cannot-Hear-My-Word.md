"Ye cannot hear my word," said Jesus to the angry Pharisees. The voice of prejudice and the clamor of self made it impossible for them to hear the simple truths which the common people heard gladly. He was speaking of life and righteousness, and simple souls who wanted help and strength for right living hung upon his words. The proud and worldly leaders of the church, to whom religion was unconnected with life, heard the same sound of words, but the words of life fell on deaf ears.—The Oriental Watchman.
