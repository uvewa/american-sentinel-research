It is not intended that you should lean upon public sentiment. Public sentiment is not an argument,—at least not a conclusive one. And in questions relating to moral right and wrong it is to be remembered that public sentiment is most often in the wrong. That public sentiment now glorifies war and demands an expansion of military power and of territory, does not settle the question for you. The decisions of other people do not settle any question of moral right for you. You must settle such questions for yourself; not of yourself, but by your own judgment, your own conscience, and that Word which is the divine standard of righteousness. Anything less than this is popery, and will if continued result in failure to form that character which is the all-important thing to be gained in this present life.
