A CIGAR dealer of South Norwalk, Conn., was recently fined for selling cigars on Sunday, the judge of the court holding that tobacco is not a necessity of life, and hence cannot be included among the things exempt from the law. In this the judge has struck out one of the absurdities of the Sunday law,—that which allows the sale of tobacco and forbids the sale of bread—but the unjust principle of Sunday laws is not made any better by relieving them of their inconsistencies.
