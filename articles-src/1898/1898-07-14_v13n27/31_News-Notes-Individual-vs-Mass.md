THE tendency of the age is to lose individual identity in the mass. The teaching which comes from sources regarded as authoritative says that individual judgment must be sacrificed to that of the majority, for the general good. This is quite proper in all matters which do not involve questions of moral right or wrong. But it is now said that public morality is paramount to individual morality; that there is a State conscience, and that to this the individual conscience must give way. And let no one imagine that these are questions which do not personally concern him. The issue may arise at any time which will oblige you to choose whether you will stand with the crowd upon their convictions, or against the crowd upon your own convictions; and the decision will depend upon the nature of the elements you are putting into your character to-day.
