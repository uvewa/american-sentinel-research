It will now no doubt be the order of the day for the churches throughout the land to erect their poles and have their flag-raising exercises. The initiatory, we believe, has been taken in this direction by the Trinity Baptist Church of Jersey City. On July 4, on a grass plot in front of the church, an American flag was hoisted to the top of a sixty foot pole, and unfurled to the breeze with much ado. Patriotic addresses were made by several ministers from other churches; the Declaration of Independence was read, and "America," "The Star Spangled Banner," and "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean," were sung, and a gun salate was given by the Boys' Brigade.

Christ said to his church: "Ye shall receive power when the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." Has the church received the power? Are they His witnesses? Christ said to the church: "Go ye into all the world, and PREACH THE GOSPEL to the whole creation."

Is the church preaching the gospel?

Christ said of his church: "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." Reader, is that true of the church to-day?
