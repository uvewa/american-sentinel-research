In Congress recently, during the consideration of a bill appropriating $25,000 to make improvements upon a piece of ground near the city of Washington, it was intimated that this was desired mainly to increase the value of a tract of land held by Methodists, who hoped to erect upon it a Methodist college. Mr. Henderson offered in favor of the measure the argument that "we have in this city a Catholic university, and Congress has given it every facility, by roadways and street improvements, to afford it easy facilities in connecting with the city." This illustrates how easily and naturally one wrong is sought to be justified by another wrong, when a wrong precedent has once been established.
