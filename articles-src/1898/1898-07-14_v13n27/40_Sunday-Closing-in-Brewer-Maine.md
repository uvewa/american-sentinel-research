*"Bangor Daily News," June 27.*

There is a strange condition of affairs in Brewer now, as a result of the effort to have all the stores, except drug stores, remain closed during Sundays.

A petition to the mayor last week, asking that the law against transacting unnecessary business on Sunday be enforced, resulted in City Marshal Fickets making a tour of the city on Saturday and notifying the dealers who have been keeping open shop on Sundays to close up in the future.

The dealers didn't like it a little bit, but it was thought that they would obey the order and keep their doors locked on Sunday.

They didn't close, however, for there was no time Sunday when a person could not have purchased anything that he wished in the way of ice cream, soda, cigars and groceries, and it must be said that many—yes, a great many Brewer people availed themselves of the opportunities, as they have for years past; and appeared glad that the order had not been obeyed.

It is understood that the signers of the petition are going to do their utmost to have the law enforced, while on the other hand the business men affected by the order say that they will make a fight.

Said one of the business men: "If they make us close our stores on Sunday, which is our best day, we'll take a hand at having the old Blue Laws enforced. They've no right to say that the soda and cigar stores shall be closed, but that the drug stores can keep open. The law doesn't give the drug stores the right to sell cigars and soda on Sunday, while the straight cigar and soda places must close.

"Another point if they persist in closing us up, we will see what we can do about closing business of all kinds, stables, drug stores, street cars, milk wagons and bakeries, and I guess we can stop Sunday pleasure riding and walking.

"Yes, sir; I think we can be able to give them all the Blue Laws they want."
