THE country is at war. It has been at war for two months and more; but now that heavy fighting has begun between the armies on Cuban soil, and many are falling in battle, the terrible fact of war becomes far more real to the public mind than it could be made by reports from the blockade around Havana. The fighting spirit of the people is aroused, and war and fighting are glorified in the popular sentiment of the day.
