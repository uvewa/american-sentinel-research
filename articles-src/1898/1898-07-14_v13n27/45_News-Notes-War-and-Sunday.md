We are told disaster will befall the nation because of its disregard for Sunday; we are told that God's displeasure is upon those who desecrate it; we are told that God will not fight the battles of those who do not honor that holy (?) day; and yet, in spite of all this, it would seem that the very opposite is the case. Two whole fleets have been wiped out of existence, with not the loss of a ship and only the death of one man on the American side; and to-day the nation is rejoicing because of the favor which they say God is bestowing upon them in their war with Spain.
