This all-important question is being settled to-day by great organizations of Christian young people, of which the Society of Christian Endeavor is now the foremost example. Shall they seek to the legislature—to politics—for power to accomplish the Christian work they have undertaken? or shall they seek "power from on high"—the power of God? In the illustration the movement seems to be towards the legislature; and this, unfortunately, correctly represents the situation. And in this lies the gravest peril to them and to the country.

"Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls." Jer. 6:16. "I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go." Isa. 48:17.
