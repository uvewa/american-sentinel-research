THAT was not a very conspicuous success which was scored by the W.C.T.U. on the occasion of the launching of the battleship "Kentucky." The W.C.T.U. of the State had interposed a strenuous objection to the custom of breaking a bottle of champagne over the bow of the vessel at the launching, and had prevailed upon the governor's daughter, who was chosen to perform the ceremony of "christening," to substitute a bottle of water for the customary bottle of liquor. But no sooner had the bottle of water been broken over the ship's bow, than bow and sides were bombarded with innumerable flasks filled with the "genuine article," from the hands of the hundreds of assembled Kentuckians, who were bent on being loyal to the traditions of their State. So that never before was a ship's bow so drenched with intoxicating liquor on the occasion of a "christening." After all, however, we do not think the W.C.T.U. ought to feel very bad about it. It is a much better way of using up whiskey than to drink it, and as everybody knows the close connection there is between whiskey and fighting, it really seems that no person ought to object to such use of it on the ground of propriety. The "Kentucky" ought now to become the best fighter in the navy.
