An important decision touching the question of the legality of religious exercises in the public schools of Missouri, is that lately rendered by Attorney-General Crow, of that State. The decision is in answer to the following questions raised by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, John R. Kirk:

"1st. Is there legal authority for such religious exercises?

"2nd. If there is authority for such religious exercise within school hours, can the teacher require pupils of the school to give attention to the prayer if they do not volunteer to do so; or, if the teacher has authority to conduct such religious exercise, may a portion of the children retain their seats and pursue such studies as they prefer to pursue during the exercise?"

The attorney-general said in reply:

"Reading the Lord's Prayer is certainly manifesting that degree of reverence which constitutes worship. The continuous reading of the Bible and repeating the Lord's Prayer cannot be done by believers in Christianity without feelings of deepest gratitude and a holy sense of honor, reverence, adoration and homage to the Supreme Being, which is the essence of worship.

"This exercise, therefore, being a form of religious worship, and the same being done as one of the rules and exercises of our public schools, it necessarily and logically follows that a public school house is therefore made a place of worship. Referring now to that part of our constitution which provides 'that no person can be compelled to erect, support, or attend any place of worship,' it must be borne in mind that the tax paid by our citizens for the erection and maintenance of the public schools is an involuntary tax, one which they are by the provisions of law 'compelled to pay.' Thus he becomes 'compelled' to erect, support, and maintain a place of worship, if such religious worship is suffered in a public school. . . .

"I am, therefore, of the opinion that religious worship can not be indulged in any of our public schools, and that repeating the Lord's Prayer, being, as suggested by you, religious worship, may be excluded therefrom. . . .

"To compel any pupil against his conscience to participate and observe any such exercise is a vile perversion of the Constitution guaranteeing freedom of conscience and religious worship. . . .

"Such practice would produce religious and sectarian strife in every school district in the state. No matter how innocent or honestly done, it would constitute the first step toward a union of church and state, which logically involves the last step."

Let no one entertain the idea that antagonism to the conducting of religious exercises in the public schools necessarily means antagonism to religion. Such antagonism as that represented in the above decision is based upon justice; and there is no antagonism between justice and Christianity. On the contrary, Christianity demands that justice be done in every matter; hence it is true that Christianity itself demands that religious exercises should not be conducted in the public schools.

When religion enters into partnership with the state in any matter, it becomes debased and changed into a moral poison. Out of regard therefore both for religion and for mankind, we oppose such a partnership in the public schools.
