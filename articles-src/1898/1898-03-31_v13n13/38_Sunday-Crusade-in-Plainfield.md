A CRUSADE for Sunday enforcement was recently begun in the city of Plainfield, N.J. The first Sunday "raid" by the police resulted in eleven arrests. Three of these pleaded guilty and were fined $5 each, the alternative of paying being twenty days in jail. The others were held for trial. The result was, however, when the matter was tested in court, that the jury disagreed; and the crusade seems likely not to prove the success that was anticipated.
