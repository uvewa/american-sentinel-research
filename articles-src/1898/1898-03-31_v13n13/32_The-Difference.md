A little boy, who in the course of some conversation of his elders, heard a good deal of talk about the progress of civilization, approached his grandfather, who was taking no part in the talk.

"Grandpa," said the child, "what is the difference between civilization and barbarism?"

"Barbarism, my boy," answered the old man, "is killing your enemy with a hatchet at a distance of a step, and civilization is killing him with a bombshell twelve miles away!"—Youth's Companion.
