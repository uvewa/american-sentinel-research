It is the fond dream of many that the kingdom of God is to be ushered in, or at least hastened, by political action. It was Miss Willard who said some years since: "The kingdom of God must enter the realm of law through the gateway of politics." But what is the kingdom of God?

In the epistle to the Romans, the apostle says, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." Certainly in this sense the coming of the kingdom of God could be in no way hastened by political action. Politics is not a means of grace.

Wherever Christ reigns there is his kingdom. To his disciples he said, "Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power. And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them. And his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses and they were talking with Jesus." And again he said, "The kingdom of God is within you."

In the transfiguration, they saw the kingdom of God in miniature; saw it as it will exist when all God's people shall be gathered home. There was Christ the King, all glorious in his royal apparel; there, too, were Moses and Elias; the first representing those who, having fallen asleep in Jesus, will be raised to immortality at his appearing; the second, representing the living saints who shall be changed to immortality and be translated without seeing death, even as was Elijah.

But the heart subdued by the love of God, cleansed by the blood of Christ, changed by the transforming influence of the Spirit of God, is also a fit type of the kingdom of God, for there is the new man, the subject to Christ the everlasting King. There is a throne in every heart and Christ is the lawful king. Too often the usurper sits enthroned where Christ should reign, but the kingdom belongs none the less to God; so that it is true of every man, whether he recognizes the fact or not, that the kingdom of God is within him. But the ushering in of the kingdom of God in this sense is beyond the power of earthly rulers.

Our Lord said, "My kingdom is not of this world." And when some would have taken him by force and made him a king he hid himself from them. Had he come bearing the symbols of a princely lineage, had he sought honor of men, had he courted political preferment, in short, had he coveted an earthly throne, doubtless the multitudes who scorned him and who joined in the cruel cry, Crucify him, crucify him! would have united in crowning him king of the Jews.

But Jesus Christ received not honor of men. They could add nothing to him. Each can for himself give to his Lord that which is already his—"A sinful, wayward heart;" and this once given, Christ will cleanse it, making it a fit temple for his own abode; but men can never give to Christ any other kingdom than their own hearts. He receives his kingdom from the Father, who says to him, "Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." Ps. 2:8,9.

Our Saviour likened himself to a nobleman going into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return. Cf. Mark 13:34 with Luke 19:11,12. He receives that kingdom as promised in the second Psalm, at the conclusion of the judgment described in Dan. 7:9,10. This judgment decides who are to be the subjects of that kingdom. The giving of the kingdom is described in verses 13 and 14. Following this comes the ruling with a rod of iron, the breaking in pieces like a potter's vessel. "According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands will he repay recompense." Isa. 59:18. "Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS." Rev. 19:15,16.

This earth was not created to be forever the abode of sin and rebellion against God. It was created to be peopled with a race loyal to their Creator. "For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited; I am the Lord and there is none else." Isa. 45:18. Of the character of those who are to inhabit the earth, the psalmist says: "The meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace."

"The Lord knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be forever." Ps. 37:11,18. The apostle Peter, also, speaking of God's purpose concerning the earth, says that notwithstanding the fact that it is to be destroyed by fire, even as it was once overthrown by water, "Nevertheless, we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:13.

The future glorious kingdom of God for which our Saviour teaches us to pray, saying, "Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth," is, then, nothing less than this earth purged by the fires of the last day, and restored to its Eden glory by the power of him who sits upon the throne, when he shall say in the presence of all his redeemed people, "Behold, I make all things new." Then from the ashes of the present world shall come forth the new earth, promised long; the hope of saints and sages, of patriarchs and prophets; and as before the astonished gaze of the saved of all ages it springs at once into verdure, as they see it "rejoice and blossom as the rose," as "the excellency of Carmel and Sharon" are given unto it, from the lips of that throng "which no man can number," will burst that glad shout of praise, "Blessing and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb forever and ever."

The work of preparing subjects for this glorious kingdom is now going on in the earth. This gospel of the kingdom is being preached "in all the world for a witness" (Matt. 24:14); and soon the end will come. But only the gospel can prepare men to enter this kingdom; and only its preaching in the demonstration and power of the Spirit of God can hasten the coming of that day. "Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." "The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this." Human governments are powerless in this matter. God alone "can bring a clean thing out of an unclean."
