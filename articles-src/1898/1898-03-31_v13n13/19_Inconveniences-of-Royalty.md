As English paper says that the other day, when Queen Victoria was seated in her drawing-room, with several of her household in attendance, the lamp placed close beside her began to smoke. To the horror and astonishment of the company the Queen promptly raised her august hand and turned down the flame.

"Your majesty," said the lady in waiting in awestruck tones, "why did you trouble to do that yourself?"

"Because," said the Queen, "if I had called out, 'This lamp is smoking!' one of you ladies would have said to the equerry, 'See! the lamp is smoking!' and the equerry would have called out to the nearest servant, 'Here! the Queen's lamp is smoking!' and that servant would have called to a footman to attend to it, and all the time the lamp would have gone on smoking; so I preferred to turn it down myself."
