MAJORITIES seldom have a conviction.

WE ought to obey God rather than man.—Bible.

TRUE worship springs from voluntary loving service.

PURE civil government never persecuted because of religious belief.

It was with a kiss that Judas betrayed his divine Master; and we should all be admonished, whatever our faith may be, that the rights of conscience can not be so successfully assailed as under the pretext of holiness.—Richard M. Johnson.

A GOVERNMENT without law is no government at all; but it does not follow that that law should be religious in its character.

THE acts of faith and obedience to which the gospel calls us is a reasonable service to which we are to be drawn by the mercies of God and not driven by the terrors of men.—Clark's History of Intolerance.

No human law has a right to interfere with a man's belief, his freedom of conscience, his right to worship his Creator when and how he will, so long as he does not trespass on the rights of others.—T. E. Richardson.

WE can not consistently deny liberty to our fellow-man and expect long to have it granted to us.

THE true doctrine of Christian liberty is not simply our right to think and act for ourselves, but the recognition on our part of the right of the other man to think and act for himself.

W. E. C.
