As regards the manner in which Spanish government in Cuba served the interests of the people, it will be of interest to refer again to the speech of Senator Gallinger. Upon that point he said: "Let us look at the matter of taxation. In addition to all direct and indirect taxes on real estate, there is a tax on every door, every window, and every chimney in every house. There is a tax on every letter in every business sign. There is a tax on every name on every hotel register. Licenses are required to build houses and to paint houses. There is a tax on food animals as a whole and also a special tax on the horns, the hoof, and the hides. In addition to all this, the interest on the debt is a tremendous burden, the salary of Spanish officials is beyond all reason, and the amount of money wrung from the Cubans to keep the Madrid Government from complete insolvency is simply enormous. What would we think of such a government as that? No people on the face of the earth have been so oppressed, the treasury of Spain being literally supplied from the revenue extorted from Cuba and the Philippine Islands."
