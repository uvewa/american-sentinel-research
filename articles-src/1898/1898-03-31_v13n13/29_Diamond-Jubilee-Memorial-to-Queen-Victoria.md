"Present Truth," London, Eng.

The following petition signed by 336,250 women of the United Kingdom, has been laid before Her Majesty by the Secretary of State. None but women were allowed to sign it, and all signatures were of those over sixteen years of age. The petition, it will be seen, asks for nothing that can in any way affect the petitioners personally, but is concerned only with the welfare of others. There is no desire to curtail religious liberty, but there is a feeling that there should not be a class privileged under the name of liberty to exercise despotism. It is no wonder, however, if the followers of him who exalts himself above the law of God, should treat with contempt all human law:

"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY—

"We, your Majesty's loyal and loving subjects, while thankfully acknowledging the goodness of Almighty God in preserving your valuable life, and extending your beneficent reign to a period beyond that enjoyed by any of your royal predecessors; and while further acknowledging the innumerable blessings which have been bestowed upon your subjects throughout your vast dominions, and the many humane laws which have been sanctioned by Your Majesty for the promotion of their well being, happiness and freedom; desire earnestly to plead on behalf of a large number of women within these realms, who do not share in such freedom, benefits and blessings, as the rest of Your Majesty's subjects are favored to enjoy.

"Your Majesty's memorialists venture to point out the following facts:—

"(a) That since the early part of the present century 865 convents have been established in Great Britain and Ireland, about 800 having been instituted during Your Majesty's reign.

"(b) That no public record of the number of inmates of these institutions is known to exist; but it is estimated that the women in these convents must at the present time be not less than 20,000.

"(c) That many young persons of tender age are induced in a moment of enthusiasm, and by means of false and highly-colored representations of the character of a nun's life—together with the promise of celestial rewards at its close—to enter convents, and find, when awakened to the dread realities around them, that they are involved in hopeless imprisonment.

"(d) That with regard to the structural arrangements of conventional buildings, many of them are surrounded by high walls, that both the entrance and the inner doors are trebly secured, and that underground cells are known to exist; showing that all possible means are used for giving effect to the canon-law of the church of Rome, which inexorably insists that nuns be made veritable prisoners for life. This law enacts, 'That nunneries be carefully closed and egress forbidden to the nuns under any pretext whatever without episcopal license,' i. e., of those who are deeply interested in keeping them where they are. Further on it is stated that 'if a nun of her own accord throws off her habit [desirous of returning to her natural life] no allegation should be heard, but being compelled to return to the Convent, they must be punished as apostates.'" This law is supreme in every enclosed convent in Your Majesty's dominions.

"(e) That the knotted cord disciplines are used more or less in all Convents, and the more austere orders use the steel-spiked wire whips, called iron disciplines, and other terrible instruments of torture.

"(f) That nuns, being under vows, are not free agents. The will of the Superior is in all Convents absolute, and all correspondence to and from the Convent is read by her or by one whom she may delegate; and all communications not approved by the Superior are withheld, mutilated or destroyed, as she may determine. Generally an iron grating, built in the wall, separates the nun from her visitor, whilst close by stands another nun, to hear every word, and spy upon every action passing between them. Thus, free intercourse is rendered impossible, and no nun has the opportunity of making known to her friends without, any wrong from which she may be suffering.

"(g) That nuns have been transported from the British Isles against their will; your Majesty's memorialists therefore plead that the deportation of nuns from English Convents to affiliated institutions on the Continent should be made impossible without due registration and license from the civil authorities.

"(h) That private burial grounds being attached to Convents, in which interments have been seen to take place at night, and having regard to the fact that there is no specific registration existing of the names and numbers of the inmates, the Convent authorities have great facilities for avoiding the holding of coroners' inquests, and for evading the provisions of the burial laws.

"(i) That the inspection of prisons, lunatic asylums, factories, workshops, etc., has brought comfort and liberty to many thousands of Your Majesty's subjects; while Convents in Great Britain, unlike those even in Roman Catholic countries, are exempt from any kind of state supervision.

"(j) That your memorialists are mindful of the benefits conferred under British rule, upon your Majesty's Indian subjects by the abolition of a long established religious rite, called Suttee, whereby Hindoo widows, under the delusion that they would thereby attain eternal beatitude, immolated themselves upon the funeral pile of their deceased husbands, causing hundreds of lives to be sacrificed annually, which abolition resulted in giving general satisfaction to Your Majesty's subjects. They are therefore absolutely convinced of the necessity for equally stringent laws being passed to prevent practices not less unnatural and cruel and withal of life-long duration inseparable from Convent life.

"Your Majesty's memorialists therefore humbly pray that Your Majesty may be graciously pleased, in the circumstances above stated, to cause a searching inquiry to be made into the system and practices of all conventional establishments within your realm, and to institute such public control over them, as shall preclude the possibility of any of your subjects immured therein, being deprived of the benefit and protection of Your Majesty's laws.

"And your memorialists will ever pray."
