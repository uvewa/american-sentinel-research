### EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:

The case of Ellis H. Roberts, Treasurer of the United States, appellant, vs. Joseph Bradfield, was argued in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, on the 8th inst. The remarkable feature of the argument was contained in a printed pamphlet bound with the brief of the appellant, and signed by Henry E. Davis, attorney of the United States for the District of Columbia, and D. W. Baker, his assistant, both of whom were designated by the attorney-general to act as counsel for treasurer Roberts. Referring to the act of Congress of March 3, 1897, in so far as it declares against sectarian appropriations, they say:

"The bare declaration in regard to the policy of the government is not in itself an enactment, and really means nothing. It was put in the act to appease certain outgoing members of Congress, who for years had clamored against so-called sectarian institutions and sectarian appropriations; and possibly the framers of the act knew themselves that it meant nothing; while those who were pleased with the declaration were not wise enough to know its effect."

What De Lome said about President McKinley was less reprehensible than the foregoing assertion; because this assertion is made by the duly-accredited attorneys of the Executive Department, imputing equivocation, mental reservation, and moral torpitude to the latter. I called on Treasurer Roberts this morning and asked him to repudiate the words and the sentiment they convey; but after reading the language in the brief, he declined to repudiate it."

JOSEPH BRADFIELD.

Washington, D. C., March 10.
