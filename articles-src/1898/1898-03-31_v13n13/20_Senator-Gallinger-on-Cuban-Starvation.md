After all that has been said about the horrors of Armenia and of India, and the profound interest that has been awakened thereby throughout the civilized world, the following words of Senator Gallinger relative to the situation in Cuba, spoken in the U. S. Senate on the 23rd inst., need no apology for coming to the ears of the American people.

SENATOR GALLINGER had just returned from a trip to Cuba, and spoke from the standpoint of his personal investigations in the island. In his speech he said: "The number of people who have starved in Cuba will never be definitely known. It is estimated that 800,000 were driven from their homes into the cities and towns. I had it from Spanish authority that, according to their figures, 225,000 have already perished, but it is said that the Red Cross Society is in possession of figures showing that 425,000 Cubans have died as a result of Spanish cruelty from starvation, and that 200,000 more must inevitably die, making an aggregate of 625,000, or almost twice the population of the District of Columbia or of the State of New Hampshire. Dr. Lesser, an authority on the results of famine, who is on the ground, says that of the 175,000 not taken into account above, at least 5 per cent. of them will die, making a grand total of 634,000 deaths of men, women, and children as a result of Weyler's inhuman and barbarous decree. It may be that the Government of Spain and the cities of Havana and Mantanzas are doing something to relieve this terrible suffering, but if so I did not see any evidence of it. The hope of the poor remaining sufferers is in this great Government, and Heaven be thanked, our people are reaching out the hand of sympathy and affectionate interest in the shape of food, medicine, and clothing."
