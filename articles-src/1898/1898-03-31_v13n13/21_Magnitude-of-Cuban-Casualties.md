From carefully-prepared statistics, it appears that during the great civil war in America, 150,000 lives were lost on the Federal side, and 133,000 on the side of the Confederacy. By comparing these figures with those furnished by investigations in Cuba, some idea may be gathered of the awful magnitude of the storm of death and ruin that has been sweeping the island for the past two years, while it was asserted by Spain and recognized as a fact by this Government, that no war existed in Cuba at all! It should be remembered also that comparatively few of the casualties of our civil war were attended by horrors greater than that of swift death on the field of battle; and the victims were for the most part brave men, and not women and children.
