ON Sunday, January 9, says the Indian Witness, of Calcutta, there was a collection taken in all the Roman Catholic churches and chapels of that city "for the extermination of slavery in America,"—this being one of two collections in the year prescribed by the pope. There being no slavery in America save in the Catholic portion of it, we are left to wonder at the consistency of taking up a collection in one part of the papal household for the abolition of slavery in another.
