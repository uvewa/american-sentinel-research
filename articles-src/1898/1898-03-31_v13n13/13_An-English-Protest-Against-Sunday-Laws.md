ONE of the leading dailies of London, Eng.,—the Chronicle—recently in taking notice of a prosecution under the Sunday statutes, said:—

"When will people learn that it is impossible to enforce a religious observance of Sunday by law? Or when will Parliament spare half an hour for the repeal of our ridiculous Sabbatarian acts? Now and again some poor old woman in a slum is summoned by a spy under a statute of Elizabeth for having sold him two kippers on a Sunday; and now at Caversham, near Reading, three men have been prosecuted for playing football on Sunday afternoon, contrary to an early act of Charles I. The magistrates, under the chairmanship of Lord Saye and Sele (whose name in itself savors of Charles I.'s reign), of course, dismissed the summons, not because it was spiteful and ludicrous, but because the three men 'did not constitute a concourse of non-parishioners within the meaning of the act.' The act forbids all sports and pastimes on Sundays to any concourse of non-parishioners, whilst all of us, even if parishioners, are debarred from bear-baiting, bull-baiting, interludes, common plays, or any other unlawful exercises or pastimes such as are so popular amongst all ages and all classes to-day. It is a strange thing that the moment we touch law we seem as a nation to lose our sense of absurdity. And as to people who get up summonses of this kind, they are undoubtedly the direct descendants of those Puritans who hated bear-baiting, not because it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators."

The Chronicle fails, however, to recognize that all observance of Sunday must be religious, since Sunday is a purely religious institution.
