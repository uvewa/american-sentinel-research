"In our last talk we explained the time, times, and dividing of time," began Mrs. Ross. "and I think it will be interesting to notice when and how this same period is again mentioned. You may read Rev. 13:5."

Charlie read: "'And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies: and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.'

"Of what prophecy does this remind you, Charlie?"

"Of the prophecy in Dan. 7:24 and 25, about the papal horn. Why, mama, it is almost the same. Only there's nothing in it about wearing out the saints."

"Read the 7th verse."

"'And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them.'"

"This must refer to the same power. What I wished to explain first is the 42 months. You remember that the time, times, and dividing of or half a time, was 1260 years. The Jews reckoned 30 days to a month. How many days would 42 months make?"

Charlie figured a moment and said, "1260 days."

"Then as each day in prophecy is a year, you have 1260 years for the continuance of this power."

"What power was it?"

"That is the answer to one problem for to-day. You may read the first verse."

"'And I stood on the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.'

"Now, Charlie, we have a few review questions. What does water represent in prophecy?"

"Peoples, nations, and tongues." (Proof, Rev. 17: 15.)

"What does a beast represent?"

"A kingdom or government, an earthly power." (Dan. 7:23.)

"What do the horns on this beast stand for?"

"For the ten kingdoms of Rome, perhaps."

"Well, as we do not deal in 'perhapses,' you may read concerning them in the 17th chapter, 12th verse."

"'And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet.'

"When was John writing this prophecy?"

"In A. D. 96."

"In his day these kings had not yet risen. But what about the heads? Read in the Revised Version Rev. 17: 10."

Charlie read: "And these are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is yet to come; and when he cometh he must continue a short space. And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven."

"Well, mama, this is the greatest puzzle we have studied. What do you think these heads represented?"

"The forms or heads of governments."

"How many forms of government was Rome ruled under up to the time of John's writing?"

"Five, according to prophecy."

"Can you name them?"

"I'll try. Let me see,—kings, consuls, decemvirs, triumvirates, dictators."

"John says, 'five are fallen.' These had passed away. 'One is.' What form was Rome under in John's day?"

"Emperors."

"Then there was one to come who was to continue a short space. This one was called the ex-arch of Ravenna; but it is never really reckoned among the Roman heads. You see the prophet is more exact than the historian. Now we come to the seventh head. What was that?"

"The papacy."

"Very well; we have now disposed of the heads, and will turn to the horns. When was Rome divided into ten kingdoms?"

"Between the years 356 and 483 A. D."

"But mama, this whole beast—horns, heads and all—seems to be swallowed up entirely by the seventh head; for surely it was the papacy that warred on the saints, spoke great things, and continued in power 1260 years."

"You are right, Charlie. This beast represents papal Rome. The dragon of the 12th chapter was a beast with seven heads and ten horns, and represented the pagan phase of Rome: and as we look deeply into the spirit of both, we see behind them the old serpent which deceiveth the whole world. To whom did the dragon give his seat and great authority? Read Rev. 13:2."

"'And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.'"

"You remember that it was through Justinian, a pagan emperor, that the bishop of the church of Rome received his seat in the city of Rome, and his authority."

"Yes; that is clear. But I have been struck with this beast as with something familiar. I notice that he has all the characteristics of the four beasts of Daniel—a mouth like a lion, feet like a bear, body like a leopard, and the 'dreadful and terrible' beast's power. Beside all these features, which point back to Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and pagan Rome, he has a mouth speaking great things, wears out the saints, and continues in power as long as the horn of Daniel was to continue. What a wonderful prophecy!"

"It is, indeed; and as these characteristics of the old kingdoms are united in this beast, we need not be surprised at the manifestation of the old persecuting spirit.

"What power did the prophet see this beast exercising? Read the last of the 3rd verse."

"'All the world wondered after the beast,' read Charlie;

"Now read the last of the 7th."

"'And power was given him over all kindreds, and nations, and tongues.'

"How many shall worship him?"

"'And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.'

"This used to puzzle me very much, and I have often prayed to be saved from worshiping the beast. Now I know that it means more than having reverence for the papacy. To worship the beast is simply to worship and serve self. The beast is only the full outcome of the self principle. So still I pray with growing understanding to be saved from dependence upon men, to be saved from leaning to my own understanding, or from resting upon the opinions and traditions of humanity. Jeremiah says, 'Cursed is the man who trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm.'

"Now read in the 3rd verse what was to happen to the head of this beast."

"'And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death: and his deadly wound was healed.'"

"With this you may also read the 10th verse."

"'He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.'

"When was the papal head wounded, sent into captivity and into death?"

"In 1798, when the pope was taken to France, and died in exile."

"'His deadly wound was healed,' it says; and yet the pope, who is the head of this power, is still called the 'prisoner of the Vatican.'"

"Do you think, mama, the papacy will ever again have power to persecute the people of God?"

"We'll talk about that another time, Charlie. There is one more verse I wish to explain to-day. It is the 18th."

Charlie read: "'Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.'

"Now we are to reckon the number of a man, whose number is the number of the beast. Two men have been pointed out in the Scriptures. One is the 'Son of man,' the other the 'son of perdition,' or the 'man of sin.'

"One day a traveler was visiting the city of Rome, and down the street came a papal procession with flaunting banners. Amid the images of saints and apostles, on a high throne sat the pope, wearing his blazing crown. In jewelled letters upon it the traveler saw the words, 'Vicarivs Filii Dei,' and the words came to his mind 'the number of the beast.' Hastening home he counted the numerals of this title, thus: v, 5; i, 1; c, 100; i, 1; v, 5; i, 1; l, 50; i, 1; i, 1; d, 500; i, 1; and found that the sum of the numerals in the title is 666, the 'number of the beast.'"

"Well, mama, that seems queer no matter what it may mean; but I shall never see the picture of the pope's hat again without thinking, 666." F. B.
