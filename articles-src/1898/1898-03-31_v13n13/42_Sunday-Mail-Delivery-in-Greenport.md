THE town of Greenport, L. I., is agitated over the question of mail delivery on Sundays. Two prominent church workers of the place, it is said, want the post office closed on the ground that some persons go there for mail on Sundays when they ought to go to church. Of course(?) these individuals will go to church as soon as they find that they cannot go to the post-office on Sundays, and especially when they learn that it was the church that closed the post-office against them.
