Just one thing was presented as possible for me to do for my friend's husband; that was to send him a message through the mail. I felt how unconventional it would be, and hesitated a long time; but at last as I could get no rest from the burden of it, I wrote a very brief note of gospel warning and invitation, based on what I had discovered, when he had compelled me to see him at his worst. I appealed to his fatherly nature, and entreated him for the sake of his children to stop short in the course that was taking him to eternal ruin. I did not "mince matters." I realized the necessity of saying what I had to say in as few and forcible words as possible so that their meaning should not escape a muddled brain, or be utterly lost if flung away in a flash of anger.

When the note was ready for the mail I laid it on a chair before me, and kneeling in prayer gave it to the Lord. "You made me do it," was my trembling appeal, "and now you must go with it, or it had better never have been done." That prayer was easy, for I felt a great sense of need. I was not yet, however, free from the feeling that I had done a very strange, and perhaps an unwarrantable thing; and as soon as the letter had gone to the letter box, I would have given anything to have had it back safely in my hands again. All the morning I was harassed and unable to go on with the literary work which was occupying me during those days; until again I knelt and said to God, "Lord, you made me do this; I wrote that letter to that bad man for you; now take the burden of it away and let me go about my work, for I must do it. I cannot be worried over this any longer. I must depend on you to take care of this strange thing which you compelled me to do. I give it up,—take care of it,—I will trust it all to you!" And from that instant I was free. When three o'clock came I found that I could pray with such faith and confidence as I had not had at any time before since I had assumed this strange new responsibility.

It was in this experience that I learned the relation between words and deeds in prayer; that prayer to be real must have in it the elements of activity.

Two or three days thereafter as I was on my way to the Public Library I met my friend; she grasped my hand and said:—

"I was going to see you; come into this office; I want to tell you something."

We entered into a sewing machine store and found a corner where we could talk quietly, when she said:—

"The strangest thing has happened. Mr. R. came home the other day sober, threw a letter into my lap and said: 'Read that'! It was your letter. I read it, he standing before me; I knew he was watching me close; O, but I was afraid! I thought:—she does not dream of what she is doing to me by this letter. I did not dare let him know when I had finished it; I expected blows; I did not know what dreadful thing might happen, so I kept acting as though I could not quite make it all out; but at last he said: 'Well, what do you think of that?' I tried to answer carelessly, but I had to try two or three times before I could say, 'I don't know: what do you think?'"

Then it was with tears and sobs mingled with laughter that she tried to repeat what he had said. It was all so different from anything that she could have expected, as God's work always must be.

"'Roxy,' he said, 'it is God's truth, every word of it; I am a lost man, and I want you to pray for me.' Just think of that. He asked me to pray for him when I had expected curses and perhaps blows. O, how I prayed! We knelt there together for the first time in all our lives, and I never thought of a doubt or a fear. I just told Our Father all about him, and us all, and how J. cried and prayed! I never would have believed it possible, for he never cries. He is a very proud man. It was a proof of God such as I have needed all these years. He has been converted truly, and I shall always be so glad it was at home with me, for I thought he had no more love for me. I thought he hated me. I should have supposed I must get out of the way if there had been any signs that he was thinking of trying to do different; that the sight of me would have driven every good thought away. God sent him home to me in this way, for my good I know. I wanted to fly to you, but we have had so much talking and praying to do that I couldn't get to it, until this morning. It has made a revolution in our home, and my boy feels the change already."

I must leave my readers to imagine the song of praise that filled our hearts, and the effect which this story of salvation had on me. It was a lesson to me, that I have tried never to forget; and as I recall it, it always stands as a demonstration of how truly the Holy Spirit has led us in ways that we had not known from the beginning of our work.

This man's career was woven in with the development of our rescue work for men, and he became one of our strong helpers.

What volumes have been written, what laborious "sermons" preached, what ingenuity exercised, on the part of men, to overthrow that simple statement of Scripture which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath"! What a hard work it is, truly, for puny man to overthrow one of the words of God! As well might one try to beat down Gibraltar with a club.
