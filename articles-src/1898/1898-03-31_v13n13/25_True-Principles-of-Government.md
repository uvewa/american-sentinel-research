But it is not true that the government is the most sacred thing on earth. It is not true that any government is paramount to the people under it. Government is but the creature, and the people constitute its creator. Government, like anything else, is of value only as it fulfills the purpose for which it was instituted. In whatever degree it becomes perverted, its value is lessened. And it is a fact that in almost every country on the earth, from the time of Nimrod down to the present, human government has perverted the object of its institution on the earth. It remained for the founders of this Republic, after the lapse of centuries of such perversion, to announce to the world once more the true principles of government, and to set up a government upon those principles. The Declaration of Independence, declaring that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that the purpose of governments is to preserve these rights, set forth the principles of government; and the American Constitution came into being as the foundation of a government established upon them.
