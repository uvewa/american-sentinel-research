This is only one point in which the Spanish government fails to fulfill the purpose of government, improving an injury rather than a benefit to the people. Another and even greater one consists in its union with the church. For of all things that sap the vitality of nations and bring demoralization and degeneracy upon the people, there is nothing that takes precedence of a union of church and state.
