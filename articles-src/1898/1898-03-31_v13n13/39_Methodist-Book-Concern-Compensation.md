BY the signature of the President, recently affixed to the measure giving compensation for war damages to the Methodist Book Concern of Nashville, Tenn., that institution has received $288,000 which does not belong to it. It is strange that an institution which professes to be established in the interests of Christianity and to rest upon Christian principles, is willing to go on record as dishonest before the world. The moral influence of such action must certainly be a minus quantity. It is said, by the way, that $288,000 is more than the entire plant was worth, which was not destroyed, but only damaged, by its occupation by the Federal troops.
