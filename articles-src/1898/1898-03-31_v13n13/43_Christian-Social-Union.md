ONE can hardly keep track of all the organizations that are springing up these days upon the idea of the enforced application of the divine law to political and social life. The latest that we have noticed is the "Christian Social Union," the objects of which are: "1. To claim for the Christian law the ultimate authority to rule social practice. 2. To study in common how to apply the moral truths and principles of Christianity to social and economic difficulties of the present time," etc. How difficult it seems to be for some people to realize that God himself knew of but one way in which the Christian law could be made applicable in a beneficial way to human affairs, and that required of him an infinite sacrifice; that God made this sacrifice in the death of his only Son on the cross; and that this one way provided by him is the gospel of Jesus Christ! There is no salvation for anything in this world but by the gospel.
