And why is all this appalling sacrifice of human life, with its attendant flood of suffering and ruin? Oh, it is in order that the government in Cuba may continue to be Spanish, and not some other government! A weighty reason, truly, for the killing of hundreds of thousands of people! Yet it illustrates the principle upon which all human governments proceed. Each one of them assumes the right to perpetuate its own existence, at no matter what sacrifice of human life and happiness. What then is government, that it should be so much more sacred than humanity? Is there anything, indeed, on earth, or more importance than human welfare?
