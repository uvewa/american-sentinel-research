All Europe is to-day, as it has been for years, an armed camp. Why is this? Is it because all the people there love to fight with one another?—Oh, no; nobody supposes that. A great many of them have such a dislike for it that they are willing to journey thousands of miles to a strange country, where they will not have to spend years of the best part of their lives in military service. Is it because the people of one nation are afraid that the people of another nation are bent on doing them some injury? or because they contemplate some great misery that would overtake them in case the government were overthrown?—No; the people themselves, in any nation, are not bent upon injuring other people; indeed, the spread of socialism through Europe has developed a bond of sympathy and union between the people of the various nations in opposition to the spirit of war, so that it has been a question whether the socialist movement, should it continue to augment, would not be able soon to prevent war through the simple refusal of the common people—its adherents—to fight at the dictation of their rulers. Nor can it be said that in most of the countries of Europe, the people would not be just as well off under another government than the one which now holds their allegiance. There is no reason to doubt that should England conquer those countries and set up her own government in the place of those now existing, the people would be better off than they were before; for Anglo-Saxon civilization is the best that the world affords. But should England attempt it, the very people who would be benefitted by the establishment of her rule would no doubt resist her to the last; and they would do this to maintain the government. Such is the power that has been acquired over men's minds by the idea that the preservation of the government, whether good or bad, is paramount to everything else.
