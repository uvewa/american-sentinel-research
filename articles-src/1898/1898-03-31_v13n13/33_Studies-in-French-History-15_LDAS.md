"What puzzles me is," interrupted Joe Palmeter, "why the pope had any more right to interfere with the government of kingdoms than anybody else. I thought he was the head of the church."

"So he was," said Professor Carman. "But this did not satisfy him. So he wished to unite church and state, and be the supreme head of both. He evidently thought that all the kingdoms of the earth were his, to keep or to give away, just as best suited him. Accordingly, he next offered the throne of Aragon to Philip III."

"Was he the same as Philip the Bold?" asked Florence Ray, writing busily in her note book.

"Yes; Philip III was called the Bold, and reigned during the years 1270–1285. He was not as tender of conscience as his kind-hearted father, Saint Louis, and so he raised an army and went down into Spain, in conformity to his ambitious vanity, where he fell a miserable victim to the dreadful climate and died. His son, named after him, Philip the Fourth, and known as the Fair, took the reins of government at the age of only seventeen."

"I wonder why he was called the Fair," said Milly Brown. "Was he a handsome man, professor?"

"Yes, he had a handsome face, indeed, but that was all one could say in his favor. He was a cold-hearted, ambitious man, and perfectly unscrupulous in his manner of getting money. He did the dreadful thing which people call debasing the coin,—that is, he caused inferior metal to be put into the gold and silver,—and then when anybody was owing him, he obliged them to pay him pure coin. The people were in this manner cruelly oppressed. The workings of the Feudal system yet gave the poor people no end of trouble. The rich nobles had the poorer people who were under them almost entirely in their power, and it was with an iron hand that they held them, and ground them down. The poor wretches were as much real bondsmen as were ever the unfortunate and downtrodden slaves of our own country, and as much needed a noble Lincoln, with his 'Proclamation of Emancipation.' Sometimes the nobles would compel their vassals, after working hard all day, to sit up all the long night, and strike the surface of the pond near their fine castles with whips to quiet the croaking of the frogs, so that the slumbers of the fine lords and ladies should not be disturbed."

"I wonder if they laid awake all night to see if the frog stillers did their duty," laughed Milly Brown.

"I would never have done it!" exclaimed Rob Billings, with emphasis."

"Well, then, you would likely have received a severe punishment. It would hardly have paid you alone to resist. But the reckoning time was coming when the cruel aristocracy would reap what they had sown.

"Philip IV was an extravagant man, and was very expert in extracting money from the Parliament of France—which was much the same as our Supreme Court—and was considered by Philip as only a means by which he could wring money from his wretched people. He made all sorts of cruel laws to regulate even the very diet of his subjects, and the kind of clothes they should wear. He forbade their eating more than one dish of meat at their dinner, and so, as the French people were much the same as now, quite fond of good things to eat, they tried to avoid the letter of the intolerant law by heaping several kinds of meat on one dish."

"I should think that somebody would have acted the spy, and told Philip," said Florence Ray.

"Yes, he did soon find it out, and he put a stop to it at once. Even the trimming on the ladies' dresses was regulated by the word and will of the tyrant."

"Perhaps that would be a good plan nowadays," suggested Julia March.

"No, indeed! it is not the business of any king, president, or congress to interfere with anybody's personal conduct in such matters," said Joe Palmeter, stoutly. "Do you agree with me, professor?"

"I certainly do, Joseph," said the teacher, "though I have no doubt there is many a dollar unwisely spent for such purposes.

"The common people were forbidden to own a carriage, or to wear gold or jewels. You see they were not allowed to spend their money as they liked, after they had earned it. But the king's word was law, and no one said anything—aloud.

"In the reign of Philip, there was a very peculiar fashion in shoes, which raged quite extensively. The king was not satisfied without having his say about this queer fashion also, and so the length of a man's title could be determined by the length of his shoes. A plain, ordinary man must not wear his shoes more than twelve inches long; a knight might have them eighteen inches, while a baron was allowed to indulge his love of shoe-leather to still greater extent—being allowed twenty-four inches."

"What did the poor fellows who were unfortunate enough to be princes do with their feet, I wonder?" laughed Will Barnaby.

"Bless you, Will; they used to hobble around in shoes two and a half feet long; while the king himself would probably have had his four or five feet in length, if he could possibly have moved his feet."

"Well, that does surprise me!" said Edna Philips.

"It is indeed surprising; but nowadays people are just about as willing to follow the dictates of fashion as they were then," said Professor Carman, as he rang the bell for dismissal.
