The evidence thus far given that Sunday is the mark of the papacy has by no means been exhausted.

By studying the prophecy (Rev. 13:11-18) still further it will be seen that while the mark of the beast (papacy) is being enforced there are those who will not receive the mark either in their right hand or their foreheads. Instead of this they are brought to view as receiving the "Father's name in their foreheads." Rev. 14:1.

It will be apparent that the mark of the beast is a rival institution to that which is called the "Father's name." The number who receive the Father's name are spoken of as being 144,000 Whether this means exactly the number or represents a larger number, is not necessary to be discussed in this article.

If as has been proved Sunday is the mark of the papacy and it is a rival of that which is called the "Father's name," it must be that at the very time when strong efforts are being made to enforce Sunday as the mark there would be another day laying claim to recognition as the Sabbath and which really contains the Father's name.

And furthermore, if Sunday is represented as being a sign (and this has abundantly been shown to be the case in these articles), we should naturally expect to find that this particular day, of which Sunday is the rival, has not only the Father's name in it, but also is said in Scripture to be a sign.

No one who is at all acquainted with the religious movements in this country for the last half century or more, can deny that there has indeed been another day contended for as the Sabbath, that really does contain the Father's name and is positively called by God himself his sign. That day is the seventh day of the week.

For proof on this point we turn to Ex. 20:8-11, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," etc.

This is the fourth precept of the Decalogue, and it can readily be seen that it contains God's name,—"In six days the Lord [Jehovah] made heaven and earth," etc.

Of the sanctuary that God commanded Moses to build, and in which the law—the ten commandments—was put, it is frequently said that God's name was there. For instance, Deut. 16:6: "But at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to put his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover, at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt." Also of the temple which Solomon built and dedicated, and which replaced the movable structure that Moses built, it is said (1 Kings 8:29): "That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there," etc.

No less plainly and more so if there is any difference at all, is the seventh day called a sign. In Ex. 31:13 we read: "Speak also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep; for it is a sign between me and you." The same thing is stated again in verses 16, 17. And yet again in Eze. 20:12, 20 we have the same truth uttered, "Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them." "And hallow my Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God."

Let it be remembered that it is not simply man who thus speaks of the seventh day as the sign of God, but it is God himself who says it. And because God says it, the seventh day is now being set forth as the sign of the Creator, and the people of this country—yes, and of the whole world—are asked to recognize it as such.

But just here it is proper to state most emphatically that under no consideration is governmental recognition and aid asked for the seventh day as is the case with Sunday. Being the sign of God's eternal power in creation and redemption, it could not in the very nature of things ask such aid; while it is perfectly consistent that for Sunday, being the sign of the papacy which has never used any other power than that of the governments of earth, such help should be asked.

No, indeed; the seventh day as the sign of God appeals to the individual conscience, leaving to the individual himself the decision whether he will recognize the day or not; leaving him to answer before God's tribunal and not man's, for his action, whether for or against. And this is in perfect harmony with the principles recognized in the American Constitution, as explained by those who framed it.

The two days—the Sabbath and Sunday—are now and have been for years, before us; the prophecy is being fulfilled, and we are called upon to choose which we will accept. And be it ever remembered that it cannot be both at one time. That important results hang upon the issue before us will be pointed out in future articles.

Meanwhile the reader is asked, Which day will you accept—the seventh day, the true Sabbath, which contains the Father's name, and is God's sign? or the Sunday, which is never in the Scripture called the Sabbath or Lord's day; is not nor ever can be God's sign; but is and always has been from the first the sign of the papacy?
