God chose to make beings just like himself, only finite, having limited powers, while his powers are unlimited.

His people are called "Sons of God." 1 John 3:2. The "brethren of the Son of God." Heb. 2:11, 17. They are said to be "partakers of the divine nature." They are called "gods," and it is said that in the future they are to be "equal unto the angels," and "as the angels." Now no series of appellations can be imagined which could show to as great a degree as do these terms, the dignity, the glory, of the position which God designed and designs that his people shall occupy.

"Sons of God," "partakers of the divine nature," what can be greater than this?

They are then to be able to choose between good and evil just as independently as God himself would choose. They are called "gods" in Ps. 82:6. This is no mere figure of speech or superlative expression; nothing of the kind. "God" is the family name, the title of grandeur, and they who are made God's sons and daughters, who actually partake of God's nature, as truly become Gods as children born into the Jones family become Jones.

Read Daniel 4 for a description of King Nebuchadnezzar's period of lunacy and you will see that the angels may and do demand of the central government, the government of heaven, the issuing of such decrees as are necessary to the ruling of this world, and if of this world then of all worlds. The angels then have an important part to act in governing and ordering the affairs of the whole great universe, and God's children are to be equal unto the angels.

They too will act just such a part; for Jesus says, they "shall sit with me in my throne;" and as the universe was made by and for Christ (Col. 1:16), he will, under the Father's direction, rule the universe; and his people sitting with him, sharing with him "in his throne," will help him rule the universe.

The people of God will judge angels and men. 1 Cor. 6:2, 3. "Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God." Pillars uphold the building; God's temple is the seat of his government, of his authority, the Capitol building of the whole universe of worlds.

To be a pillar, an upholder, there, is to have a share in the government. "And I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the New Jerusalem, the city of my God, and I will write upon him my new name."

Have you ever seen a sailor ashore from one of the huge battleships of the navy? And have you noted that across his breast, or on his cap, in bold letters, was printed the name of his vessel, "Kentucky," or "Yorktown," or "Illinois," or "Indiana"? Well, just so, as the saints of God, paired and twinned with angels, plant their shining feet upon the glittering worlds of eternity, swift winged from the grandeur of the sphere where shines the located throne of God, bearing in hand or by word of mouth some gentle yet mighty decree of Omnipotence, enacted at their request, they will show in blazing brilliance, on brow and breast and belt, the lustrous names of the Royal City, of the King's Son, and of the King himself, eternal, immortal.

Such is your transcendent privilege; such may be your magnificent destiny. O, poor delver in this world's hardships and darkness. And if such be my future right, can you not, O earthly governments, O earthly courts, allow me to take direction, even here, from the King himself, in all things pertaining exclusively to his service? If I may be entrusted with a share in supervising the affairs of eternity, can you not, as long as I harm no man, allow me to think and to act for myself with reference to my duty to God in this world?

Tallmadge, O.
