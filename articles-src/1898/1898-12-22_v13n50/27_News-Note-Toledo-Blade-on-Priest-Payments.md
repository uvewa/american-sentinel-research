In reply to a query by one of its readers whether or not the Government has promised to pay priests employed on the lands taken from Spain, the Toledo Blade says:—

"If you had thought a moment, you would not have sent that question, for you would have considered that, had it been true, the Blade and all other newspapers would have had an account of it in their news columns. Furthermore, if you had considered the matter a little further, you would have remembered that no public money can be used in the United States to maintain any church or religious teachers, and that therefore it cannot be so used in any of the island's coming under the authority of the United States.

"Now, do you understand that the story is simply a stupid lie, or must we assure you of that fact still further?"

The Blade needs sharpening. Appropriations of public funds for sectarian uses have been going on in this country for years in plain view of reading and observing people. Only recently the Government paid $288,000 to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and within recent years it has given millions of dollars to various churches, notably the Catholic Church, for sectarian uses.

The Blade ought to know this; but the people ought to know that the average newspaper is not a reliable source of information upon such questions.
