DEFERENCE for days of human appointment always grows in a nation in proportion to the decrease among the people of deference for the day set apart by the Lord. The development of this sentiment is illustrated in the following paragraph from an article contributed to the Sunday-School Times, by Prof. A. B. Garner, of York, Pa., on the "duty" of a better observance of Thanksgiving:—

"It is our Christian duty. This day is not set aside by the church, to be sure, nor is it specifically appointed in God's Word; but it is the one day of all the year in which we are called upon, as a people, by our chief executive, to perform a distinctively Christian duty, and to ignore it or to slight it is to turn our backs upon this proclamation that we are a religious, a God-fearing, people. It is the one opportunity given for us to show to the world that we are Christian. Only atheists and infidels refuse to give thanks, and, when we make our nation thus refuse, we brand ourselves an atheistic or infidel people."

The Lord gave the Sabbath to be a sign between his people and himself, that they might show that they were not an atheist or heathen people, but worshipers of the true God, the Creator. But to observe a day of human appointment, in deference to the command of an earthly power, is a proceeding which savors only of the human, and is therefore atheistic in its very nature.
