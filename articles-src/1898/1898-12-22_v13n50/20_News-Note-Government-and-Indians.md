OF the care of the Government for its wards, the Indians, the New York Independent, in a late issue, says:—

"We are more and more dissatisfied that the Department of the Interior takes no interest in the welfare of the Indians. Of course, the Indian Bureau is not responsible, as it cannot appoint an agent or an inspector. Admirable men for the very important position of inspector of schools, which requires technical knowledge, are suggested purely on their own merit, and they are passed over for men who have no qualifications except personal or political influence. But what can we expect when a tried man like Dr. Hailman was dropped as superintendent of schools, to the sad loss of the service, purely for political reasons?"

This is the way the Government cares for the uncivilized races under its authority right at home. It illustrates the remark made by Dr. Parkhurst in late discourse that "our policy of dealing with semi-civilized folks and with savages is not just what you would call reassuring." And this being the way it cares for such people here on its own shores, what can reasonably be expected as regards the care it will exercise over savage races thousands of miles away?
