THE citizens of Danville, Ill., have recently been much stirred up over the operation of a Sunday closing law secured not long since by the Barbers' Union. One barber, the report states, kept open shop on Sunday and was arrested; whereupon he at once had warrants sworn out for the arrest of about thirty business men of the place—clothing merchants, druggists, restaurant keepers, newsdealers, etc.,—who were like himself, keeping their places of business open. It is said these cases will be appealed to the supreme court of the State.

Bigotry, envy, and the spirit of retaliation are the natural avenues through which the Sunday laws are put into operation.
