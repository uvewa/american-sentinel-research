ENCOURAGED by the promise of governmental support for the church in Cuba, Rome has returned to the attack upon American principles through appropriations to sectarian schools. Nothing else, of course, was to be expected. A special dispatch from Washington to the Chicago Times-Herald, dated Dec. 9, says:—

"Archbishop Ireland, of St. Paul, and Bishop Thomas J. O'Brien, of Sioux Falls, are in the city in the interest of the movement, headed by Cardinal Gibbons, who seeks to have Congress reverse itself and make appropriations for the education of Indian children in sectarian schools. There are intimations that this is intended as the entering wedge for a proposition to have native children in the Philippines sent to Roman Catholic schools in those islands." (Italics ours.)

Some years ago the Government was entrapped into the business of maintaining Roman Catholic Indian schools in the United States, by a yearly appropriation of funds from the public treasury. These appropriations, naturally, grew larger year by year. Several Protestant denominations followed suit, but they were unable to keep pace with Rome in securing the patronage of the Government. Seeing this, they turned about and repudiated the principle of government aid to sectarian schools, and finally secured a reversal of the policy by the Government. But meanwhile Rome had secured from the Government, under this policy, no less a sum than $2,366,416. This is the amount stated by Senator Gallinger on the floor of Congress as having been paid to the Catholic Church in this country during the eight years ending in 1894.

Now, Rome has returned to the attack, and aims not only to secure all that she had lost before, but a great deal more. And the prospect is favorable that she will get all this in the end, if not at once. The Government has shown itself entirely too ready to help the Catholic Church in the territory acquired from Spain, and in this has logically committed itself to the position which Rome desires it to maintain. Government support of Catholic schools for the children among the 8,000,000 Filipinos, means a larger sum in the papal coffers than the Government has ever put there before. The papal church is no doubt quite willing to exchange the support of Spain for that of the United States. Spain has not been rich for many years past, and has been growing poorer and poorer, until she has come to the verge of bankruptcy; while the United States, on the other hand, has become the wealthiest nation on the globe.

The United States cannot afford to pay to Rome or any other church a single principle of the free government which it is its honor to represent. To give away republican principles is a far dearer sacrifice than any amount of money; and this sacrifice Rome always demands. It will be immeasurably cheaper for the United States to build and support a system of public schools in the Philippines, than merely to support the so-called schools already built or that may be built by Rome.
