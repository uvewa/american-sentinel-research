We must now ask the reader to recall a few points set forth in previous articles, that he may be able to grasp more readily the present situation existing in the religious world.

Going back to the time of the Reformation, we found that the principle for which the Protestants contended was that the Bible is the only true rule in faith and morals, while up to that time it had been taught by the Catholic Church that the Bible and tradition—with tradition the more clear and safe authority, was the rule. We also found that when the Catholic Council of Trent met it was for the purpose of meeting the "errors" of the Reformers. In doing this the question of tradition had to be decided. Should the council define that tradition was not a part of the revelation of God, and of equal value with the Bible, it would be at once to acknowledge that the Protestants were right. And in that case every doctrine based upon tradition would have to be thrown out. In fact, it would have meant the collapse of the Catholic Church. But such an acknowledgment, it was decided, must not be made: the "heretics" must be confounded. But how should it be done? The way out was finally found.

Notwithstanding the Protestants had contended that the Bible should be recognized as the only rule in faith and morals, they, later at the Council of Augsburg, conceded that Sunday should be observed, and, too, that it existed solely by the authority of the Catholic Church. This was at once to concede the Catholic principle of tradition and to deny the Protestant principle of the "Bible only." This the Council of Trent saw, and seeing it, was quick to use it. Hence, Sunday was recognized as the pillar of tradition, while in turn tradition was necessary to the existence of the Catholic Church. And that being so, anyone can see that Sunday is the very foundation—the pillar of the Catholic Church. And all this meant a triumph for the Catholic Church.

Now as Sunday was the vital point between true Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, and as Protestantism at that time missed this very point, it was logically necessary that the whole question of Protestantism as against Catholicism must come up again, with Sunday as the issue. And we found, too, that the United States was the most favorable place for it to come up.

In our study of the symbols of Rev. 13, we have found that the two-horned beast is a symbol of the United States, and that consequently this country is to enforce the mark of the papacy, which we have seen is the Sunday. And further, it has been pointed out that the movement having in view the enforcing of Sunday is now on foot, and is making rapid progress.

The reader will pardon us for making such a lengthy review, but the points herein set forth are too important to be lightly passed by, and they now serve to impress upon our minds the fact that now—at this very time we are standing just where the Reformers stood three hundred years ago.

For in the demand that Sunday be kept as the Sabbath day, we are asked to accept the papal principle of tradition, and all that is involved in it,—for even the leaders in this movement for Sunday observance confess that there is no scriptural warrant for the observance of the first day of the week, and for one to recognize this papal principle is to recognize the authority of the Catholic Church.

Now that we are brought face to face with the principle of the Reformation, with the vital point—Sunday—at issue, we may well ask the question, On what side of the issue will the Holy Spirit be manifested? Nor is the answer hard to find. The Holy Spirit is bound to be on the side of the Protestant principle as He was at the beginning of the Reformation. It is therefore as plain as anything can be that those who are trying to enforce Sunday, with those who shall accept it, will be arrayed against the Holy Spirit.

Let no one think that it is a matter in which only men are concerned, and the question one merely of days. Luther in his day protested that it was not a work of his own doing; that an unseen power was urging him on; that he was only an instrument. And so it is to-day. In this matter of the Sabbath and of Sunday, men engaged in this question are merely the instruments.

We have reached a point when it must be determined once for all whether one will worship God in the fullest sense of the word, and acknowledge his authority and the supremacy of his Word; or whether on the other hand, he will worship the papacy (and the dragon) by accepting his mark, and so recognize his authority.

Back at the beginning of the Reformation, and for that matter, ever since, the Reformers were denounced by the Catholics as being moved upon by the devil, although in reality it was the Holy Spirit.

It will be noticed that this was exactly the charge that the Pharisees brought against Christ. See Matt. 12:24–32. And Christ said that this was the sin against the Holy Ghost.

Is the sin against the Holy Ghost involved in this question of Sunday? We shall see.
