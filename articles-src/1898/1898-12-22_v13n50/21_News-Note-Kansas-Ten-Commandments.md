A PRESS dispatch dated "Topeka, Kans., Dec. 13," says:—

"C. W. Walters, a Populist member of the Kansas House, wishes to transform the State by law into a modern Canaan. If an extra session is called, he will again seek to have the ten commandments enacted as statutes. Walters is a well-to-do farmer of forty, residing in Labette County. He is deeply religious. In 1897 he made his campaign and won on the platform of the Mosaic law."

This is an example of the idea of government illustrated on the front page of this issue. It is the idea which the National Reformers are trying to set up, in which they are being aided by the largest religious organizations of the land, and which is involved in every religious law and every effort to secure legislation in behalf of a religious institution.
