A WRITER in the *Windsor Magazine*, who was sketching the history of some of the first archbishops of Canterbury, quoted an old account which shows how much it cost to burn a heretic three centuries ago and more. He says:—

"To defy the authority of the church meant in those days certain excommunication, which in turn entailed that the culprit should be dealt with by the laws of the state. That my readers may realize what this course implied, I give the following significant extract which appears in the municipal records of Canterbury, dated 1535:—

"For the expenses of bringing a heretic from London, 14s. 8d.
"For 1½ loads of wood to burn him, 2s. 0d.
"For gunpowder, 1d.
"A stake and staple, 8d."
