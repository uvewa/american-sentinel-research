A SAMPLE of the way in which Roman Catholic propagandists are doing "missionary" work among ignorant Protestants comes to us from California, in a newspaper clipping, which says:—

"The Rev. Father Hopper delivered an able lecture Thanksgiving night upon 'The Blessed Virgin the Mother of God.'"

"The audience was carried away with the force and unction of his words.

"As he drew his lecture to a close he took a text of Holy Scripture saying, 'It is a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may be saved from their sins.'"

This "text of Holy Scripture" will be found next to the text which says that the first day of the week is the Sabbath.

The real student of Scripture will not be carried away with the "force and unction" of glaring religious fraud.
