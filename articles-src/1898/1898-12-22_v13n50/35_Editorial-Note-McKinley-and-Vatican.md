PRESIDENT McKINLEY, says the London Chronicle, is understood to have given assurance to the Vatican that Catholics in the islands lately taken from Spain would enjoy the same liberty as Catholics in the United States. Whereat the pope is much rejoiced, and has sent the President his warm thanks.

What the pope and other Catholics were worrying about, was of course the Catholic Church property in these islands. There was no danger that Catholics themselves would be interfered with under American rule, but it was not improbable, judging from the history of Mexico and other Spanish-American countries, that much of the enormous church property might be confiscated for civil uses. To prevent this the papal party have importuned the authority of the United States, making it appear, of course, that such confiscation would be a sacrilegious robbery which the American Government was in duty bound to prevent. This church property was of course acquired in the usual way in which the papacy has acquired property in all lands where she has had absolute sway; which is to say that the people have been robbed and peeled by the priests until the church became immensely rich and the people correspondingly poor; and all this in order that the church might overawe the people by a display of wealth and magnificence, and make more secure her hold upon them in civil as well as spiritual affairs. And now, having robbed the country for centuries, she wants the United States to guarantee that she shall not be obliged to give up any part of the spoils. And this, it appears, she has persuaded the Government to do.
