AT a recent meeting of the National Christian Citizenship League, held in Washington, D. C., the question was raised whether the churches in the islands taken from Spain are rightfully the property of the Catholic Church; and it was contended that the United States Government should take possession of all church property, and submit the question of its disposition to the people in whose midst it is located.

The Catholic Church, as is well known, has for centuries been in close union with the Spanish government; and churches built in the islands under Spanish rule, were largely the property of the state. And as such property has now passed to the control of the United States, the point is made, and quite logically, that the Catholic Church has no right to assume control of such church property now.

Neither this Government however, nor any other government, has rightfully any business with church property as such, save to hold it subject, like other property, to taxation.
