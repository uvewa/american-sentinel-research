The founders of the American Republic doubtless believed in expansion. They were no more opposed to such a thing than are the most ardent imperialists who are to-day trying to explain away the Constitution and Declaration of Independence in defense of their views.

But what is the thing to be expanded? That is the vital question in the whole discussion.

Is it the American army and navy? Is it the incubus of militarism? Is it military government, or any other form of arbitrary rule? Are these the things which need expansion for the fulfillment of the national purpose? We think not.

Our forefathers expanded the truths which underlie free government. They did this in the Declaration of Independence and the national Constitution. They proclaimed to all the world the truths which till then they had harbored in their own minds, that all men are by creation equally endowed with certain unalienable rights, and that to preserve these rights is the one legitimate purpose of governments among men. They asserted these as self-evident truths; and they asserted them as much for the inhabitants of the countries of Europe, as for themselves.

Upon these principles the American Republic was founded; and under the influence of this example the application of these principles in the governments of the world gradually expanded, and all mankind were the gainers. That they were not at once carried fully into effect by the American Government, and that the history of the nation down to the present time has been marked by various denials of these principles in American institutions and laws, are not facts which invalidate the principles, or which constitute an argument for repudiating them to-day.

The founders of this Republic believed in the expansion of free government. That was the kind of government they set up for themselves and advocated for all the world; and that is the only kind of government which it can in reason be supposed they would wish to see extended beyond the shores of the American continent.

But is it such government that it is now proposed by the advocates of "expansion" to extend? No; it is not claimed that there is to be any "expansion" of free government. It is not pretended that "government of the people, by the people, for the people," is to be set up in any of the newly-acquired territory. The "expansion" is to be simply an extension of the authority of the United States Government. No pretense of anything else is possible, for it is well known that the people of all these territories, with the possible exception of Porto Rico, do not want to be ruled by the United States, but want to govern themselves. They are to be governed without their consent, and the government which has actually been set up, so far, in those territories, is the autocratic government of military rule.

It is explained that this government will be continued until the people shall have become fitted for self-government. But how long will it take for a people under the despotism of military rule to learn self-government? How long time will be required to establish the principles and institutions of free government under a regime which denies and suppresses them? About as long, evidently, as would be required for a person to learn to swim without going in the water.

It is not necessary that the inhabitants of Porto Rico, Hawaii, or the Philippines should be "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians" to know how to govern themselves. It is not necessary that they should know all the tricks of the politicians and be stamped with such other marks of "civilization" as usually come to the surface in a political campaign, in order to have good government. It is not the politicians, and the diplomats, and the bosses, however well educated they may be, that make good government in the United States. In fact, they do nothing to promote good government at all, and much to hinder it. If all such eminent representatives of our modern civilization could be transported to the Philippines, and their places here taken by native Filipinos, American government would be a good deal better than it is.

Here, we have the church in politics; the State and national "bosses" in politics; the "diplomats" who care everything about policy and nothing about principle; the buyer and seller of public office; and the buyer and seller of votes; and between all these, American government comes a long way from being the free and just government which the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the framers of the national Constitution meant it to be.

Good government is not necessarily such a complicated affair as might be thought from a study of the political machinery now employed in the government of the United States. The prime essential of good government is a disposition to behave one's self and not meddle with the business of others; and this disposition is about as frequently met with in the Islands of the Sea as in lands that boast most highly of their civilization. One great trouble with the uncivilized "heathen" is that they have come in too close contact with the heathen of civilized lands, and learned from the latter a vast amount of immorality that they did not know before.

Good government is simple government, and simple government is a thing not beyond the comprehension of simple people.

The extension of good government—of free government—is one thing; and the extension of the military power and authority of the United States is quite another thing. It is the latter, and that only, which the imperialist party are seeking to bring about.

There is room for free government to expand at home; of late years the politicians and bosses and religio-political parties have succeeded in greatly narrowing its scope in this country. And when the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and other bulwarks of popular rights and liberties are set aside by the Government itself, to justify the new policy, the result can only be a great contraction of free government in America itself.

This fact is what makes this new national policy a matter of serious concern for the American people. It is a policy which seriously endangers their own rights, as individuals.

We have no objection to the expansion of good government; but we do object to the expansion of any government, even American government, at the expense of good government. The American Government can never promote free government abroad by ceasing to be a free Government at home.
