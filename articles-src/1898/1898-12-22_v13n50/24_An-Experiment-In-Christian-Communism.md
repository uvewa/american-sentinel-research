Near Columbus, Ga., says *The Outlook*, there is being conducted an experiment in "Christian communism;" that is, an experiment in applying the principles of Christianity to industrial life, in accordance with the views of such advocates of the system as Prof. Herron, of Grinnell, Iowa. The community is known as "The Christian Commonwealth," and numbers about seventy souls. It is thus described:

"The practices of the outside world are exactly reversed in this Christian community. The bond which holds the association together is not self interest, but brotherly love; instead of competing with one another, they cooperate; the strongest and ablest regard their gifts, not as a means of self-aggrandizement, but as an opportunity for service. Every new member is expected to give to the association all that he has, but poor men are received without admission fee of any kind. All that is necessary is assent to the following statement of faith: 'I accept as the law of my life Christ's law that I shall love my neighbor as myself. I will use, hold, or dispose of all my property, my labor, and my income according to the dictates of love for the happiness of all who need. I will not withhold for any selfish ends aught that I have from the fullest service that love inspires.' The system is one of complete communism. Private property is limited to personal effects; all land and capital are owned by the community collectively. There is absolute equality within the association. Every member is asked to do his share in the necessary work, and receives in return all that is needful for his daily life. The colonists have several hundred acres of land, which are being rapidly brought under cultivation. There is an orchard, a nursery garden, a sawmill, a blacksmith shop, and a dairy. Commonwealth has its own post-office, and a printing press from which is issued the monthly organ of the association, *The Social Gospel*, edited by George Howard Gibson and the Rev. Ralph Albertson."

The only trouble with this system, from the standpoint of Christianity, is that it puts the cart before the horse. It is an effort to get the results of the spirit of Christianity by establishing the forms. The spirit must come first, and the forms follow as a natural result. Men must get the spirit of Christianity in order to carry out its principles in their relations with one another; not attempt to do the works of Christianity in order to get its spirit. True Christian communism must begin with a spiritual mind. A promise to accept Christ's law as the law of one's life amounts to nothing. It is a promise that no person has of himself any power to fulfill.

There is really nothing that can take the place of old-fashioned gospel work as a means of hastening the dawn of a brighter day for the suffering and the oppressed.
