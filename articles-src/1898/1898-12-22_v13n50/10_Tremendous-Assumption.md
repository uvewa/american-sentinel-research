THE attitude taken recently by Mayor Hoos, of Jersey City, toward the question of enforced Sunday observance, has called forth a manifesto from the American Sabbath Union. This manifesto declares that—

"It is the sacred, not the civil, Sabbath upon which the American institutions are built.
"It is the sacred, not the holiday, Sabbath that is the palladium of our liberties and the bulwark of private and public virtues.
"A secularized Sabbath always has been, is and ever will be, the doorway through which sweeps a flood of immorality, destructive of the home, the peace and good order of society, and the national life."

This is said in connection with a call for the enforcement of Sunday observance by law; and therefore it is plain that the enforcement desired is that of a religious observance of Sunday, and not the enforcement of a "civil" Sabbath. This is an undisguised statement of the case, like that made recently by the prosecuting attorney at Centerville, Md., where he stated that two prisoners on trial for working on Sunday, were being tried for the offense of violating "the sanctity of the Christian Sabbath." The call for religious legislation, and the enforcement of existing religious laws, is now being made with a boldness which is very significant.

There is one thing lacking in this statement by the American Sabbath Union, and the omission is one of importance. American institutions, it says, are built upon a sacred Sabbath, and a sacred Sabbath is the palladium of American liberties. But what is this "sacred Sabbath" to which they refer, built on? The "Sabbath" to which they refer is Sunday; and that day, as a "sacred Sabbath," rests wholly on their opinions. Many people do not believe Sunday is a sacred day at all; but it is the opinion of the members of the American Sabbath Union that Sunday is the "sacred Sabbath." That is their religious belief, and a dogma of the church creeds.

Their opinions, therefore,—their belief, as members of a church holding to the dogma of Sunday sacredness—lie at the foundation of American institutions and American liberty! This is what their manifesto plainly implies. American institutions are built on the "sacred Sabbath" (Sunday), and Sunday as a sacred day is built upon their opinion in regard to which day is the Sabbath. Plainly, then, their opinions lie at the foundation of the whole structure; and what would become of American institutions and liberties if their opinions should give way!

These manifestations of religious bodies who demand that their religious views and practices be forced upon other people by law, are never complete without an amazing amount of assumption.
