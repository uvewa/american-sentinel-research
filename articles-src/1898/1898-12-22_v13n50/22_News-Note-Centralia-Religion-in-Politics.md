RELIGION in politics is stirring the people of Centralia, Wash. A dispatch from that place to the Seattle Daily Times, dated Dec. 5, says:—

"This city is in the throes of a most intensely interesting municipal fight. Heretofore in city elections but little or no interest has been taken, but this year the people are all aroused. The cause of this is an attempt to enforce the state law requiring saloons and business houses to close and remain closed on Sunday. A mass convention of citizens was held at McNitt's Hall Friday evening to place a ticket in nomination. A resolution was read pledging all candidates of the citizens' ticket to enforce the state law to the letter. A long debate followed, and a vote taken on the resolution, resulting in its being carried by 68 to 36. . . . To-day the general impression is in favor of closing, but the result may be a surprise either way. All the candidates are men of competency and reliability, and there is only one issue—that of Sunday closing."

There is nothing like religion in politics to stir up the dormant activities of a community and add bitterness to political controversy. And there is nothing like politics to drag the mantle of religion through the mire.
