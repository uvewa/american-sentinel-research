In these times, when self government is denied to the people of the new accessions of the United States, and even the principle is being abandoned by American Republicanism, it is well to revert to original principles.

No American ever understood this better than did Abraham Lincoln; and no one ever made it plainer nor proclaimed it more fully. He hoped that "government of the people, by the people, for the people," should not perish from the earth. And now that it is really being abandoned by the leading men of the United States and the mass is following, it is well to recall the attention of the American people to what Abraham Lincoln declared to be "The Sheet Anchor of American Republicanism."

He was speaking at Peoria, Ill., October 16, 1854, and said:—

"I trust I understand and truly estimate the right of self-government. My faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own, lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me. I extend the principle to communities of men, as well as to individuals. I so extend it because it is politically wise as well as naturally just—politically wise in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us.

"The doctrine of self-government is right—absolutely and eternally right. . . . If the negro is a man, is it not to that extent a total destruction of self-government to say that he too shall not govern himself? When the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself, and also another man, that is more than self-government—that is despotism. . . .

"No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent. I say this is the leading principle, the sheet anchor of American Republicanism. Our Declaration of Independence says:—

"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.'

"I have quoted so much at this time merely to show our ancient faith: the just powers of government are derived from the consent of the governed. . . . Allow all the governed an equal voice in the government; and that, and that only, is self-government."

Abraham Lincoln understood perfectly what American Republicanism is. And since he has here so clearly defined it, what is this thing now being advocated by the expansionists who must needs deny to whole peoples the exercise of self-government? This is the distinct abandonment of every principle of republican government.
