"You spoke, Cecil, of the good advice of Gamaliel, and regretted that it was not always followed when the cause of truth or even of error is being promulgated. There is plenty of room in the world for free thought, free speech, and free action, in so far as they do not come in conflict with natural rights. When they do come in conflict with such rights, we have a fine protection in civil law. For the protection of men in the exercise of inalienable natural rights, civil government is ordained of God."

"The trouble is, Aleck, that men have perverted the unctions of civil government, and history proves over and over that civil government, instead of protecting men in the use of their natural rights, has restricted and prohibited them even by the penalty often of prison and death."

"Why, Cecil, you certainly have changed your mind since we began this discussion."

"Yes; because whereas I was once blind, now I see. My intellect at any rate is thoroughly convinced that your positions are right. But I am also conscious that it will take more than my intellectual conviction to make me the advocate and upholder of principle in the face of opposition and persecution."

"Convinced of your need, is half the way to power. I cannot think, Cecil, that having the light you now have, you would consent to the meanness involved in opposing truth, or in even being neutral."

"No, Aleck; my very blood boils at the methods I see were used against truth. The weakness of dependence on human power is most obnoxiously apparent in the contemptible methods used to convict a true man of unrighteousness. How men made once in the image of God, can look upon themselves as men, and do so abominably, is still a mystery to me."

"What particular case has stirred you up so, Cecil?"

"O, the very next case in the Book of Acts—the case of Stephen. He certainly showed himself a man in every sense of the word. He was full of faith—believed in your principle of utter reliance on God, and consequently was full of power. I suppose the world and the devils both became jealous of such a character."

"Certainly. The prince of this world looks with suspicion and hatred on a man who relies on God: for Satan is a declared rebel against God and his government. Such faith is not mere human belief, but an evidence of an indwelling Saviour. It is the faith of Christ. That faith the devil knows is invulnerable. He tried by every temptation in his power to overcome it in Jesus. Think, then, how he dreads its manifestation in his followers. Every weapon of hell is formed to rid the world of him who has victorious faith."

"The weapons of hell are most contemptible then. Take Stephen's case. He came in conflict with persons from a certain synagogue who disputed with him. They were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit by which he spoke. They had no argument to oppose to his. They knew he had the truth. Instead of acknowledging it, as men should, they sneaked round till they found some unprincipled villains they could bribe to bear false witness. By this means they influenced the elders, scribes and people, rousing an unjust indignation against a good man. They were not ashamed of any calumny they could invent. O how I detest such methods! Finally, they caught Stephen, brought him before their prejudiced council, and gave all possible show to their false witnesses."

"But, Cecil, God did not 'leave him without vindication.' His very face testified to his truth that hour."

"Yes. So it says that it shone like the face of an angel. If ever such an opportunity is ours, may we too have such a face."

"We need not wait for such a time. Christians will always wear a face that tells the right story—if they are Christians."

"Besides his face, he had a testimony of wonderful power. I have been amazed in studying Stephen's defense of Christ. With the most subtle tact he begins at the history of Abraham, leading them over familiar ground, showing them that in the rejection of the former prophets and patriarchs, had been foreshadowed the tragedy of Calvary. When they saw the logic of the out, come, and where it placed them, instead of bursting forth in a wail of sorrow, repentance, and supplication, they gnashed on him with their teeth. When God opened heaven to him, and he gave his last testimony, declaring he saw Jesus on the right hand of God, they cast him out of the city, stoned him to death, with hearts harder than stones, for his prayers that their sin should not be laid to their charge, was unnoticed by them."

"Aleck, if such an exhibition is the result of reliance on self, on man, on human power, my prayer shall ever be, 'O God, deliver thou me.'" F. E. B.
