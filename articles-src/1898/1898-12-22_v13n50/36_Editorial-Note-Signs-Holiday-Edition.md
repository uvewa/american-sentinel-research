HAVE you seen the great bargain that is being offered for the holidays? "What bargain?"—Why, the quartocentennial edition of the Signs of the Times, 32 pages, illuminated cover, and profusely illustrated, for ten cents! But it is not the size of the paper, nor the illustrations, that constitute its real value, but the truths which it sets before the reader. These are just the truths that are most essential to your welfare,—the genuine diamonds and pearls from the hidden mine of wisdom and knowledge. No space or energy is wasted in an effort merely to please or amuse; but while the aim is to please it is also, first and foremost, to impart information the value of which cannot be measured in dollars and cents. Send for a copy, and if you don't find it the best bargain you ever got for ten cents, you need never believe anything that we say again. Address Pacific Press Publishing Co., Oakland, Cal.
