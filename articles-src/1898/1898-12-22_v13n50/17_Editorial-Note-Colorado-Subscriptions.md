TWENTY yearly subscriptions to the SENTINEL and a copy of our premium "Combination Bible" with each one, is the result of an effort recently on the part of one of our friends in Colorado. In closing his last letter he says, "I am going to do all I can for the SENTINEL."

Dear reader, have you a copy of this Bible? If you haven't, you ought to have. If you have one, see that your neighbor gets a copy also, and the SENTINEL with it.
