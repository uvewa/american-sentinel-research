The latest issue of Our Day prints this quotation from the Rev. Stephen Merritt, who is widely known as an advocate of "faith healing:"

"A new religion is coming to the front. First, God is going to heal man, body as well as soul, and soul as well as body. The Church has taken this work out of his hands, has emasculated his work and weakened and lost his power, and is in consequence to-day, a spectacle to angels and men—a giant shorn of strength and grinding in the mills of the gods of the idolaters. Pity 'tis true. But the Holy Spirit is dissatisfied with this state of things, and now has re-opened and re-asserted the gospel of Healing, and as in the days of the beginning, frankly and fully accepts the test. The God that answereth by healing, let him be God. The Holy Spirit demands that we ask for the old paths to walk therein and throws down the challenge: 'If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.' The time has come when divine healing is to be proclaimed, and an unanswerable argument given in favor of Holy Ghost religion as it was commenced in the days of Jesus and continued and developed in the days of the apostles, and is now reopened and restored in these last."

While it is true that God only can heal disease, and therefore that every case of genuine healing is from God, it is also true, and is a truth to be well noted, that the Scripture does not present this as an absolute test of the character of the agency concerned in it. The power to heal disease is not presented as a test of the truth or falsity of spiritual doctrine. The scriptural test is: "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." Isa. 8:20.

So that if it be true that "a new religion is coming to the front," which shall proclaim, "The God that answereth by healing, let him be God," the way is being prepared for people to be caught in a deception. When Moses by the power of God worked miracles before pharaoh and his court, the magicians also "did so with their enchantments" for a time; the work of God was counterfeited by demoniac agencies; and the same agencies are at work in this age, and in the same way. There has been, and will be, counterfeit healing, or healing of counterfeit disease. This is a question of practical importance and its importance will augment as future developments unfold upon us.
