If you are supplied with a good Bible yourself, why not make a present to your friend of one of our beautiful Self-Pronouncing Combination Bibles, who will certainly very highly appreciate it and be agreeably surprised to find his or her name in fine gold letters on the cover. The Bible is an appropriate gift to young or old and your act will be in the line of true missionary work.
