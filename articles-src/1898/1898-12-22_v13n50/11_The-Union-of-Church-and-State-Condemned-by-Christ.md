The intimations in the New Testament, that God requires the separation of the Christian churches from the state are unequivocal.

Let us first examine our Lord's statement to Pilate of the nature of his kingdom, contained in the two narratives of Luke and John. "The whole multitude of them arose and led him to Pilate. And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a king. And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man."

Our Lord was charged with claiming to be king of the Jews, and therefore, as king, claiming tribute from them, and forbidding that the Jews should pay tribute to the Roman emperor, Tiberius. Pilate, therefore, as governor, asked him whether the accusation was true; that he did claim to be king of the Jews. Jesus acknowledged its truth, and yet so explained the character of his claim, that Pilate saw it to be compatible with the reign of the emperor, and declared, in consequence, that he found him guilty of no crime against the Roman law.

By this account of St. Luke it is plain, first, that Jesus did claim to be king of the Jews, according to the charge brought against him by his enemies; but, secondly, that it was such a dominion as was compatible with the dominion of the emperor. Now a secular dominion would not have been compatible with it. The dominion of the emperor, obtained by conquest, and consolidated by imperial laws, was supported by taxation, and rested ultimately upon force. If Jesus had claimed to be king of the Jews in the same sense in which Tiberius was their king, then his laws must be substituted for those of Rome, his right to tax the nation for the expenditure of his government must destroy the emperor's right, and that right must be enforced by his army. In this case Pilate must necessarily have pronounced him to be the enemy of Cæsar; and when, instead, the governor declared that he found in him no fault at all, it is clear that in the opinion of the governor he claimed no right of enacting a new code of civil and of criminal law; he did not mean to maintain his government by taxation; nor would he collect a revenue by force.

The narrative of St. John places these facts in a still clearer light: "Then Pilate entered into the judgment-hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all."

Jesus was charged with claiming to be king. Pilate, therefore, having asked whether he was the king of the Jews, Jesus, before answering that question, demanded whether he had asked this from anything which he had himself observed, apparently intending to direct the attention of Pilate and of others to the fact, that the malice of the priests, and not any public misconduct of his, had occasioned his arrest. Pilate, answering that he was no Jew, but that the priests had brought him before that tribunal, asked him what his offense was. Jesus now replied to the original question, whether he was the king of the Jews, thus: "My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence."

The object of his answer was to clear himself of the change of rebellion. Now, this might be done in either of three ways. He might have denied his claim to be king, and then the whole accusation would fall; or, asserting his divine supremacy, he might have declared that he was the spiritual and the secular king of the Jews, to whom the emperor was bound to submit, in which case Pilate must either have become his disciple, or he must have declared him guilty of rebellion; or, thirdly, he might have maintained that he was king of the Jews, and yet admit the imperial authority of Tiberius, by explaining that his kingdom was spiritual, not secular: that between the spiritual dominion and the secular there was so complete a separation that the one could not interfere with the other; and that, in consequence, he could be no rival of the emperor.

And this was, in fact, the substance of his answer: "My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence." It is clear that Pilate was permitted by our Lord so to understand it; because, when Pilate further asked, whether, then, he claimed to be a king, he answered, "Thou sayest (right) that I am a king." While he stood there, charged with rebellion, because he declared himself to be king of the Jews, he freely admitted that he did advance that claim, and yet Pilate pronounced him to be wholly innocent, which he could not have done except on the understanding that his dominion was exclusively spiritual.

The accusation by the priests was, "We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a king." The answer of Jesus is "My kingdom is not of this world; I claim no tribute, and I forbid no tribute to Cæsar." Their charge was, "He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry." His answer was, "My kingdom is not of this world. I raise no armies to maintain my rights." Their allegation was, "Whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar." His answer was, "My kingdom is not of this world, and therefore I can be no enemy to the reign of Cæsar."

If the kingdom of Christ were to be maintained by taxation and by force, like all secular powers, then his throne must subvert that of Cæsar; and therefore, when he satisfied Pilate that he was no enemy of Cæsar, by asserting that his kingdom was not of this world, it is plain that it should not be maintained by taxation and by force.

Further, Pilate understood our Lord to mean that his kingdom would never be so maintained; for if our Lord had said, My kingdom is not now of this world, not now maintained by taxation and by force, Pilate would at once have seen that it might shortly be strong enough to become a secular kingdom, maintained by force. And as it would then subvert the throne of Cæsar, he would have felt bound to condemn our Lord.

To defend himself from the charge of rivalry to the Roman emperor, it was necessary to inform Pilate that his dominion would be so entirely spiritual that it never could interfere with the rights of the emperor. And of this he did convince Pilate by saying, "My kingdom is not of this world." This was therefore the legitimate meaning of his words; and in them he has solemnly taught us, that his dominion is entirely and forever distinct from secular dominion; that he rules over men's hearts and consciences; that he will ever establish and maintain his rule without the aid of the tax-gatherer and the soldier; that he employs no coercion, and will never resort to military force.
