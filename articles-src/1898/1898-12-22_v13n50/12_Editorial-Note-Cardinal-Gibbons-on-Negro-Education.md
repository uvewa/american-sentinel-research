CARDINAL GIBBONS has written a letter in which he says the trouble with the negroes which causes the race conflicts is this:—

"The education they are generally receiving is calculated to sharpen their mental faculties at the expense of their religious and moral sense. It feeds the head while the heart is starved."

Will he not now tell us what is the trouble with the education of the Filipinos who have been killing and torturing the friars?—N. Y. Independent.
