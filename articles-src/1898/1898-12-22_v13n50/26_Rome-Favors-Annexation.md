A press dispatch from Washington, dated December 11, gives some very interesting information touching the attitude of the papacy toward the question of Cuban annexation. While any intention of annexing the island was expressly disclaimed by the Government when it intervened between Cuba and Spain, the question of annexation has nevertheless remained a live question, and promises to remain such for a long time. For, as this dispatch states, the whole influence of the papacy is cast in favor of settling the Cuban question in this way. Nor is the purpose of Rome in this hard to discover.

The dispatch says that "Archbishop Ireland is urging annexation, and it is believed he is voicing the sentiments of the pope. The St. Paul prelate has been in Washington several days, and he has talked with a number of influential senators and representatives on this subject. He explains that he speaks for the majority of Cubans, who want a stable government that will permit the development of the resources of the island in peace. He represents the Cubans of property as being in dread of a native government, because of the frequent revolutions peculiar to the republics of Latin America. This is a delicate subject, about which the archbishop naturally refuses to talk freely for publication, but Roman Catholics close to him understand that he has the sanction of the pope in this propaganda."

"There is corroborative evidence that the pope is using his influence for annexation. Most of the Roman Catholic members of the heirarchy of the United States are warm advocates of annexation. It is said at the Catholic University in this city that Count Camillo Pecci, a nephew of Leo XIII., is coming to this country soon, and it is asserted he will be charged by the Vatican with the mission of working for annexation. Archbishop Ireland is an ardent advocate of territorial expansion, and he frankly expressed the hope and belief that Cuba will be taken into the United States. If it prove true that Pope Leo is taking an active part to bring about annexation, his influence in that direction will be a powerful agency. It is the general belief, in Washington that Cuba will ultimately be added to the United States. While the President and the people of the United States are pledged to the independence of the island if the Cubans prove themselves capable of maintaining a stable government, it is expected they will never demonstrate that ability, and that this Government will never be able to withdraw from the island. Roman Catholics in the confidence of Archbishop Ireland and Monsignore Martinelli declare with positiveness that the pope has authorized the movement to hasten the union."

It is expected that the Cubans will never be able to demonstrate their capacity for self-government, says this dispatch. And whether peace and order are restored in the island or not, we are told, depends very largely upon the priests who exercise so great an influence over the population. This was one of the reasons advanced for securing the support of the United States Government for the church in Cuba. It would be very bad policy, it was said, by refusing this support to offend these priests who are able to sway the populace either in the direction of peace and order, or against it. Rome understands that she has the power to determine whether the Cuban people shall ever demonstrate their fitness for self-government or not; and hence she can speak confidently on the side of the view that they never will do this, and hence should be brought under the rule of the United States in order that stable government may be secured.

Rome has much to gain by bringing the late Spanish colonies under the authority of so friendly and strong a Government as the United States. Other Spanish colonies which have broken away from Spanish rule—such as Mexico and the states of South America—have shown a decided tendency to break away from the rule of Rome, to confiscate the overgrown church property, and in various ways to curtail the church's encroachment upon the liberties and rights of the people. In the Philippines, were the people left to act on their own judgment, this course would undoubtedly be taken at the present time; and it is by no means certain that the same thing would not be done by the Cubans, ultimately at least, were they to become an independent nation. Hence Rome greatly desires that they shall be held in check by a strong hand friendly to herself, and will use all her influence to this end.

It is a great pity that when a long-oppressed people succeed in throwing off the yoke of Spain, they should not be left free to cast off that spiritual yoke which has made the Spanish yoke the intolerable thing that it is. While the yoke of the papacy remains, the liberty for which the Cubans and Filipinos have so long fought will remain an elusive dream.
