THE Actors' Society of America has petitioned the clergymen of New York for assistance in suppressing Sunday performances at the theatres. The president of the society is quoted as basing this appeal on the fact, among others, that the Sunday theatrical performance is "demoralizing not alone to the actors, but to the community in which the performance is given." The actors do not want to demoralize themselves, and they ask the clergymen of New York for the aid of their law-making influence, that they may be prevented from doing so. Besides this, they want one day in the week in which to appear natural. Whether they promised to attend church every Sunday in return for this ministerial aid is not stated.
