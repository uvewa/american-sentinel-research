"Now that the great Colbert was dead," began the professor, "the king—Louis XIV., remember—appointed a man named Louvois, as minister of war, and to this man he listened, and to him gave his confidence, just the same as to Colbert."

"I hope he was wise and kind," remarked Milly.

"Well, Milly, when I tell you that it was partly through his influence that the king did the terrible thing of revoking the Edict of Nantes,—a deed which made the nations of Europe tremble,—you will, I suppose, decide, and that justly, that he was neither kind nor wise."

"I've forgotten about the Edict of Nantes," said Joe Palmeter, "will you please tell us something about it?"

"Perhaps Joseph remembers who issued this edict, and for what purpose. Will you tell us what you may remember about it, Joseph?"

"I believe Henry of Navarre first issued it," replied Joe, "so that Protestants might have the freedom of worshiping God as they chose."

"Yes; you remember that he favored the Protestants and part of the time professed that religion. So he made a decree that they should have religious liberty. And this, people considered a very great liberty—a very great privilege indeed. Nevertheless this edict had stood and was binding from the time of its being given until after the death of Colbert."

"I suppose Louvois must have been a very devoted Catholic, and may be he thought he was doing right to influence the king against the Protestants," suggested Julia March.

"It is well to be as charitable as possible toward all men, Julia; but it is a fact, however, that this man did not care for any religion at all. He was a quarrelsome, impulsive, ambitious man, who loved to fight better than he loved peace. His influence added to that of Madam de Maintenon was that which induced the king to again begin the miserable business of persecuting people who did not agree with him in points of religious belief. Although the king's measures were at first quite mild, they continued to grow more and more intolerant. At last the king wrote an order like this: 'All women, not noble, found at such assemblies [Protestant meetings], shall be whipped and branded with the fleur-de-lis.'"

"Why, I thought King Louis XIV. was such a polite man; I supposed he was very chivalrous," said Maggie Palmeter.

"He was, indeed; so much so that he would always take off his hat to a servant girl, and yet he so far forgot himself as to persecute women as well as men most cruelly."

"Did they succeed, finally, professor, in their object, of crushing out the religion of the Huguenots?"

"O no; but still, after a long time of the most cruel persecution and torture, thousands of people renounced the religion of their fathers, and professed Catholicism,—not because they were convinced of its righteousness, but only because they felt that they could endure torture no longer."

"I don't see why people could not always be contented to convert men as the apostle did. You know professor, he said he didn't believe in forcing people, but in coaxing or convincing them. There's a verse in the Bible that is right to the point, only I can't think of it," said Julia March.

"I presume the verse to which you refer is this one: 'Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men,' answered the teacher. "But after the revocation of this famous Edict of Nantes, which occurred in 1685, and which was really about the same as signing the death warrant of all Huguenots who would not recant, it was decided by the foolish king and his cruel advisers that they could improve upon the apostle's manner of making conversions; so they went about compelling men instead of persuading them. The ministers of the offending denomination were given only two weeks to leave the country. But because they so dreaded to leave their poor people, some of them refused to go, so they were tortured and hanged and put upon the wheel and broken—which was a mode of punishment only meted out to criminals."

"O!" exclaimed Milly Brown. "Why didn't they run away out of the country?"

"Thousands of them did, though they were even forbidden to do that. Finally, some of the countries of Europe formed a grand alliance against Louis. But he, anticipating an attack, sent soldiers over into Germany, and literally destroyed the district of Palatinate, leaving 100,000 people homeless wanderers."

"I suppose the poorer classes in France felt the horrore of war about as much as the ones whom their soldiers were fighting, after all, didn't they?" asked practical Jack.

"Almost, Jack; for after peace was declared in 1697 the country was in such a low condition that the highest wages paid a laborer was only about eight cents a day."

"What could they have had to eat? I don't see how they could have bought themselves food at all."

"They lived mostly upon rye porridge. But even though they could not afford meat for themselves, they were obliged to furnish it for the soldiers."

"Dear me! I am really weary of hearing about war. I did hope France settled down at last, and didn't need any more soldiers," said Julia March.

"It is sad, indeed, Julia, that the pages of history must be so marred. But, O no; the war of the 'Spanish Succession' was soon begun, between France and Germany,—Louis determining that his grandson Philip, should sit upon the Spanish throne, and the emperor of Germany determining that this honor belonged to his son."

"What a foolish thing to fight over!" exclaimed Charlie White.

"Foolish indeed to fight over for ten years; after some years of fighting, Louis was obliged to endure the humiliation, because England and Germany were both against her,—of seeing the son of the German emperor take the Spanish throne. The year 1708-9 was noted as being the most terribly cold winter that France had known in many years. Charlie and Rob can understand, because they have seen the River Rhine, and know what a rushing, rapidly flowing river it is, that the weather must have been very cold to lock its surging waters with a key of frost."

"I don't see how it could be cold enough for that, professor," said Rob Billings. "It did not look as if it could ever hold still long enough to be frozen."

"But the cold weather was not the only trouble. This was a year of horrible famine. Even the king sacrificed his silver and gold dishes to be made into money, to buy food for the poor. So let us credit him with doing this good deed.

"Finally, although at first the fortunes of war turned in favor of Germany, Louis was at last successful, and so his grandson, Philip the Fifth, was seated upon the throne of Spain, and the war of the Spanish Succession came to an end in 1713.

"Next week I will ask Julia March to tell us something about the death of Louis XIV."
