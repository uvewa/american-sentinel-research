THE Journal, of this city, has been publishing some pictures of the pope, taken by the "biograph," which represents him in action as he appears in the Vatican. Among other things the pictures show the papal benediction; so that by this bit of journalistic enterprise the papal benediction can be not only seen but actually received by people in this country; for Archbishop Martinelli, asserts the Journal, "in a telegram to the editor, says that the benediction will give the same benefits to those who see it in the Mutoscope as if they actually received it from the holy father in person." And no doubt they will, every bit!
