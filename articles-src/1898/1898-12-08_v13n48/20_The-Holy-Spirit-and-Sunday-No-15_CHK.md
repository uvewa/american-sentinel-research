We have seen that Jesus Christ is the Author of religious liberty; that he promulgated this principle, and practiced it himself, thus setting the example to his followers for all time. And we have seen that people cannot depart from this principle without being arrayed in that thing at least, against God and man.

The recognition of this principle means the recognition of the doctrine of separation of the church and the state. It is impossible to unite these two latter without subverting the former. Hence, in clearly-defined language, we find Christ teaching that church and state should be kept separate. This is found in Matt. 22:21. The facts that led up to the declaration of Christ in this scripture are these: Certain of the pharisees, having counselled how they might entangle Christ in his talk, sent their disciples and the Herodians with the question, "Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar?" Their purpose of course was to get him to answer in the affirmative or negative. It mattered not to them which it should be. If he should say "Yes," then he would be denounced as a friend of the Roman Government—at the head of which was Caesar, and the yoke of which the Jews hated—and therefore an enemy of the Jewish nation. If on the other hand Christ should answer "No," then he would be denounced as the enemy of the Roman Government. In either case the position of Christ would be punishable with death, and to bring this about was the very thing that the pharisees had planned and hoped for. "But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they brought him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."

Thus the Saviour exposed their hypocrisy and made them acknowledge that there were certain things belonging to Caesar which common honesty demanded should be rendered to Caesar. At the same time Christ told them that they should render to God the things that were God's.

What was true then is true now. The things of God and Caesar cannot be mixed. Confusion would inevitably be the result, the climax being that neither God nor Caesar would get that which was respectively theirs. Not only is this gospel truth, but common sense teaches it, and history proves it.

It requires no argument to prove that Cæsar represents the civil government. At the time of Christ, Cæsar was the representative of the civil government of Rome. The one stands for the other; hence their names are used synonymously. Therefore the only things that belong to Cæsar or to the civil government are the things which are purely civil. With civil things only can civil governments have rightfully anything to do. The things that are religious are to be rendered direct to God. It is clear therefore that when the civil government demands that which belongs to God, it puts itself in the place of God; and demanding the things that belong to God it is only a question of time when it will lose even the things which belong to itself. In other words, the time would come when a religious hierarchy would get the ascendancy, and control even those things that are civil, for its own ends.

In asserting the doctrine of separation of church and state, the Saviour also taught the doctrine that all men are equal—that the natural rights of all men are equal and inviolable. It could not be otherwise. The civil government is the "minister of God to thee for good." In its proper place human government can be nothing else but good—no matter what the form of government might be. But they can be what they were intended to be only as they recognize the equality of all men. And the government that comes the nearest to recognizing this principle comes the nearest to the mind of Christ with reference to earthly governments; and so far as it is possible, would come the nearest to that divine government over which Christ is to rule when all earthly governments shall be no more. And the more the equal rights of all men are recognized by any government, the less tyrannical will that government be.

As in the matter of religious liberty, so of these things—they are the teachings of Jesus Christ. Both were denied by the papacy. But they were recognized by the founders of this Government, and incorporated into the fundamental law of the land; and this too with the express object of keeping out from governmental affairs the papacy or anything like the papacy, no matter what name it might go under.

Thus in the immortal Declaration of Independence we have the words, "We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." And when the Constitution was framed, these principles, as stated above, were incorporated into it.

This is Christ-like. This is lamb-like. And, as we said last week, with reference to the question of religious liberty, so we now say with reference to the foregoing: the United States is the only Government in all history from the days of Christ down, that ever followed the example of Christ. And Bancroft spoke the truth when he said, "Vindicating the right of individuality even in religion, and in religion above all, the new nation dared to set the example of accepting in its relation to God the principle first divinely ordained in Judea."

Thus it is proven conclusively that the United States is the government symbolized by the beast having the two horns like a lamb. Rev. 13:11.
