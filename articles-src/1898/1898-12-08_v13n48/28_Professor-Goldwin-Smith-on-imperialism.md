Professor Goldwin Smith, Toronto, gives his view of American imperialism, as exemplified in the transaction relating to the Philippines, in the following:—

"It is edifying to mark how frankly the Spanish colonies are treated by the American jingoes as prizes captured in war, with which they are at liberty to deal just as they think fit, without the smallest regard for the rights or wishes of the native populations. The eight millions of Filipinos, who have been in arms for their own liberation, are regarded as part of the booty, to be kept, sold or transferred, just as the interest of the captor may dictate; yet the war was commenced with the most solemn disavowals of aggrandizement."
