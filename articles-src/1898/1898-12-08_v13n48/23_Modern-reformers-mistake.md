The mistake that is made by modern reformers, said the Rev. W. M. Lawrence (Baptist) at a meeting of Chicago ministers, is that "they create great agitations regarding rum-selling and gambling, and endeavor to have laws made and enforced against these evils, without in reality making one man or woman better or more able to withstand temptation than he would be if there were no such laws enforced. The place to begin is with the individual. When you have made a sufficient number of individuals better you have removed just that number from the evil influences which are so loudly decried."

This is sound doctrine. The remedy, if it is to be effective, must be applied where the evil begins, which is in the individual heart.
