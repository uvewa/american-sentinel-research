"Mary shined at school to-day 'cause I telled her how," would fittingly express the position which many people occupy in the world. They seem to shine, but they borrow all their brilliancy from those more luminous than themselves. They go through life just as the indolent student goes through college—never quite able to stand upon their own merits, wrestling with each difficult problem until it is mastered, but always depending upon somebody else to light up the dark corners of their inactive minds, and thus help them to "shine."

A satellite is never radiant only as the light from some luminous body shines upon it; all the brilliancy which it seems to possess is a mere reflection. When we behold the "moon's full orb" at night, we say it shines; but further investigation proves that all its radiance is borrowed from the sun. There are people in the world who, upon first acquaintance, seem to shine, but their radiance will not bear the test of investigation. These human satellites revolve about, making many good pretensions, and are eager to be among the first to set before the public philanthropic plans, etc., which some star of the first magnitude has perseveringly devised. Such people are to church and society what the drone is to the hive: they occupy space, do a great deal of buzzing, and carefully avoid work. They do not know just what attitude to assume in regard to questions which arise from time to time, which pertain to personal or public good, although weighty consequences may hang upon their decision;—these human satellites are decidedly opaque until some influential soul "tell's them how" to shine. They love to be popular, to go with the masses, and to abide by the opinions and decisions of those whom the world recognizes as leaders.

And how easy it is to become a satellite,—to do as others do, simply because others do that way, thus casting our influence whichever way will insure to us the greatest social standing. If a temperance or religious question confronts us, instead of searching carefully and prayerfully for ourselves to know what the Word of God, the only criterion, really teaches, how much more agreeable to the human heart to trace an interlinear wrought out by some popular religious teacher, and thus place ourselves where we may easily be "carried about by every wind of doctrine." Instead of seeking earnestly for God's solution of every problem which comes to us in life's experience, it is so much easier to consult the key of some mortal man, and accept his solution as authority.

Ah! the human satellite is the heart unrenewed by the grace of God; it is the abode of darkness. It is like the arc lamp which has no connection with the source of power, but which, the moment the connection is made, sends forth its precious gleams in every direction. The convict in the dungeon cell, wholly shut away from the sunlight which causes the flowers to bloom and flourish just outside the wall, is so near the light, yet knows only darkness. And there is just as really a wall of sin separating the unbelieving soul from the divine rays of the Sun of righteousness, which cause the Christian to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth. It is only a step from the darkness to the light: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." The moment we reach the exit of a tunnel we are in the light. The moment we confess our sins, that moment we are cleansed—we are called "out of darkness into His marvelous light." The arc lamp receives its illumination from within, and radiates its light to the outer world. So it is with the human heart when it is emptied of self and filled with the Holy Spirit: it must shine, for the power of God is there; and "in him is no darkness at all." The influence of such a soul constantly tends to lead others to forsake the ways of sin. Of such, Jesus says, "Ye are the light of the world." The Holy Spirit abiding in the heart makes it luminous, as a light upon a candlestick, which "giveth light unto all that are in the house."

"Only a step to Jesus"—but how contrary to human pride to take it; and yet how many in the whirl of society to-day realize that the pleasures of the world are empty—bubbles upon the rough sea of life, which fail to satisfy the longings of the soul. How many a youth inwardly admires the character of the follower of Christ, and really covets the sweet peace which he daily enjoys. But how many, instead of surrendering self, seek to ease conscience by good works, and continue to dwell in darkness, knowing nothing of the inward illumination of the heart, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. They may even put forth efforts to rescue souls from sin; but some way their efforts prove fruitless. They fail to dispel the shadows of evil from the inmost soul.

Ah! selfishness shines only outwardly. All its good works are but imitations of the fruits of the Spirit. But how hard it is to cut loose from the world, to exchange the life of sin for one of righteousness. But those who choose the "pleasures of sin for a season," who shine merely outwardly, will never participate in the joys of eternity. There will be no satellites in the galaxy of heaven. Every soul that shall help constitute that company of immortal beings, to shine "as the stars forever and ever," will have known what it was to be emptied of self and filled with the Holy Spirit. They will have done good works because the Spirit impelled them to do so. They will have won souls to Christ because the Christ Spirit dwelling within drew them by the "cords of love."

Christ could reach forth a rescuing hand to the poorest of the poor; and he who has the Spirit of Christ dwelling within, can reach down to the lowest depths of iniquity and point the vilest sinner to a seat reserved for him at God's right hand—if he will only take it. And there is more real joy in rescuing one sinner than there is in all the pleasures of the world. The sweet singer of ancient Israel appreciated the superior joys of the Christian when he said: "I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness."

There are many satellites in the world to-day whose seeming radiance will soon go out in oblivion. But, precious thought, there are many suns in the human constellation whose brilliancy is destined to "shine more and more unto the perfect day." The all important decision rests with each soul whether he will be a satellite or a sun.
