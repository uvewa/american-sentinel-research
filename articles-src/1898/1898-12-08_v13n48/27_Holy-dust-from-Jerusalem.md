One hundred pounds of earth from Jerusalem, gathered in the Garden of Gethsemane, recently came into the Chicago customs house, says the Chicago Times-Herald, brought in by an "eminent commander" of a Chicago Masonic order. The purpose of this remarkable importation is that members of this Order may have "holy dust" sprinkled on their biers after they are dead. The idea, it is said, "is destined to receive much attention all over the country and to be looked upon with great favor." This is all very fitting for a society which lives upon forms and ceremonies, and for such only. There is no holiness apart from God, and no ground was ever holy save as it was made so by his presence.
