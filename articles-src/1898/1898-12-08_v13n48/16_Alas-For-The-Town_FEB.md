One day hell's ambassador came to a town,
He looked round about with a sinister frown;
For the jails were all empty, there were scarce any traces
Of drinking, or betting, or even horse races.
There were schools and libraries, and many a steeple,
And the order and peace told the manner of people.
He called on the mayor, and asked, if 'twas law
That made all the righteousness round him he saw?
But the mayor laughed loudly, then pointed above,
And said, "Nay, my good sir, it is heaven-sent love.
Come down to our church the next meeting, and see
If with such gospel preaching we different could be."

"So I will," said the demon. "If there's preaching 'gainst sin,
'Twill be just the first place where I ought to start in.'"
So when the good people came into the meeting,
They gave to the demon unknown a kind greeting.
"Alas!" said the demon, "this warmth in the church
'Is just what is leaving our cause in the lurch.
'Grim coldness must come here. I must not speak loud,
'But where love runs so freely, there's always a crowd.'"
The singing was hearty, the prayer was sincere,
The preaching the kind that a demon might fear.
He wriggled and twisted, and then said, "I'll plan
'To get in this pulpit a different man."

"I'll send Fashion down here to trim up the people,
"I'll get them to building a far higher steeple;
"For 'twill help our cause better to have them in poles
"Be more interested than in these lost souls.
"I'll send Folly into the town with her graces,
"We'll soon have saloons here, and plenty of races;
"But the first thing I'll do, if I possibly can,
"Will be to get rid of that gospel-hot man."

The demon went slowly on a well-defined mission.
He set the good people to longing and wishing;
And Fashion came after, and after came Folly,
And took hold of Peter and Patience and Polly,
And old Mrs. Grundy stepped up to the pastor,
And said, "If he kept up, he'd have to move faster."

And when pride and vanity grew very bold,
The people in Christ-Church were haughty and cold.
But the pastor, long tempted, unyielding, stood true,
And he gave them the gospel, and he bade them adieu;
For the demon had worked all the length of his plan,
And got them to send for a new-fashioned man.

The new-fashioned preacher had sermons a pile.
He made the folks wonder and clap hands and smile;
But in spite of his rhetoric, 'twas patent to all
That his audience somehow was growing quite small.
'Twas choice as the choicest; but still far too thin
For the kind of a hearing his talent should win.

He passed with the crowd, and he saw many faces,
That once were at church, going off to the races.
And all the saloons were in prosperous order,
He noted statistics as if a recorder.

Just then as he pondered o'er what he would do,
His old friend came up. "What!" you look very blue.

"What's the trouble?" said he. "Oh, the trouble is sore;
"For I can't get the folks out to church any more.
"Horse-racing, and betting, saloons. Sunday papers
"Are making them play up most unloving capers.
"Good preaching and culture and ethics all passes
"As so much wind blown o'er the heads of the masses."

"Ha! ha!" said the demon. "That's hard. Let me see.
"I think I can help you Come walk on with me.
"Get a law to forbid all this racing; for say,
"The people ought surely to keep the blest day.
"Shut up the saloons, sir, and don't get out papers,
"And see if you can't change the people's bad capers.

"If when all that now tempts them is out of the way,
"And then they won't come to the church on one day,
"We can make the law straighter, though now it half shocks,
"(Yet they did it some years since), and get out the stocks!

"If the people still haggle, and still do refuse,
"Why, then, there's the rack and 'ye olden thumbscrews;'
"And if we keep at it, I say it with awe,
"We can bring them to time, when love's gone, with hard law."

"I've been looking for this for some time, for you see,
"No souls are so useful to mine and to me,
"As those who turn hypocrites, sinister knaves,
"Who'll toil in the law-chains as if they were slaves.
"And I tell you your church will become a delight
"To us demons who'll fairly split sides at the sight.

"We will set men as spies to hunt out the delinquent,
"And put the police star on some hardened old skinflint.
"You could rule as a king then, and have, don't you see?
"The reverence that should mark a true laity.
"In fact all you wanted to you would be given:
"For couldn't your word open hell, or shut heaven?"

The parson walked on, and he longed to be great.
He thought on the wonderful chances of fate,
And went to the caucuses, pulled every wire,
Where he couldn't persuade, he got some one to hire.
He talked to the people, till many grew bold
In welding their-own chains in which to be sold.
They rolled in petitions till all Congress saw
There was no other way than to give him the law.

Ah me! and alas! the Dark Ages came down
And settled and killed out all love from the town.

Say, have you heard men who are preaching this way,
Take down the old Bible, and read it, and pray?
Didn't God send the preachers to seek for lost souls?
What business have they to be wireing the polls?
For the old-time religion that springs up from love,
Is the only religion that's mentioned above.
