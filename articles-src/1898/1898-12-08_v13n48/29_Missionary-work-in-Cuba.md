The Chicago Times-Herald says that "the United States Government has still a large missionary work to perform in Cuba, and that is to teach the Cuban army first, and the Cuban people afterward, that a military government is not an acceptable substitute for republican government. We went to war because Spanish oppression and cruelty in Cuba had become intolerable. We do not propose that they shall be succeeded by Cuban oppression and cruelty." The meaning of which is that the American army must remain in Cuba until the Cubans give satisfactory evidence that they are able to govern themselves. Meanwhile American enterprises will obtain such a hold upon the island that it will be very difficult to convince a large class of enterprising and wealthy American citizens that Cuba ought ever to be released from Anglo-Saxon control.
