In "Legal Maxims," compiled and published by Herbert Broom, LL. D., a London barrister, the right of conscience is upheld in the following words:—

"Summa ratio est quae pro religione facit,—That rule of conduct is to be deemed binding which religion dictates.

"The maxim above cited from the commentaries of Sir E. Coke is in truth, derived from the Digest; where Papinian, after remarking that certain religious observances were favored by the Roman law, gives as a reason, Summan esse rationem quae pro religione facit.

"It may, however, safely be affirmed that, if ever the laws of God and man are at variance, the former are to obeyed in derogation of the latter; that the law of God is, under all circumstances, superior in obligation to that of man; and that, consequently, if any general custom were opposed to the divine law, or if any statute were passed directly contrary thereto,—as if it were enacted generally, that no one should give alms to any object in ever so necessitous a condition,—such a custom, or such an Act, would be void.

"It may further be observed, that, upon these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human laws can be suffered to contradict these. For instance, in the case of murder: this is expressly forbidden by the divine, and demonstrably by the natural law, and if any human law should allow or enjoin us to commit it, we are bound to transgress that human law, or else we must offend both the natural and the divine. 'Neither are positive laws, even in matters seemingly indifferent, any further binding than they are agreeable with the laws of God and nature.'

"It cannot, however, be doubted that obedience to the laws of our country, provided such laws are not opposed to the law of God, is a moral duty; and, therefore, although disobedience is justifiable in the one case supposed, of a contradiction between divine and human laws, yet this is not so either when the human law affirms the divine* in a matter not indifferent in itself,—as when it forbids theft, or when the human law commands or prohibits in a matter purely indifferent; and in both these cases it becomes a moral duty on the part of the subject to obey."

These legal maxims constitute what may be called the classics of Anglo-Saxon law—the foundation principles established centuries ago, affirmed by the most celebrated legal authorities, and which have come down unchallenged to the present time. As such they are justly to be regarded as unquestionable authority.

*This is true as the authors meant it, but not as affirming that human law can rightfully affirm the law of God, as such.
