The effort to force Sunday observance upon the seventh-day people and others of Ford's Store, Md., appears to be growing in intensity and bitterness. The intolerant ones now say that they will petition the next legislature to enact a law by which people who are religiously opposed to the dogma that Sunday is the Christian Sabbath, and refuse to observe it as such, will be sent to the workhouse, there to work out the amount of their fines and costs at hard labor.

Another incident which illustrates the spirit that is behind this effort to maintain the "sanctity of the Christian Sabbath," is that Mr. Neal, whose trial and conviction for Sunday work we have already noted, was not tried under the Sunday law, but under a law for regulating the sale of goods, he being a storekeeper.

Under this law a heavier penalty could be secured than under the Sunday law, his fine amounting to twenty dollars, while the maximum fine under the Sunday law, for the first offense, is but five dollars. Mr. Neal's offense was that of selling goods on Sunday, and his prosecutors found some means of convicting him under this law which provided the heavier penalty. His fine, however, was paid by some one whose identity remains unknown; consequently Mr. Neal was released.
