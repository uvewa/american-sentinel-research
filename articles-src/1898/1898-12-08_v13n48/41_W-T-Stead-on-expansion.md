Mr. W. T. STEAD, the well-known English journalist, has been making a general tour of Europe, and tells what he found the general sentiment of Europe to be with reference to the new American policy of "expansion." He says:—

"Outside of England I have not met a single non-American who was not opposed to the expansion of America. Nor through my whole tour of Europe have I met a European who did not receive the protestations of the genuine sincerity with which the Americans entered upon the war with more or less mock incredulity."

And, adds the Times-Herald (Chicago), which published the above, "Mr. Stead reports that the bitterest hostility of all was found at the Vatican." That the Vatican should be hostile to the policy of despoiling the most faithful Catholic nation of her colonies, is altogether natural, and taken in connection with Mr. Stead's positive affirmation, may be regarded as conclusive evidence of the fact, notwithstanding representations made by Catholic authorities in this country. And now that American government is being extended to Catholic lands, Rome will work with redoubled energy to remodel that government upon the principles of the papal church.
