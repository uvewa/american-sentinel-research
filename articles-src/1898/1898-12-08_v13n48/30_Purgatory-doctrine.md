The following was printed, editorially, in the Pittsburg Catholic, of November 16:

"A striking sermon on purgatory was within this month preached in the Catholic church. The Catholic doctrine on this subject was laid down in clear and explicit terms. They who were privileged to be present could not but realize the important duty devolving upon them, to be generous in their prayers, to storm heaven, as it were, by masses said and supplications for the souls in purgatory. By so doing the faithful people of God will find rest for themselves as well as for the suffering souls."

This is the precise doctrine, the preaching of which by Tetzal aroused the first active opposition of Martin Luther. To-day the Catholic Church uses this scheme to draw money from the pockets of the people without any particular protest being heard.
