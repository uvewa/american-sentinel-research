At a meeting called by colored people of Chicago to express their sentiments relative to the situation which has developed in the Carolinas, the following resolutions were passed, which, aside from the sentiment of regard for right and justice which they express, constitute a most forcible comment on the present pose of the nation as being divinely commissioned to propagate the principles of free and just government among the peoples of foreign lands:

"WHEREAS, The campaign of crime and bloodshed prosecuted by the white people of North and South Carolina against colored citizens has resulted in the butchery of more than a score of unoffending men, women and children; and—

"WHEREAS, The openly avowed purpose of the white people to disfranchise colored voters and to drive colored men from positions in the public service has been successfully accomplished through arson, mob law, and murder; be it—

"Resolved, That the colored citizens of Chicago, in mass meeting assembled, respectfully appeal to the President of the United States to give the cause of these oppressed people the benefit of some recommendation in his next annual message to Congress, and we appeal to Congress to prosecute an investigation into the revolution in the Carolinas, and for the enactment of a statute which shall make representation in Congress dependent upon the number of qualified voters in the several states.

"Resolved, That we express ourselves as unalterably opposed to the acquisition of foreign territory until the nation shows its purpose and power to govern its people at home. A government which cannot protect its citizens under the shadow of the capitol ought not to assume to protect 10,000,000 of foreigners 8,000 miles away. (Italics ours.)

"Resolved, That we appeal to all fair-minded people for a patient consideration of the questions which agitate the nation, and, believing that the permanence and security of every nation must rest in the supremacy of the law, we earnestly bespeak for our race the support of public sentiment in our contest against mob law everywhere, whether assailing our right to vote in North Carolina or denying us the right to work in Illinois.

"Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, properly engrossed, be sent to the President of the United States, a copy to each member of the Illinois delegation in Congress, and copies to the Chicago press."
