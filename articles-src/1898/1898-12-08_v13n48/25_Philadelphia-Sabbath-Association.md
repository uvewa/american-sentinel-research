The editor of a Seventh-day Baptist paper reports that "A conversation with the secretary of the Philadelphia 'Sabbath Association,' after the public meeting, revealed the fact that he 'is hoping' to find three men in each of certain districts of the city who will unite, thus securing a hundred or more men who will push the work of compelling the city authorities to execute the Sunday laws against 'laundries,' Jewish clothing stores, and similar 'small fry.' Nothing appeared in his plans touching the agitation of the fundamental issues of the Sabbath question." There is renewed activity all over the country in agitating for a more rigid enforcement of laws for the observance of Sunday.
