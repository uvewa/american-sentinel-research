"New York Journal," December 1.

Has a man the right to pick apples on Sunday on his own farm? That is the question which will engage the attention of the Westchester County Grand Jury next Monday.

Mrs. Winifred Horton, an aged and pious resident of Sing Sing, says that such conduct is unlawful, and makes a specific accusation against her former neighbor, Andrew Eck. She charges that on Sunday, September 18, she was walking in her garden when she saw Farmer Eck come out of his house, go to his orchard and then and there pick several ripe apples from an overhanging limb.

Mrs. Horton knew that Farmer Eck was doing wrong, so she went to the office of Justice Stuart Baker, in Sing Sing, and informed him of the culpable act. Justice Baker, also esteemed for his piety, carefully considered the merits of the case and concluded to sustain the charge.

He issued a warrant for the arrest of Farmer Eck, and when it was served the old gentleman nearly collapsed. He appeared with the constable before the Justice, who, puzzled as to what sentence to impose, released the prisoner on $20 bail.

County Judge Smith Lent, of Westchester County, a resident of Sing Sing, finally heard of the case and ordered that the Grand Jury investigate it.

The action of Judge Lent was highly pleasing to Farmer Eck, who did not want the charge hanging over him, and who is confident that he will not be indicted for taking his own fruit from his own tree, even on a Sunday, in the presence of a pious woman.

Mrs. Horton will go to White Plains to tell her side and sustain the charge. Since it was made there has not been the best of neighborly feeling between the farmer and Mrs. Horton; in fact, they have ceased to speak as they pass by.
