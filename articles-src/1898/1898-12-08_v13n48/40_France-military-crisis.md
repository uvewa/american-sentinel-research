News from France is of the gravest character,—the republic is liable at any time to be swept away by the military power. The London Spectator, of December 3, declared, "It is our sincere belief that a great event is immediately at hand in France." And the French premier, M. Dupuy, is quoted thus: "We have been living for twenty-eight years upon a pious misunderstanding, and it is surprising that it can have lasted so long. We have placed side by side an army and a democracy. Now it is only too true that these two institutions have as their foundation contradictory principles." The acuteness of the present situation lies in the fact that the military, under the lead of General Zurlinden, is determined that Colonel Picquart, under arrest for complicity in the Dreyfus affair, shall be tried by court-martial December 12, and the Government wishes to postpone the trial but does not dare to do so.
