The United States Government gives to Spain $20,000,000 for the Philippine group of islands, with all that is on them. For this sum, besides the land and its natural wealth, eight million human beings have been transferred from the rule of Spain to that of the United States, with as much deference to their own wish in the matter as if they had been "the cattle upon a thousand hills." Yet it had been supposed that the days of buying and selling beings made in the image of God, under the authority of the United States of America, had forever passed away.
