The Evening Star, Washington, D. C., reports that a Catholic monastery is in process of erection in a suburb of that city,—the first of its kind to be erected in this country. It will be an imposing structure, and will have a chapel or church in close connection with it. It will be under the control of the "Franciscan Fathers of the Holy Land." The church is described as being remarkable for its "underground shrines and passages." The underground portion of Catholic churches and other edifices are usually well filled with rooms which are intended for uses that will not bear the test of public inspection.
