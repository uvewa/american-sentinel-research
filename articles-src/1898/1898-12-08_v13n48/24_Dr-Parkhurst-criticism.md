Although but a few months ago no one in America dreamed that the United States would occupy the position as a world power that it does to-day, it is coming to be counted as an offense but little short of treason to advocate a continuance of the national policy that has been followed up to the time of the war with Spain. The Rev. Dr. Parkhurst, for uttering the words printed by us last week, warning against a departure from the principles of Government advocated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, provoked a storm of hostile criticism from his brother clergymen, one of them going so far as to say that "If Dr. Parkhurst and Professor Norton talked in any other nation during a war as they had in this, they would have been tried for high treason." All this smacks of the despotic systems of the Old World, and is very significant.
