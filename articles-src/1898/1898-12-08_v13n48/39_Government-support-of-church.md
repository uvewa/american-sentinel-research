Whether the church in Cuba, or the Philippines, or anywhere else, prospers or goes down, is not a question with which the United States Government, or any government, has rightfully any concern. Whether or not it would be for the benefit of the Cubans to maintain the Catholic Church in the island, is a religious question, depending altogether upon the truth or falsity of religious doctrine; and when the Government undertakes to uphold the church in Cuba it assumes as true that which can be demonstrated as true or false only by the divine Spirit of truth. It has no shadow of right to meddle in such matters. It has no business whatever to consult with Catholic church officials, or any other church officials, concerning the affairs of the Catholic or any other church in Cuba or the Philippines, or anywhere else. The maintenance of a church is purely a church affair, and the Government is undertaking to do in Cuba that which devolves upon the Catholic Church alone. What business has it to make itself the servant of the Catholic Church? What business has it to compel Protestants to support the Catholic Church in Cuba, by taxing them for its maintenance, under the plea of a "temporary loan"? Reader, what do you think of these things?
