The following appeared recently in the Times, Alexandria, Va., and gives some information which will be of interest to those who have made note of the arrest and imprisonment of two seventh-day observers at Ford's Store, Maryland, for non-observance of Sunday:—

### "MEN IN JAIL ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR RELIGION."

"An old citizen having seen in the Times, some weeks ago, that two Adventists, Rhodes and Curlett, were held in jail at Centreville, Queen Anne County, Md., for cutting corn on Sunday, wrote to them regretting that such a state of things could exist in Maryland and urging agitation to induce the voters there to secure an amendment of the Sunday law similar to that in the Code of Virginia which declares that no penalty shall be incurred for work on Sundays by any one who conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week should be observed as a Sabbath, and does in fact refrain from secular labor or business on that day. To this the following reply was received yesterday:—

"CENTREVILLE JAIL, Nov. 20, '98.

"DEAR FRIEND: We received a kind and welcome letter from you the other day which encourages us very much. We appreciate kindness and sympathetic words that we may receive from any one. We can see by the tone of your letter that you are not in harmony with the persecuting spirit which prevails in Queen Anne County, Md. We keep the seventh day of the week in accordance with the commandments of God, and work on Sunday, which we are persecuted for. But we rejoice that we are accounted worthy to suffer for His sake who suffered for us. The servant is not greater than his Lord. He has promised in his precious Word that he will never leave us, nor forsake us. And praise to his most holy name we are getting an experience here that we could never get any otherwise. We remain,

"Yours respectfully,

J. H. RHODES.

J. F. CURLETT.
