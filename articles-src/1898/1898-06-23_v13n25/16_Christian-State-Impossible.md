THE state is the embodiment of power. By power it lives and moves and has its being. Take away the power and there is nothing left of the state.

States are, by their very nature, independent powers. When the state yields to another power, its own identity is lost, and it remains but a part of the conquering power so long as the authority of the latter is exercised over it.

But the state cannot be Christian without yielding to another power and thus surrendering its independence. For the first step in Christianity is submission to the will of God. The state therefore would simply lose itself in the government of God. In that government there are no states.

And it is a truth which all Christians know, that no person can become Christian without first passing through death. The Apostle Paul says that he was "alive" before being converted to Christianity, but that "when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died." Rom. 7:9. And his experience is that of all Christians. Man, as he was before conversion, must die, before he can become Christian.

Christianity means a new creation. All that is of earth, must have a new creation before the stamp of Christianity can appear upon it.

And this utterly debars the state. For as nothing can become Christian without first passing through death, the state would simply pass out of existence in the endeavor to acquire the stamp of Christianity.

There is no "new birth" for a state.
