The physical examination of applicants for military service under the Government, has revealed a fact which the Government may well view with apprehension. It has been found that a large per cent. of such applications have to be refused, because of injury the applicant has experienced from the use of tobacco; principally in the form of cigarettes. And what lends particular force to this fact is the further fact that this percentage has largely increased since the time of the Civil War, when similar examinations were conducted under the calls for volunteers then made.

In the light of these facts it is easily seen that the cigarette is nothing less than a deadly enemy of the United States Government. It is really a much worse enemy than Spain. It disqualifies for service a much larger number of American citizens than would be disqualified by death and wounds in any ordinary war; and for all this there is no compensation in the way of loss to the enemy. The enemy keeps ever fresh and vigorous. Its harmfulness is not particularly felt under the circumstances attending war with a decadent power like Spain. But should there be war with a strong power, the seriousness of the evil which the cigarette has inflicted upon the nation would be painfully felt. A soldier physically unable to execute orders in a military campaign is as useless as one who would refuse to obey them.

Not all the spies that Spain is reputed to have in her employ, nor all the traitors that may be in the land, can do the Government the injury that has been and is being done by the cigarette. Will the Government then recognize this baneful thing as a deadly foe and make its attitude toward it that of an enemy? If the cigarette is an enemy to the Government—as it clearly is, and a most dangerous one at that—why should not the Government be an enemy of the cigarette? Clearly, that would be the only consistent course.

Upon physical grounds, it is much better that men should not indulge in tobacco and intoxicants than that they should not rest from labor one day in seven. Yet the Government has never shown any disposition to curtail indulgence in these things, while it has exhibited unmistakably a disposition to curtail popular indulgence—if we may use the term—in work. The inconsistency can be explained only by admitting that the real reasons for the curtailment of labor one day in the week, are religious.
