OUR next issue will illustrate, by original and specially designed cuts, some very pertinent points in the present status of religious liberty in this country.

Extra copies can be had at the regular price. One dollar per hundred; $8.00 per thousand.

To those of our readers who are deeply interested in the special line of work to which the SENTINEL has been called, but who have not had the privilege of being thoroughly conversant with it in the past, and to those also who value the SENTINEL for reference and help in their work, we would respectfully call their attention to our "Bound Volume" ad. which appears in this issue of the paper.
