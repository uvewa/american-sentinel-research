IT is pointed out by some who defend the policy of territorial extension upon which the nation has entered, that the same objections now made against this policy were made when the nation acquired "Louisiana" and other territory on the North American continent. But this comparison loses its force in view of the fact that the present policy is one which will plant the national flag in the midst of the political strifes of the Old World. To keep possession of the Philippine Islands, the United States will need as big an army and navy as if "Uncle Sam" himself were an Old World power.
