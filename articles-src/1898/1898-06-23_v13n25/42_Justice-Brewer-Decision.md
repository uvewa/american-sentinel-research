A JOURNAL of this city quotes Justice Brewer, of the Supreme Court, as the author of a recent decision which for lack of solid ground to stand on, is comparable only to his decision in 1892 affirming that "this is a Christian nation." The case was that of a railway which had entered into a contract with Mercer County, Ky., to run "through" the county, but had terminated two miles short of the county line. Justice Brewer held that this was to be considered a fulfillment of its obligation in the matter, and in proof quoted from John Bunyan: "As I walked through the wilderness of this world I lighted on a certain place where there was a den," etc. As Bunyan had not gone from one end of the wilderness to the other, it followed that to go "through" a place might mean to go only part way from one side to the other! From this it would appear that the dictionary is not held at a premium in the Supreme Court.
