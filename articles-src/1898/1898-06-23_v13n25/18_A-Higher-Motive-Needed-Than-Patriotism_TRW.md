## A Higher Motive Needed Than Patriotism.

BY T. R. WILLIAMSON.

PATRIOTISM of the right kind is certainly a noble quality. Any man with a man's heart in him must love the neighborhood where he was brought up, where his parents lived, and his near and dear relatives, his playmates, and where he went to school, or to the worship of God on days of worship. These scenes are invested with a sacred charm and a man naturally loves them. And to love the nation is simply a broadening of this love of home, of neighborhood. But no matter how strong this love of country may be, it is not the highest actuating motive in human life.

The newspapers are blowing great gusts of fervid patriotism over the land, in order, largely, to sell papers, and from the way they go on, and from the way people talk who are set going by the papers, one would naturally suppose that there was no other main spring to life and action that can compare with love of country.

But this is a mistake. The highest life motive is that which prompts a man to high, pure living, to noble manhood, to making the best of himself in every way that he knows in order that he may correctly represent and serve the cause of humanity, the interests of the race. Millions are ardent patriots who yet debase their manhood in the very dust by using intoxicating drinks.

Patriotism, though a noble passion, yet may be and often is fervently and strongly felt in saloons as the drinks go around to "one country and one flag," or as the German patriots put it, "Ein country, ein flag, zwei lager."

Patriotism may and often does stir the hearts in dens of vice to earnest wishes for the success of the national arms, but the love of country does not mold anew the character, the aspirations, the life, of any who frequent those places. Patriotism as a life reformer is altogether inadequate to the task.

The nation has called out two hundred thousand men to fight its battles, and seven hundred thousand have applied, and yet it has been a difficult matter to fill the call with healthy, able men, because of the prevalent habit of cigarette smoking. And though this fact is widely known it is certain that cigarette smoking, unless the law shall stop it in defense of the needs of the army, will go on as largely as ever.

Men and boys are ready to rush headlong into a charge, for their country, ready to sail straight into the teeth of deadly batteries, over mines and torpedoes and hidden death and mangling, ready to do and dare to the very utmost to serve the nation; but where are the men who are willing to live a pure, manly, noble life, for the nation?

It is not only charging, fighting, dying, frenzied heroes, that the country wants. It is men who shall be able to endure all hardships from day to day with the best possible chance of living through them, who shall be able to stand coarse fare, sleeping out, unhealthful surroundings, and to take all these with equable temper and patient performance of duty. And this want patriotism alone can never fill.

What is wanted by the nation and by the times is men of character, of pure life, of right habits, of earnest will, of loyal behavior, under all circumstances.

Such men are always in demand, and not the love of any earthly country can train them. Such men can only be trained by the love of heaven, the love of God, the enduring love of the meek and holy Christ.
