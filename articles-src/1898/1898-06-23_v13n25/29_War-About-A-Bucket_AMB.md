## "War About A Bucket."

Co. 12, Nat. Mil. Home, Ohio, June 11th, 1898.

EDITOR OF AMERICAN SENTINEL:—As a subscriber to and reader of your paper, please permit me to make a small complaint. On p. 363, you quote from *The Oriental Watchman* an article, "War About a Bucket"—"a long and bloody war"—while in your comments thereupon you do not so much as mention to your readers another "War About a Bucket" quite as notorious and promising to be as bloody as that of A. D. 1005. Your paper is not lacking in comments elsewhere upon the "Bucket War" to which allusion is here made; but the subject was made so very apropos by your excerpt from the *Watchman*, that a more extended comparison might have been reasonably expected. The writer does not wish to burden your columns with what is flooding our daily papers (or would be but for military censorship); therefore will only add that according to a Spanish Lexicon owned by the writer, the Spanish word "Cuba" is defined as meaning "Bucket."

Very Respectfully Yours,

ALLEN M. BLANCHARD.
