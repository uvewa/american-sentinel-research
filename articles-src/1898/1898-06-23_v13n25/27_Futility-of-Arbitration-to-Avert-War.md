## Futility of Arbitration to Avert War.

In making note of the "fourth annual Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration," recently held at Lake Mohonk, the New York Sun makes the following comments upon the idea of a coming era of general peace through the establishment of the arbitrational method of settling national disputes:—

"It is a queer time for plans of international arbitration. The war between the United States and Spain is a striking evidence of the futility of international arbitration, except in comparatively picayune matters or where one of two nations at controversy is really willing to yield to the other. When the feelings of either nation are strongly stirred, as the feelings of Americans were by the long misrule of the Spaniards in Cuba and by the destruction of the "Maine," the talk of arbitration is preposterous.

"It may be taken for granted that so long as a majority of the American people retain their common sense they will not submit any really important matter to arbitration. If any vital interest of the United States is menaced seriously, it must be protected by the strong hand. There is no other sure way of protecting it. A claim of right cannot be sacrificed to the chances of arbitration, which at the best is a mere lottery.

"Judge Rufus B. Cowing, of this city, told the Mohonkers, perhaps with some ironical intention, that 'altruism' was needed to 'secure arbitration and the de- thronement of our armies and navies.' Precisely. But what would an altruistic nation be? A nation ready to prefer the interests of some other nation to its own. In other words, a fool nation. A country conducted on the altruistic plan would soon be driven to the wall.

"In view of the fact that arbitration is a hopeless humbug in the case of many strikes of workmen, the attempt to apply to the nations of the world a principle that is frequently a failure when applied to a bakery or shoe shop or any other small concern is amusing. Do the Mohonkers want an International Board of Arbitration that will vie in usefulness with that illustrious court, the New York Board of Mediation and Arbitration?

"Until national patriotism dies, and is supplanted by a feeling of international solidarity, or whatever our Socialist philosophers call it, international arbitration, save in the matter of unregarded trifles, must remain a foppery and a toy. The reasonably distinguished and generally amiable gentlemen who aired their views of arbitration at Lake Mohonk might, with as much practical effect upon the policy of nations, have discussed the question, 'Do the inhabitants of Mars shave?'"
