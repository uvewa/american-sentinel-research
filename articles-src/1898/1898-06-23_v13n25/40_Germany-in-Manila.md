GERMANY has reinforced her naval squadron in the Philippine Islands, and now has a naval force in Manila bay that is considered quite the equal of that under command of Admiral Dewey. This is done, of course, with friendly assurances on the part of Germany; but probably it is nowhere more true than in diplomacy that "actions speak louder than words."
