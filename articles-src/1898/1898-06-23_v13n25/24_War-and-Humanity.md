War, though it may be begun professedly in the name of humanity, is never long conducted, even professedly, on that principle. Sooner or later it becomes a war of retaliation and conquest, and beside these every other sentiment sinks into insignificance. It was all very well to talk about the high and unselfish motives which prompted the interference with Spain in Cuba, before any loss had been sustained by the American forces; but when the "Maine" was blown up, the cry was everywhere raised, "Remember the Maine," and in every engagement that has been the animating sentiment in the minds of those representing this country; and now that some loss is being sustained by the troops investing Santiago, and Spanish soldiers have committed barbarities upon the dead bodies of some of their foes, the cry is raised for vengeance upon them because of these indignities.

That is the way it always has been and will be. When one side inflicts a severe loss upon the other, or sustains such a loss, as must sooner or later happen, the burning desire is to get even, to avenge the loss, and to wipe out the memory of the disaster. Such are always the animating motives in carnal warfare; and this war with Spain is no exception. First it was said that it must be undertaken as a high and sacred duty. Next it was said that Spain must be chastised on account of the "Maine;" then when the country had heard from Manila, it was said that the war must be prosecuted to establish an American Empire; and now it is said that Spain must be chastised as a nation of barbarians. And with every fresh ground for indignation and fresh desire for retaliation and conquest which is furnished in the course of events, there will be less said or thought about the interests of humanity which seemed to be paramount at the start. The church must find some other ground for giving her sanction to the war.
