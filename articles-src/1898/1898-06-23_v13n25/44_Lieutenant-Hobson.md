EVERYBODY seems to be agreed that the exploit of young Lieutenant Hobson and his handful of men in Santiago harbor is almost beyond praise as an exhibition of courage, skill and patriotism. But precisely what advantage it is to have the harbor of Santiago blocked against a powerful fleet lying outside, and which would quickly terminate the campaign if it could only get at the enemy's forces lying within the harbor, does not seem to be so clear in the public mind. At least nobody seems disposed to point it out.
