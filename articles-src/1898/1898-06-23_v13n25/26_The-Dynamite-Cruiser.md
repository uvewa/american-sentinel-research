Recently the "dynamite cruiser"—"Vesuvius"—was given a trial of her qualifications for actual warfare, in front of the fortifications of Santiago harbor, Cuba. Three shots were fired from her pneumatic guns, and upon observing their effect, the idea of which the "Vesuvius" is an embodiment was pronounced to be of the greatest practical value. The vessel is looked upon as a great success, and it is probable that steps will soon be taken by the Government to extend its military power in the direction of that which this new type of vessel represents.

The underlying idea of the pneumatic gun is the use of high explosives. These could not be used in the projectiles fired from ordinary cannon, on account of the danger of explosion from the shock the projectile receives when propelled by gunpowder. This danger is overcome in the dynamite gun by using compressed air in the place of gunpowder as the propelling force. The projectiles are filled with gun cotton or nitro-gelatine, the latter being a more powerful explosive than dynamite. The guns of the "Vesuvius" can throw two hundred pounds of this high explosive a distance of several miles; and no vessel afloat would be able to survive even a single blow struck by such a power. There are some of these guns in the forts at the entrance of New York harbor, and some at the entrance of San Francisco harbor. As an experiment one of the latter was used recently to throw a projectile filled with this high explosive across the Golden Gate, a distance of one mile, into some rocky hills on the opposite side; the result being that a hole was blown in the solid rock where the projectile struck, thirty feet deep and sixty-five feet in diameter.

THAT we have reached a time in the history of the world when such appalling agencies of destruction are being discovered and eagerly sought for by the governments of the earth for military uses, is a very significant fact. The use of such things in warfare cannot but have a most baneful effect upon the minds of those who become familiar with them. Human life has been held cheaply enough in the past, even in the most "civilized" warfare; but with the use of these new agencies, it is only to be expected that it will soon come to be held more cheaply than ever. And when human life is held cheaply there is not likely to be a very stable condition of peace.
