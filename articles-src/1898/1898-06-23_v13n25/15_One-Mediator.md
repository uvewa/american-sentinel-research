IT is affirmed in the Book of divine truth that there is "one God" and "one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus."

All men may come to God through Jesus Christ; and only through him can they come to God; for "there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved."

But Jesus Christ is "the man Christ Jesus." And being a man, he is become the representative of the human race.

Thus in the government of God, which covers all our relation to him, we have a representative, "the man Christ Jesus." He stands before the Father's throne as the representative of all on earth who have accepted him as their Saviour. And God views all such as complete in him.

There is, however, a doctrine in the land which proclaims that man may represent his fellowman in religion; that religious acts may and ought to be done by the Government, in which each official is the representative of the people. It is the very common doctrine that "this is a Christian nation." The declaration means that the officials of the Government ought to act for the people in religion.

Manifestly, this idea is wholly contrary to Christianity. One person cannot have faith for another; nor can one be righteous for another. If the people are sinful they must suffer for their sins, and no righteousness on the part of any official, from the President down, could save them. Speaking of a sinful land, the Lord by the prophet Ezekiel says (Eze. 14:13,14): "Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness."

The only righteousness which can save the sinner is the righteousness of Christ, which every person may receive by the exercise of faith. No government can give righteousness to anybody. There is no righteousness in the universe but God's righteousness, for he alone is righteous of himself; and his righteousness is the righteousness of Christ. And having God's righteousness Christ is perfectly fitted to be man's representative in religion; and he alone, of all beings in heaven or earth, is so fitted.

The "Christian race" must be run—the Christian life lived—looking not to the state, but "unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith." Heb. 12:1,2. To look to the state in any matter of religious faith or practice is to look away from Jesus and to depart from the foundation principle of Christianity.
