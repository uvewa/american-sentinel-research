INTERNATIONAL diplomacy was defined recently by a well known clergyman of this city, as being "the art of lying;" and this definition finds support in a statement credited to Bismarck, that the surest way for one diplomat to deceive another in a matter of international controversy would be to tell him the exact truth.

And yet this diplomacy is considered an indispensable thing by all the powers which are called "Christian."
