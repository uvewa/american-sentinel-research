THE present war, ostensibly Christian though it be, furnishes illustrations of the spirit of war that do not at all differ from those furnished by war in general. A young sailor on the cruiser "Montgomery," writing to a relative in Jersey City, describes a battle with two Spanish gunboats, and makes these illustrative remarks about himself: "I look like a pirate;" "I don't know if we killed any Dons or not, but I hope we did." A victory is always welcome in war; but somehow it is never so welcome to the winning side as when there has been a tremendous loss of life on the other side.
