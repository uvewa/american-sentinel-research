## Studies in French History — 27.

"MEANTIME it was quite hard to tell, for sure, just who had a right to France, whether it was the Dauphin Charles or the infant king of England, who was only a very little babe when his father died. However, he was proclaimed King Henry the Sixth, in Paris."

"I imagine that business didn't suit the dauphin very much," said Florence Ray.

"No; it was not at all to his taste, but he was of an indolent, lazy disposition, not inclined to anything harder than dancing and having a good time. Of course he was very young at this time (1422), being only twenty years old. Perhaps this may in part have accounted for his indolent, careless way of living. But when we stop to consider the condition of France at this time; that England had actually conquered a goodly portion of it, and that the infant Henry, of England, had been proclaimed king, right in the ancient capital and metropolis of the land of the Capets, we are astonished that Charles VII. could have been so reckless as he was,—even thinking of going out of the country entirely, and leaving his people to their fate."

"He did not seem to inherit much of the blood of Hugh Capet," observed Edna Phillips.

"No; he inherited his throne, though indeed it had become a tottering one, but he did not fall heir to his patriotism or his courage. The English, indeed, claimed the most of the northern part of France, but Charles might have busied himself to good advantage in relieving the terrible necessities of his poor, starving people. But he seemed incapable of doing anything more serious than dancing."

"Perhaps he did not know of the bad state of things," said Milly Brown, with characteristic sympathy.

"It seems that he could scarcely have been ignorant of the fact that his people were so starved that the poorer classes were very glad to get the dead carcass of a dog to devour. It was at this time that the horrible amusement called the 'Danse Macabre' became quite popular among the wretched people."

"It seems so sad, professor, that I do not like to think about it, and it almost seems a pity to learn about those dreadful things. One almost gets tired of the same old story of horrors. Don't you think so?" asked Julia March.

"Yes; it seems sad to think about or even to learn about. But of course we must take history as it comes to us. We can neither make it better nor worse. But one thing we may do: we can make such a history of our own lives, Julia, that we shall not fear or blush to have it read."

"Will you please tell us a little about that awful play, or something of the kind, you mentioned? I want to know more about it," said Charlie White.

"Certainly; I will tell you all you need to know about it. Remember this was in the early part of the fifteenth century. The name, Danse Macabre, signifies the dance of death. It consisted only in wild and aimless dancing and yelling among the graves. It was participated in by hundreds who desired to do something to forget for a while their miserable existence. This wild revel they would keep up till morning, and then, exhausted and wretched, they would slink away, to return again at night."

"Didn't these horrors disturb the mind of Charles?" asked Will Palmeter.

"Not in the least; nothing of a serious nature ever disturbed him."

"I can't see what made them call him The Victorious, if he was so cowardly," said Will.

"I think they had no reason for it; but I suppose the title pleased his vanity."

"Was this king as eager to get money from his people so that he could live in luxury as some of the other kings had been?" asked Max Smith.

"No; this did not seem to be his disposition He was too indolent to let money matters trouble him. You will believe this the more readily when I tell you that it is related of him that he once needed a pair of shoes, and ordered them delivered. But the shoemaker, being of a more thrifty disposition than Charles, seeing that the money was not forthcoming, refused to leave the shoes. So the king had to get along as well as he could without."

But this neither disturbed his peace of mind nor robbed him of his determination to have a good time."

"I think you said that little Henry VI. of England had been announced king in Paris, after his father died," said Edna. "Didn't he appoint some one to act as king till the baby grew?"

"O yes, indeed; he did not forget that. He was too cool-headed to neglect to make secure the great victories he had won. So the important office of regent was held by the Duke of Bedford."

"I think I've read that he was a wise and good man," said Edna; "affairs must have prospered with him at the head of government."

"I've no doubt they would have prospered better, but for the fact that the duke was more anxious to gain the rest of France for the English crown than to mitigate the sufferings of the people, though he would gladly have done both."

"I would like to know what became of Queen Isabella. I think you have not mentioned her since poor crazy Charles died," said Maggie Palmeter.

"She lived in the very place—the same hotel St. Pol, where her poor neglected husband passed so many years. She lived for a long time, and let us hope she was sorry for the wretched part she had acted before she died."

"Why, let me see," said Will Palmeter, "she must have been the grandmother of the little English king, Henry, wasn't she?"

"Why no; how could that be?" chimed in Rob Billings. "I thought she was the French queen, and the mother of the Dauphin Charles the seventh."

"She was all of that, and yet Will is right. Who can explain? Hands up! Who remembers about this? Jennie Jacobs may answer."

"Why, it is easy enough, I think. Rob forgets that King Henry V. married Catharine, the daughter of crazy Charles and Queen Isabella, so of course their little boy Henry would be the grandson of Isabella."

"I remember it now," said Robert. "I'll just note that in my book, and then I won't be apt to forget it again."

"When the kings and queens of different countries marry each other, it is apt to make quite a change in the map of the countries concerned, and so it is well to make it a point to remember such things."

"Uncle Jack says that when Isabella died, they put the image of a wolf over her as a monument," said Edna.

"So they did, and it was not at all complimentary to her disposition and virtues. Though once she wept when little Henry lifted his baby cap to her, in token of respect, I suppose she did not think she deserved so much. So let us hope she was not entirely without feelings of tenderness.

"About this time a remarkable woman named Jeanne Darc arose, claiming that she was sent of God to deliver France. I would like Robert Billings to tell us all he can of her history, either verbally or in writing, just as he likes, at our next study."
