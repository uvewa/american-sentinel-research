BY E. W. WHITNEY.

During the agitation here in Boulder over the "flag salute," much has been said of the "disloyalty" of Seventh-day Adventists because of their refusal to use the formula connected with the salute. In the face of repeated explanations to the effect that Adventists do not object to showing respect to the flag in a proper manner, and that they are loyal to the principles of which it is the emblem, but that their objection is simply to the use of words which are inconsistent with both the religion of Jesus Christ and with the principles expressed in the Constitution of the United States, there are still those who persistently charge them with disloyalty to the Government. This charge will, doubtless, become more common as the contrast becomes more apparent between true Christian loyalty and that pretended loyalty which places allegiance to the laws of men above that which we owe to God. This possibility should lead to the careful study of what constitutes

**TRUE CHRISTIAN LOYALTY.**

Can the Christian be loyal to both God and the government? The answer depends, perhaps, upon the definition we accept of the word loyal. If we use the word in the narrow and limited sense of implicitly obeying in detail whatever law a government may enact without regard to the higher law of righteousness, it is evident that he cannot always be loyal to both. But if we regard the term in the more comprehensive and better sense of steadfastness in and loyalty to the principles of right upon which all government is supposed to be based, then he can be loyal to both God and the government; rather he must of necessity be loyal to both. Indeed in this true sense the Christian is the most loyal man—the only truly loyal man—that walks the earth.

A familiar yet striking example of such loyalty to God and government is that of Daniel. In his position of president of the princes of Media he was certainly loyal to the king—the government—in the true sense for he was "preferred above" his associates "because an excellent spirit was in him." Yet when it came to obeying specific requirements of the king which were in conflict with Daniel's obligation to God, the very principle of excellence which made him loyal to the government of man in everything consistent with his allegiance to God, made him just as bold to disobey an inconsistent requirement, in his loyalty to the higher government of God. This true loyalty in him was not manifest alone during the reign of one king, Darius, but also during the reign of Cyrus, for the record runs: "So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius (the Median) and in the reign of Cyrus, the Persian." Thus in his loyalty to God and to God's government first, he could also be loyal to the principle of human government under two forms represented by Darius and Cyrus. Though this loyalty led him to utterly refuse to obey the king's decree, and, as a consequence to be cast into the den of lions, yet it proved a blessing to the king, the nation and the world. It caused Darius to acknowledge the true God, and to publish his acknowledgement "unto all people, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth."

A most important lesson for the present time should be learned from this experience, viz., That true loyalty to God and his government first, last and all the time is the truest loyalty to human governments.

## GOVERNMENTS ORDAINED BY GOD.

The principle of government originated with and is ordained by God for a purpose, and whether in the nation or in the church—two distinct fields for its exercise—this principle is to be recognized and respected. But as thus exercised by men as God's agents its recognition is never to supercede the individual recognition of that higher allegiance which every man owes to the author of the principle. Christ and Paul both taught very distinctly that governments should be respected and sustained (see Luke 20:19-26, and Rom. 13:1-7); yet never by precept or example did they teach that such support and recognition should be rendered, either to national or church government, in matters conflicting with any requirement of God upon the individual.

The true attitude of the Christian, then, is that of loyalty to God first, and this principle will make him loyal to any government under which he receives benefits and protection just so far as that government requires nothing of him contrary to his personal obligation to his God. This view of loyalty draws a clearly-defined line between civil and religious requirements. In the one we are to respect the governmental authority of men though their requirements may conflict with our personal selfish interests, for this is for the common good of society, and does not encroach upon our conscientious service to God. In the other, men, no matter what their position or authority, have no right to interfere, and if they do so, true loyalty demands that the individual shall obey God rather than men. Such loyalty will in fact prove better for all concerned, though it may be unjustly adjudged as disloyalty and treason.

## GOD ALONE INFALLIBLE.

It is well to note in this connection that the same principle holds good whether in respect to government as exercised by a church organization or by a state organization. Both are, as at present constituted, organizations of men for a purpose. Both are, however, ordained of God. Each has a different field, but neither, even in its specified field, is infallible. God alone is that. To him each individual, whether ruler or subject, priest or layman, has equal access. And when one avails himself of such access it places him outside and beyond the authority of any man or body of men, either judicial or ecclesiastic, as to matters of conscience in understanding and obeying God's Word.

Perhaps no better presentation of the true principle in its application to both the state and the church can be given than the answer of the apostles when forbidden to teach in the name of Jesus by the "rulers," "elders," "scribes," and "priests." These men, notwithstanding the fact that at that time the Jews were under Roman rule, represented, in their relation to the apostles, both the authority of the church and the state. Paul recognized such relation later (see Acts 23:4,5; and 28:19). Yet with this relation existing and with a just sense of loyalty to both human and divine authority, Peter and John and the other apostles answered and said: "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than to God judge ye. . . . We ought to obey God rather than men."

In the time of Christ the Jewish rulers in their blind zeal to support their national and church customs repudiated, in fact, every principle of true loyalty. In principle it is just as possible now that the same mistake be made by others besides Jews. Christ was the only one truly loyal to the Jewish church and nation when he declared, "Woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous and say: If we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye be the children of them which killed the prophets." And again, when he told them that it was vain for them to worship God while they were "teaching for doctrine the commandments of men."

This is the kind of loyalty needed to-day, rather than that pretended and spurious kind which exalts custom, courts the favor of and stands by men and institutions simply for the favor one hopes to receive in return. In the latter there may seem to be present gain, but it will result only in future loss and eternal ruin. In the former may be seeming present loss, but it will prove future gain and eternal salvation.
