We have heard much in this country from certain ones about the horrors of the "Continental Sunday." The part which imagination, under the stimulus of religious emotion, may play in such descriptions is suggested by some words that were uttered at the hearing at Winnipeg on the proposed Sunday law for Manitoba. Mr. J. S. Ewart, Q. C., had spoken against the measure, on the ground that it was not needed. "Dr. Duval," says a Winnipeg daily, in its report, "then engaged Mr. Ewart in a lively skirmish on the Sunday of the United States and Mexico, and stated that that day in those countries was so desecrated that decent people did not care to live there. Mr. Ewart answered that this was due to other influences which were not at work in Canada."

In the mind of this Canadian clergyman the horrors of the American Sunday evidently exceed those of the "Continental Sunday," as pictured by his brother clergyman in the United States.
