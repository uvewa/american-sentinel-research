At the hearing recently given at Winnipeg, Manitoba, on the bill for Sunday legislation brought forward by Manitoba ecclesiastics for passage by the legislature, the workingmen of the city, through their representative, declared their antagonism to the proposed measure. The following from a Winnipeg daily gives the substance of the speech made by the workingmen's delegate:—

"Mr. W. Scott said he was present on behalf of the Trades and Labor Council and the Labor Party in the city. When these men's rights are assailed they generally make a good outcry. These men whom he represented are not asking amendments to the bill, but asking that it be dropped altogether. Those he represented repudiated the assertion made at the second reading of the bill, when it was said that those who opposed it were asking for a continental Sunday. It had been said by the sponsor of the bill that this legislation was required to prevent the spread of secularism. What is secularism? Is it not a protest against certain creeds which clergymen themselves believe to be obsolete. By passing this act it would tend to the spread of secularism. The whole bill was class legislation. Why should a livery man be allowed to hire out a livery rig on Sunday, and the man who owned a few row boats on the river be prevented from hiring out his boats? He supposed it was because the livery rigs would be hired to drive people to church. In fact the whole bill was of the tendency to close every door but the church door. He then discussed the various games prohibited, saying that in this respect the bill was both arbitrary and invidious. He hoped the government would not forfeit the confidence of the people which they now enjoy, by passing such an act."

This is how the workingmen of Winnipeg feel on the subject of Sunday legislation. They do not want it. As their representative stated—and this is true of the workingmen everywhere—they are able to make a "good outcry" for what they do want; and this has never been made by them anywhere in behalf of compulsory Sunday observance. What sentiment has been expressed by them in favor of such legislation has been worked up by dint of much exertion on the part of religious zealots. The workingmen do not want more restriction; they want liberty.
