BY FANNIE BOLTON.

When on a dying bed our loved lay low
With faintly beating heart and brow of snow,
That heart that loved the world in all its woe
Filled with a tide of love's own overflow,
That brow whose circle spanned the thought of man,
Was all engrossed with love's redemption plan,
And rising on her couch of death, love's power
Sustained her for a long exhorting hour,
In which she urged the world's need be sufficed,
Its hunger stayed by Christ and only Christ.

Had she not known of science? Seen with awe
The working of God's unremitting law
In star and flower? Aye. Had she not
Compassed the economics with her thought?
Pleaded the arm of state should stern withhold
The weak from sorrow at the hands of bold?
Had she not planned to thwart heredity
That brought to man an evil destiny?
Been philanthropic to the utmost stint,
And fed and clothed the poor from liberal mint?
Preached measures of reform for field and city,
And whelmed all nations in our woman's pity?
Yet when the rustle of all plans were still,
She saw the cross alone on Calvary's hill,
And stood with one, the Man of love in tryst,
And said with her last breath, "Preach Christ, preach Christ."

Felt she the world's need less at last, that she
Should urge one plan alone with urgency?
Ah no. Her soul with love more strong than death
Held for the world the service of her breath,
To tell the standard bearers mid all loss
To raise aloft the banner of the cross,
And rally men beneath Emanuel's sway.
With eyes more clear to the great need to-day
With heaven's Holy Ghost to show love's plan
She bade with urgency to speak to man
Of that one Fulness that for all sufficed;
To preach to souls the power of God in Christ.

This was Paul's message, and he would naught know
Save Christ, Christ crucified mid men below.
"Not I, but Christ," he said, "and yet I live
The life of Christ through my dead self to give,"
As one raised out of time, and for such soul
There'll be a crown of life, a well-won goal.
This message that for souls like these sufficed,
Surely shall do for us. "Preach Christ, preach Christ."

We've laid her mid the lilies as 'tis meet.
She breathed the fragrance of the lily sweet.
We've planted roses o'er her grave. E'en so
She breathed the rose's perfume here below,
And in her dying hour saw only Him
Who dwells in love amid the cherubim,
The altogether lovely,—He who came
To save men by the power of His name.
In Him for life and death she was sufficed.
O let us heed, and preach to men but Christ.
