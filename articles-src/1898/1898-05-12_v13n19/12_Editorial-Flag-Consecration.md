The other day in Chicago the national flag was "consecrated" by a Catholic priest and afterwards hoisted to the spire of his church. The proceedings are thus described in the *Inter-Ocean:*—

"One thousand people were in and around the Church of the Nativity this afternoon when Rev. Father J. M. Cartan, a veteran of the Civil War, officiated in the ceremony of blessing the national emblem. Solemn services in the church prescribed by the ritual for the blessing of battle flags preceded the opening exercises. A chorus of forty voices sang Mozart's 'Gloria.'

"Seventy acolytes assisted at the ceremonial, and at its conclusion the flag was lifted from the altar by two boys attired in silver embroidered robes of white, and was kissed by each of the seventy boys in turn. It was then brought out by the priest, who said: 'We are met here under thrilling circumstances. We are about to raise the greatest emblem of justice and civilization on earth, next to the cross.'"

The national flag was "the greatest emblem of justice and liberty on earth, next to the cross," after it had received this Catholic blessing. After being thus Romanized, it was fit to be raised to the spire of the Catholic Church. If not so, what was this blessing for?

Of course, the "blessing" amounted to nothing; otherwise the flag would be fit for nothing as the emblem of a free government.
