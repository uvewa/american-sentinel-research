The first real battle of the war with Spain was fought in the harbor of Manila, May 1—Sunday.

It was a terrible desecration of Sunday,—worse than is ever caused by Sunday baseball or any other worldly amusement. It was Sunday fighting,—fighting in which men were being killed, and where devastation and death were being spread faster than is being done by the open Sunday saloon. It was Sunday desecration in its worst form.

Under such circumstances the only expectation at all in harmony with the repeated and positive assurances given by a certain class of clergymen touching Sunday desecration, is that the party by whom such glaring desecration of Sunday was inaugurated, would meet with crushing defeat. But lo, instead of this they met with the most brilliant success!

The American commander was not obliged to give battle to the Spanish fleet at Manila on Sunday. He might have delayed the attack for a day, mindful of the terrible incubus which—by the prediction of these clergymen—his disregard of Sunday would cast upon his prospects of success. But he did not wait. It was simply a case of daring defiance of all the principles and precepts upon which the Sunday National Reform theory is based.

More than this: if the accounts given be true, the feat which the Sunday-desecrating commander undertook was one of unusual hazard; for he had not only to engage the Spanish fleet in battle, but in doing so had to force his way into a strange harbor filled with mines and to sustain the fire from a humber of formidable fortifications. Yet, where a fatal slip would have been so easy, Providence gave him none. His success was signal and complete.

If his ships had run aground in the darkness of night under cover of which he entered the harbor; or if they had been blown up by the mines as was the "Maine" at Havana; or if they had been sunk or disabled by the fire of the enemy's guns, the country would have been pointed to it as a clear and terrible result of disregard of the "Sabbath." And being the opposite of the result which we are assured Sunday desecration must bring, it is clearly true that either Sunday is not the Sabbath at all, or that there is nothing in the theory by which temporal judgments are threatened to desecrators of the day; or both.

It is to point out how utterly valueless and unworthy of notice is this principle of National Reform doctrine, that we mention the coincidence of this naval battle and victory, with Sunday. The doctrine that Sunday desecration brings disaster upon the nation is just as weighty with truth—and only so—as were the curses pronounced by the Catholic priest upon the crops of one of his flock who had dared to break away from his control, with the result that the next season the farmer came to the priest with the request, "If ye plase, sir, would ye come agin and curse me crops?"
