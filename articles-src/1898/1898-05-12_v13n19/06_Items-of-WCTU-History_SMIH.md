BY MRS. S. M. I. HENRY.

He looked at me a moment as though my proposition was the raving of an insane woman, unworthy of even contempt; and then turned to close the interview, but I said:—

"No, you must listen to me. You called me in and threw down the challenge, so I must be heard. You men insist upon the necessity of this business, and you know, every man among you, that the saloon could not live on much longer if our pure, clean, sweet little boys should not learn some time to drink rum, and start into the awful procession of drunkards. You will have the saloon; you will not devise any plan to run it by machinery; you will have our boys; you catch them, or what is just the same, you license the saloon to do it. It lies in wait for them as they are growing up, and as soon as one gets a little taller than his mother, and that doesn't take long for he grows so fast, you catch him and throw him into your mill, and grind him up into devil's meat, and still you expect the mother to sit quietly at home and sing to the younger boys, and teach them the principles of truth and purity until they grow big enough for you, and then you catch them and grind them up, for the sake of revenue, and still demand that the mother must stay behind her closed doors and sing on, and pray on, and believe on, and be as gentle and saintly as though nothing had happened. No, sir; Satan has over reached himself; the mothers of this country are awake at last, and I assure you that they will never go back into the old quiet life as long as a saloon, and a law protecting it, exists in this nation."

He had become flushed with anger, as, I suppose I was myself; and as soon as he could find a chance to put in a word he exclaimed:

"Well, what are we to do? When we men, who are supposed to know something about public affairs, have done the very best we know how to do, if you women are not satisfied, what are you going to do about it, anyhow?"

This question came to me with the force of a stunning blow. What could we do? We had done everything that we knew how to do, and still the saloon was here. Might it not be possible that "the men" had tried just as hard as we had, and had as honestly failed? What was the trouble? We had prayed to God, and to every class of men who seemed to have any sort of relations to the saloon, or to the laws under which it existed; and the only results so far as yet appeared were of a nature to arouse the gravest anxieties. We were helpless indeed; and as for myself, I was at that moment more nearly hopeless and faithless than at any other time in my life. I thought of my children with a sense of despair that could not be expressed in words.

The man whose question had completely silenced me, stood a moment watching the effect of his words, and then with a sarcastic expression flavored with a sort of a patronizing pity for my evident distress, turned to his desk, and began, I suppose, to try to get hold of the work which had been interrupted; while I sat, turning his question and the situation over in my mind, and wondering if indeed God had hidden his face in anger, or if we had as yet failed to find his way out of this perplexing labyrinth of evils and of sorrows which are included in the intricate windings of the "Sum of all Villainies."

As I sat brooding over the question, suddenly a thought flashed into my mind, and then followed what I have always called my revelation. My heart gave a leap of joyful surprise, for I seemed to see the end within reach, by a way so simple and natural, so philosophical, so in harmony with every principal of righteousness, so far-reaching, that I was thrilled and enthused with a new courage.

I said to the man at the desk, "Come here, please, I have something to say to you;" and he arose and came toward me.

"I have an answer to your question," I said. "You want to know what we women will do about it. I will tell you, for I have just found out. The trouble is that, while there are a great many good men who look at this question of the saloon just as we women do, there are not enough of them; that is all. They are in the minority, and must be reinforced, and we women must do it. The majority of the members of the W.C.T. U. are mothers; of the rest the majority are teachers. We have the crude human material in the cradles, the schools, the Sunday and mission schools, and the slums are full of it waiting to be gathered up and utilized. We will go to work on this crude material—the boys of this nation. Some of them are pretty young yet, but that is a defect that time will remedy; give us a little time"—and I began to tell off the years rapidly in my mind. "Give us thirty-five years at the furthest, and, by a process of education, training and development, we will produce and present to this nation a majority on the right side of this question; men who will look at it as we do, and will some day snow the liquor traffic under with a pure man's clean ballot so deep that it will never know a resurrection. This thing will we do, God helping us."

O, the inspiration of that possibility—of what then appeared to be a certainty! I have many times tried to repeat these words in telling this story, just as I spoke them that day to my audience of one; but the fire that burned in them at that moment could never be reproduced. And how true it seemed! Surely nothing could be more logical. It evidently struck my audience as a foregone conclusion. He turned white as death, and for a moment had nothing to say; but rallying himself, with a light nervous laugh, he turned on his heel, saying,

"That will be a good idea; I would advise you to do it; it will keep you out of mischief."

"I will," I retorted, "I will go out and begin now."
