"WELL, Charlie, you may review our last talk briefly, and then we will go on," said Mrs. Ross.

"In our last talk we studied about the beast with two horns like a lamb, but who spake as a dragon; located the symbol as applying to the United States, which has practiced the two lamb-like principles of civil and religious liberty, and which now is on the way to contradicting her former policy by the enforcement of religious laws by which it will speak as a dragon, and prove itself the exponent of this prophecy."

"What is the next specification?"

"And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him."

"What was the first beast before him?"

"The papal power."

"How much power did the papal beast exercise?"

"Why, the power to compel conscience and to cause the death of those who stood for their God-given rights. But, mama, do you think the United States will ever go to such lengths as that?"

"Charlie, the enforcement of any law that conflicts with men's God-given rights has for its final penalty the death penalty. No man can surrender his God-given rights, without dishonoring God, and losing his soul, and the loyal one prefers death to that. He will contend for his God-given privileges."

"Do you mean that he will fight for them?"

"No, indeed. Jesus did not fight for his rights. He committed himself to Him who judge rightensously. 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.' I read lately of a young Christian Hungarian who was drafted into military service; but no amount of persuasion or threatening could induce him to surrender his right to keep the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill.' But he submitted meekly to five years of penal servitude. He suffered as a Christian, but did not surrender his rights."

"What was the two-horned beast to do?"

"He causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed."

"The first beast we have located definitely to be the papal system that finds its flower and fruit in a church-and-state union. Then, to cause the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the beast, would be to cause them to yield obedience to the church and state principle. Obedience is the highest form of worship. Samuel said to Saul, 'To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.' It says, 'he causeth the earth to worship.' We have already proved in former talks that Sunday as a day of worship has been given to the world through the command and influence of the papacy. When Sunday laws are enforced to such a degree that land is untilled, unsown, and unreaped because of this enforcement, the earth itself will be rendering obedience to the papal mandate."

"What is the next specification?"

"'And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.' There, mama, at last we have come to the point I asked you about when we studied about Elijah commanding the fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice."

"You may recall the story, Charlie. For what did Elijah call down fire from heaven?"

"To prove that Baal was not God, but that God was God, and to enable the confused people to choose to keep God's commandments."

"For what purpose does the two-horned beast call down fire from heaven? Will you read the next verse?"

"'And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do?' O mama, what a dreadful thing! Why, the people will surely think that such a sign as this is from God."

"Certainly they will; but it will be because they will not believe God's word. Do you think, Charlie, that when this is fulfilled that those who have read and believed this prophecy will be deceived?"

"No, mama, they will know for what purpose the fire is called down, and who is the agent that commands it."

"The time is coming, my boy, when we shall not be able to safely trust our senses. The Word of God must be the Rock on which our feet are planted. The hosts of evil are busy these days in leading men to close up their Bibles, to ignore history, and to seek into forbidden mysteries. Men are consulting clairvoyants, mediums and wizzards, holding communion with fallen spirits, and putting themselves at the mercy of demons. The devil and his agents work through the senses, and are only too willing to gratify the people's desire for some manifestation from the unseen by making them believe that they may hold communion with the departed dead. This puts men where the malignant spirits can control and deceive them. There is no need of any being deceived; for the Word of God is unimpeachable, and will be found to be so. But the carnal craving for something by which to gratify the senses leads them to welcome the spirits of devils, who are represented as going forth unto the kings of the whole world to gather them together for the battle of the great day of the Lord.

"The Word of God brings out the fact that as sharp a line of distinction is to be drawn in this day as was drawn in Elijah's day between the worshipers of God and the worshipers of the beast, Baal, or self. On one side of the controversy will stand those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and on the other side those who worship the beast and his image. But instead of a prophet of the Lord, there will stand an emissary of Satan who will seek to confirm the worshipers of the beast by the test of Elijah, and at the command of Satan's agent, fire will fall from heaven to establish souls in error, and to bring upon those who worship God and who keep his law the unrestricted enmity of the world.

"An unseen, malignant intelligence is ever on the alert to corrupt every civil government, and turn it into a cruel despotism. This world has been usurped by Satan, and there is a controversy going on that has waged through all ages. The point in dispute is the question of who shall possess the earth as a kingdom. The history of the past shows the struggle of two opposing forces, and the victory and defeat of the two forces may be traced in the power exercised by the church-and-state union, and the undoing of that power. The tidings of the battle between principalities and powers may be read in the daily papers. To day the hosts of evil are rallying for a final battle, and the malignant spirit wars with desperate earnestness for the mastery of the world. It is he who is behind the movement for the revival of the beast-like principles and policy in order that the machinery of the state may be manipulated by the church, to blot out all who would be loyal to Christ; for such will yet be counted as traitors to human interests.

"He has led men to believe that if religious observances can be compelled by law (but this would only turn men into hypocrites and knaves), that the millennium will soon be ushered in and the kingdom of Christ will be set up on earth. This malignant spirit allures souls along forbidden paths to chase the will of the wisp of a supposed golden age, in order to overwhelm them at last in the morass of destruction and death. Christ's kingdom is not of this world, and he who in the name of Christ would pose as its king, is an impostor and a usurper. Yet so deceived will men be that they will actually think that they do God service in persecuting those who will not bow down before the arch deceiver."

"O mama, what will keep us in such an hour of temptation?"

"Jesus says that he will keep us if we will keep the word of his patience."

"May God help us to do it."

"Amen."

F. B.
