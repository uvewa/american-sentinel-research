A shoemaker in Kansas City, Kan., says a dispatch to the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, of April 26, had a narrow escape from lynching on account of what was construed by his neighbors to be a lack of patriotism. When the announcement came that war had been declared with Spain, he closed his shop, hung crepe on the door, and posted this notice: "Closed in memory of a Christian nation that descends to the barbarity of war."

The result seems to have been not what he anticipated. "In ten minutes," says the dispatch, "a vast crowd had gathered, the door was burst in, and in another minute Collins would have been dangling at a rope's end from the near-by telegraph pole. But the police rushed in and rescued Collins, and hustled him off to the police station, followed by a howling, shouting mob. Collins will be compelled to leave town to avoid the vengeance of the patriots."

If this account is true, as it seems, it clearly shows that there is in this country a sentiment of false patriotism which is the most dangerous enemy of that liberty of thought and speech which all true patriotism upholds. Every individual has a right to protest against the barbarity of war and to point out the incongruity of war with the assumption that the nation going into it is Christian; and true patriotism does not deny the rights of the people.
