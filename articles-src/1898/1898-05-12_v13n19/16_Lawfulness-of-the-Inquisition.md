In the *Nineteenth Century*, for March, Mr. W. S. Lilly states some interesting facts concerning the nature and workings of that infamous institution, the Inquisition. It appears that the Inquisition was conducted strictly according to law, and its proceedings were based—in the minds of its defenders—upon the principles of sound reason. The author quotes as his chief authority on the subject the writings of a Dominican monk, Father Elisha Masini, published at Rome and Bologna in 1716, with authorization of the church. This writer's object was to magnify "the divine, the heavenly occupation" of the Inquisitor; and among those of this class he enumerates "Almighty God," David, Christ, St. John, John the Baptist, and St. Peter. We quote from a summarization of Mr. Lilly's article, by the *Literary Digest*, of April 30:—

"A trial before the Inquisition was instituted in one of two ways, by denunciation, when some one came before the tribunal as an accuser of another, and by inquisition by the tribunal into the truth of some rumor. The former was the more common way, and Father Masini's 'Sacred Arsenal' gives full information on the methods to be pursued, the questions to be asked, the nature of the tortures to be administered, the distinctions between different offenses, and the reasons for everything. It even gives a model trial of one Beltramo for blasphemy. The first step is the denunciation and the interrogatories addressed to the one making it. Then comes the summoning, one by one, of the witnesses to the blasphemy, and the questions in each case. Then Beltramo, ignorant of the charge against him, each witness having been sworn to secrecy, is summoned. If he denies the charge and makes a defense he is entitled to an advocate, but from the advocate as well as from Beltramo all the facts that might disclose the identity of the denunciator are concealed. We quote now from Mr. Lilly's translation from the 'Sacred Arsenal:'—

"If the accused denies the offenses laid to his charge, and they are not fully proved, and if within the time assigned him for making his defense he has not stated anything in his exculpation, or, having attempted a defense, has not in any way cleared himself from the charge which results against him from the process, it is necessary, in order to have the truth of it, to subject him to rigorous examination, the torture having been expressly devised to supplement the oral testimony of the witnesses when they can not bring complete proof against the accused. Nor is that at all inconsistent with ecclesiastical mildness and benignity. Even when the proof is legitimate, clear, and, as the phrase is, conclusive in suo genere, the inquisitor may, and ought, without in any way incurring blame, to employ it, in order that the accused, confessing their crimes, may be converted to God, and, by means of this chastisement, may save their souls. It would be an unbecoming and unjust thing, repugnant to all laws, human and divine, to subject any one to torments save in a lawful way, and upon evidence; and besides that, the confession so obtained would be invalid and of no account, even though the accused should persist in it, for we must never begin with torture but with evidence. And even if subsequently evidence should be forthcoming, such confession would not be validated. But since in a matter of so great importance errors may easily be committed, either to the notable prejudice of justice, if crimes remain unpunished, or to the most serious and irreparable loss of the accused, the inquisitor, in order to proceed cautiously, should put before the consultors of the holy office the case for the accusation and for the defense, and be guided by their learned and wise opinion—although they have only a consultative, not a decisive voice. Or, if the matter be grave, let him put it before the sacred and supreme tribunal of the holy and universal Roman Inquisition."

"The most common of the tortures applied in Italy was the strappado. The person tortured had his hands bound behind his back, then by means of a cord attached to the wrists he was elevated to the roof of the chamber and then let fall to within a short distance of the floor. The torture of fire was the exposure of the bare soles, anointed with lard, to fierce heat. The boot and thumb-screws were also employed. Any confession thus obtained had to be ratified afterward, without the torture; but refusal to ratify would subject the witness to renewed torture."

Such is a glimpse of the workings of the Romish Inquisition, which continued in force in Italy up to the time of the papal overthrow in 1870. It put no person to the torture "save in a lawful way;" and the fiends who presided over its operations, bearing in mind no doubt its scrupulous regard for the requirements of law and reason, appeared as men pursuing a most honorable and even saintly calling. "Saint" Peter Martyr, who as president of the Inquisition, "achieved fame as one of the most relentless exterminators of heresy the world has ever seen," was a man of "sweet benignity, of exhaustless compassion, of wonderful charity." But a devil is never so fully a devil as when he appears as an angel of light.

There is no tyranny so cruel, no yoke so intolerable, as priestcraft vested with temporal authority.—*Bishop Venner*.

If the gospel was of a nature to be propagated or maintained by the power of the world, God would not have entrusted it to fishermen.—*Luther*.
