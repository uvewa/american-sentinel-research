BY H. F. PHELPS.

FEBRUARY 29, 1892, will ever be memorable from the fact that it was upon that day that Justice Brewer of the Supreme Court of the United States sent forth his dictum, that "This is a Christian nation." Not only did he do this most un-American act, but he did lay hold of that sacred document, the Constitution of the United States, and declared that that instrument "voiced the same thing." It is scarcely necessary to say that in so doing he misinterpreted, and misconstrued, and perverted the Constitution from its original intent and purpose.

The next event in the scene was the establishment of a papal court at Washington, D. C., with Mgr. Satolli as its first delegate; and that for a wicked purpose,—a jesuitical act in the final subjection of this nation to papal control. Referring to the appointment of Satolli as papal ablegate in this nation, the Rev. Joseph Cook says: "But Satolli is in America to make the most of press, pulpit, platform, and the secret power of the confessional to advance Romish pretentions smoothly. . . . His taking up his residence among us as first incumbent of the office of a permanent apostolic delegate, is an omen of mischief to American institutions." For had not the Supreme Court of the United States, in that dictum of Justice Brewer, declared for a legalized Christianity, the very image and likeness of papalism? And would not Rome lay claim to that which was her own?

Then quickly followed the third act in the drama, that of Bishop O'Gormon, at the World's Catholic Congress, taking out of the mouth of Justice Brewer, the very line of argument which he used to prove that "this is a Christian nation," as proof that this is a Catholic Christian nation. In the meantime, as a sort of an accompaniment of this third act in the drama, the nation in the person of its citizens and officials engaged in extending congratulations and welcomes to this emissary of disruption of our institutions; which thing was again repeated at the coming of the second ablegate, Mgr. Martinelli. Satolli, in turn, shouted to his countrymen, for he saw that the way was clear, "Go forward! In the one hand bearing the emblem of truth—the Bible (the Catholic Bible, of course), and in the other the Constitution" (of the United States as interpreted by the Supreme Court, of course). From that time to this, Rome has put on a bolder front than before, declaring that she was preaching "bold doctrines to Americans;" and doing all in her power to make this a Catholic Christian nation.

And now comes the fourth act in this greatest of all tragedies—for it is and will be nothing short of a tragedy from this time forward to the end. This fourth act is in connection with the Hispano-American controversy. There is no room for doubt but that Pope Leo would most gladly have accepted a call from this Government to act as arbitrator of this trouble with Spain, according to the traditional policy that the popes should be at the head of all civil governments,—the father of nations, if not in one capacity then in another. But no one would like to believe that this Government would be guilty of so great a blunder as to ask the pope to intermeddle himself in the affairs of this nation. But, blunder or no blunder; guilty or not guilty; with or without official request, it now transpires that Pope Leo and Archbishop Ireland are, to say the least, the semi official arbitrators between the government of the United States and Spain. It will be well if the people of this country would open their eyes and see things as they really are. It seems that the queen regent begged the pope to use his good offices to bring about peace; all naturally enough. Then why did not the pope ask the Spanish government to stop their butchery in the island of Cuba? Did he do this? No. He turned his eyes toward the United States, and desired some one to represent his "holiness" in Washington. Martinelli was first selected, but he refused on the grounds that he could not possibly have any standing at the White House. "It was then determined," says a St. Paul daily, "that the close and cordial friendship which existed between Archbishop Ireland, President McKinley and his whole cabinet, joined to the fact that he is an American citizen, made him a fit instrument through which negotiations could be conducted. In view of this he received a formal letter from Cardinal Rampolla, papal secretary of state, authorizing him to represent the pope. This was presented to Judge Day and semi-official relations begun. Since that time Archbishop Ireland has been in communication with Europe. Through him the official texts of concessions which Spain was willing to make for the sake of peace have been laid before this Government and before the European ambassadors. The composite news of the situation has been cabled to him and by him disseminated."

The iniquity of this movement will be more apparent when we remember that Spain has an officially-recognized representative in this Government, through whom the pope could have officiated. But this would have been to acknowledge the authority of civil governments as being above that of the pope.

It is claimed that the mission of Mr. Ireland is "to find and to make practicable some plan of honorable peace." Of course, this is a good mission, if only he would give his time and efforts to it as a citizen, as an individual; but when he does it as a representative of the Vatican, there is mischief in it. Rome has always been an enemy to the principles that underlie a republic; and although she now makes professions of friendship with such governments, it is only because she can the more easily carry out her ruinous schemes. Rome is here to stay; and, as a recent writer has said, "All over this fair land Rome is piling up her massive structures, in the secret recesses of which will be repeated the persecutions of former days."

I am aware that this is a strong arraignment of Rome; but some so-called Protestants are doing far more than she can possibly do, to turn this Government over into her hands. Let them awake to the study of the first principles that gave the name "Protestant" to the world. If only they would do this, they would not do that which they are now doing.
