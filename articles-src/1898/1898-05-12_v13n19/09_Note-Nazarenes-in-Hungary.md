The sect of the Nazarenes in Hungary is increasing so rapidly that its growth threatens the Austro-Hungarian government with an additional burning question. These people, whose tenets with regard to military service and swearing allegiance closely resemble those of the English Friends and the Russian Mennonites, refuse to perform the military duties imposed on them.—Literary Digest.
