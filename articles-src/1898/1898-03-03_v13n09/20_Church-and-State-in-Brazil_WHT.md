The constitution of Brazil guarantees perfect liberty to all religious denominations, and declares, "A free church and a free state, without which there could be no self government."

This is all that any one could ask, providing it meant what it says; but when we come to the practical workings of religious liberty we find liberty to be somewhat wanting. As long as not much is said against the established religion and customs of the country all goes very well, but when the Word of truth is proclaimed, setting forth the gospel as the power of God unto salvation and that the church is subject to Christ, and that he is the head of the church, we are sometimes called in question.

The following facts will serve to show some of the religious freedom enjoyed by Protestants in Brazil.

Not long ago a Protestant colporter was selling Bibles and religious books in the State of Espírito Santo and one evening he was seized, dragged into a store, and there tantalized until midnight by an impudent crowd of men, and all of his books and Bibles were taken from him and burned in the street.

In the State of Rio de Janeiro, a Protestant minister was holding meetings in a village, about twenty five miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro, and one evening during service the building in which the meetings were being held was surrounded by a furious mob of Roman Catholics and the windows were broken in, the minister thrashed, others beaten with sticks, some cut with knives and as soon as possible they fled to the woods for their lives.

The minister appealed to the proper authorities for redress, but he could not get a hearing. The authorities told him that he had better not go there any more and then there would be no more trouble.

A month or so later I visited the same village and while there I had an interview with a prominent Roman Catholic of the place relative to the recent trouble, and he said he did not approve of mob violence, and then he went on to explain that the mob was composed of the lower class of Catholics. I asked him why he did not protest if he did not approve of the disturbance. "Well," said he, "I haven't anything against Protestants enjoying their own religion, but I don't think they should be teaching it in Catholic communities."

I then told him that, according to his idea, the commission, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel," should read, "Go ye into all the world, except where there are Catholics, and preach the gospel." He smiled, and after a short conversation on the topics of the day, I thanked him for the privilege of so pleasant an interview and departed.

About six months ago, in the State of Santa Catharina, a Protestant minister, accompanied by two colporters, held a series of meetings and as a result about forty Germans embraced the new faith and many of them were baptized and a Protestant church was organized.

Many in the place who rejected the influence of the gospel and its power to save, became displeased with the new doctrine (the gospel pure and simple), and one man had his two daughters, young ladies, arrested and put in jail for being baptized and keeping the Sabbath (seventh day) as it was contrary to the religion and the customs of the country, and against his personal wishes. Several others were put in jail for the same offense(?) and they were held there a week, but their testimony was the same when they were released as when they went in, "We cannot help but believe the things which we have seen and heard." When the minister and the colporters were leaving the place, they were overtaken by a furious mob, armed with guns and clubs, and after a few minutes' babel, a man struck one of the colporters on the head with a club and then the mob dispersed.

The colporter was carried away for dead, but he finally rallied and it was three days before he regained consciousness. Before he was able to walk the officers of the place came and demanded his presence at the court. He told them that he was too ill to go, and they dragged him out of bed, but on finding that he could not walk they left him with orders to appear as soon as able. A few weeks later he appeared before the court to answer for, he did not know what. He had done nothing but what he had a perfect right to do. He was called in question for filling the place with his doctrine. He was not the minister, he was only assisting in the meetings and had been nearly killed for it, but that was no matter; he was one of the company; so with Bible in hand he answered the questions and was finally released with the charge not to speak at all nor teach any more in that place.

The question may arise as to what was done with the man who gave, what he hoped would be, the fatal blow. Nothing at all was done with him. The colporter went on his way rejoicing that he had been counted worthy to suffer for the name of Christ, and praying for his persecutors that they might learn better and do better.

These are some of the practical workings of religious liberty(?) in Brazil, but if the people knew better no doubt they would do better.

Before closing I wish to say that the foregoing has not been written with any feelings against Brazil and her people, but simply to set forth the facts as they exist. There are many good people in Brazil and all they lack is the great principles of truth which are able to perfect them in righteousness. The gospel is spreading over the land and some are yielding to its saving power.

The motto on the Brazilian flag is, "Ordem e Progresso" (Order and Progress), but it is a progress in evil without much order. Just to the extent that the people receive the gospel, just to that extent is the reformation taking place and no further.

With sword and bayonet the government has been trying for years to make the people better, and every charge makes them worse, but where the gospel is received into the hearts of the people there they have no use for the sword. How different the effects of compulsion and persuasion! One is a savour of death unto death, and the other a savour of life unto life. W. H. Thurston.
