A SUNDAY law for the District of Columbia is an entering wedge which is designed to sever all connection of the Government with the principle enunciated in those words of the Constitution: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Let the friends of liberty look out for the entering wedges.
