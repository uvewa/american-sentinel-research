In a recent Encyclical to the bishops of Manitoba, the head of the Roman Catholic Church speaks as follows on the subject of the "rights" of pupils in the public schools:—

"The matter is indeed one of very great and very weighty moment. We wish to bring to mind what seven years ago the legislators of the province of Manitoba decreed in session; who indeed took away a right which the laws of the Canadian Confederacy had established, namely, that Catholic children had a right to be taught and educated in the public schools in accordance with their conscientious beliefs."

Catholic children have a "right" to be taught the papal religion at public expense, and no other religious belief has any right to be taught at all. The Encyclical says on this point:—

"Wherefore it is as foolish to wish to imbue minds with right moral principles while they are allowed to be deprived of religion as to call them to recognize virtue when the fountain of virtue has been removed. Now, to a Catholic the Catholic religion is one and the only one; wherefore he can neither accept nor recognize any moral or religious teaching unless it is sought for and derived from intrinsic Catholic sources. Therefore justice and reason demand that the school supplies to every scholar not only a knowledge of literary character, but also, as we have said, that knowledge of morality joined with precepts taken from our religion without which assuredly all education will be not only unfruitful but injurious. From which these consequences naturally follow; the teachers must be Catholics, and the books from which the scholars are taught must be such as the bishops approve. There must be unfettered power of arranging and ruling the discipline, so that the whole system of teaching and of learning shall exactly agree and coincide with the belief of the Catholic faith and the duties which thence arise."

Catholic children have a "right" to be educated in Catholic doctrine at public expense.

All education which does not embody a "knowledge of morality joined with precepts taken from our [the Catholic] religion" is "not only unfruitful but injurious."

The state evidently has no right to give anyone an "unfruitful and injurious" education.

Hence the state ought to teach every pupil in the public schools, Protestant and Catholic, the Roman Catholic religion, and has no right to teach them anything less or contrary to it.

This is Roman Catholic doctrine on the subject of the duty of the state in relation to the public schools, as enunciated by the highest Catholic authority, and published in the Catholic Mirror.

Please bear it in mind.
