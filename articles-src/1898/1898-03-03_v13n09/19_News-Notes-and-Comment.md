The topic of all absorbing interest for some time past has been that of war with Spain. There are a great many people in this country who think we ought to have war with Spain over the blowing up of the "Maine;" this is evident from all reports that come to us, making the most liberal allowance for journalistic "inaccuracies." And not a few of these belligerently-minded people occupy the position of ministers of the gospel of Christ.

OF course, if "this is a Christian nation," there will be no war; for even should it be proved that an act of treachery caused the disaster to the "Maine," the nation would forgive the offense, which would probably be all that Spain would require. It cannot be denied that Christianity requires the forgiving of offenses, however wanton and injurious these may be, and forbids taking revenge upon an adversary. "Dearly beloved," it says, "avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."

But it is needless to say that no such considerations will govern in the case; for this is not a Christian nation, and depends not upon God to fight its battles, but upon its army and navy. No Christian nation ever found it necessary to maintain an army and navy. No Christian ever found it necessary to preserve his standing and maintain his interests among his neighbors by carrying about with him a loaded revolver.

WE have heard of "Christians" who were willing to prove their Christianity by fighting any person who might call it in question. This may be rather an extreme case; still it is quite in accord with the dictates of the natural heart, and quite as convincing an argument as would be furnished by carrying out the warlike suggestions of some of the preachers. The tendency of the times is toward making a person's willingness to fight a test of his Christianity. If he does not believe in fighting he is set down as not patriotic; and the worst denunciations he will receive will come from the pulpit and the religious press.

"WELL, then, should not an individual do any fighting in this world at all?" This is a natural question, and can be very easily answered. The purpose of God in the gospel does not contemplate that we shall do no fighting in this world; on the contrary it provides that every person who will conform his life to it shall have all the fighting he can possibly want. It simply substitutes another object of attack for that which the individual, left to himself, would naturally choose. In place of "the other fellow," it points him to self as his worst enemy, and directs him to exert all his energies to conquer that. It declares—and very truthfully—that "greater is he that ruleth his own spirit, than he that taketh a city."

THERE is nothing figurative about this; it is intensely real. The only person who could doubt its reality would be he who never tried to live the Christian life. The fight with self is a battle royal. The gospel provides a harder battle for the believer than any that he would ever engage in without it; but at the same time it gives him a perfect assurance of victory. So the individual who likes to be belligerent need not pass the gospel by for fear that he will not have ample scope under it for the exercise of his combativeness. He need not fear that it will make of him a weak, supine creature because it requires meekness and forbearance toward all men. On the contrary it will develop in him the strongest possible character. Moses was reputed as being the meekest man on the face of the earth; but he was at the same time the strongest and most fearless character of his time. The man who is master of self has attained to the pinnacle of human greatness, whether he be recognized as great by the world or not.

God is not fighting men; on the contrary he is working to save them, without distinction of class or nation. Must it be thought strange, then, that he does not want men to be fighting and killing each other? God is fighting the evil that has established itself in the human heart; he is fighting the selfishness which is man's mortal enemy. And if men had the will and the courage to cooperate with God in fighting self in themselves, there would be no occasion for all the fighting that they are so ready to do with one another.

SELF is always ready to fight—some one else. There are individuals who go about the country making a business of fighting. Was ever one of them known to be willing to fight self? They glory in the thought of being able to master other people; but not one of them is master of himself. They are conspicuously subject to their own passions. They are slaves to their worst enemy. No other possible foe can bring upon them so much evil; no other can bring them to such a fearful destiny. It is the settled purpose of self to plunge the soul into ruin for all eternity; for this it is working every hour and every moment. Why then cannot men see that their first business as fighters is to fight self; that they are to be masters of themselves first of all? He who is not master of himself is not fit to be master of anything else; and as long as men are not masters of themselves there will be no end to their efforts to be masters of each other.

However, we believe it safe to say that there will be no war with Spain over the loss of the "Maine." The issues which determine peace or war in these days are different from those which settled the question centuries ago. This is the age of commercialism. Commercial interests dictate the policy of nations. The "great powers" will unhesitatingly make war upon any weak tribe which refuses their trade. England forced the opium trade upon China; and only recently China was forced to accept a loan which she did not want from England and Germany. When there are weighty financial reasons for war, war is very apt to follow; but war in this day, when it costs thousands of dollars to fire a big gun even once, and when millions of dollars are put into a single warship which may be sent to the bottom of the sea by a single blow, is a very costly undertaking; so that usually financial considerations weigh heavily in the opposite direction. Spain is reported to be bankrupt; and however well a nation may be supplied with patriotism, it cannot go to war if it is not supplied with gold.

By the way, can any one tell why it is that government officials are so chary about giving any news relating to important matters out to the public? These officials are always pledged to the strictest secrecy regarding all information in possession of the Government of such a nature as would naturally exert a powerful influence upon national action, as for example the discoveries relating to the disaster to the "Maine." Why are the people left for days and perhaps weeks to feed upon newspaper lies? We had always thought that in this country the people themselves were the real government, and that those in office, from the President down, were the servants of the people; and we never knew it was the proper business of a servant to conceal from his master important information concerning the latter's business. Where do these officials get their authority for such a course? Not from the people, certainly. Do they really consider themselves the servants of the people? or do they regard themselves as their rulers? Cannot the American people be trusted? If they cannot, then the sooner the pretense of self government is abandoned, the better. But we believe in a government by and for the people.

It seems that a movement is on foot which has in view the appointment of the pope to arbitrate the difficulty between the United States and Spain. The pope, it is said, is the only arbitrator Spain would accept, and doubtless Leo himself would not decline an invitation to act in that capacity.
