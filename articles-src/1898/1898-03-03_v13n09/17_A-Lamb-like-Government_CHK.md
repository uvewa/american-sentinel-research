Additional evidence that this nation is the one symbolized by the "beast" of Rev. 13:11, is furnished in the description that the prophet gives of the beast. It has two horns like a lamb.

Whenever, in the Bible, a lamb is used as a symbol, it is always to represent Christ. See Rev. 5:6, 8, 12. And more than once we hear John the Baptist speaking of Christ as "the Lamb of God."

Therefore the conclusion is inevitable that the two-horned beast, which is lamb-like, symbolizes a government, which, in its national capacity, is like Christ. In other words, such a nation would be established upon principles which are in harmony with the utterances of Christ concerning governments.

That being so, we may rest assured, beyond the shadow of a doubt, of the correctness of the application of the symbol; for in all history, from the days of Christ, there has absolutely never been a government founded upon principles taught by Jesus Christ excepting that of the United States of America.

Jesus Christ taught there are duties devolving upon every member of the human family that are of such a nature that it is impossible for any earthly tribunal to successfully take cognizance of them; duties which in the very nature of things can be discharged only when the heart is regenerated, washed in the blood of the Lamb.

The first duty incumbent upon all mankind, and in the same degree to all, no more, no less, is: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." And another duty that grows out of this is: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."

But where is the nation that can enforce this duty? The only power that any government can use in enforcing its requirements is force: force, too, that is represented by policemen's clubs. But all the clubs of the whole police force of the United States cannot instil one particle of love for God, or anybody else, into the human heart. They can reach no further than a man's skull, and at their very best only club his brains out, and put him where he cannot possibly love either God or man. But one reason why it is the first duty of man to love God with all his heart is that without this element being there it is absolutely impossible for him to comply with a single requirement of the Almighty, for "on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." "Love is the fulfilling of"—not a substitute for—"the law."

Again, the Bible teaches the absolute equality of all men. For instance: "There is no respect of persons with God." Rom. 2:11. And in Acts 17:26 we are told that God 'hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth.'" Again: "Every one of us shall give account of himself to God." Rom. 4:12.

In order that this can be done properly—whether the account is good or bad, man has been endowed with liberty—liberty to serve or not to serve God, as man himself pleases; or if he chooses to serve God, to do it in a way that shall be pleasing, or not pleasing, to God.

This is his natural right; God has so endowed him. Without it true service could not be rendered to God. This liberty is usually spoken of as "liberty of conscience." This is shown in the language of Christ: "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not." John 12:17.

Now any government which should in practice recognize these principles with reference to earthly governments would indeed in this respect be Christlike or lamblike.

But as before stated, the United States, of all nations, is positively the only one that has so recognized them. The following expresses the position of this government: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."—Declaration of Independence. And also: "Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."—The Constitution.

"The intent of the lawgiver is the law," is a legal axiom. Just what was intended by the above may easily be learned, and therefore what the law really is.

Washington says, "Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen, is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience."

Jefferson took a prominent part in bringing before the General Assembly of Virginia a bill which was carried, entitled "An Act for Establishing Religious Freedom." A few brief extracts will show what Jefferson's convictions were on religious liberty. "Well aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet choose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do . . . that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, more than our opinions in physics or geometry . . . that it tends also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honor and emoluments, those who will externally profess and conform to it . . . that to suffer the civil magistrates to intrude his power into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles, on the supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty. . . . Be it, etc."

And in a letter to Rev. Mr. Miller, Jan. 3, 1808, he says: "I consider the government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, disciplines, or exercises."

These expressions, and many others, are summed up in what Bancroft, the historian, says: "Vindicating the right of individuality even in religion, and in religion above all, the new nation dared to set the example of accepting in its relations to God the principles first divinely ordained in Judea. It left the management of temporal things to the temporal power; but the American Constitution, in harmony with the people of the several states, withheld from the Federal Government the power to invade the home of reason, the citadel of conscience, the sanctuary of the soul; and not from indifference, but that the infinite spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom and purity and power."

Thus the United States adopted the principle of government that Jesus Christ taught; thus it became lamblike, and being the only nation that ever did it, it is proven beyond a doubt that the United States is the Government symbolized by the two-horned beast.
