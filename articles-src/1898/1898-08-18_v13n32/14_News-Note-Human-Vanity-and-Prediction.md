The Scripture says that man at his best estate is altogether vanity, and man himself is continually demonstrating the truth of the statement. One way in which he does this is by presuming to exercise powers which are altogether beyond his capacity to possess. For instance, men are continually claiming the ability to apprehend, to a greater or less degree, events which are yet behind the veil of the future. There is the weather prophet, who predicts what the weather will be for a month or more in advance. There are also the astrologers, and fortune tellers, who claim the ability to foretell the chief events of an individual's life, and who are credited by most people with having some degree of power in this direction. And aside from all these, the vast majority of people have more or less confidence in their own ability to predict what is going to happen, when they have some slight basis of known facts from which to shape their conclusions. They are always ready when opportunity offers to speak the self-justifying words, "I told you so."

The events of the war with Spain, which are fresh in the minds of all, afford an illustration upon this point. Before the war began, but when it had become a visible prospect, a certain writer drew considerable attention to himself by writing a history of "our late war with Spain." Few people believed at that time that war would come, but with the possibility of it in mind, the probable result of a clash between two powers provided with modern implements of war was a question of general interest. The writer set forth such events as, to his mind, were to be expected in the conflict. From what was known of the resources of the two nations, and of the nature of the weapons that would be brought into use, he thought to make a fairly accurate prediction of what would happen when these two nations pitted their armies and navies against each other. And his descriptions were received by the public with almost the interest that would be given to credible prophecy.

But his predictions could hardly have fallen more wide of the truth. The great battle between the Spanish and American fleets, as he portrayed it, was a doubtful contest, in which the opposing ships were obscured by clouds of smoke, under cover of which one of the fast auxiliary cruisers sailed close to one of the Spanish battleships and silenced it completely by a single broadside from more than a hundred small quick-firing guns; and at the close of the combat not one of the victorious American ships was in condition to continue the fight. As a matter of fact, when the opposing fleets came together off Santiago, the auxiliary cruisers played no part at all in the contest, the result was never doubtful, and the American fleet was not at all disabled by the fire of the enemy. So far from proving, as predicted by a number of assumed authorities, only an even match for the Spanish navy, the American fleets have sent the Spanish fleets to the bottom of the sea without suffering the loss or serious injury of a single ship.

It is a strange thing, but yet true, that men have always been inclined to pay more attention to the predictions of their finite fellow-mortals than to those of the Word of God. And though the predictions of inspiration have never yet failed, while those from a human source have scarcely been anything but failures, people are to-day as ready as ever to allow their minds to be diverted from the truth by things that are false and of no value. It is the purpose of the author of what is false and counterfeit, to obscure what is genuine and true; and the world to-day is flooded with counterfeits of the things provided by the grace of Omnipotence for man's salvation. But "nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure," having this infallible test: "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."
