### "Ye Shall Be as Gods."

"MAMA, Satan not only told Eve that she should not surely die, but that 'ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.' Of course, if we were to be as gods, we would not die."

"No. In heaven Lucifer would not acknowledge that God was more than he himself was; he flattered himself that he himself was divine power, and that all he needed was opportunity to develop it, and be as the Most High. In telling man he should be as God, he breathed into him the ambition that had caused his own expulsion from heaven. Ever since then man has thought there was something divine in him independent of God, and that something divine could therefore be originated by him. This idea led him to become a worshiper of himself, to make his own religion, and give to the machinery of civil power, the authority to enforce the theories of the majority, or the stronger, on the weaker. As God is love, and can only be worshiped through the faith that works by love, of course the man-made worship, thrust on souls by force, could only be against God, and disastrous to men. How disastrous, we shall never know till the books are opened."

"Mama, the boys who think lots of themselves, who have what we call the 'big head,' always want the other fellows to do just as they say."

"That's it, Charlie, self-exaltation leads to the stamping out of individuality, and to monopoly. Even on the play ground, the principle finds illustration. Your selfish boy generally wants and gets supremacy. The outcome of it in the world is a one-man power—the papacy. In the universe it would be the overthrow of God's throne, and the supremacy of Satan."

"What makes the boys on the play ground give up to the selfish boy?"

"Some of them are afraid of getting into trouble, if they don't. If you are not as strong as he is, you'd better skip out, or come to terms."

"Then it's a government of fear. That's what it was in the dark ages, and men lost their manhood. They had to sneak and quail and cringe. In order to keep in favor with the strong, they had to spy and report and hunt and torture those who were out of sympathy with the principle. Men who in heart hated the management, through fear, pretended to be in favor of it. No one dared to speak a new thought or manifest any unusual ability; for a government founded in fear is sustained and enforced through jealousy. So the ages became black, and even God's word was said to 'prophecy in sackcloth,' because its advocates were in danger of losing their lives, if suspected; superstition ran rife, and the good, the simple-hearted, the talented, were looked upon with suspicion, and many of them were burned as witches. This is the degradation to which man comes who believes he is as God, and seeks for God-like supremacy in enforcing his ideas and plans on others."

"But away down deep in his heart, mama, can any man believe he is divine?"

"No, Charlie, not unless he is wholly given up to the devil. Many of these very men who became so lifted up, submitted to, or originated, the cruelest sort of punishment for sin in themselves and others. They sought to make atonement for themselves. Refusing to be justified by faith in the Redeemer of the world, they tried to justify themselves. But the wearing of hair shirts, walking on peas doing penance, lacerating the flesh with iron points, walking up Pilate's stairs on their knees, fasting, praying, all seemed to fall short of the penalty deserved. However, this fostered spiritual pride. People looked with wonder and admiration on those who endured most suffering from themselves, and gave them the title of saint. Then it angered them to hear that all this suffering was vain, and aroused their enmity against those who trusted in the merits of Jesus, and rested in the love of God, who were justified by faith. They were determined to make the followers of Christ suffer as they had suffered themselves. Their self-inflicted sufferings made them cruel."

"But, mama, were they satisfied?"

"O, no, Charlie; self-justification never satisfies. The Catholics all expect to spend some time in purgatory.

The pagans had this doctrine long ago. You will read it in Virgil's Eneas. All nations have the thought of punishment after death."

"Well, mama, so have Chris tians. We believe that the wicked will be punished."

"What is the punishment, Charlie?"

"'The wages of sin is death,'" said Charlie. "But mama, what is death?"

"Look it up in the dictionary."

"Cessation of life," read Charlie. "Yes, but I can't understand. The Bible says, 'These shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life eternal.'"

"Well, that only tells how long the punishment is to last. The death is everlasting. There will be no end to it."

"But mama, it says 'the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night.'"

"Yes, I know, Charlie. But the words 'forever and ever' are used in a limited sense. Dr. Adam Clark, the commentator, says you cannot make that expression mean unending torture. The same word is used in Exodus 6th chapter, where a man has his ear bored through with an awl to signify that he is a slave, and it says, speaking of his master, 'He shall serve him forever.' This means simply as long as he lives. Now other passages teach plainly that the wicked are to become extinct. 'The day that cometh shall burn them up . . . and it shall leave them neither root nor branch. And ye shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet.'"

"Then mama, what does the Bible mean by hell?"

"In some places it means the grave; in some places the place of the punishment of the wicked. But the Psalmist says that the righteous are to be 'rewarded in the earth, much more the wicked and the sinner.' With 'thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.' When the thousand years are finished, the wicked will be raised from their graves to acknowledge that God is love, and to die the second death."

"But mama, why does God have them resurrected at all?"

"It is necessary to the plan of the full vindication of his character, and to the stability of his eternal government. Every tongue is to confess that Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father."

"Lucifer would not acknowledge Christ as Lord; but claimed that he was himself superior to Christ. He led his angels and the hosts of the wicked to affirm this falsehood. The vindication of truth demands that the instigator and the repeaters of this falsehood make a public confession of its fallacy and an acknowledgment of the truth. This the truth itself will compel them to do, not through force, but through the compelling conviction of the intrinsic worth of truth. In that day the utter weakness of forcing men to acknowledge truth or error, will be made apparent. As Satan and his hosts surround the beloved city, and the glory of love is made manifest, the great confederacy of fallen angels and wicked men, will crumble into dust and ashes. The blaze of God's glory will be a consuming fire to all evil. He who said, 'Ye shall be as gods,' will be brought 'to ashes on the earth' in the sight of saints and angels. Death and hell are to be cast into the lake of fire. Out of the last conflagration will come the renewed earth, the home of the redeemed."

"But, mama, we will be like God after all, at last."

"Yes, indeed, 'We shall be like him.' Not merely in external form, but in spirit and in truth. We shall be in the image of his glory, which is love."

F. B.
