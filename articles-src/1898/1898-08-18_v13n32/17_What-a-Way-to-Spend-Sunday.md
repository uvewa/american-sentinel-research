## "What a Way to Spend Sunday!"

***

THE REASON why the Spanish Admiral Cervera was defeated off Santiago in the engagement with the American fleet, according to *The Observer* (New York), is given in the following quotation from that journal:

"The fact that Admiral Cervera deliberately selected the hour when the crews of the American ships were at religious service for his dash out of Santiago harbor on that now historic Sabbath morning may in the providence of God have had more to do with his overthrow than most people have yet imagined. The morning was calm and peaceful, bringing its tender reminiscent reflections to hundreds of worshipful American hearts on the fleet at anchor off shore, when suddenly, as though to disturb the Almighty at his own devotions, the impious Spaniards, fired while also fuddled with wine, rushed forth, as it proved, horribly to die or finally to be captured. What a way to spend Sunday! And when the sun set that Sabbath its last reproachful beams slanted across the smoking hulks of the fleet of the proud Spaniard who deliberately broke up religious meetings in the hope of gaining a strategic success. But the stars in their courses fought against Cervera. God is not mocked, nor can his commandments and sacred sanctions ever be impugned with safety."

According to this evangelical authority, then, it is all right to fight on Sunday, provided you do not strike the first blow. You may even compel the fighting, by forcing your adversary into a corner, and still be guiltless. Nor is it necessary that your Sunday fighting be in self-defense; it may be only to prevent your enemy from escaping, and still be right. God will excuse you from religious devotions any time if it is for the purpose of fighting, only you must not fire the first shot. Is this an exalted, or a low, conception of Christian principles?

Let us alter the statement a little. The "impious Spaniards" rushed forth to disturb the sanctity of the day of rest, and the American sailors at once rushed to their guns, prepared to make the disturbance as complete as possible, and then occupied themselves with all their energies in destroying the property and lives of their enemies, killing and maiming hundreds of their fellow-beings made in the image of the One whom they were assembled to worship. "What a way to spend Sunday!" Was it really a better way than that chosen by the Spaniards?
