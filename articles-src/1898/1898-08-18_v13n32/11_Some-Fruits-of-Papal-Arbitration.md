## Some Fruits of Papal Arbitration.

*New York "Christian Advocate."*

The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions comes forward to say that it does not meddle in public matters, and that at the present time it takes no part in discussions relating to territorial acquisitions by the United States in any part of the world. It proceeds, however, to state that for thirty-five years it prosecuted mission work in the Caroline Islands without the missionaries' seeing the slightest sign of any government except that of native chieftains. They were doing well, when in 1887 the Spaniards sent an armed force to Ponape, from Manila, with a governor to claim sovereignty, under the decision of the pope, as arbitrator, which confirmed Spain's claim to the Carolines. The Spanish governor brought fifty soldiers, twenty-five convicts, and six Roman Catholic priests. The board says that its missionaries were driven off, and the churches of the natives in most instances demolished; that the Bible had not been permitted to be landed, nor the missionary vessel, the "Morning Star," to stop there; and says that in view of the forcible intervention of Spain and the putting a stop to the work of these missionaries "the board deems it right to ask that whenever the status of these islands is determined, ample guarantee shall be required of whatever power shall hold sovereignty, that perfect religious toleration shall be enjoyed by the islanders. As to what nation shall hold that sovereignty we have nothing whatever to say." Many things besides this go to show that in this conflict the pope can never impartially fill the position of arbitrator between Spain and the United States.
