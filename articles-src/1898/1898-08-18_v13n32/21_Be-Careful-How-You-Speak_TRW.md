### Be Careful How You Speak.

BY T. R. WILLIAMSON.

CHILDREN and fools, they say, will tell the truth,
Heedless of what befalls of wrong or ruth.
And many folks there be in every street
Ready to talk small truth to all they meet.
Live and let live are words that rule the wise.
Endeavor so that truth, or e'en surmise,
Shall neither seem to flow from off your tongue
Mingled with spite 'gainst any, old or young.
I say that even truth had better be
Left tongueless oft than told in gossip free.
Tell what is simply, what is fairly, true.
Owe all men friendliness and pay it too.
Ne'er think it wise to utter all you know.
When folks do that they soon to lying go.
A fool's tongue, and a child's, are unrestrained.
If we of older growth have no more gained
Than to take them for models, surely then,
Earth needs a nobler, manlier, race of men.
