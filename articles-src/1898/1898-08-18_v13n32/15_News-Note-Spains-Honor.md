The war with Spain having practically ended, it may be presumed that Spain's "honor" is satisfied; for this "honor" was the one thing that Spain most strenuously insisted on preserving. But what real honor has Spain preserved? From whom does Spain now receive honor as the outcome of her conduct of the war? Evidently her fancied preservation of honor is but a gigantic hallucination. Only feelings of pity and contempt have been awakened throughout the civilized world by the display of weakness and barbarity which marked the struggle on the Spanish side.

It would have been honorable in Spain to have granted relief to the oppressed Cubans before they were driven to the point of open rebellion. It would have been honorable to her if she had entered into any arrangement with the United States for the maintenance of a proper government on the island, under which the people might have lived in security and prosperity. But in her own view, all this had nothing to do with honor. The essential point of "honor" with Spain was to display the utmost possible tenacity in maintaining an unjust, unreasonable and utterly hopeless attitude toward her colonies and the Government of the United States. Her "honor" consisted in not giving up anything until she was compelled by force to do so. This is "national honor" with Spain, and it is not altogether unlike "national honor" elsewhere. But true honor is revealed not through politics, but through Christianity.
