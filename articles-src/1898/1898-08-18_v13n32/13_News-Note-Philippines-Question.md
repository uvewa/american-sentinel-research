Passing events continue to make it more clear that the question of the disposition of the Philippines is not one that will be lightly settled. Now that American and Spanish troops have met in battle at Manila, and American blood has been shed and American lives lost in establishing American supremacy, the sentiment for retaining the islands as American territory is no doubt tremendously strengthened, and in all probability will be too strong to be denied. And when this Government announces definitely its intention to establish itself in power on the borders of the seat of the contentions of the Old World powers, it will not be strange if those powers take more decisive action in the matter than they have done hitherto.
