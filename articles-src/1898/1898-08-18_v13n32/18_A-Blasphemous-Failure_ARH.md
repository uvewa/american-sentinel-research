# "A Blasphemous Failure."

RY A. R. HYATT.

The Oil City Blizzard, of Oil City, Pa., under date of Friday, June 24, contains an editorial on Robert G. Ingersoll, the noted infidel, and his work.

Now we do not believe in Ingersollism, and think we are as truly opposed to infidelity in all its forms as is the editor of the Blizzard. But the editor is on the wrong track. Listen to what he says: "For Robert G. Ingersoll, the lawyer, the orator, the open-hearted, public-spirited man, we must entertain respect; for Robert Ingersoll, the infidel, the blasphemous expounder of a poisonous belief, contradictory to the doctrine of the Bible, inconsistent with the creed of the Christian nations, we can hold nothing but feelings of abhorrence.

"This man, whose eloquence is so powerful as to corrupt minds too weak to hold their own convictions, is a follower of Thomas Paine, the hideous scoffer against revealed religion, and, like Paine, we find him stepping aside from his religious controversies long enough to put in masterly diction a plea for pure morality, honesty and truth. With all his unrighteous tirade against the existence of an almighty God, he is a man with a keen appreciation of all that is good and fine in life, and it is astonishing to find him so. His family ties are the sweetest; his ability as a lawyer has won the confidence of his clients; his standing as one of the most able orators in the country cannot be questioned; his estimate of women, made apparent in so many of his lectures, and his love for little children, show him to be a man of culture and good principles.

"But all these attributes are clouded in darkness by the realization of his religious differences. He denies the existence of God; he would tear to pieces every thread of truth on which we base our comforting faith; he is a rank inconoclast, seeking to shatter the doctrinal idols of a Christian people and giving them nothing better in their place.

"He can harm no one with a mind strong enough to resist his powerful persuasions, but to the ignorant mass of men his unreligious utterances framed in language of marvelous strength and beauty, must come like the inspiring and impressible tones of harmonious music and inflict their contamination.

"In this country, where free thought is allowed unbridled liberty, he can give voice to his false sentiments and meet no stronger opposition than the arguments of the American pulpit; but it is a woful mistake, and toleration of speech should be a dead law when it comes to a ranting exposition of unreligious sentiment.

"Ingersoll on Shakespeare, Ingersoll on Napoleon, Lincoln, or any of the historical characters of the world, is a literary treat; but Ingersoll on the 'Holy Bible' is from beginning to end a sacrilegious, blasphemous failure."

A "failure,"—"from beginning to end a sacrilegious, blasphemous failure,"—and yet it is desired to hinder a man from showing his efforts to be such in speaking against the "Holy Bible." If it is a failure, good; let him fail. When men feel a desire to forcibly prevent their fellows from expressing their views on religion, they give evidence of a low appreciation of the religion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

This editor has judged Christianity from the standpoint of popular pulpit teaching as shown by the expression: "In this country where free thought is allowed unbridled liberty, he can give voice to his false sentiments and meet no stronger opposition than the American pulpit." Let the pulpit present the plain truth as revealed in the Bible, and it will stand against the bombastic ebullitions of all the infidels in the country, and there will be no need of unjust laws that trample upon the God-given rights of the individual.
