A CONGRESSMAN from New Hampshire, Mr. Cyrus Sulloway, is reported as having said in reply to the question whether the United States ought to hold the Philippines: "Hold them? Of course we should hold them! It would be cowardly to desert them now simply to satisfy a few weak-pulsed Americans who say we cannot handle them. We Anglos can fight with a Bible in one hand and a rifle in the other. Where he cannot convert, he shoots."

***

Of course, the only idea in carrying "a Bible in one hand and a rifle in the other" would be to shoot wherever it was found not possible to convert. That is the principle of procedure that must be followed by a "Christian nation"—force joined with religion. Force with religion means compulsion wherever there cannot be persuasion. And this is a very old principle—one that has been often tried with the object of benefitting mankind. One can see that if this principle should be fully carried out, the whole world would ere long be "converted," because all the people who had refused to be converted would be dead. When Spain first came to the Western World, several centuries ago, she carried the symbol of religion in one hand and the sword in the other; and the unfortunate natives had their choice between "conversion" and death. And now, when Spain is being driven out, the victorious party who congratulate themselves on being rid of a barbarous neighbor propose to put in practice the barbarous principle which has done most to make Spain what she is.

"The Bible in one hand and a sword in the other" does not make an effective fighting outfit. The Bible is the Word of God, and the Word of God is the "sword of the Spirit." The two swords cannot work in partnership. If the sword of steel is to be carried, the "sword of the Spirit" might as well be dropped. The sword alone is more effective against the enemy than the sword and the Bible combined.

***

The real antagonism between these two weapons may be seen from the fact that the purpose of the sword is to kill, while the purpose of the Bible is to save. Being thus opposite in purpose, when joined together the one only antagonizes and neutralizes the other. The sword has, of course, its legitimate field in the divine economy for this world, being the conservator of civil peace, and borne by the civil ruler "not in vain." But this is altogether outside the sphere of religion.
