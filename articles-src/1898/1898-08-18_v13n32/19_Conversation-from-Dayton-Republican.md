The Dayton Republican (Dayton, Tenn.) of August 5, reports the following interesting bit of conversation occurring recently in that town, in which is displayed the spirit of the demand for Sunday laws:

"A Graysville lady who is also an Adventist was canvassing in Dayton recently for an Adventist paper, when she encountered an unexpected snag.

"'I don't want your Advent litatoor,' said the lady of the house she called at. 'You Advents ought to be in jail anyway. You was there once and you ought to have stayed. If you would obey the laws of your country you would not get in trouble. George Washington fixed the Sabbath, and you have no business in disobeying him.'

"During this diatribe the visitor stood aghast. Finally she managed to interpose: 'But Jesus Christ is greater than George Washington.'

"'Not in this Sunday business he ain't,' snapped the irate lady of the house, and this ended the unique discussion.

"Clearly there is a field for missionaries other than in China and Africa."
