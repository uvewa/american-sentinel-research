Writing of the thirteen inch gun used in the navy, a writer in The Engineering Magazine says: "It is difficult to appreciate the power and, at the same time, the delicacy of these great fighting-machines. At the muzzle the immense projectile has been forced through twenty-seven inches of Harveyized steel. At two thousand yards the penetration is twenty-two and one-half inches. The extreme range is thirteen miles. The projectile leaves the gun with a velocity of 2,100 feet per second, or 1,400 miles per hour. A shot can be fired every one and one half minutes for a period of several hours. The force imparted to the projectile, if properly applied, would lift a battleship bodily three feet, and yet this great machine, weighing 145,000 pounds, is as accurate as a high-grade watch."

The most powerful weapons are spiritual.
