## Studies in French History.—34.

"While all these things were going on in France during the fifteenth century, there was a humble man born in Genoa, Italy, in 1435, who from study, observation, and deep reasoning, formed the opinion that our earth, instead of being a flat body of land floating in a sea of waters, was a round body; and that by sailing westward he might if he only went far enough, sail to India by a new route. His name was—"

"Christopher Columbus!" exclaimed all the children in concert.

"Yes," said Professor Carman, "but as this does not directly affect French history, we will drop the subject, interesting as it is, and finish our study of Louis XI."

"The king was still shut up in his dismal castle," said Harry Ray, "when our last lesson closed."

"Yes, and he never left this castle until he died. He grew more and more superstitious, and was continually adding a relic of some dead saint to the string of charms which he constantly wore, hoping thereby to postpone the hour of death, which he so much dreaded and for which he was so little prepared."

"Relics! What kind of relics, for instance?" asked Florence Ray, who was a great hand to particularize.

"Well, he would get a piece of something which he was told was the finger or toe of some saint, or may be the bone of an animal, which some deceiving priest would gravely assure him was a part of the once living form of St. Peter or St. Paul, and he would string these around his neck in the vain hope that they would cure his bodily maladies."

"I should suppose he would want to be cured of his spiritual diseases before he died," observed Julia March.

"O he cared far more to be made well in body than to be healed in spirit; and when his attendants would pray for his soul as well as his body, Louis often remonstrated with them, and begged them not to ask for too many favors at once, but to ask only that he might have his health again. He would not allow any of his attendants to mention the word 'death' in his presence; yet, after all, he was obliged to yield to the grim messenger at last.

"He is called 'the worst husband, the worst father, and the most brutal son in the world,'—a sad name indeed to follow a man through the ages."

"Did he do anything at all worth remembering?" asked Charlie White.

"Yes, indeed; it is very seldom that one cannot mention some good deeds in every life, and Louis's is no exception. He made some very sensible laws, and the middle classes were certainly in a better condition when he died than when he first ascended the throne."

"Did King Louis have any one to take his place?" asked Rob Billings, "if he did I hope for the sake of the poor people that he made a more kind-hearted ruler than his father."

"O yes; but his little son Charles the Eighth, called The Courteous, was too young to govern his father's kingdom, being then only thirteen years old: so his sister Anne was made regent. The poor boy never seemed to be well. He was badly misshapen and dwarfish in appearance, but he had a kind heart, and although his was comparatively a short reign, he endeared himself to his people. His father's government had been so severe that the poor people were glad enough for a change."

"Did the regent, Anne, manage things pretty well?" asked Milly Brown.

"Very well, indeed, considering the difficulties there were in the way. She is said to have been an intelligent woman and one who possessed great tact. But affairs were in a very sad condition. The country had been overrun for about four years by her father's troops, and the poor peasants were in a state bordering upon actual starvation."

"It does not seem as if we ever had such a very poor class of people in this country, or ever could have," said Max Smith.

"We may not have so many poor people nowadays, but don't you think, professor, that the number is getting pretty large?" answered practical Jack.

"Yes, and it is growing larger. I was in Chicago at the time of one of the great strikes only quite recently, and I saw more actual want and suffering among the poor than I supposed it possible to exist in this favored country."

"Isn't it true that history repeats itself?" asked Julia March.

"Yes; it was never truer than now.

"At last King Charles married a daughter of Maximilian, of Austria, afterward Emperor of Germany.

"The young king was quite ignorant, but he learned to read after he was married, and then he wasted much time in reading foolish stories,—for he was quite romantically inclined,—and it had then precisely the effect it has now; it filled his head with much nonsense, and turned a naturally kind-hearted man into a foolish fortune hunter."

"What! did he go gold hunting?"

"O no; but he did just as foolish a thing as that. He had not learned the lesson that it hardly pays to conquer territory far away from home, and so he started out to conquer Italy."

"I imagine the pope had something to say about that," said Joe Palmeter.

"He certainly did. True to the papal idea of the righteousness of uniting church and state, Pope Alexander the Sixth, whom history calls the most thoroughly wicked man who ever sat in the chair of St. Peter, gave the young king the kingdom of Naples as coolly as though it were his to give."

Now as the time was up, Professor Carman dismissed his class, bade a kind good-by to Charlie White and Rob Billings, who intended to sail for Paris the next day, and asked them to write often, which they promised to do.
