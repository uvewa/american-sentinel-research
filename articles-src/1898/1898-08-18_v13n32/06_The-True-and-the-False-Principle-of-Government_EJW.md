## The True and the False Principle of Government.

BY E. J. WAGGONER.

AFTER the death of King Solomon and the accession of Rehoboam, the people came to the new king and said: "Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee." The king "consulted with the old men" and they gave wise counsel, saying, "If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever." Then the king "consulted with the young men that were grown up with him" and they recommended this reply: "My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins." The new king followed the counsel of the young men and threatened the people with heavier burdens than his father had imposed upon them.

The two replies well represent the difference between the principles of the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness. "If thou wilt be a servant unto this people," said the old men, and this was the principle upon which God in Jesus Christ deals with the rebellious world. "Behold my Servant whom I uphold." "I am among you as he that serveth." "Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant." Thus does he who is King of kings and Lord of lords relate himself to those whom he would win as his loyal subjects. In marked contrast with this is that arbitrary spirit which would seek to crush under an iron heel every one who should raise a voice against oppression. The one would win by self-sacrifice, the other would drive by an increase of arbitrary power.

But instead of being terrified into submission by the threats uttered, the people were driven into open revolt: "What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David." When the tax-gatherer came among them, "all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died." "So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day." Thus by disunion and division was the way being prepared for the downfall of the nation and their captivity.

He who considers the situation among the nations of the earth to-day cannot fail to see the working of the same influences which brought disaster to Solomon's kingdom. There are nations where the people are groaning under the burden of debt and taxation, and yet their protests, not always wisely made (as in the recent riots in Italy), are met with a display of military power, and no hope is held out that the condition of affairs will be improved. The ruling powers have in many cases so far repudiated the principles of truth and righteousness that there is no sure foundation upon which to build any hope of future reform. The time is near when "all these things shall be dissolved," and the only hope of individuals will be that each one has built for himself upon the sure foundation, and "other foundation can no man lay that than is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
