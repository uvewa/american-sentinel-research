THE National Reformers, it is stated, have petitioned the Government to appoint a day of national fasting and prayer. They have a precedent—or what may be claimed as such—in the proclamation of a similar kind issued by President Lincoln during the darkest period of the civil war. It is proper enough at any time, of course, that the people of the nation should seek the Lord with fasting and prayer; but the civil government has neither the authority to call for such a step nor the power to make it effective.
