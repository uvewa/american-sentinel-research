THE Methodist Ministerial Union of Omaha, Neb., are hard at work to secure Sunday closing of the gates of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. To this end they have circulated petitions throughout the States participating in the Exposition, to be filled with signatures and forwarded to the managers of the same. The petitions as sent out by the Union for circulation were accompanied by the following printed note:—

"DEAR BROTHER:

"Inclosed find a petition for the closing of the gates of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition on the Sabbath.

"The management has received some petitions in favor of Sunday opening, and we believe they are predisposed in favor of granting that request.

"Nothing but prompt, energetic action on the part of lovers of the Sabbath will prevent the opening of the gates on that day.

"Please circulate this petition quickly. The case is urgent. Much depends upon you. Secure all the signers possible and return to Rev. J. B. Maxfield, D. D., 2202 Miami St., Omaha, Neb., as early as May 1, 1898.

"By order of the METHODIST MINISTERIAL UNION."

The petition, with some reasons alleged in its support, reads thus:—

"PETITION FOR SUNDAY CLOSING.

"To the Management of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.

"Town…………………, State…………………, ………………1898.

"GENTLEMEN:—We are not advised as to whether you intend to open the gates of the Exposition on Sunday or not, but in advance of any announcement regarding this feature of the case we do not hesitate to express our convictions touching the question; and, as citizens and voters of this great Trans Mississippi territory, like yourselves we are interested in the success of this great International enterprise and make use of our privilege in petitioning your honorable body in the interests of good order and morality; and, therefore, as men over twenty-one years of age, and women more than eighteen years of age, we beg leave to say we would regret the demoralizing effects of opening the gates to the public on God's holy day; and, furthermore, we believe that more people would gladly contribute to the success of the enterprise if the gates shall be closed on the Sabbath.

"We hereby record our opposition to the opening of the gates on the Sabbath for the following reasons:—

"1. It would be a violation of God's law, upon the keeping of which depends the prosperity and perpetuity of this nation.

"2. It would be in violation of the statutes of the commonwealth of Nebraska.

"3. Many employés would not only be deprived of the rest and privileges of the Sabbath, but would be compelled to work in violation of their consciences.

"4. Many would be obliged to forego the pleasure of a visit to the Exposition, on account of the conscientious conviction that it would be wrong to patronize an institution that desecrates God's holy day.

"5. It would be a scandal to the fair name of our great West.

"6. It would weaken the public conscience, lessen the reverence of the masses for law, and render the enforcement of law much more difficult than heretofore.

"7. It would set a dangerous precedent for all future enterprises of a similar kind."

This Exposition being, as we understand, a private enterprise, not under the management or control of any department of the Government, there can be no objection to Sunday closing based on the principle of separation of church and state. But the reasons alleged in support of the petition are, for the most part, in violation of this principle, and its circulation is designed to create a sentiment in favor of enforced religion. Petitions do not represent persuasion, but the force of public opinion.

The petition is entirely uncalled for, for two reasons. First, if the managers really have a regard for Sunday, they will close the Exposition on that day of their own free will and accord, without any pressure being put upon them. And, second, If they have no regard for Sunday as a sacred day, it will be but a hypocritical pretense for them to "keep" it anyway, and not an act that will strengthen the cause of righteousness and truth.

Sunday is not the Sabbath. But even supposing it were, its cause could gain nothing by its being forced upon the people. God wants people to regard the Sabbath day—to love it. And if they have no regard for it as his holy day, they will not stand any better with him by adding hypocrisy to their disregard of God's commandment.

That is what the Methodist Ministerial Union really ask by this petition. Evidently believing that the managers of the Exposition have no real regard for the day, they ask them to become hypocrites before God and man, in order to strengthen the public conscience and maintain the reverence of the masses for law; in short, in order to save the nation.

We do not believe in a scheme of national salvation which puts a premium upon hypocrisy.
