Press dispatches of recent date contained the following item of news from the Philippine Islands:—

"The archbishop of Manila issued a pastoral letter on May 5 calling on all Christians to defend the faith against the heretics, who designed to erect an insuperable barrier to their salvation, they intending to enslave the people and then forbid the sacraments of baptism, matrimony and burial, and the consolation of absolution.

"The archbishop declares that if the Americans are allowed to possess the islands their altars will be descrated and the churches changed into Protestant chapels. Instead of there being pure morality, as now, examples of vice will only be inculcated."

THE "pastoral letter" of a Roman Catholic archbishop ought to contain good Catholic doctrine; and if this is good Catholic doctrine in the Philippine Islands, it is good Catholic doctrine anywhere. The item concludes:—

"The archbishop appointed May 17 as a day of rejoicing over the renewed consecration of the islands to the sacred heart of Jesus."

Being thus "consecrated" according to the valid Roman Catholic form, how can good Catholics anywhere give assent to the invasion and forcible seizure of the islands by the American troops? We do not see the logic in Catholic devotion to a non-Catholic country, against one that is strictly Catholic.
