The London Truth, of Canada, in a recent issue thus speaks of an actual occurrence that took place in that city:—

"At a meeting of the Local Women's Temperance Union at Ottawa the other day a lady gave a shocking example of the indifference to Sabbath observance which is creeping over the modern world. She stated that she had, to her shame and sorrow, seen two men looking in at the window of a well-known tailor's shop on the Sabbath day, evidently engaged in selecting the materials for their new spring suits. She added that she had consulted a solicitor as to whether there is no law which could be invoked for the purpose of putting a stop to such profane conduct, and that she had been informed in reply that, though there is at present no law under which tradesmen can be compelled to pull their blinds down on Sundays, it was quite within the power of the legislature to pass such a law. She asked the meeting to join in a petition to the legislature in favor of such an enactment, and the matter was referred to the Lord's day committee."

This incident very well illustrates the spirit that actuates a large share of the zealous advocates of enforced Sunday observance. If they had the power and public sympathy, what wouldn't they do?
