**TUNE—"Marching Thro' Georgia."**

Raise the banner of the Lord, unfurl it everywhere,
Cry aloud, O watchman brave, His glorious truth declare;
See the banner of the foe,—'tis waving in the air,—
While we are marching to Zion.

**CRORUS.—**O glory, glory! raise the banner high,
We'll fight beneath this ensign till we die;
Our weapons are not carnal, for we're marching to the sky,—
Yes, we are marching to Zion.

Come, my brother, haste thee; for I hear the battle's din,
Wield the Spirit's mighty sword, the Word of God will win;
Take the shield of faith against the mighty hosts of sin,
While we are marching to Zion.

Jesus is our Leader, so our hearts are full of cheer;
He will have a kingdom, but His kingdom is not here;
Take the helmet of salvation, fight but never fear,
While we are marching to Zion.

We will win the victory by watching unto prayer;
Let us never ask the State, Christ's uniform to wear;
Let us conquer souls for Him, and bravely do and dare,
While we are marching to Zion.

Though through persecution dark and bloody we may wade,
Though through dangers wild and fierce the Christian's path is laid,
We can hear the Captain cry, "'Tis I, be not afraid,"
While we are marching to Zion.
