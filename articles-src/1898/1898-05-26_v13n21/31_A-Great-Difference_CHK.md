There is a wide difference in the preaching of "one of the most influential and eloquent" ministers of apostolic times, and that of some "of the most influential and eloquent" ministers of this city at this present time. Samples of sermons that are preached nowadays are given us in the New York World, May 16, 1898, which sermons were delivered the day before.

The burden of one of these "influential and eloquent" ministers was to set before his audience, and through them, before the Government of the United States, the course that this nation must follow since the "Philippines have fallen into our hands."

One thing that is clear to his mind is that "we shall draw closer than ever before to our mother country." An Anglo-Saxon Alliance, to his mind, would mean peace. Thus he says, "Could the English-speaking peoples stand together, the destinies of the world would be in their hands. When England and America shall say together in the presence of any wrong, 'This must stop,' it will stop. Then from the soul of the English-speaking race which stands for peace will be heard, with the tone of an authority not likely to be slighted, the sacred words of our greatest soldier, 'Let us have peace.'"

Another prominent minister preached in a similar strain, his subject being "The Anglo-Saxon Alliance." In such an alliance he saw the sure preservation of the whole world and a peace that could not be disturbed. Still another influential speaker took for his subject—not Jesus, the crucified—but "Helen Gould, patriot." Among other things the speaker said, "I hail Miss Gould's gift as a sublime challenge to all our nation's wealthy families to go and do likewise, and thus to mollify the bitter and discontented feelings of the struggling masses."

From the foregoing it appears that entangling alliances are the means by which the peace of the world is to be preserved, while the munificent gifts of money would "mollify the bitter and discontented feelings of the struggling masses."

As reported in the papers there is absolutely nothing said of the gospel of Jesus Christ, through whom alone there can possibly be peace.

In contrast with all this, we have the utterances of an "influential and eloquent" minister of apostolic times,—one who was called to "fully preach the Word of God," being "separated unto the gospel." He declared, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified." And to such an extent did he realize the importance of this work that he exclaims, "Woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel."

Paul knew, and so taught, that the preaching of Christ, and its acceptance, was the only solution of every difficulty that could possibly arise.

The truth is that this world, like an old sinking ship, is doomed—it is going down. And while statesmen and others are seeking to keep together its rotten timbers, the ministers of the gospel should be lifting their voices with one accord, in the power of the Holy Spirit, in urging the people to get ready to take their departure to the new and better world—the "world to come."

If it is seen by politicians and statesman to be necessary that the nations should draw near to each other in the way suggested, let them attend to that; but let the preachers adhere to their high calling of persuading the people to draw nigh to God. This is the most important work; for if the people draw nigh to God there is no question but that they will draw nigh to each other. And this really is the only way in which this can be done.
