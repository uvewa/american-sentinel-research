One of the greatest kings of antiquity, was Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He was one of the few monarchs that have sat upon the throne of universal earthly dominion.

This Nebuchadnezzar at a certain time in his reign made a great image of gold, which he "set up in the plains of Dura," and commanded all the "people, nations and languages" of the province of Babylon to worship it.

There were three officials of the government—Hebrews—who refused to obey the king's command, and declared that they would worship the God of heaven and none other. They flatly refused to obey the law of the land.

The government said that they should do a certain thing, and they absolutely refused to do it. That was plain disloyalty to the government.

Was it? So Nebuchadnezzar thought, and he commanded them to be cast into the "burning, fiery furnace." And they were bound and cast in; but lo! another power greater than the power of Babylon interposed and by a wonderful miracle vindicated them in their refusal to do that which had been commanded.

When Nebuchadnezzar, who was looking on, saw that, he changed his mind; not as regards their opposition to the law of the land, for he said that they had "changed the king's word"; but as regards their loyalty. And the indisputable proof that he changed his mind on this point is the fact that he then promoted these three individuals—"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego"—in the province of Babylon. Dan. 3:30. And every Christian will admit that in this the king did what was proper and wise.

These three men, by their firm adherence to the right in opposition even to the law of the land, gave better proof of their loyalty to the government than was given by the men who obeyed it simply because it was the law. Nebuchadnezzar recognized this fact.

That was loyalty to the government then; and what true loyalty was then, it is to-day.
