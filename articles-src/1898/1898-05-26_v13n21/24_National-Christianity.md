The Reform Press, of Pueblo, Col., recently touched on the idea of national Christianity, as follows:—

"There is not a Christian nation in the world to day. A Christian nation would be a nation composed mainly of Christian people and conducted on Christian principles. Such a nation is not to be found on the face of the earth. There are some nations which have a measure of civilization, for which we thank God. But such a thing as a Christian nation does not exist now and never has in the past."

This is quoted in a Nebraska journal, the Central City Democrat, with the following pertinent comments:—

"And yet we have been told that all civilized nations are Christian, and each one a little more Christian than the balance. England has claimed to be a Christian nation for many centuries, and was particularly so when Catholics and Protestants were cutting throats and burning heretics. France had a spasm of Christianity once which culminated in St. Bartholomew's day. New England was so much Christian that her people burned all the wicked witches and drove all the heretics into a lifelong exile. We are Christians in America with ten thousand churches closed six days out of seven and four times as many saloons open every day of the week; with ten thousand devoted ministers and forty thousand accomplished gamblers; with a few thousand millionaires and a few million paupers; with the poor oppressed by law and the rich setting the laws at defiance. You can just bet we are a Christian nation, and if anybody dispute it we will fight him."
