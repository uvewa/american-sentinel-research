TAKE four individuals—Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln; only these four—out of American history, and the reputation of this nation would suffer an incalculable loss. Any one familiar with United States history must admit this.

These four individuals were great men. But the nation did not make them great; they, on the contrary, added much to the greatness of the nation.

They became great as individuals, and it was only the recognition of this greatness which gave them national reputation. They were not great because they were put at the head of the nation; they were put at the head of the nation because they were great.

Having the same opportunities and advantages which hundreds or thousands of others about them had, they rose to positions of pre-eminence by virtue of the inherent power that was in them,—the power of character. And by the same power they acquitted themselves well at the head of public affairs.

A small man—small as an individual—would look a good deal smaller at the head of a nation than he looks as a private character.

These are truths, and plain truths; yet in spite of them the notion is getting to be prevalent that individualism is a dead issue, and a doctrine of no value to mankind to-day. The talk is all about "nationalism"—as if there was something in nationalism that could elevate or save mankind.

The nation cannot help the individual. Give him all the wealth of the nation, or give him all the power, and what would he do without a strong, upright character? He would do a great deal worse with them than he would without them.

Without individualism, there can be no nationalism that amounts to anything. And if the day of individualism be passed, then the day of national greatness is passed with it.
