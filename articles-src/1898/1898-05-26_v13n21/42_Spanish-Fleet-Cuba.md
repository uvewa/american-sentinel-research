GREAT things are going to take place on the high seas in the vicinity of Cuba as soon as the American and Spanish fleets come together. This is the substance of the "news" which the journals of "wark extra" notoriety have been selling to the public for the last two weeks. Admiral Sampson has orders to destroy the Spanish fleet and is all ready to do so just as soon as he can get to it. This much is obvious to any intelligent person without the aid of enterprising journalism. And every intelligent person knows also that no newspaper can tell anything about when or where the hostile fleets are to come together. The Spanish fleet is composed entirely of fast ships; from which fact it may be inferred that it was not sent to this coast for the special purpose of fighting. And as its speed is several knots an hour faster than that of the American fleet, it is plain that under ordinary circumstances it will be able to keep out of Admiral Sampson's way. And this fact may postpone a decisive encounter for a considerable time.

Meanwhile it is obvious that every day's delay in the matter tends to make the situation more complex and critical. Another decisive victory like that of Commodore Dewey at Manila would probably be the signal for European intervention to force Spain to submit; but Spain is counting on securing European aid, and while she can postpone decisive action there is a chance that complications may arise which will provide her with a powerful ally. Nothing could be more unfortunate for the United States and for the world than such an outcome; and therefore the situation calls for the utmost decision and celerity of action on the part of the United States.
