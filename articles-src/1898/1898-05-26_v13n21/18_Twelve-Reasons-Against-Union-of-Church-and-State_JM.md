1. **BECAUSE** Christ himself has drawn the line of demarkation between the two, by teaching us to "Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's." Matt. 22:21.

2. Because such a union proves how weak and powerless must be the religion professed by those who seek political power to sustain it by legislation, since they thus make man their stay instead of God.

3. Because when a church unites with the state, and receives governmental support, the church must preach only that which the government may decide, which must naturally be according to the ideas of the majority.

4. Because when the ideas of the majority are accepted as the national religion, the natural result of such an illegitimate union must be the enactment of religious laws to strengthen their unlawful position.

5. Because immediately a government discriminates between religions, and would favor one sect more than another, it by so doing poses as a judge of the consciences of the people, and thus would steal the prerogative that appertains to our Eternal Father.

6. Because the inevitable result of enacting religious laws must be religious persecution to those of different views from the majority.

7. Because in so doing the government forfeits the right to demand obedience, since God himself has laid down the line of action to be taken in such a case, recording in his holy Book that it is better to obey God than man. Acts 5:29.

8. Because there was never inaugurated a religious persecution, in the whole world's history, in a country where there was no union of church and state.

9. Because the union of church and state instead of promoting true religion, impedes its progress, and germinates more religious hypocrites and atheists, than anything else can do.

10. Because Christianity can never seek the aid of any earthly power, to advance its teachings, since the Author of the Christian religion when on earth, taught that his kingdom was not of this world. John 18:36.

11. Because the union of church and state is absolutely opposed to the fundamental principles advanced by the founders of Protestantism.

12. Because when I seek to enact laws that would intrude upon the religious rights of others, I at once prove that I do not love my neighbor as myself; and should I profess to love God while occupying that position, the Bible says I am a liar (1 John 4:20, 21); and liars can never enter the kingdom of God. Rev. 21:8.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.
