THE "almighty dollar" is just now a potent factor in quieting French hostility toward the United States, which has shown a disposition to make itself felt in the controversy with Spain. The French are getting ready for a great display at Paris in the year 1900—a great world's fair which is to eclipse any former thing of the kind—and the prospect that American dollars will be withdrawn from the enterprise is one which they would willingly make some sacrifice of sentiment to avert. And besides this, says the New York Sun, the big shopkeepers in Paris are greatly concerned over reports of the banding together of patriotic women in America to resent French hostility towards this country by discarding French dresses. We hope the report is true; for whatever the action may count for patriotically, it is much to be commended from the standpoint of good sense. We can think of nothing more deserving of eternal boycott than the fashions of "Paree."
