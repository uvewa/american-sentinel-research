The following from the New York Journal, of the 17th inst., presents some questions worthy of serious consideration by those who hold to the idea that the war with Spain is a philanthropic one:—

"There is one question which Americans who are not strategists are asking themselves more seriously every day as this war goes on. It is this: What do we expect to accomplish by the blockade of Cuba?

"We know what we actually are accomplishing. We are killing off our friends, the reconcentrados, by hundreds if not thousands every twenty four hours. We are finishing Weyler's work with a thoroughness that must fill the butcher with ghoulish glee. But what end do we hope to achieve by inflicting all this misery?

"It seems to be forgotten in some quarters that this is not an ordinary war. If we had begun to fight Spain on account of some injury to American citizens in Madrid, and if Cuba had been a loyal Spanish colony, there would have been nothing illogical in striking at Spain through the Cubans, either by blockade or in any other way. But Cuba is only nominally a Spanish colony, and as far as we are concerned she is not one at all. We have officially announced that the Cuban people are and of right ought to be free and independent. They are our friends and the enemies of Spain. Is it not a curious policy, then, to strike at Spain by starving the Cubans?

"It has been demonstrated that as long as there is any food in Cuba the Spanish soldiers will not starve. Before they go hungry every Cuban within their lines will be dead. To bring about such a result will be to destroy such foreign confidence as now exists in our profession that we have undertaken this war from motives of humanity."
