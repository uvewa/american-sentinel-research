PROTESTANT missionaries in Madagascar, it is said, are anxious—some of them—that their work should receive political recognition from the French government. There are some, however, among those most interested in this mission work who realize that governmental recognition would be disastrous to spiritual progress, and earnestly opposed it for this reason."
