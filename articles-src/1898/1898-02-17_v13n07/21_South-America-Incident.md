There is no quarter of the globe that furnishes richer mines for securing practical examples of the workings of a united church and state than South America. We have published within the last year quite a number of personal experiences, written by the actors themselves. In a contemporary, we find the account of a seller of religious books in Chile, where there is supposed to be religious liberty. It seems that it was his first experience, as he was evidently not aware that Catholic holidays in that country are quite rigidly observed. He came to one town where he had some books to deliver, and all the places of business being closed, he could do little or nothing, so he went to another town, and with practically the same results. While waiting in the public square for a train, a priest came out of the main church of the town with his procession of saints, when all the men took off their hats. There were fully a thousand present, and he alone kept on his hat. On the opposite side of the street the priest in his four-cornered cap came along and motioned for him to take off his hat. No attention was paid to this, and he was then commanded to either remove his hat or leave the square. What happened after this we will let him tell in his own language. He says:—

"I asked him what authority he had in Chile to give such a command, as there is religious liberty in this country. He threatened to call the police. I said, 'Very well, if you have authority to do so.' He left his monos (saints) in the street, and went to look for a policeman; and the crowd left his procession to see me.

"While I was waiting, I asked the people what authority the priest had, as I did not believe in his santos or his church. Finally the priest came back with the policeman, and commanded him to take me to jail. I again asked if one had to take off his hat in the public square. The policeman said I must come with him, and talk to the chief of police, which I did. While on the way, I gave a tract to the policeman, and convinced him that the priest was wrong. Half a square before we reached the prison, several persons came rushing up behind, and asked the policeman to let me go. One of these brushed my back with his hand, as on leaning against a tree while waiting in the square for the priest, my coat had become soiled. I asked them to come along and see what the chief would say.

"On reaching the prison the policeman said, 'I come with this man by order of Señor Cura, because of his making a scandal in not taking off his hat.' The chief said, 'Go.' I did not care to go at once, so he asked me in, and I showed my book to him and others, and gave him some tracts, then turned to the public square again, where the priest was. A little before reaching it a well-dressed man came almost on a run, and we met on the corner. He was astonished, and asked if I was not the man who had been sent to jail.

"'Yes,' was my reply.

"He said, 'If I only had power, you would go to jail.'

"I then asked him if he was a Christian, and if Christ ever sent any one to jail. He went away somewhat ashamed. On reaching the 'plaza,' or square, the people spied me, and pointed me out to others. Because of my 'offense' many had become my friends, and perhaps more had become my enemies. After talking awhile to some, as the priest was entering the church with his crowd, I gave away some tracts, and left for the station to take the train for San Felipe.

"When I had entered the train one young man began brushing the dust off my back to show his affection. I felt thankful to the Lord for this victory. Being my first visit to the town, I arrived without friends or enemies; but on leaving, all were either friends or enemies."
