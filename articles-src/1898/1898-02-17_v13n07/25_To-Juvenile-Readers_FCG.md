Dear Friends:—Doubtless all of you are more than gratified with the Young People's Department of this periodical, which has been created especially for the youthful readers of the paper. Personally, I am of the conviction that this addition is very timely, and will be of great value to all who interest themselves in it. Perhaps some may think the subject of religious liberty is not essential for young people, nor of vital importance enough for them to become interested in. But of all the people who should be especially awake to these living principles, with a keen sense of their value, the young ought to be the first and most active. There are many reasons which demonstrate this to be a fact; a greater number than can be written in this short epistle.

It is a fact with which nearly all of you are familiar that, during the past three years, a continuous patriotic wave, so-called, has been sweeping over this country, and it seems constantly to rise with each setting sun. One very remarkable thing about this movement is that its strength lies in the concentrated forces of several millions of the best young people of this country. Never perhaps in the history of the country, the times of '76 and '61 excepted, has the air been so full of patriotism as at the present, and its density becomes more and more apparent. One writer, recently speaking of this movement, said, "There can be no question about the penalty that may be incurred by neglecting the present golden opportunity to make patriotism universal and fervid, North, South, East, and West. Miss this God-given opening of to-day, and the fortunate conjunction may never return."

God is certainly granting golden opportunities at the present time to rightly understand the true meaning of civil and religious liberty, that all may know the correct relations which exist between God and Caesar; between the church and state; between God and the individual; between individuals and society; and much, yes, everything, depends upon a correct understanding of these relations. Never has a truth come to the world without the devil was bound to defeat it if possible; either by directly opposing it, or else by counterfeiting. So these eternal principles of civil and religious liberty which to-day are commanding the attention of almost the whole world, and promise, in the near future, to become the living issue, are either misrepresented, falsely colored, or misconstrued by the force of evil, in order that their true meaning shall not be apparent to all.

As one of the outgrowths of this popular patriotic wave there has been thrown ashore this so called "Christian Citizenship" organization. It has gathered under its influence nearly five millions of people, the very cream of the land, and imbued them with an enthusiasm worthy of the most noble cause the world has ever known. As we are all well aware, the whole foundation of this great movement is built upon a false hypothesis; hence will not stand when the great contest between righteousness and error will be waged. It being built upon a sandy foundation, the rivers of truth will inundate the whole structure. Then how important it is that every young person educate himself that he may correctly understand these eternal principles,—that he build upon a solid foundation, even upon the Rock of Eternal Truth, in order that he be not carried away with "the refuge of lies," which are to come to nought.

Yet more: it is not only necessary that each one understands these principles for himself, but he also has a duty to perform in telling his neighbor the true intent of the principles of civil and religious liberty. Millions to-day are anxiously waiting to learn the truth of these things; and as ye have freely received, freely give.

But some may ask, "Who is my neighbor?" He who needs the assistance most, independent of caste, color, condition, or position. When we consider the millions of persons in these various organizations, working with such a zeal and earnestness for what they believe to be the upbuilding of Christ's kingdom upon earth, yet misguided because of erroneous principles, how necessary it is for every person who loves God, and to whom has been given the privilege of knowing these eternal truths, especially among the young people, to become thoroughly acquainted with these facts themselves, and then cooperate with the divine One, that many of these earnest but misguided persons may know the truth as it is in Jesus, and turn their feet in the path of truth and rectitude.

It is the mission of this department of the SENTINEL to educate the youth upon this line. The call of God today is, "Educate, Educate, Educate." By so doing each one will not only save his own soul, but will have many sheaves to be gathered in the garner at the great day of the Lord.

Yours for religious liberty,

F. C. GILBERT.
