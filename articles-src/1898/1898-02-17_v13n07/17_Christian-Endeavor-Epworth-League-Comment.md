We have no objection to the Christian Endeavors, or to the members of any other religious society.

We have no objection to any religious organization, as such. In their legitimate field of work, the Christian Endeavor Society, the Epworth League and kindred organizations are capable of achieving magnificent results in the way of uplifting fallen humanity.

In this line of work they have done much, and their work is worthy of all commendation. We cease to approve, and object, only when they enter upon work which is outside their legitimate sphere of action.

We object, in other words, when a religious organization steps over the line between that which is religious and that which is civil, making use of civil power to enforce religious beliefs or observances.

The Christian Endeavor Society is a truly magnificent body of earnest, devoted, and well meaning young men and women; and the same is true of the Epworth League. They have power, influence, enthusiasm, consecration.

But for this very reason it is all the more essential that they should not make the false moves which they are now being led to make. That which is capable of accomplishing vast good is also capable of doing incalculable damage. It is only a question of whether it is used for its legitimate purpose, or is perverted to something else.

We believe the Christian Endeavor Society, joined with the Epworth League and kindred organizations, while capable of immense good in religious work because of their numbers, zeal, and devotion, are also, for that very reason, capable of plunging this whole country into ruin, under mistaken ideas of right and duty.

There is nothing else but ruin for this country in a union of church and state.

Lucifer, before his fall, was one of the highest angels in heaven; and for this very reason, when the goodness that was in him became perverted, he became the prince of evil.

Too great caution cannot be exercised in guiding organizations within which lie such vast possibilities for good or evil.
