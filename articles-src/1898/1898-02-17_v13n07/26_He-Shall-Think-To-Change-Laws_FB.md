"Our last talk brought out the fact that the papal power has warred against—well, let me see if you can tell me, Charlie?"

"Against the Most High God and against the saints of the Most High."

"What was he next to war against?"

Charlie turned to the prophecy and read from Dan. 7:25, "He shall think to change times and laws."

"Whose times and laws, Charlie?"

"The times and laws of the Most High."

"Yes. We all know that it is customary for nations to change their laws; for men to change each other's laws; but what kind of wisdom would men need to change the laws of the Most High?"

"The wisdom of the Most High," said Charlie.

"Has any finite being ever had the wisdom of the Most High?"

"N-no," said Charlie, slowly. "Jesus was the Son of God,—God in the flesh."

"We will speak of his attitude to the law of God a little later. What does Paul call the pope?"

"The man of sin," said Charlie.

"And in our past talks we have learned that the pope's only an exponent of self; that each one of us, unchanged by divine grace, will war against God and his saints."

"Let us see what the pope has said in regard to changing God's law. Hand me the books on the sofa."

Mrs. Ross read: "The pope's will stands for reason. He can dispense above the law, and of wrong make right by correcting and changing laws."—Pope Nicholas, Dist, 96.

"This paragraph is from the decretals of the popes."

"But, mama, suppose the pope did think to do away with God's law and the precepts of Christ, what difference would it make? He couldn't really do such a thing. Right, you know, is right, because it is right, and because God is. To undo God's law, that is the very expression of right, would be to put God out of existence."

"Yes, Charlie. But who is behind the papal horn?"

"Satan."

"And Satan is manifested in self, and self would kill and obliterate any thing or body that would hinder its exaltation. While no one can undo right, or dethrone God, yet self thinks to do it. The Catholic version reads, 'He shall think himself able to change times and the law.'"

"Do you suppose that the pope actually thinks he is able to do that?"

"Certainly. But he is not the only one who thinks so. Whole nations have thought to do so, and as nations are only individuals in mass, individuals have thought to do so. You may turn to Rom. 8:7, and read."

Charlie read, "'The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.'"

"Dear me," said Charlie; "Is it impossible for any of us to keep God's law?"

"Impossible, unless we experience a change of heart, or mind. Paul also says, 'We have the mind of Christ.' Jesus told Nicodemus that in order to understand the things of God he 'must be born from above,' All have carnal minds who have not the mind of Christ, and the works of the flesh appear. Self controls the life, and the fruits of the Spirit are not seen."
