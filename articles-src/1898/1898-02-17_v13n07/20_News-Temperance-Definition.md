THERE is quite a sentiment prevailing in this country, if we may judge from newspaper statements, in support of the idea that temperance does not mean total abstinence from what is bad, but that it consists in a moderate use of such things; the use of them in so moderate a way as not to exhibit their harmful properties. For example, true temperance as regards the use of intoxicants consists, according to this idea, in drinking them to an extent that will be just short of getting drunk. An individual who writes upon the subject, and in so doing no doubt voices the sentiments of others, says this: "When we are admonished to be temperate in all things, even in language, I presume it was never intended that we should abstain from talking; and so in our 'meats and drinks.' Pray relieve the mind of one accustomed to drink wine at table who has heretofore believed that there was virtue in temperance, and still thinks there is but little in prohibition."

IT is true there is such a thing as intemperate speech; but speech is not inherently harmful, and intemperate speech does not mean much speech, but improper speech. Intoxicants are harmful in and of themselves. The harmful property is in the smallest amount of them, no less truly than in the larger quantities; if this were not so, no harm could result from using them freely. It is a fact that moderate drinking does directly lead to "over-indulgence" and drunkenness; no one ever begins the use of intoxicants otherwise than "moderately." Must we then conclude that temperance leads to intemperance? The proposition is absurd. No; if "moderate" drinking were true temperance, it would never lead to drunkenness. The moderate use of the things which are proper in eating and drinking, never leads an individual to a dishonored grave. This so called "moderation" is a delusion and a snare. If people would be really temperate in life, they would never care for the "moderate" use of intoxicants. A taste for such things is a sure evidence that the seeds of intemperance are in the system, only waiting the opportunity to develop and do their deadly work.

IT is the same with indulgence in any other form of evil. The carnal heart continually longs to indulge in those things which are hurtful to body and soul; but it aims to do this only "moderately." And in this it now has, all too frequently, the countenance and aid of the church. As noticed in our last issue, the pastor of an Episcopal church in Jersey City has started a class in dancing, in the church gymnasium; and the success of the innovation shows how ready the young people are to avail themselves of the opportunity to indulge in a form of worldliness under the auspices of the church. Under the auspices of the church, the indulgence will of course be very "moderate," and therefore an exhibition of true temperance. Will it? What do you think?

Here is what one individual thinks—Mr. Eben Bumstead, of Boston, Mass—who has sent us a leaflet called out by this Jersey City incident. He says:—

"Dear Sir:—The prominence which has lately been given to the announcement that a Jersey City pastor intends to form a 'Bible-class dancing school,' would seem to make this an opportune time for speaking in no uncertain tones—cost what it may—in order to warn your people everywhere of the dangers which they do not now see, of the modern waltz, which the dancing masters at their recent convention in this city condemned as 'obnoxious,' and which the Christian Herald, of Sept. 22, 1897, says 'has proved the road to ruin to countless thousands.'"

In this circular is given the testimony of Mr. T. A. Faulkner, ex-dancing master, ex-champion dancer, and ex-president of Dancing Masters' Association of the Pacific Coast. In this he says on the point of "moderation" in this indulgence: "I only wish that certain parents who think they are restricting their children to 'parlor dancing at home only,' could have been with me the night of May 30th, 1892, and have seen as I did, their girls, some of them but twelve or fourteen years of age, dancing in a public saloon, where so much beer had been spilt on the floor that the women had to hold their dresses to keep them from getting soiled and wet as they danced. This is usually the result of teaching the child to dance and then to restrict it to home dancing. If they once become fascinated with it they must and will, by some means, fair or foul, have more of it than their homes afford. The safe side is the best side. Keep them from taking the first step to ruin, and they can never take the last."

True temperance consists in abstaining from taking the first step to ruin.

And it is very significant that such charges of worldliness can be laid at the door of the church at the very time when the church is trying to get control of the state, to run the affairs of civil government according to the laws of Christian morality. The church should remember the proverb, "Physician, heal thyself."
