PRESIDENT WHITAKER, of the New York State Bar Association, said recently that from 1777 to 1897 the Legislature of New York had passed and ordered printed 101,000 pages of statutes, and that in the years 1887 to 1892 a volume of 600 pages was published each year; from 1892 to 1897 two volumes of 1,000 pages each were issued each year, with the exception of two years, when the output was three volumes each year. This is a vast amount of legislation even for so important a state as New York, and there can be no doubt that much of it is never enforced, and probably some of it is absolutely unnecessary. Perhaps if the Legislature met biennially, and the term of the session was limited, this evil of unessential legislation might be mitigated. As it is now, the Legislature sits for about four months each year, and produces about 1,000 pages of statutes. President Whitaker says: "A very large portion of the time of the Legislature is spent in passing special and personal laws, in which the people as a whole have very little, if any, direct interest. And it is not infrequent that laws are passed in direct opposition to the real interests of the general public. In fact, people are beginning to look upon legislative sessions as a menace, rather than a solace."

What the world needs is not more legislation, but more love.

On the side of truth men care only to discuss principles; on that of error they prefer to descend to personalities.
