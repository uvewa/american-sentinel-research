The greatest power in the universe is the power of God.

The greatest power is capable of accomplishing greater results than any lesser power.

In the direction of reform, therefore, the greatest results will be accomplished by the power of God.

"The power of God for the reformation of man is manifested in the gospel, and in that alone. The gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom. 1:16.

There is now a great call made for moral reform and the regeneration of society.

Yet those who are sounding this call and organizing movements for its accomplishment, do not propose to make use of this power of God which is by faith, but of another power—the ballot.

Why do they propose to use the ballot in the place of the power of God? Why do they pass by the greatest power in the universe and select a power which is infinitely inferior to it?
