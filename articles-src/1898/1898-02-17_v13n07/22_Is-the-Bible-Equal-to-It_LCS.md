Just now the preachers of this city are having a spasm of "higher criticism." They are jubilant over the so-called discoveries, and lament that they have been so simple-minded as to believe in the past, that the Bible is the very word of God, and that the Lord meant just what he said. Now, they say, we can treat the Bible as literature, and in their wisdom it is not safe for one not well versed in the languages to attempt to do much with the Bible.

Such language reminds one of what was said by the papists after Luther's triumph at Leipsic; they said in substance, We too accept the Scriptures, we even put them above Augustine and the Councils. But who can interpret them? Can peasants and women, or even merchants and nobles? The Bible, though inspired, is full of difficulties; there are contradictory texts. It is a sealed book except to the learned; only the church can reconcile its difficulties. We can accept nothing which is not endorsed by popes and councils. No matter how plain the Scriptures seem to be, on certain disputed points only the authority of the church can enlighten and instruct us. Moreover, since the Scriptures are to be interpreted only by priests, it is not a safe book for the people. We, the priests, will keep it out of their hands. They will get notions from it fatal to our authority; they will become fanatics; they will in their conceit defy us.

Then Luther rose, more powerful, more eloquent, more majestic than before; he rose superior to himself. What! said he; keep the light of life from the people? take away their guide to heaven; keep them in ignorance of what is most precious and most exalting? deprive them of the blessed consolations which sustain the soul in trial and in death? deny the most palpable truths because your dignitaries put on them a construction to bolster up their power? What an abomination! What peril to the souls of men!

Then Luther grasped that great idea of the Reformation, which was "The right of private judgment," or "Religious liberty." He said, Let the Scriptures be put into the hands of everybody; let every one interpret them for himself, according to the light he has from the guiding Spirit. Let spiritual liberty be revived, as in apostolic days. Then only will the people be emancipated from the middle ages, and arise in their power and majesty, obey the voice of enlightened conscience, and be true to their convictions. Then will they obey God rather than man, and defy all sorts of persecutions and martyrdom, having a serene faith in those blessed promises which the Gospel unfolds.

That same enemy of religious liberty is abroad again. Let us beware. Don't put the scholarship of men above the wisdom of God, for God has hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them unto babes. The doubts and denials of scriptural facts, by the so-called higher critics, have gotten men into the fog, and to-day men and women are skeptical as to the existence of God, the moral government of the world, the truth of Christianity, and the reality of the supernatural. Now the way out of this fog is by a living faith in the living Word of God. Give it a prayerful study. It has light yet to reveal for these times. It is equal to these times, for it is Spirit and life.
