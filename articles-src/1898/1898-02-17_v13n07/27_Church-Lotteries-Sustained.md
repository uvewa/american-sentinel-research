A decision recently given by Justice Neu, of the First Civil District Court, in this city, affirms that an article put up and disposed of at a church lottery, is the property of the winner, and cannot be confiscated by the State for violation of the law against lotteries.

Holy Trinity Church, of East New York, was in need of funds; so it was decided to hold a fair and bazaar after the usual fashion and raise the money. Between the pastor, the ladies, and the Y. M. C. A., the necessary arrangements were completed, and the fair was inaugurated. This was in last December.

The enterprise was a "grand success"; but one thing turned out unfortunately. A fine tapestry rug, with a picture painted on it representing a love scene, was raffled off, and was won by a saloon keeper. He might make use of the tapestry to ornament his saloon, so the church people realized, and of course this would never do.

So the saloon keeper was approached by one Mr. Miller, and a bargain made whereby the former parted with his tapestry for the sum of $5. But not long afterward the saloon keeper learned that his tapestry, by virtue of the painting upon it, was valued at $75; and then, as it is reported, he used "some powerful language," and going to Mr. Miller he offered the $5 and demanded the return of the tapestry. Mr. Miller declined; and now the decision of Justice Neu, into whose hands the matter came, awards the tapestry to the saloon keeper, who will display his trophy where he sees fit.

This is much to the disappointment of the church people; but they may console themselves with the reflection that the point of the rightful claim of the State to the possession of the article for violation of the anti-gambling law, which was raised by one of the attorneys, and would have been a heavy blow to church lotteries, was not sustained by the court.
