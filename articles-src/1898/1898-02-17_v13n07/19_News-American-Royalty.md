AMERICA has at last a real queen, with jeweled crown and scepter, and all the other appurtenances of royalty. A new royal dynasty has been launched into being, the head of which is to be known as "Queen of the Holland Dames of the New Netherlands." With much pomp and glitter, the coronation ceremonies were conducted on the evening of the 9th inst., in the grand ball room of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Miss Lavinia Van Westervelt Dempsey is the name which has hitherto designated the new monarch.

THE proceedings attending the coronation were very interesting, and were meant to be impressive. "Her Majesty" was seated upon a gilded throne, over which was a canopy of ermine. Upon the upholstery of the throne was embroidered the coat of arms of Holland. Surrounding the queen were Sir Knights and noble dames and ladies of honor, and numerous pages waited in attendance to bear the trains of the royal dresses. Some of the Sir Knights wore costumes said to be fac-similes of those worn in the time of William the Conqueror; and others were dressed to represent the court of Louis XVI. of France. One of the ladies of honor was dressed like Mary Queen of Scots, and displayed a veil and prayer book which she affirmed once belonged to the wife of Oliver Cromwell. As regards uniformity of style, the court costumes were a failure; but much allowance must be made for slight discrepancies in conducting such an undertaking as that of founding a royal dynasty upon American soil; besides, they all represented royalty, and that was the important point.

So now we have a real American royalty; and American heiresses need no longer be sent abroad to acquire a royal title; for in the natural order of things there must be in this new dynasty real American princes and princesses, dukes, marquises, counts and what not, and it will only remain for title-loving Americans with money to purchase their titles from the home market which will be available from this time forward. Of course, the highest order of "high society" in America will be the new royalty; and the "four hundred" must now step down into second place.

THERE is a serious significance in all this, however much one may be impressed with its absurdity. As a straw showing the direction of the wind, it joins with other things to show the existence and growth of a sentiment among wealthy and prominent Americans which is directly the opposite of that under the inspiration of which this republic was established. It is one of many indications that with the rise of the money power, there has arisen in this country a sentiment which is contrary to the Declaration of Independence and to the principles of free government, and which must be reckoned with as a dangerous foe of American liberty.
