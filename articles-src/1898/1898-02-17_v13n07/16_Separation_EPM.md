"BE ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?

"And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?

"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.

"And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."—2 Cor. 6:14–18.

Salvation is through separation unto Christ. The world with all its wisdom, philosophy, science, civilization and progress is a moral ruin, and if any are saved it must be by coming out of it.

Sin separates from God, and we can only get back to God by separating from sin. This began to be very distinctly taught in the calling of Abraham (Gen. 12), and was constantly taught in the ceremonials of the Mosaic dispensation. In general, this is the separation which Christ exemplified in his earthly life. We are to imitate him. We are in the world but not of the world, in its affections and desires, objects and aims, hopes and anticipations. By the world in this connection is meant the system of men and things most common around us, which is evil, under control of Satan the usurper, and opposed to God and his gospel. Gal. 1:4. This system has many departments—social, political, commercial, and religious, through which Satan works. This world is unchangeably evil, opposed to God, and bound over with its head to "the judgment of the Great Day." From this we must be separated or we cannot be saved. 2 Cor. 6:17, 18. All who are loyal to the Word and willing to study it may take the following lesson respecting—

1. We must be separated from the world's SOCIAL YOKE for fellowship with Christ. "Society" is hydriotic-cal, hollow-hearted, proud, carnal, godless, and increasingly immoral. All Christians should renounce its claims. The early Christians regarded its objects and aims, its conversation and amusements, its spirits and attire as utterly unchristian and they utterly renounced it. Indeed, the early Christians would not be admitted into modern "society," nor would they seek admission. No person can be truly loyal to Christ and at the same time to Mrs. Grundy. Her dominion is earthly, sensual, devilish. Her polished manners and esthetical sense are only the veneering and foil of the flesh. 1 John 2:15–17; James 4:4; 1 Tim. 2:9–10; 1 Peter 4:3–5. Of course this principle will keep Christians out of all brotherhoods, or call them out as soon as their eyes are opened, if they walk closely with God. Man-made societies naturally adopt a man-made and Christless religion.

2. We must be separated from the MARRIAGE YOKE with unbelievers in order to live in holy wedlock with our Heavenly Bridegroom. God's people from the outcalling of Abraham, have been forbidden to marry unbelievers. Such intermarriages brought in the antedeluvian apostasy. Gen. 6:2–5. Paul declares that Christians should marry only in the Lord. 1 Cor. 7:39. Yoke a sheep and a goat together, and the goat will usually lead the sheep. This is not God's way of saving souls. Lot's daughters, Ishmael, Samson, Ahab, Jereboam, and many others in Bible history were injured or ruined by these unholy alliances. The first blasphemer stoned was the son of an Egyptian, married to an Israelitish woman. Lev. 24. The rebellious Absalom was the son of a Pagan woman. Even Solomon was led astray and perhaps lost through alliance with outlandish women. Samson's parents expostulated with him against his marriage outside of Israel, Judges 14:3. Some one says, "Well, well, if you marry a child of the devil, you may expect to have trouble with your father in-law." Deut. 7:3–4; Josh. 23:12–13; Ezra 9:2; Rom. 8:5; Luke 16:18.

3. We should renounce the BUSINESS YOKE with unbelievers in order to be free to do our Master's business. In a business firm it is unsafe to commit yourself to the action of others who are unconverted. The ethics of the world and Christ are widely different. Deut. 22:10. We are to do all for the glory of God; they nothing. 1 Cor. 10:31. We do all in his name; they nothing. Col. 3:17. We are not to love money; they do. 1 Tim. 6:10. We are crucified unto the world and alive to Christ; they are alive to the world and dead to Christ. Gal. 2:20. Mark the results of such business alliances in 2nd Chronicles, 18th and 20th chapters; also in many examples of modern times.

4. We should renounce the POLITICAL YOKE imposed by bosses, and discharge first of all the duties of our heavenly citizenship. Satan, the usurper, offered the kingdoms of this world to Christ, for a bow. Matt. 4:9. Since the crown rights of our true covenant king have been and still are rejected by all nations during these times of the Gentiles, it is vain for us to expect to reign, rule and run the world. Our mission is to run people out of it for refuge in Christ. Heb. 6:18–20. In all countries we are pilgrims and strangers who refuse to be naturalized. Phil. 3:20.

> "We've no abiding city here;
> Then let us live as pilgrims do."
> (Col. 3:1–3; Heb. 11:13.)

We advocate the crown rights of an absent Prince and wait for a rejected dynasty to be restored. Titus 2:11–15. There is no "Christian State" on earth, and there never will be one until the Christ of God shall come to erect it and reign over it. The old prophets were indeed statesmen, under a theocracy, but the apostles were not, under Gentile rule. Good citizenship under the theocracy was very different from good citizenship under man's government. Ours is a pilgrim life like that of the father of the faithful and the friend of God. We have a higher citizenship and a loftier patriotism. No instructions are given us in the New Testament for Christians to work in politics or hold office during our Lord's rejection and these times of the Gentiles. We are ambassadors. Four duties only are enjoined:

1. Pay taxes. Matt. 17:24–27; Rom. 13:6.
2. Obey rulers. Rom. 13:1–7; Titus 3:1.
3. Honor rulers. 1 Peter 2:17; Jude 8.
4. Pray for rulers. 1 Tim. 2:1–3. Christ and the apostles instruct us in the duties of husband and wife, parents and children, elders and deacons, but not in those of the magistrate. If we have other duties to the state, it must be by inference only; there is no express command.

5. We must renounce the vain and formal RELIGIOUS YOKE of the world for the blessed and spiritual yoke of Christ. Matt. 11:28:30. The religiousness of worldly societies among us is no better before God than paganism. Nothing is farther from the religion of Christ. Two prominent characteristics of the present time are unprecedented and phenomenal:—the multiplication of societies and the production of ecclesiastical amusements for mixed saints and sinners. It is a fact to startle thought, that although these two devices are often carried on to help the church to reach the "masses," and attract them to the church, the masses are further away than before they were invented.

What then must we conclude concerning the wisdom and scriptural character of these methods?

Let us declare and testify with divine assurance, that if the great power of God should come upon us, it would annihilate both these devices.

"Ecclesiastical Amusements" would vanish like a delusive dream before the earnest work of rescuing lost souls, and these "societies" with their "amusement industry" would merge their spiritual individuality and energy in the promise and potency of the consolidated Church of God, the sacred Bride of Christ.

The Church of God, in its original constitution, was not a confederation of man-made and half-breed societies, with the clatter of machinery and the clamor of methods, but a compact and consolidated body. Eph. 4:15, 16.

Christ ordained no "auxiliaries" nor "annexes" for his church, and if she is faithful she needs none.

But the unfaithfulness of the church occasions their existence, and as some of these societies are doing good, though not in the best way, we cannot absolutely condemn them.

Indeed we work with some of them, and pray God's blessing upon them.

But what a pity that the church should need so much and such help, leading so largely to the "Amusement Heresy and Cooking-stove Apostasy."

We have contact but not fellowship with the world. We should have fellowship only with assemblies of persons who give evidence of being saved persons. 2 Tim. 3:1–5. The alliance in law of "Church and Society," with "Secular Trustees," is marriage with the world—"Pergamos." Godly deacons managed the property of the early church. In Rev. 17:3, the harlot rides on the beast, but in Cant. 8:5, the true Bride leans on the arm of her Beloved. All yokes with "associate members," or lobby members, are utterly unchristian. There was no fellowship between those inside and outside of the ark. They were absolutely and eternally separated, as the saved and the lost. No auxiliary pleasure yachts were provided to hover around the ark with "associate members." Keep out of mixed flocks of sheep and goats. The line of demarkation should be distinct. These alliances are efforts of the church to "plow with ox and ass," and the crop will be thorns and thistles for the burning.

In short, we are to be like Christ, Isa. 53:3, despised; Matt. 10:24, rejected; John 5:41, no position; John 18:36, strangers; Heb. 3:1–14, pilgrims; 2 Tim. 2:12, suffering; Titus 2:11–15, self-denying, sober, righteous, godly, watching, pure, peculiar, and unpopular. This is Christianity according to Christ, and the only gospel that saves.

In all ages the policy of conformity to the world has shorn the church of her strength, destroyed her usefulness in the world, and dishonored Christ. She has always been most powerful, honored and triumphant, when most separated and holy.

Then in the face of soft theology, pulpit blandishments, and all worldly policy, let us ring out the clarion call for complete separation from the world and complete consecration to Christ.

If all Christians would live like Christ they would soon turn the world upside down.
