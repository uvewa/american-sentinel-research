The earthly portion of God's kingdom was given to man. Ps. 115:16. He was to rule in the earth as God's representative. Gen. 1:26. It matters not, at this stage of our study, just how that rule was to be conducted. It is enough to know here, that God is love, and that all his acts are therefore performed in love. Man, having been created in God's image, could have conducted the government entrusted to him on no other principle than that of love. But this state of things was not destined to continue long. In an unguarded moment, earth's deputy governor was betrayed into the transference of his fealty from God to another, whose character was exactly opposite to that of Him in whose kingdom man was installed as a prominent factor.

This was a transference also of ruling power to the captor. Instead of being what God had made him, a free being, man was brought under the bondage of sin, and hence became an agent of Satan. 2 Peter 2:19. Hitherto he had been in condition to rule after God's pattern, but after having adopted Satan's methods, his system of government came to be in accord with his new master's will, and his own assimilated likeness of Satan's character.

But as shown by the diagram here reproduced, although God's original kingdom was thus dismembered by man's disloyalty, the traitor was not cast off by his former Master and Benefactor. True, God cannot receive a rebel into his favor, but he could land did provide a method by which every one who wills to do so, may again become members of his kingdom, though living in a territory and government hostile to the interests of the kingdom of God.

Let the upper horizontal line of the diagram represent the earth as first placed under man's dominion, but which fell under the rule of Satan, through his power over man. So long as Satan rules in the hearts of men, so long will that usurped territory be ruled under the suggestions of Satan. It will be useless for a few puny men to undertake to transfer back to God that of which Satan has gained possession. Human wisdom and might cannot possibly be equal to such a task. Only one—the Lord Jesus Christ—can do this, and the accomplishment of it will not be till he destroys him who has the power of death, that is, the devil. Heb. 2:14. Then, and not till then, will the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ. Rev. 11:15-18.

For this very reason, the Lord made provision to extend parallel with the history of earthly kingdoms, one by which man might show himself loyal to God and opposed to Satan. This arrangement is illustrated by the lower horizontal line of the diagram, springing from the original kingdom, at the fall of man, and being made to reach forward to the end, where it again merges into the earthly kingdom at its final cleansing from sin and the power of Satan.

This is the kingdom of God's grace. As the gospel of the kingdom is preached in Satan's territory, men may, by refusing to acknowledge Satan's reign, be counted as citizens of the kingdom of grace. God does not ask that any of those in the earthly kingdoms shall be forced into his rule of grace, but "whosoever will" may come, and freely partake of its favors. Whoever does so must, however, be also willing to have his citizenship a wholly heavenly one, in order to be true to his King who is in heaven (Phil. 3:20), and be satisfied to count himself a stranger in the earth; for God and mammon cannot possibly be served at one and the same time. Matt. 6:24. It is therefore folly to think of forcing by civil laws one of earth's subjects to accept a grace that he cares nothing for, since that grace can never be bestowed by the laws of man, but by the will of God alone. James 1:18.

When a few hundred years had passed of man's misrule under the direction of Satan, a flood came and swept away all earthly governments, leaving but eight persons who were righteous before God. Gen. 6:5-8; 7:1. Had Noah and his posterity preserved their integrity upon coming out of the ark, Satan's rule over mankind would have been broken forever, and the kingdom of God would have been the rule in the earth, as it was designed to be from the beginning.

But the power of evil again took possession of men's minds, until few regarded the kingdom of God's grace. There was one, however, whom God chose to have represent him and his kingdom in the earth. But in calling Abraham as his servant, God did not again destroy the kingdoms of men, as he had before done in selecting Noah to be his representative in the earth. He did, however, select a portion of territory in which to plant his kingdom, and called Abraham out from the Chaldean country, telling him to get away from all his relatives, and go into the chosen land which would be shown him. Gen. 12:1.

It will be noticed how careful God was to have Abraham removed from the molding influence of human minds as he took up the work assigned him. About to become the head of God's kingdom on earth, and the father of all the faithful, God would not permit even Terah, the father of the patriarch, to accompany him to the country of which he was to be the heavenly representative. The father of Abraham being of doubtful character (Josh. 24:2), he could not be permitted to have an influence in the government of that nation which was to be developed from the seed of Abraham, "the friend of God."

Notwithstanding these requirements of God, Abraham took his father with him, when he left Ur of the Chaldees. But his steps were turned aside from entering the promised land at once, and the whole company went to Haran where they remained until Terah's death. Gen. 11:31,32. This bar to the proper beginning of the kingdom being removed, Abraham received command to proceed to the country for which he had started some years previous. Gen. 12:4. Lot went along, however, and caused much anxiety to his uncle, until, through a quarrel between the herdsmen of the two men, the younger decided to separate from his uncle, and settle in the plains of Jordan, among a people more to his own liking. Gen. 13:5-11.

When this came about, and the last relative of Abraham was separated from him, then the Lord spoke to him, saying, "Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it, and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee." Verses 14–17.

There is more in this promise than one sees at the first glance. God had actually promised to the representative of his kingdom in the earth, territory claimed by another. Satan had conquered its first deputy-governor, and held it by right of conquest. He now saw that God intended to take it from him again and give it as a prize to those who would renounce the power of evil, and so restore all the component parts of the original kingdom. Here was another opportunity to charge God with arbitrariness. Was not the earthly territory his, fairly won from man, whose dominion it had once been? What right had God to bestow by promise upon Abraham and his seed that which he himself claimed the privilege of giving to whomsoever he would? Luke 4:6.

From this time forward we may look for a fierce contest to be waged by Satan against the seed of Abraham, lest the promise of God shall be fulfilled to them, and the territory pass from under his control. Having command of the powers of earth, we may expect him to marshal their governments, at every step of the way, to oppose the growth of Abraham's seed, and so prevent them from possessing the domain which he considers his lawful prey. Just when he began that work, and how he has since carried it on, are points to be reserved for another paper.
