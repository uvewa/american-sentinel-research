IF the nations of Europe and the United States should accept the czar's proposition for disarmament, and retain only one soldier for each 1,000 citizens, which is the proportion advised by General Miles, the armies of the respective countries would be: Russia, 125,000 men; Germany, 50,000; France and Austria, each, 40,000; and the United States, 70,000.
