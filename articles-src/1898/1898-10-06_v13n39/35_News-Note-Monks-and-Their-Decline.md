A Catholic priest of Buffalo recently distinguished himself creditably by writing a book attacking the practice of some Dominican monks in Pennsylvania who were running a brewery in connection with their monastery; the book being entitled, "Monks and Their Decline." Now the papal authorities have placed his work upon the "Index" of prescribed books.
