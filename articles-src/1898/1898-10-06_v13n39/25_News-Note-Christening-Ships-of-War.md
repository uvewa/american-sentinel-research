SPEAKING of the custom of "christening" ships of war," which is to be observed at the launching of a new United States battleship, the Independent says:—

"We think the ceremony with either [wine or water] to be a blasphemous travesty on a holy sacrament. Baptism is for human beings. As well baptize a penknife or an inkstand or a bell or a shop or a church as a ship, and last of all a ship of war."

And this is very true; but there is as much sense in the idea that a ship of war ought to be baptized as in the idea that such a ship is an instrument of Christianity. When a ship of war has been duly baptized, if she was not launched on Sunday or in any part constructed on that day, she is by many regarded as a sort of Christian institution, whose work of death and destruction is not in violation of the moral code.
