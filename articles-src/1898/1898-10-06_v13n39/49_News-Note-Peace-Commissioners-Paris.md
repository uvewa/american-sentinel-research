There is not much prospect, it seems, of a speedy understanding between the Spanish and American commissioners who have met in Paris to arrange terms of peace. Spain wants the United States to retain only a coaling station in the Philippines, allowing Spain to dispose of the islands as she sees fit, and to assent that Cuba shall bear the Cuban debt. These propositions are regarded in this country as being preposterous, and it is asserted that the United States will insist on retaining the island of Luzon, in the Philippines, and will forbid the sale of other islands of the group to any European power. Also that this Government will refuse to be responsible in any way for a single penny of the Cuban debt, or to allow the debt to be put upon the Cubans.
