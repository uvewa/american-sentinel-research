In Georgia, recently, says the Pittsburg Catholic, a lower court decided that marriages contracted on Sunday were illegal and void, Sunday being in that State a dies non. The case was appealed, and the Supreme Court reversed the verdict, on the ground that Sunday laws regulate only "ordinary employment," and hence did not apply to a marriage ceremony.
