A READER of the Outlook, edited by Dr. Lyman Abbott, having applied to the latter for an explanation of the statement in Num. 22:28, that Balaam's ass spoke certain words to Balaam, received this answer:—

"The story on its face relates the strange experience of a heathen soothsayer, and may be wholly legendary. Or it may have a basis of fact, since dumb animals often speak to us in their dumb way, and we understand them as well as if they had uttered human speech. If the ass spoke at all, she certainly spoke ass fashion. St. Peter's authority used to be invoked for the belief that she used human speech (2 Pet. 2:16). But scholars generally agree that that epistle is an anonymous work of the post-apostolic age."

This is "interpreting" Scripture; that is, it is making the Scripture mean something different from what it says. It is only upon the theory that the Scripture does not mean what it says that the idea rests that it needs to be interpreted. And this idea having been handed down by tradition to the religious world of to-day, the people think it necessary to seek to some one in a position of "authority" to find out what the Scripture means. This is one of the greatest and most dangerous delusions of the times.

The Scripture is the Word of God to man. And whoever will allow that God had the ability to say what he meant to say, and the honesty to mean what he said, and then will observe the common-sense rule of going to the author of a statement to inquire its meaning if any doubt exists, instead of to some one else, will have no trouble about an understanding of the Word of God.

It is almost needless to add that such treatment of the Word of God as is given it in this instance, by one who claims to be a Christian teacher, only strengthens the hands of those who rail at Christianity and make sport of its adherents. Any person who believes that the Bible is a compilation of legends, or of "anonymous works," or in any other way is not what it claims to be, or that it does not mean what it says, can be consistent and honest only by openly joining the ranks of those who repudiate it altogether. There is no middle ground between faith and unbelief.
