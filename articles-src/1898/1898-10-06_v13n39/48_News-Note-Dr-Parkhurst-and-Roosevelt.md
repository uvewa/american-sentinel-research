Dr. Parkhurst, the reformer, is much disappointed in Colonel Roosevelt, because the latter has gone over to "boss" Platt. Mr. Platt's career, he says, has been one of deliberate treason to the best interests of this city, of the State, and of the country; and now that his trusted friend in reform has joined with the "boss," he will not support him for governor and has no more use for him. Dr. Parkhurst's dream about purifying politics is rudely dissipated; but what else had he a right to expect? The sooner Dr. Parkhurst and the other preacher politicians find out that they are not "in it" with the "boss" and the political machine, and cease to try to promote morality by manipulating politics, the fewer disappointments they will meet and the better it will be for society.
