THE Republican candidate for governor of the State of New York, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, is a man distinguished among men for a sturdy independence of character, and seemingly was as likely an individual as could be found to administer the duties of political office without being subservient to the "machine" or any political boss. It was predicted that he would be a genuine "rough rider" for the machine, which was what the good people of the State desired to see; but it is found that the Republican boss of the State puts up Mr. Roosevelt as his candidate, controlling the political machinery of the State the same as he has done in times past. The "machine" runs as smoothly with Mr. Roosevelt on it as it ever did. Mr. Crooker, on the other hand, has the Democratic machine as thoroughly under his control, and set up his candidate with only a nominal show of opposition. And this is politics as it is to-day—simply a huge circus in which two leading bosses run their respective machines against each other for political supremacy, with a few side-shows accompanying in the shape of "independent" tickets.
