THE Turkish authorities do not look favorably upon the "Zionist" movement, which aims at peopling the land of Palestine with a sufficient number of Jews to convert the country into a Jewish state. The Sultan does not believe in having a Jewish state established in his dominions. Jewish authorities in the United States are nearly unanimous in opposition to the scheme.
