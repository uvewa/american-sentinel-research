RECENTLY a Polish priest of Chicago, Father Kozlowski, was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Chicago, the excommunication being no mild affair, but one which consigned the "father" to eternal damnation and forbade "the faithful under grave penalty," "to have any intercourse or communion with him." This of course established a boycott against the victim of papal wrath, and thus it became a matter within the jurisdiction of the civil courts. Father Kozlowski accordingly has brought a suit for damages against the archbishop, and has precedent established in a similar case in Massachusetts for expecting a verdict in his favor. As the Independent says, "A penalty which forbids a man to be spoken to, or any business done with him, and whose purpose is to make him an outlaw and starve him, is in tolerable in this generation."
