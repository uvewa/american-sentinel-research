If religion cannot support its own agencies and teach its own doctrines without the aid of the state, let it be cut down, for it alone cumbersome the ground. Faith without works is a stinking carcass; let it, for God's sake and man's, be buried.

It is because I value the Holy Scriptures so highly, because I regard religious instruction as such an important and sacred duty, it is because I love the state, and Christianity more, that I plead that the church make herself responsible for all religious ministration, and that the state mind its own business, which is certainly not that of universal provider of religion for the community. Rev. J. W. Roberts (Presbyterian, Australia).
