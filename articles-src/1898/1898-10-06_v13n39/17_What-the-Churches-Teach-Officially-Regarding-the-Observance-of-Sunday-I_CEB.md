**BY CHARLES E. BUELL.**

There are two distinct classes of religionists that seek for the distinction of being considered the exponents of the teachings of Jesus, the Messiah. These will be spoken of as State churches,—those which are joined to civil governments; and Evangelical churches,—those which are not united to the civil power.

The State churches comprise the Roman Catholic Church, the Imperial Russian Orthodox Church, the Church of England, the State Church of Prussia, the Greek Orthodox Church, and the Government churches of Switzerland.

The teaching of the Roman Catholic Church regarding the observance of Sunday instead of the Sabbath day, is given in the recently published catechism, entitled "A Catechism of Christian Doctrine, prepared and enjoined by the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore," 1890. On page 62 it is stated:—

"Q. Why does the church command us to keep holy the Sunday instead of the Sabbath?

"A. The church commands us to keep holy the Sunday instead of the Sabbath, because on Sunday Christ rose from the dead, and on Sunday he sent the Holy Ghost upon the apostles."

The Catechism of the Church of England, as used by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, reads very similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church:—

"Q. Why was Sunday made the great day for Christian rest and worship?

"A. Because the resurrection of Christ took place on the first day of the week."

Then follows the reference to the day of Pentecost.

The Pentecost was regarded as a supplement to the Passover, and followed the Paschal Sabbath in seven weeks and one day thereafter. In the opinion of leading scholars among the Protestants the Roman Catholic catechism is at fault in its statement that "on the Sunday Christ sent the Holy Ghost upon the apostles."

The late Horatio B. Hackett, D.D., Professor of Biblical literature at Newton Theological Institute, etc., a scholar that was well and favorably known, remarks: "It is generally supposed that this Pentecost, signalized by the outpouring of the Spirit, fell on the Jewish Sabbath, our Saturday."—Commentary on the original Text of Acts, pp. 50, 51.

In the work by Hobbs, entitled "The Day of Pentecost," it is stated: "Saturday the 27th of May, A. D. 30, was the fiftieth day after the Paschal Sabbath."

This means that the resurrection and the Pentecost cannot have both occurred on Sunday.

The Roman Catholic Church makes no attempt to justify the change to Sunday upon anything that is taught in the Scriptures, the brief teaching in this catechism to the contrary notwithstanding.

In a publication entitled, "A Doctrinal Catechism," by Stephen Kenan, approved by the late Cardinal McClosky, New York, 1875, p. 174, he says:—

"Had she [the church] not such power she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day of the week, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority."

Cardinal Gibbons, in his work, "The faith of Our Fathers," p. 111, says:—

"You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday."

In the first place, if it is true that the Roman Catholic Church originated the observance of Sunday, as claimed, then it was not the custom to observe the day prior to the organization of that church. And, if it is true, as stated by these eminent prelates, that there is no Scriptural authority for observing this day, then its observance does not revert to the resurrection of Jesus, or to anything Scriptural.

In the Catholic Mirror, the organ of Cardinal Gibbons, there appeared a series of articles beginning Sept. 2, 1893, in which Sunday is given the title of "The Christian Sabbath," and there follows in heavy lines, "The Genuine Offspring of the Union of the Holy Ghost and the Catholic Church, His Spouse."

In this interesting series of articles this paper jeers the Protestant pulpits which ring with loud and impassioned invectives against violating Sunday sacredness, and declares that "the claims of Protestants to any part in the Christian Sabbath are proved to be groundless, self-contradictory, and suicidal."

If there was a sacredness clinging to Sunday that was due to Scriptural teaching, there would be no ground for insisting that the Protestant world have no claim to a part therein; but if however, the institution of Sunday observance is a man-made one, there might be a foundation for the assertion that the claims of the Protestants to a part therein are groundless.

The fact also that the decrees of monarchs, centuries ago, commanding the observance of the first day of the week instead of the Sabbath designated in the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, did not make any mention of the resurrection, or refer to the Christian belief, and that these decrees were met by petitions from the members of the early Christian congregations asking exemptions from the decrees and the restoring to them of the Bible Sabbath, refutes the idea that the observance of Sunday is on a Scriptural foundation.
