The study of the history of any country is apt to consist quite largely of the study of the lives of its leading men. This is especially true of French history, for the people having been so long ruled by a king, the principles of loyalty were a part of their very nature, so that as the lives of the people were so closely blended with that of their king, the life story of the latter would be almost the history of the former.

"Of what king were we speaking last?" asked Professor Carman, adjusting his glasses with a kindly smile, and glancing over his little group to see that there were none absent.

"Of Henry II., said Max Smith, promptly, 'I remembered, 'cause I have an uncle Henry.'"

"What was his father's name?"

"Francis I., King of the Gentlemen," said Julia March, with a hasty glance at her note book.

"Yes; and Henry would have done much better if he had heeded his dying father's advice. He begged his young son to do all in his power to make it easier for the poor people by lessening the taxes. Then there was a man in banishment, named Montmorenci, and the king being fearful of his influence in the kingdom asked his son that he be not recalled to the country. He also regarded the family of Guise as a continual menace to the kingdom, and he advised Henry to look out for him."

"I should really think he would pay a little attention to his dying father's requests," said Milly Brown.

"Well, but he did not; as soon as he became king, he hastened to do the very things which his father begged him not to do. At this time, the heavy tax on salt, the gabelle tax—Philip of Valois first imposed this—was so severe a burden to the poor that they rebelled against it. So the banished Montmorenci was recalled to France, and given the task of quelling the uprising, which he at once proceeded to do in a cruel manner. Then, also, the Guise family, already claiming too much power, were encouraged and favored in every way."

"Was the Duke of Guise a good man?" asked Julia March.

"I think he was quite too fond of power, Julia, to have been a good man, but he was certainly at this time a very popular man in France. Directly after he was made lieutenant-general, he took the strongly fortified city of Calais, which had been in English possession for two centuries, in only eight days."

"This must have provoked the English a trifle," commented practical Jack.

"It did; and the English Queen Mary felt so badly at the French victory that she said that the word 'Calais' would be found written on her heart when she died."

"Of course the duke must have been a great favorite after such a victory," said Max Smith.

"Certainly; and then his niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, married King Henry's son—the young dauphin, about the same time, which added still more to the duke's fame.

"By this time, Charles V., Emperor of Germany and King of Spain, was dead, and his son Philip II., took his place. Philip's wife was the Queen of England, and as the English were so sore over the loss of Calais, he knew that he would get no help from them against his old enemy, the King of France; so, like silly children, quarreling one minute and kissing the next, the two kings of France and Spain decided to cement a compact of peace which they had entered into, by a wedding. By this time Philip's English queen-wife had died, and he proposed to marry Henry's daughter, Elizabeth."

"Well, I declare!" exclaimed Milly Brown. "His old enemy is his new father-in-law! I hope they had peace in the family after that."

"The fact is, Milly, the father-in-law did'nt live long enough to quarrel with his son-in-law after the wedding. He was killed by a splinter entering his eye as he was riding in a grand tournament."

"Poor fellow! I wonder how many true mourners he had," said Julia March.

"Not many, Julia, not many," sighed her teacher. He had added his name to the obnoxious list of French kings whose chief object seems to have been to increase the misery of this poor people by unjust taxes and cruel oppression. He died in the year 1559.

"At the time of his death there were two great parties in France—the Protestant Reformers, who now began to be called Huguenots, and the Catholics. The leader of the former was the King of Navarre, named Antony de Bourbon, and of the latter, the Duke of Guise. We have not mentioned much lately about the progress of the Reformation, but you see it was not dying out, although persecutions and horrors had continually blocked its onward march. The most dreadful tortures were in vogue in the reign of Henry's father, and things were in no better shape now. The poor Protestants were suspended in the air and slow fires built under them, and they were left to slowly roast to death. You see when Spain and France made their treaty of peace, an article was added—the work of two cardinals—which was kept a secret from the people, to the effect that France and Spain were to work unitedly in the work of exterminating the hated Protestants. These poor hunted people at last rose in their anger and became a political as well as a religious people. Of course this led to a horrible civil war."

"I don't think the country could have been in a very nice condition when the next king took the throne," commented Harry Ray.

"No, indeed; when poor Francis II., son of Henry II., took the reins, he was indeed to be pitied. It must not be expected that a feeble youth of sixteen would do better than his predecessors. He was simply king in name; for he did exactly what his advisers asked him to do—persecute the Huguenots to their death."

"Do you think it exactly right for the Protestants t₀ have added politics to their religion, and to have gone to war?" asked practical Jack.

"What do you think about it, Joseph?" asked his teacher. Joe Palmeter's eyes grew very bright, and his cheek flushed, as he answered earnestly:—

"Christ said, 'I say unto you that ye resist not evil.'"

"But I tell you, Joe Palmeter," said Bert Mathews, "it isn't so easy to be tortured and burned and hunted—and everything—I guess you'd want to pay them back; I would."

"But," replied the teacher, "the Master says, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay."

"At last," continued Professor Carman, "the weak king passed a law that the churches belonging to the opposite faith should be destroyed. Then they formed a committee whose special business it was to condemn heretics to be burned, and the place where they met was called 'The burning chamber.'"

"It hardly seems possible that this took place only a little more than 300 years ago," said Julia March, shuddering.

"True, Julia, but it was only the same spirit which in our own day rejoices in the imprisonment of honest men, simply on account of religious differences,—and it is the spirit of the enemy of all righteousness," replied the teacher.
