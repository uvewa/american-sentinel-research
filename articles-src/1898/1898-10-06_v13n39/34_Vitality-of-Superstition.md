It is a fact of which there is abundant proof that the "light of the nineteenth century" has had little or no effect in destroying the germ—so to speak—of popular superstitions. Superstition in its various forms flourishes to-day to a greater extent, probably, than at any time since the Dark Ages. In an article by Daniel G. Brinton, in the September Century, on "Popular Superstitions in Europe," the author says:—

"From some strange reason, there has been a wonderful revival within the last decade of nearly every medieval superstition, under various guises, in the most enlightened centers of the world. Palmistry, astrology, sympathetic magic, the doctrine of signatures, hierotherapeutics, and all the farrago of fifteenth-century thaumaturgy, flourish to day in Boston and New York, in Paris and Chicago, to a degree surpassing anything known three centuries ago."

But the reason for this revival is not so strange as the writer assumes. For superstition is essentially a religious manifestation, and wanes only where religious light increases. And religious light is not increasing, because Christian truth is shunned by the carnal mind.
