A LOWELL, Mass., journal of recent date, mentions the arrest of four citizens of that place for playing cards "on the Lord's day." The complaint drawn up against them specified as follows:—

"That on the Lord's day you did severally take part in a certain game, to wit, a game of cards, the name of said game being to your complainant unknown, then and there played on the said Lord's day, the same not being then and there a concert of sacred music or an entertainment given by a religious or charitable society, the proceeds of which, if any, are to be devoted exclusively to a charitable or religious purpose."

Does the court in this case know that the day on which the offense was committed—Sunday—is the Lord's day? Is it a judge itself of religious questions? No; it does not claim to be, but on this point it takes the word of the church. But what right has it to take the word of the church? By its own rules of evidence, it is bound to investigate the alleged fact itself, and take cognizance of it as a fact, if it exists; and not take the word of some other party for it. That is only "hearsay evidence." The court might just as well take the statement of some person that the accused parties are guilty, as being a fact, without investigating the charge itself, as to accept as a fact the church's assertion that a certain day is the "Lord's day," without which the case against the accused persons would have fallen to the ground.

We would not defend card-playing; but prosecutions for gambling should rest upon some other ground than that of "profaning the Lord's day."
