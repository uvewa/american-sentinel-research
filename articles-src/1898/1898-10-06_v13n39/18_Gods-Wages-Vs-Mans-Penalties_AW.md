BY ALBERT WRIGHT.

"The wages of sin is death." That is the only penalty that the all-wise and merciful Ruler of the heaven and earth knows how to meet sin with. And if any government legislates against sin, its use of any less penalty than death is sheer folly.

But all the individuals of which any human government is composed are sinners. And sins being worthy of death, the only thing that can logically come of an attempt of human government to cope with sin, is self-destruction.

The only legitimate province of human law is protection from crime—not recompense for sin. "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." And any human power whatsoever, that undertakes this work, is but a manifestation of "that man of sin, . . . who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.

God's vengeance is as different from man's as love is from hatred. When one has earned wages he usually receives them willingly. And the hardened sinner, who has rendered himself incapable of repentance, will welcome destruction to escape the presence of that glorious character against whom his mind is enmity and his life rebellion. The quietude of oblivion will be as much better for him than an eternity of his own devices, as the happy estate of the righteous is better than their perilous yet peaceful pilgrimage of earth.

But why should Satan deceive us, that we should walk the hard way of the transgressor to his dreadful goal, when the price has been paid to make us sons of God? Why not accept now the peaceful life of Christ, which even amid the fiercest persecutions is as much better than our own, as eternal life is better than destruction.
