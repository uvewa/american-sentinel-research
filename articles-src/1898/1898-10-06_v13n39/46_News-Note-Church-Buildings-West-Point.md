Taking advantage of the permission given to erect church buildings on the Government grounds at West Point, the Roman Catholics have applied for and received their permit from the Secretary of War, and will begin work at once toward the erection of a substantial church; and now the Campbellite and Methodist churches are preparing to follow suit. In time, if the Secretary of War is as fair with one denomination as with another, the traveler coming in sight of this military reservation may think he is coming into a collection of churches.
