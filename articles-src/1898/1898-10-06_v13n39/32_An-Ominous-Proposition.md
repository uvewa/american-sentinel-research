THE doctrine of American imperialism does not need a season's growth to begin bearing fruit. The idea is now suggested that as we will have need for a large army of trained soldiers, the public schools should be utilized to give military instruction and drill to the young boys of the land, which would fit them to become trained soldiers in a short time when a large army might be needed. On this point a New York daily prints the following, under the heading, "Schools as Nurseries of Soldiers":—

"Our experience in the late war has shown the need for military training in this country in time of peace—not for a vast standing army on the European scale, but for such instruction as shall create a foundation on which, in case of need, an effective force may be built.

"What better agency can we find for this work than the public schools? The millions of pupils now under instruction there are already subject to discipline. They are at an impressionable age. It would be a simple matter to give them a military training that would enable the Government, in case of need, to call upon any number of effective soldiers, as useful on their first day of active service as raw volunteers would be after three months' licking into shape.

"Those pupils who displayed a special aptitude for military life could enter West Point, which could be made a great university for the higher instruction of the martial elite of the nation. It would furnish all the skilled officers we should need in time of war, while at other times those graduates not needed in the peace establishment would be well fitted to succeed in civil life.

"The military training now given in a number of colleges and universities is a good beginning, but we need something more. Let us rest our system of defense on the hard foundation of the public schools."

When the nation starts out on the road which has been traveled by the nations of Europe, it can only be expected that it will ere long experience the conditions under which those nations are sinking to day.
