SOMEONE has made an estimate of the religious vote in the United States, based on the election returns for 1896. It gives these figures:—

Protestant vote, 2,877,816; Roman Catholic vote, 1,245,892; leaving a secular vote of 12,816,703. This—which is at least approximately correct—shows that the United States is preeminently a secular nation; yet there are some people who think that terrible differences would appear—that, in short, the country would go to rack and ruin—if it were not for the Christian vote!
