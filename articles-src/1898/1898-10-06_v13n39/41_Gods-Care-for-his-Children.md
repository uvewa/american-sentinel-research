[The following incident which is narrated in the Youth's Companion, ought to be very instructive to people who think that Christian missionaries are dependent for protection upon the power of the state.]

THE incident of St. Paul and the viper, and the stories of Zinzendorf and Brainerd and their serpent visitors, are read by every one with a thrill of interest always felt where a human life is at stake. We can imagine the effect upon those who were eyewitnesses of the facts, and saw these men escape without a wound.

Near the middle of the last century David Brainerd left his mission among the Indians at Stockbridge, Mass., and travelled southward to the "forks of the Delaware." He had heard of a savage tribe in the heart of the New Jersey forests, and yearned to bring them under Christian influences.

With his pocket-Bible, his tent cloth and a few simple utensils for preparing his food strapped in a bundle on his back, he pushed on through the wilderness till he found himself in the neighborhood of the Indian village. He was tired, and mounting his shelter-tent on sticks, he camped under the trees to rest and fortify himself for the new undertaking that lay before him. What peril was near him from savage hands he could not know, and like his Master in "a solitary place apart," he talked with Heaven until he felt refreshed and strong.

When he finally reached their wigwams, he was an astonished man. His faith and hope had made him bold, but he little expected when he faced the enemies of his race that a "whole village" would come out to meet him as if he had been a long-looked-for friend. Led by their chief, the Indians welcomed him as their guest, and seemed almost to reverence him as a prophet. He stayed among them and preached, winning the hearts and the faith of the untutored natives, until he gathered a church of between seventy and eighty Christian Indians.

Brainerd never knew, until they told him, the secret of his welcome. The savages had discovered the white stranger in the woods, and a party of them had waited to steal upon him and kill him as soon as he entered his tent. Peering between the folds of the canvas, they saw him on his knees, praying.

Ignorant wonder held them back, and their wonder turned to awe when they saw a rattlesnake crawl over the stranger's feet and pause beside him, with its head raised as if to strike; but it only gazed at him a moment, flickered its red tongue, and glided out of the tent on the opposite side. The Indians hurried back and reported that the white man was under the protection of the Great Spirit.

However much the superstition of these "children of nature" influenced their thought, they told a Christian truth in pagan version. It is certain that

> "Man is immortal till his work is done,"

and God had work for Brainerd to do.
