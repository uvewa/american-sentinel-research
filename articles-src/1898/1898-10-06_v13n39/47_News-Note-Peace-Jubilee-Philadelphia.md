In Philadelphia preparations are being made to celebrate this month a "Peace Jubilee," in commemoration of the cessation of hostilities with Spain. President McKinley has promised to be present. We trust the expectations which underlie this celebration will not be disappointed. It would be well if the people would realize, however, that internal peace—peace between the classes of society—means far more to the country than international peace. The conflict at Pana, Ill., is of more serious import to this country than was any battle of the war with Spain.
