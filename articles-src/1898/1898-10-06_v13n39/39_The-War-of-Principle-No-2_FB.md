"If I mistake not," said Aleck, "the god of this world is Mars. His name and his nature is war. The children of disobedience are his children, and unless they are regenerated they are the children of the devil, and the lusts of their father they will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, said Christ. This proves the god of this world a god of war. Christ came to make men peacemakers by imparting to them the peace nature."

"Then how is it, Aleck," said Cecil, "that he says, 'I came not to send peace on the earth but a sword.' Does he not then make himself responsible for war?"

"His sword is his Word. The weapons of our warfare are not carnal. His Word brings on the war, not because there is war in his Word, but because it carries with it the divine nature, and those who are born of this incorruptible seed are the objects of Satan's hate and of the world's. The war comes not from the peace-making side. It is as if a lamb suddenly fell into a den of wolves. You know where the attack comes from?"

"No, no, Aleck; Christianity did not simply walk about as a blameless lamb in the midst of wolves; but it was aggressive. History gives us proof of a positive character. Not speaking of the crusades, remember how the early disciples entered homes, and broke up the unity of the family, went into communities, and disturbed the social equilibrium. Why did not the Christians let the wolves alone in their happy dens?"

"Happy! Do you call the world happy at the time when the gates of Janus were closed? Slavery, poverty, crime, infamy, misery, and ignorance were everywhere. It was pity for man's lost condition that led Christ and his followers to the agression you deplore. They went not with carnal weapons. Their armory was love. Wherever they went blessing and light followed. The despairing began to hope, the faithless rejoiced, and though they were cast out, persecuted, and ostracized, they counted their afflictions light."

"After all I can't see why this aggression had to be brought in when the temple of Janus was closed. If your reformers had given the world time, given them education, and such arts as come with peace, this separation among men need not have been."

"Ah, Cecil, these men were not reformers. They came offering a new life to men, a new lineage, a new country. Paul was once of your opinion, and consented to the death of Stephen. He went everywhere haling men and women to prison. He was enraged at the aggression of the Christians, whose doctrines did break up families and disturb society; but when he himself saw the heavenly vision, when he looked on the Lamb of God, he became more aggressive than any of them. He no longer held the traditions of the fathers in such reverence; but counted everything loss save Jesus Christ.

"Athens was then in the enjoyment of peace. The culture, the arts, the polity that this world gives in its most favorable times, was there. Surely if there was a spot on earth to be left in quietness it was Athens. But underneath all the quiet, aesthetic exterior, throbbed the unsatisfied heart of humanity. Paul felt it. Looking round the Pantheon crowded with the images of their gods, he sees their dumb anguish. Vainly they have striven to portray the true God. Suddenly he comes to an altar reared to 'The unknown God.' Here was a challenge. Could he go away filled with their longing, having a knowledge of that unknown God, and be just—to himself, to them, or his God? O, no, Cecil, you can see that this called for an avowal of the truth, and he said to them, 'Whom ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.'

"Had you left the world to its Janus-closed gates, you would have left it to a mere mask of peace, while beneath, the heart of humanity would have groaned for God. It is this pathetic pleading of the heart that so moves all the resources of infinite love. There are thousands to-day who are ignorantly worshiping the unknown God. Shall those who know him refuse to declare him, because it will make a division in some family whose Janus-gates seem closed? Ah, Cecil, the peace that exists there is as superficial as it was at Rome."

"At any rate it is smothered and covered. But when persons are converted, they seem all out of joint with other folks."

"Yes. 'Ye are not of the world, even as I am not of the world,' said Christ. Certainly they join themselves to a spiritual kingdom, and are no longer citizens of this world."

"That is just what I object to," said Cecil. "Whenever you begin to preach what you call 'distinctive principles,' you break into the peace of society, and I can not help looking upon you as disturbers. I sympathize with the men who said, 'These men who turn the world upside down are come hither also.'"

"Well, Cecil, I hope you may also realize that these men who have turned the world upside down, seeming out of joint with its ways, have also been the salt of the earth, the preservers of society, the salvation of the faithful."

"Very well, Aleck, I hope I shall see the truth."

F. B.
