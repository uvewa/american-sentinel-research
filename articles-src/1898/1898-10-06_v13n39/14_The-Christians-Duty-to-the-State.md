*Rev. Alex. Sutherland, Toronto, Ont.*

In the days of primitive Christianity the rule was to render to Caesar all honor and obedience that did not conflict with fidelity to Christ and his law, but now the rule seems to be to render to Christ all honor and obedience that does not interfere with loyalty to party, and this is justified under the plea of patriotism, and by some is even called Christian patriotism.

The term is a misnomer. Christian patriotism seeks first the kingdom of God and his righteousness; mere patriotism seeks first the kingdom of this world and its advancement.

We teach our children to love their country and hate all others. Christ taught his followers to love the whole world and to hate no one. We teach the political brotherhood of a common nationality. Christ taught the true brotherhood of man.

The Christian's duty to the state is to uphold the authority of rulers in all lawful and just things; to obey every law that can be obeyed with a good conscience toward God, but to oppose steadily and resolutely whatever conflicts with the principle of the kingdom of God, and to this end he must keep himself free from party domination and from all entangling alliances.

That the kingdom of God, as such, should form no alliance with the kingdoms of the world is an affirmation having all the force of an axiom. The sphere and positions of the two kingdoms are so entirely distinct that they cannot be merged or even allied without irreparable damage to the heavenly kingdom.
