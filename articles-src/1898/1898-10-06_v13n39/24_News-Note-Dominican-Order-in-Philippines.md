THE Dominican Order in the Philippine Islands is getting a taste of the irony of fate. It is obliged to look for protection to the United States Government. If the people of the islands, who are Catholics, are left in possession of the country, they will confiscate every peso of Dominican property, and hence this Catholic order is obliged to look for protection to a nation predominantly Protestant. That speaks well for Protestantism, but ill for Catholicism.
