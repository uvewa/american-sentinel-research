A warning voice against the peril of imperialism was raised by Bishop Potter, of the Protestant Episcopal Church, at the annual convention of the diocese of New York, held in this city September 28. His words may be profitably read and pondered by thinking Americans:

> "The nation has had too much during the past few months to blind and intoxicate it. It has won an easy victory over an effete and decrepit adversary, in which no splendors of individual heroism nor triumphs of naval skill—and in these we may indulge a just pride—ought to blind our eyes to the fact that we have had a very easy task against a very feeble foe. And now, with unexpected fruits of victory in our hands, what, men are asking, are we going to do with them?

> "Nay, rather, the solemn question is, What are they going to do with us? Upon what wild course of so-called imperialism are they going to launch a people, many of whom are dizzy already with the dream of colonial gains and who expect to repeat in distant islands some such history as our conquered enemy wrote long ago in blood and plunder in her colonies here and in South America. We have, indeed, our Congress to direct this race for empire, and our gaunt and physically wrecked sons and brothers by tens of thousands at home to show us how they will do it!

> "At such a time, as never before, the Church of God is called upon, in the pulpit and by every agency at her command, to speak the words of truth and soberness and to reason of righteousness, temperance and a judgment to come—a judgment for nations as well as individuals, till impetuosity is sobered and chastened, and until a people in peril of being wrecked upon an untried sea can be made to pause and think. The things that this community and this nation alike supremely need are not more territory, more avenues of trade, more places for place hunters, more pensions for idlers, more subject races to prey upon, but a dawning consciousness of what, in individual and in national life, are a people's indispensable moral foundations, those great spiritual forces on which alone men or nations are built!

> "Most opportune is it, I think, that in the ear of a nation already dizzy with the dream of what it may achieve by conquests through the force of arms, there should sound that strong, temperate, and most cogently reasoned message which rings through the ukase of the Emperor of Russia. It is an unanswerable indictment of the enormous folly and essential madness of the international race for increased armaments—ships and forts and men, piled up in ever greatening proportions, until at last, the utmost limit of a nation's resources in men and money has been reached, the last man has been dragged from his family, the last shekel has been borrowed from reluctant creditors and the empire, or the republic, makes its wild plunge, at length, into irredeemable bankruptcy.

> "And this is called 'statesmanship' and the 'wisdom of diplomacy,' as against the visionary dreams of an imaginative sentimentalism. For myself, it is better described in those very recent words of a singularly clear, hard-headed and acute English statesman, whom nobody will accuse of being visionary or a dreamer. I mean Sir William Vernon Harcourt, who pronounced the present rivalry of the great powers of the world in the matter of ships and men as simply 'insensate folly!'"

We should regard liberty, not as a right of which to boast, but as an opportunity of receiving and doing the greatest good.—Rev. Richard E. Sykes, Universalist, Denver.
