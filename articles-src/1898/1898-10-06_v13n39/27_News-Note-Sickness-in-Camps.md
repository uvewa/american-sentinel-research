UNQUESTIONABLY much of the sickness in the camps of the soldiers, which has caused such a controversy in government circles, was due to lax discipline which allowed the soldiers to indulge their appetites freely for both food and drink, in the cities and towns near which the camps were located. The greater part of the sickness in this world is caused by violation of natural laws in eating and drinking.
