By B. W. Noel, M. A.

[Much is made by the advocates of union of the state with religion, of an assumed analogy between the position and duties of the state and those of a parent. This argument is well disposed of in the following, which was written by an English clergyman in review of one of Mr. Gladstone's early works defending the establishment of religion in England. The principles of state support of religion apply of course as well in this country as in England.]

MR. GLADSTONE, as well as other advocates of the union, has much insisted on the analogy between the nation and the family—between the functions of the state and those of the parent. Hence, he adds, "I argue that the state when rightly constituted is eminently competent, by intrinsic as well as extrinsic attributes, to lead and to solicit the mind of the people, to exercise the function, modified indeed, but yet real, of an instructor, and even of a parent." Bishop Wilson adds, "Though an Establishment is not essential to Christianity itself, it is essential to every Christian government which desires to discharge its highest obligations toward the people committed to its care. A connection between Christianity and the rulers of a Christian country is imperiously required to fulfil the duty of the Parent of the State to his vast family." The doctrine grounded on this analogy is that, as a parent must provide Christian instruction for his family, so the state must provide Christian instruction for the nation. Both the analogy and the doctrine founded upon it are false.

The state being composed of queen, lords, and commons, among which three estates the House of Commons having now so much influence that its decided and permanent judgment determines ultimately every public question, we must consider that House as being especially the depository of the state's parental authority. But if the House of Commons is the parent of the nation, the difference between the father of the nation and the father of the family is so considerable as to make their respective duties exceedingly distinct.

1. Children being placed under the authority of their parents through their weakness and ignorance, without any choice of their own, the control of them by their father is natural and unavoidable; but the House of Commons is chosen by the electors of the empire, and is therefore, an elective father, an adopted parent, raised to that dignity by his adopting children, to whom alone he owes his position and his power.

2. The father of a family has a permanent, and, within certain limits, an irresponsible control, so that he can determine the education of his children from infancy to manhood. But the national father is elected by his children, on certain terms and for certain ends, can claim no more power than they are pleased to concede, is responsible to them for the execution of his office, is forced by them to resign it at the end of seven years, because they are afraid that he would assume too much authority, and all his decisions may be revoked by the next elected national father, whose views may be totally opposed to his own.

Since, then, the circumstances of the parent are so different from those of the state, it is obviously unsafe to argue from the duties of the one to the functions of the other; but just so far as there is an analogy between them, that analogy condemns the control of the church by the state as absurd; for when the children of any family grow to manhood, they are invariably emancipated from parental control in matters of religion. What parent would think of dictating to his son at the age of thirty, the creed which he should profess, or the minister whom he should attend? What son at that age would submit to such dictation? At that epoch the authority of the father in religious matters has expired, since every man is responsible to God for his religious conduct, and can permit no one to interpose between his Maker and him. The son is then become religiously independent; and all attempts to impose on him a creed or a religious teacher would be usurpation. The obligation of the parent to teach the children arising solely from their need of divine truth, from their incapacity to judge for themselves, the reason of this dictation ceases as soon as their faculties are mature, and from that time it would be criminal in them to permit its exercise. Not less imbecile and culpable is it in a nation to allow the state to dictate its creed: for the nation is fullgrown. There have been times when a government might with some plausibility assume toward a nation the tone of a parent to a child; but why should this nation be treated as a child now? Myriads of men in this country can think for themselves on religion as well as the six hundred and fifty-eight members of the House of Commons can think for them. In every free nation the press and the platform are coordinate powers with the legislature itself: and in this country every day makes it more manifest, that the members of the House of Commons are not pedagogues, but representatives of men; among whom are many who are as able as themselves to investigate every question both of politics and morals: and if the nation is composed of men, parliament should cease to treat them as children. Indeed, in no other question are they treated as children. The state does not determine for us our lawyer, physician or tradesman; why should it appoint our pastor? Why select for its dictation precisely the matter in which it is the least competent to dictate, and in which its blunders are the most injurious? When the parent chooses the pastor for his children, he chooses also their physician and their tradesman; if the state will play the parent with men, let it nominate our physicians and our tradesmen no less than our ministers. Either treat us wholly as children, or wholly as men.

When a parent relinquishes all control over the religion of his children, because they have attained to manhood, he may yet be wiser than they, and is certainly more experienced. But what religious wisdom and experience has this elected national father, who retains the control over the churches of Christ? Here, in truth, the analogy between the relation of the state to the churches and the relation of the parent to his children is wholly reversed. In the churches of Christ is collected all the religious wisdom of the country: in the House of Commons there is little religious wisdom. If in political knowledge Parliament may resemble the parent and the nation be like the child, in spiritual knowledge Parliament is like the child while the churches have the wisdom of the parent: and to intrust parliament with the creed, laws, and discipline of the churches, is to intrust the control of the parent to the child.

But this is not the whole of the absurdity involved in the state episcopate. As no one can teach what he does not know, or will inculcate what he does not believe, an ungodly father cannot educate his children in religion. On the contrary, some ungodly parents have been known so systematically to vitiate the minds of their children, that the Court of Chancery has on this ground taken from them the custody of their own sons. The state is under the same incapacity. If the House of Commons be the national father, it is a father so irreligious, that the children should be withdrawn from his control. Six hundred members of parliament, with no more religion than six hundred men taken at hazard from any city or town of Great Britain, whose theological opinions, including Romanism, High-Churchism, Socinianism, and a thousand other varieties, make up a perfect chaos of irreconcilable contradictions, are not entitled to control the creed and discipline of twelve thousand Christian churches.

To complete this view of the absurdity of the union, we must add that, while the father of a family controls the education of his children, because he pays for it, the members of the two houses of parliament, instead of paying themselves for the spiritual instruction of the nation, force the nation to pay for it, distraining on the property of all who refuse to pay: just as if an ignorant and ungodly parent should force his children, when grown up to manhood, to receive a bad tutor from him, and should beat and force them if they would not build a lecture-room, and pay the tutor's salaries themselves.
