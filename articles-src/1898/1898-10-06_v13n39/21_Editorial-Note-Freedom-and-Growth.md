FREEDOM is worth what its attainment has cost and is costing, chiefly as it affords advantages of a larger life, which we industriously improve. We should seek it as an invigorating atmosphere in which to grow rather than a balmy air in which to sleep. We should seek freedom of thought in order that our minds, unfettered, may think great and worthy thoughts and hold unmolested the conclusions of honest investigation; that in its search for truth the mind may not be terrified by threats, weakened by flattery, or narrowed by bigotry.—Rev. Richard E. Sykes.
