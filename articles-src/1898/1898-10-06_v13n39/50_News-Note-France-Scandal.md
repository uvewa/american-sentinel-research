There is a momentary lull in the great national scandal of France, but fresh disclosures are promised shortly. The Sun, of this city, says:—

"The next exposures will be such as might tempt any ambitious foreign power to take advantage of the weakness and infamy of those upon whom France relies for her defense. But, fortunately, there is little reason to fear an attack from the quarter whence the French themselves believe it is most likely to come.

"The story, when told, will be an appalling object lesson on the moral effect upon those most concerned of the modern system of keeping great nations constantly on a war footing. I put it in this form because it is impossible to believe that the men who control and direct the national defense are natural scoundrels, conspirators, and criminals. Evidence is not wanting, in fact, that similar perversions of moral sense are not absent from other military cabinets on the continent."

And it is to be hoped that this "appalling object lesson" will be heeded by the United States, before this nation proceeds so far upon the road of militarism as to fall a victim to similar evils.
