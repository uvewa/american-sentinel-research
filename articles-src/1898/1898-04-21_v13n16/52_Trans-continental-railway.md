It is proposed to build another trans-continental railway through Canada, further north than the Canadian Pacific. The new route will run from Montreal direct to the upper end of Lake Winnipeg, thence northwest to the Rocky Mountains, crossing them at an elevation of 2,400 feet; thence down the valley of the Skeene to the Pacific. It is proposed to build also connecting branches to the Yukon.

When this is done, the trans-Siberian railway being also completed, as it no doubt will be, a journey from America to England can be made without going across the Ocean.
