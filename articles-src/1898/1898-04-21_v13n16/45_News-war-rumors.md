NEVER before in the world's history did the sound of war reverberate throughout the earth as it does today.

"PROCLAIM ye this among the Gentiles: Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong." What more would be necessary than is seen and heard to-day to constitute the fulfillment of this prophecy of Joel? And this prophecy marks the proximity of the day of God.

Both branches of Congress having passed by large majorities resolutions which amount to a declaration of war against Spain, it is probable that by the time this paper reaches its readers an open rupture between the two countries will have become a reality. The pope, meanwhile, has tried hard to get Europe to interfere in behalf of Spain; but his propositions seem to have met with favorable response only from France and Austria, who are not able to do anything toward dominating the situation without the coöperation of the other Powers.

A DISPATCH from Washington quotes a member of the Administration as saying, with reference to the present outlook, "Events seem to be leading up to the last grand crash before the millennium."

Thoughtful observers can see that events are leading up to a "grand crash," and—very thoughtlessly—many persons associate this with the idea of the coming of a millennium of peace. But the war spirit, which is abroad in the earth to-day, does not beget the spirit of peace. It begets only that which is like itself.

There will be a "grand crash," truly; but it will usher in the "day of God," not the millennium of peace. Is the world ready for it? Are you ready for it? That is the important question.
