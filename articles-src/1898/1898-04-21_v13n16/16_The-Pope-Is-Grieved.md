Disparities from Rome state that the pope is "deeply grieved" by the apparent failure of his efforts to mediate between this country and Spain. In view of the prospect that war cannot be averted, he is reported to have said:—

"I have prayed to God with the whole force of my being, with the deepest fervor, to avert war, and not to allow my pontificate to end amid the smoke of battle. Otherwise, I have implored the Almighty to take me to himself that I may not behold such a sight."

The pope has a deep horror of the "smoke of battle," and the "sight" of fighting, when Spain is opposed to a formidable nation. But what about the smoke of battle that has for three years been hanging over the island of Cuba, and the starving of innocent women and children by the hundred thousand, which has been in progress ever since Weyler's order of concentration? Has he felt any horror over these? If he has, he has not expressed it.

The scenes which have been enacted in Cuba under the Spanish arms—arms to which, by the way, the pope has given his blessing—are far worse than any that are likely to attend a conflict between Spain and the United States.

If only the Roman pontiff could succeed in preserving peace between two great "Christian" nations, what a prestige would be given the papacy in the eyes of the world, and what a basis would be afforded for asking concessions to the papacy from the United States! No wonder "his holiness" is deeply grieved over his failure.
