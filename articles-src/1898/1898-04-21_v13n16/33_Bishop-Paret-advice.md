A Protestant Episcopal bishop of Maryland, Bishop Paret, has given the clergymen of his diocese some sensible advice on the subject of discussing political and "patriotic" issues in their pulpits. It is well that there are still some clergymen of influence left in the country who understand and are not afraid to say that the proper business of a Christian minister is to preach the gospel. He says:—

"God having brought us to times of uncertainty, trouble, and danger, he calls our nation and its authorities to use all possible patience and wisdom. And as helping to that, I expect that you keep your sermons free from all questions of war or of national politics, and from unnecessary professions of patriotism. True patriotism does not need to be boastful. Important as these things are, they have no place in the pulpit. Our Saviour and his apostles first are our best models for preaching the gospel. There were questions of deepest national importance then pressing upon the minds of the people, but they did not make them themes for preaching. They had something still higher to speak of—the spiritual truths of the gospel, and its great moral principles and duties. These prevailing would bring peace and truth as their results. . . . Keep Spain and points of national policy out of your sermons. Ask God's blessings on those who now have the great responsibility. Use at every morning and evening prayer the appointed prayer 'For the President and for all others in authority,' and at every litany service and at all other services the prayer for Congress."
