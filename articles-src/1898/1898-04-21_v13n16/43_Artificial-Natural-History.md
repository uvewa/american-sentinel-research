An exchange says:—

"The science of zoology, both for the extent and difficulty of terminology, makes the greatest demand on the memory. As illustration, there are over 5,000 known species of lizards, each with its distinguishing name. Here are four as samples: Phrynocephalus przewalskii, Cryptoblepharus poecilopleurus, Tracheloptychus petersip, Cordylosaurus Trivittatus."

That is called "Natural Science," when as a matter of fact it is not natural at all, but wholly artificial; neither is it science, for the knowledge of it is not the knowledge of truth. Let no one get disheartened at these long names. The animals are not born with them, neither do they carry them about. A person may know all that any man can know of an animal, without ever having heard of these yard-long names; and one may have them all at his tongue's end without knowing the real truth about a single animal. It is true that it is possible for a person to have his mind crammed with artificial classification and jaw breaking names, and at the same time to know the things themselves; but the chances are all against it. Remember that there is a vast difference between knowing the truth concerning a thing, that is, knowing the thing itself, and knowing the name that somebody has devised for that thing.
