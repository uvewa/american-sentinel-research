The Christian Statesman, the leading exponent of the theory that a civil government is a moral person and as such is bound to obey the moral law, sees in the present crisis of affairs between the Government and Spain, an opportunity to illustrate its theory "with remarkable clearness." Proceeding, therefore, to improve this favorable opportunity, it says:—

"It is the belief of perhaps ninety nine out of every hundred American citizens that the battleship 'Maine' was blown up by the Spaniards. . . . The belief of many of the American people is that the mine was exploded by Spanish agents. But Spain herself is held accountable for the deed of these agents.

"The same principle of political science finds illustration in the condition of affairs in Cuba. The policy adopted by General Weyler has reduced thousands of Cubans to a state of starvation. . . . But while Weyler is justly condemned for his inhuman method of carrying on the war, Spain as a nation is held accountable by the civilized world, for the cruelty and barbarity that have been practiced in Cuba by her accredited agents. Weyler is no longer there, but the suffering continues. Spain is the responsible person with whom to deal."

Now the truth is that international diplomacy does not consider the Spanish government, or any government, as a person. There is no personal reality to any government. The Statesman's illustration no more proves the personality of Spain than the well-known cartoon figure called "Uncle Sam" proves the personality of the United States, or than the stout figure labeled "John Bull" proves the personality of England. There is no way to represent the personality of governments except by a cartoon figure which everybody knows has no reality outside of paper and ink.

Governments conduct the business pertaining to their relations with each other through ambassadors, consuls, and other individuals who are the agents of the governments. And they cannot treat or negotiate with each other in any other way; they cannot communicate with each other at all independently of these agents. They cannot do anything independently of these agents. But a person can act independently of his agent, always; and a government, if it were a person in more than a figurative sense, could do likewise.

Spain, or any government, is very properly to be held accountable for the acts of its agents. But this is not saying that Spain can be held accountable as a person can be. When a person commits murder—as was done in the blowing up of the "Maine"—he is by the law of all nations punished with death; but how is a civil government to be thus punished? No one proposes to put the government of Spain to death for the thousands and millions of murders which its agents have committed in the last two or three centuries of its history. It was not proposed to kill the government of Turkey—the "sick man of the East"—because of the series of massacres of which it has been guilty during the present century. A civil government is not held accountable for murder, as persons are. It cannot be held accountable for anything, apart from its agents and representatives. It cannot be seized and put in confinement, as every person is when he is to be punished for crime.

* * *

Apart from the people, civil government has no existence at all. Any dealings with civil government, therefore,—any punishment of it, or satisfaction exacted from it—must simply affect the people; and whatever affects the people must affect them as individuals, for they are individuals, and nothing more. The people are what the Creator made them, and they were created as individuals.

The idea that a government is a person, in any other than a figurative sense, is ridiculous; and in the doctrine that it is a moral person, amenable to the divine law, it is presented in the most ridiculous light. A civil government cannot believe on Christ and be baptized; and therefore its salvation is impossible. There will be in heaven no United States of America or empire of Great Britain. There will be no political divisions at all. There will be no politics. There will be only the host of heaven and the host of the redeemed—redeemed as individuals and saved because they made the doing of God's will on earth an individual matter.
