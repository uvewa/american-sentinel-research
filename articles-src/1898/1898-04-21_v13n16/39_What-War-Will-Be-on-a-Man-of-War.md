The conditions of a combat at sea between modern warships have vastly changed since the time of the last great sea fight between the forces of civilized nations; and the change, it appears, has not been in the direction of increased safety to the participants in such a contest. It might seem at first thought that the steel armor in which ships of war are now usually encased, would afford secure protection to all who would take care to keep it between themselves and the missiles of the enemy; but the fact is that in the race for supremacy the heavy armor has not kept pace with the heavy guns; and in coming naval battles the ships will be subjected to the destructive force of projectiles which the heaviest armor they can carry will not withstand. The torpedo, also, will play its deadly part, and the rapidity with which destruction and death may overwhelm both vessel and crew can be imagined from the disaster which overtook the "Maine."

Captain McGiffin, the American who commanded the Chinese battleship "Chen Yuen," in the battle of the Yalu, between the fleets of China and Japan, in speaking of the sensations experienced during the fight on that occasion, said:—

"A very great feeling of curiosity animates all hands in a battle at sea. Chinamen are about the least curious men in the world; yet the deck officers on my ship had great trouble in keeping the members of the black gang, the firemen and coal passers, and even the machinists, down below during the action. They kept poking their heads above the main deck, lifting off hatches for the purpose, to see how we were making out. On the whole, I think the men down below are more nervous during a fight than the men on deck. They are a bit afraid of what they can't see. It's just like the fear of a man lying in bed in a dark room when he knows there is a burglar within a few feet of him. The men on deck can see the whole game, and the smoke and the roar infuse the devil of battle into them, and they simply don't care whether the ship remains on top or goes down. They literally enjoy the fun. A lot of our gunners were positively hysterical with delight. Some of them laughed like wild men. They muttered to themselves and howled like drunkards. Indeed, half the ship's company looked to me as if they were three parts drunk after the fight, yet there was no grog. They reeled about, with silly, drunken expressions on their faces, although they knew we were licked."

When asked if he didn't feel like running when the fight commenced, Captain McGiffin replied, "Run where?" and added that in a fight at sea under the conditions of modern warfare, there is literally no place to run to, one part of the ship being about as safe—or as dangerous—as another.

In view of the fact that a conflict between this country and Spain would be fought out mostly on the water, the following description of the conditions which will be imposed upon those on board a man-of-war "in action," is of interest. It is furnished by a writer in the New York Sun:—

"Common and perfectly equal as the danger in which all hands on board a modern man-of-war unquestionably stand during a fight, there are, of course, some stations that appear to be more ticklish for the men assigned to them than others. For example, there is probably not a sea soldier in the United States Marine Corps to-day who is not figuring on the insignificant show he will probably have for his life if, in the event of his ship's getting into action, he is detailed with a picked few of his mates to man the rapid-firing guns in the fighting tops. At first glance the fighting top of a modern ship of war appears to be quite the most dangerous spot on the ship fore or aft in case of action. There has never been any good opportunity to test this, for fighting tops (rightly called military masts) are of comparatively recent development, and during the Chino-Japanese naval engagements no systematic attempt seems to have been made on either side to raze the fighting tops to the decks or into the sea. The proportion of killed and wounded in the fighting tops during those engagements was considerably less than on deck.

"In a sea fight between expert manipulators of ships, however, there can be no doubt that the vessels will go each at the other's military masts with enthusiasm at the very outset, for the purpose of silencing the deadly play of the rapid-firing guns, which are capable of making terrific havoc on an enemy's decks. The rapid firing guns only would be used for the purpose of chopping off or knocking over the enemy's fighting tops, for a fighting top is a small mark in long-range shooting, and no gunner would be so foolish as to waste big gun projectiles in an attempt to shave a mark the chances of striking which are about as a thousand to one against him. But rapid-firing guns are accurate and their projectiles are powerful enough to do for the strongest fighting top that ever reared its ugly circular head from the deck of a ship of war. The sides of the fighting tops are armored, but they are not armored sufficiently to render them impentrable to the projectiles of ordinary rapid-firing guns. The sea soldiers man the fighting top guns, and it may be set down as something mighty certain that in the event of a war the duels between the marines in the fighting tops will be sanguinary features of the sea fights.

"The bluejackets who are stationed in the magazines during a sea fight are certainly no better off than their mates, either above or below decks. Each commander in a naval battle knows precisely where his foe's magazines are located, and there is likely to be some tall aiming for magazines in the next naval war. To those who are unfamiliar with the general expertness of modern great gun markmanship and the extraordinary accuracy of some of it, it might seem pure foolishness for a gunner to make an attempt to hit any especial part of an enemy's ship at a range of several miles. Those who think it this way, however, have only to be referred to the bit of marksmanship performed by one of the 13-inch gun crews of the battleship "Indiana" the other day. This crew, using service projectiles and charges in practice, put two 13-inch shots right through the same hole. This sort of marksmanship is by no means uncommon in the United States Navy, the standard of which for great gun expertness is as high as that of any navy in the world. It is no unusual thing for gunners of American men of war engaged in big gun practice to tear the canvas targets to ribbons, at the very longest effective ranges, before the practice is well begun.

"This being the state of great gun marksmanship at the present time, it is reasonable to suppose that the men in the magazines in a sea fight should have no especial cause for being happy above their fellows over their stations. One great gun shell plumped well over a magazine (even though the magazines be all far below the water line) is likely to cause enough trouble to induce the magazine men to wish they were on deck, if they have a chance to think at all. Moreover, there is such a thing as a heavy projectile penetrating an armored ship below the water line, as was proved on the "Yalu," and if this should happen at a point of the ship where a magazine chanced to be located the men hauling ammunition and manning the hoists in the same would never know what had happened to them. Then there is always a likelihood of shells exploding on deck and bits finding their way through the open magazine hatches—and such a thing would be dangerous enough. The magazine men, moreover, have to work in practical darkness. Magazines on modern men-of-war are of course fitted with no standing lights of any sort. In times of peace, when the gunners' mates and inspecting officers wish to examine the interiors of magazines, they carry portable incandescent electric lights with them, but in handling loose ammunition during actual fighting even these portable electric lights would be deemed dangerous, so that the magazine men would no doubt have to grope for it and take out their nervous curiosity as to what might be happening to their ship or fleet in wondering.

"The officer would have no advantage whatever over the enlisted man in the matter of greater safety in a modern naval engagement. The sword-carrying men with the range-finders were lopped off with complete impartiality in the "Yalu" fight. An officer in command of a gun has even a bit the worst of the chance in comparison with the men handling the gun, for in order to get a line on the enemy he must necessarily expose himself to be enemy's scientific rapid-fire play, while the gunners have the protection of the gun shields and barbettes. Even the commanding officer is no better as a war risk than the humblest mess attendant in a fight. His station on modern ships will generally be in his ship's conning tower, and, well as conning towers on ships of war of today are protected, eminent naval authorities haven't much faith in their invulnerability. Conning towers are necessarily in exposed spots—almost always away forward, beneath where the bridge ought to be, but isn't, when the ship is cleared for action—and gunners of the enemy are naturally expected to do what they can toward sending the commanding officer of an antagonism ship into the next world before his time.

"The man in the bunkers, viz., the humble coal passer, is likely to have a dismal, unsatisfactory time of it during the progress of a fight. He sees absolutely nothing, but what he does not see is more than atoned for by what he hears. Any man who has ever listened to the intonation of great guns during target practice from the shelter of a half empty coal bunker is likely to remember the twenty times amplified thundering that threatens to rip his ear drums in twain. Theoretically, the coal passer is supposed to shovel buckets full of coal and trundle them along the trolleys in the mellow light of many 16 candle incandescent lamps, and as a matter of fact all modern ships' coal bunkers are lighted. But the writer, who has crawled through the bunkers of many a modern man-of-war, American and foreign, has found that standing electric bunker lamps rarely illuminate. The glass around the wires is smashed in the process of coaling ship, and, of course, the lamps do not work. Naval constructors are still trying to find some scheme to illuminate bunkers. The coal passer, standing his watch in the bunker of a ship in action, then, has the additional gloom of darkness to fight, unless he violates a rigid regulation by carrying an open light into his bunker. He does not know when an armor-piercing shell is going to pass directly through the bunker he is working in, and altogether his station in a fight is not a desirable one.

"Nor has the fireman or the water tender a very cheerful station. Both of these members of the black gang, of course, are in the boiler rooms, and they have perpetually before them the possibility of a great shell ripping its way through a boiler, thus insuring them a death by scalding. The oiler is another man of the black gang who has a title to feel nervous when his ship is fighting, for he is always more or less tangled up in the machinery apparently endeavoring to see how near he can approach death without actually compassing his own, and in the event of a shot dropping through the deck and among the intertwined masses of machinery he is liable to be torn to pieces by the same, 'racing wild,' as the engineers call it, even if he is not done for by the explosion.

"The soft spot,' as an old gunner's mate put it, 'is about five fathom beneath her, in a diving suit.'"
