The Rev. J. M. Henderson, who assumes to speak for the African M. E. Church in America, is quoted as saying that the church is ready to fight in case of war with Spain, and that it could raise 150,000 men. Also that the ministers of the church, of which there are about 5,000, have been instructed by their bishops to do everything in their power to rouse the patriotism of the members of their congregations. In this the African M. E. Church is only following the example set by some other Methodist bodies in this country.
