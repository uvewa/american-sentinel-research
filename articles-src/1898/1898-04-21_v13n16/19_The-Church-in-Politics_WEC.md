It was Christ, the founder of Christianity, who said, "My kingdom is not of this world."

It was the Apostle Paul who declared, "I am determined to know nothing among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified."

There are two kingdoms in this world, the visible and the invisible—the church and the state. Christ is the head of one, Caesar is the head of the other. One is ruled by force, the other by love. One takes cognizance of the overt acts of man only, while the other goes beyond and judges the thoughts and intents of the heart. The one is of earth, the other of heaven.

There is a clear dividing line between the two, across which Christ taught that neither should go.

It is a sad fact, however, that this command has for the most part been disregarded by those who have been called to the exalted work of the gospel commission. They have dabbled in state matters, and through this intermingling the Christianity of its Founder has been trailed in the dust.

Rev. S. G. Smith, one of the leading ministers of Minneapolis, Minn., evidently does not fall in line with the 'church in politics' idea that is nowadays so prevalent.

In a late issue of the *Minneapolis Times*, he is reported as saying in a sermon:

"Grant, for the sake of argument, that the churches, if they combine, can put down the saloon; that they can put down the social evil, that they can put down many other evils which, perhaps, they cannot in fact. But grant that they can, and when they have accomplished one of these reforms, it will be like the first taste of blood to the carnivorous. The tongue of cunning and the hand of greed will make use of them, as they have in the past, wherever the church and the state have intermingled. Whenever the church knows and others know it has such a power, bad men will use it to further their own ends. The pirates will board the ship of God."

He is right, and all the history of the past is but a monument of proof to the truthfulness of his assertions.

W. E. C.
