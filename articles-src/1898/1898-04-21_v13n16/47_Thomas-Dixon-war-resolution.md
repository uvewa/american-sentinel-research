AT the Academy of Music in New York City, Sunday morning, the 17th inst., after a stirring discourse by the Rev. Thomas Dixon, Jr., a resolution was passed by a practically unanimous vote of the congregation declaring that this Government ought to make war on Spain and bombard Havana by Wednesday next at the latest. And this resolution was proposed and the vote taken, that the announcement of the fact might be telegraphed to the authorities at Washington; the pastor stating that he would do this by 3 o'clock of the same day.

And so it has come to this,—that the church, which is supposed to preach the gospel of the Prince of Peace, now openly declares for war; and not only this, but wants war even more than the civil authorities want it, and urges the latter on to the conflict because they do not move fast enough to suit her! The church urging the world on to carnal warfare! This is "Christianity" indeed!
