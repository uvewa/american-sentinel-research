Mormons of Rockbridge County, Va., have applied to the governor of the State for protection from the non-Mormon residents of the vicinity, who have become much incensed over the preaching of Mormon doctrine among them, and have threatened to tar and feather the Mormon band if the latter did not leave the country. It is a mistake when anything is done which is calculated to create sympathy for Mormon missionary work. The only way to overcome evil, is to oppose it with good.
