A National Reform organ in Pennsylvania mentions that some large manufacturing establishments in Pittsburg are operating their mills seven days in the week, compelling the operatives to do work on Sunday as on other days. And in discussing the obstacles which lie in the way of securing Sunday closing of these mills, it mentions that "many of them [the proprietors] are members of our large strong orthodox congregations." This only adds another testimony to many that have been given showing that church people themselves are largely responsible for the prevailing desecration of Sunday. And this being so, would it not be consistent for the church to set herself in order before calling on the state to provide a remedy for Sunday desecration?
