We learn that in Texas a law has recently been passed which is favorable to convassers of religious literature in that State. The gist of the law is given as follows:—

"A license of forty-five dollars is required of every agent, except those who are engaged exclusively in selling books of a purely religious character."

We haven't very much sympathy with it as a law, as it is a straight out and out case of class legislation, which is wrong first, last, and all the time.

W. E. C.
