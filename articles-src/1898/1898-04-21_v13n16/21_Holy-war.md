One of the leading pastors of the city of New York is reported as having said in a sermon that if war must come between Spain and the United States, "It should be a war for humanity, a war for truth, a war for God. It should be in a real sense, a holy war."

Many people think that Spain has not got beyond the Dark Ages in her conceptions of humanity. And the words of many preachers of these days show very plainly that they have not got beyond the Dark Ages in their conceptions of Christianity.

Think of making war for the God of peace! Think of destroying men for the Saviour! Think of making in a real sense, a holy war!

Until such men obtain better ideas of Christianity, it will be to very little purpose that they denounce the Spaniards' low ideas of humanity.
