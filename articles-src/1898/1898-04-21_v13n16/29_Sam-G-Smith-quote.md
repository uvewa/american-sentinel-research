The following forcible sentences spoken by Sam. G. Smith, of the People's Church at Minneapolis, are worth passing round to all the people everywhere:—

"Julius Caesar was a priest, the most renowned authority in Rome on matters ecclesiastical before he became a general in Gaul. Men of the church have been powers in the state from time immemorial. Kings and priests alike have done things that will not bear the closest investigation. This Government of ours was based on the theory that the church and the state should be kept separate, each working in its own way for the benefit of the people. Almost the last words of the father of his country were his admonition to keep these two factors in human civilization forever apart."
