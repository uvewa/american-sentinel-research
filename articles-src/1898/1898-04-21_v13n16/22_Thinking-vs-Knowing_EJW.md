How often we read with reference to something pertaining to the Bible and religion, "Dr. —— thinks that this is," etc., and what the doctor thinks is then by many considered as final, until he "thinks" again, or until somebody else "thinks" something else.

"Then you would have us ignore the opinions and ideas of other men, and each one simply follow his own thoughts." Not by any means; our own thoughts are no better than other people's, and often not so good. I would have you follow, not what you or somebody thinks, but what you know. When you absolutely know a certain thing, you accept it not on anybody's authority, but for its own sake. Then you are sure of where you stand.

"Ah, but what conceit for a man to assume that he knows the truth in a case where more learned men confess their ignorance." Yes, indeed it is, if you assume that you know the truth. Don't assume anything, and when you are not sure that you know, don't be ashamed to say that you don't know. But what is there strange in a person's knowing what the Lord tells him, and in being sure that he knows it? In such a case it is sin not to know. Jesus says, "If ye continue in my word, . . . ye shall know the truth." The Word of God is sure, and whoever believes it may be sure.
