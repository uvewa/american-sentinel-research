THE Christian Statesman, organ of the modern Puritanical element in religion, expresses (in its April issue) a fear that the Sabbath (Sunday) may soon become in this country "as it is in parts of Europe, a day of labor, of pleasure, and of crime." Probably the Statesman here meant worldly "pleasure," though it is quite in accord with the Puritan nature as it stands. For it is well known that the Puritans classed pleasure on the Sabbath with secular labor and crime. But God's Sabbath was made to be a day of the highest pleasure.
