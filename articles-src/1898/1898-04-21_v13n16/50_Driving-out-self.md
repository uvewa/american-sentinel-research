WHETHER or not the Government is going to drive Spain out of Cuba may be a great question; but it is not so important for you as the question whether self is going to be driven out of your heart. This is a question of what you are going to do, and not somebody else. Self has declared war against you, and you need not wait a moment to begin fighting the greatest and most important battles of your life.
