One of the heavy fighting ships of the United States Navy is named the "Puritan," and considering the well-known character of the Puritans, this name may not be inappropriate. But no one has yet ventured to suggest the name "Christian" for a ship of war, although according to the statements put forth by religious speakers and writers, such a name would be perfectly appropriate. If this name, displayed in large letters upon the hull of a ship engaged in pouring death and destruction upon another ship filled with human beings, is not entirely appropriate, will some of the religious speakers and writers who advocate war please tell us why.
