THE history of one of the most important and interesting developments of modern times is being given in the SENTINEL, in the articles headed "Items of W. C. T. U. History." Probably no person living is better qualified to speak on the subject than is the writer of these articles; and we do not see how any person who feels an interest in human affairs can fail to be interested in them. We are sure they afford an excellent opportunity for introducing the SENTINEL to those engaged in the work of the W. C. T. U.
