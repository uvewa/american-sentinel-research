An exchange which is a staunch advocate of Sunday laws, says:—

"There is no doubt that from a business point of view merely, the converting of the Sabbath into a work day will prove profitable. The firm that works seven days in the week has a decided advantage over the one that works only six. The capital invested yields one-seventh more. The output is one-seventh greater than in works of equal capacity. For a firm that closes its mills on the Sabbath to put out an equal amount as the firm that runs continuously, it would require an enlargement of its plant one-seventh, i.e., the investment, it may be, of a large sum of money."

And yet this paper and all the rest of the Sunday "reform" organs have been telling us from time to time, that "from a business point of view merely," it did not pay to work machinery and men seven days in the week. They have elaborately and with great assurance explained to us that both machinery and men need a rest one day in each week; that without it, both will wear out quicker than would otherwise be the case, and that really more work would be accomplished in the six days, with the day of rest, than in the seven days without it, etc., etc. Which of these opposing views are we to believe? Or must we believe that neither was made so much with a view of stating the truth, as of offering an "argument" in behalf of their scheme of reform?
