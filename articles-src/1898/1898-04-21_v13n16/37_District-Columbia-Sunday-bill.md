The Defender, organ of the N. E. Sabbath Protective League, announces the "cheering news" that the Sunday bill for the District of Columbia has been approved by the District Commissioners. "This," it says, "means much in the keen fight for Sunday laws, at our national Capitol."

Yes; there is a good deal meant by the persistent effort to get Congress to enact a Sunday law for the District of Columbia. It is meant by this to get Congress committed to Sunday legislation, and then from this vantage ground to demand a general Sunday law for the nation. The first step in wrong doing means a good deal, always.
