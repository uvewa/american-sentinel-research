As a result of the introduction of the "flag salute" in the public schools of Ashland, Oregon, seven children who refused to give the salute have been expelled from the schools. The "salute," as we have before stated, requires the children to say that they give their hearts to God, which of course is requiring them to profess conversion,—a profession which on the part of some at least must be a downright lie. Some people—even some children—object to being compelled to utter a lie, and others object to being required to profess conversion; and these—naturally the most conscientious of the lot—are cast out of the schools. To be patriotic, after this standard of patriotism, conscience is only in the way and should be dispensed with. Some perhaps are of such a peculiar turn of mind as to think that the object of the public schools is to teach the young the rudiments of scientific knowledge, and not to teach the ideas of patriotism entertained by the "Woman's Relief Corps;" but evidently the school board of Ashland do not belong to this class.

The affair has caused some stir in the town, and some at least who are not religiously identified with the parents of the expelled children, are outspoken in denunciation of such violation of American fundamental principles. We give, in part, what one of these writes for publication to an Ashland paper, the Valley Record:

"Now, Mr. Editor, if for conscience' sake these children were debarred from receiving a free education, then may God pity the one that debarred them. Jesus came to 'redeem us from all iniquity;' but how long will it take if those who claim to be his followers commit such iniquitous acts. The few who try to defend the other side, say that the object was to teach patriotism. Well, if patriotism can be forced into the rising generation at the point of a birch rod, this might be some color of an excuse, but how long will it be before such people will be justifying the forcing of patriotism into our people at the point of a bayonet? Not long, Mr. Editor; not long!

"I have lately been told that one of the pastors of this town said from the pulpit that he hoped 'that Christianity would be forced on the heathen nations at the mouth of the cannon!' This is not Christianity; it is Mohammedanism. I have thought that education would rid the world of bigotry and persecution, but from the acts of our educators I am forced to say education may do so, but book learning will not.

"Mr. Editor, I had hoped that the days of Roger Williams and William Penn were past and that we, as a people, were at that place where we did not demand adoration or worship of anything, but that a man's or child's conscience was respected at all times and places. We think it a great wrong or injustice that the Quakers were driven out of England because they would not salute the lords and nobles of that country by raising their hat when they passed by. We build monuments to the dead martyrs and persecute their children, when for conscience' sake they decline to salute our national emblem (or image) by expelling them from the public school. Jesus would say of such as he did of the leading men of his day: 'Woe unto ye scribes and pharisees, hypocrites, for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward but within are full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness.' 'Even so, ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.' Matt. 23:27, 28.

"We have always had a great respect for the public schools of this nation, and much pride for our local schools, but when men use their position to do an injustice to innocent, God-fearing children, whose only crime consisted in refusing to do that which their conscience tells them is wrong, no words of ours can convey even a little bit of our pity coupled with contempt for them; and we cannot help but believe that it was a mistake on their part and that those who occupy the high places on our school board will 'cease to do evil and learn to do well' by reinstating those children to their places where justice says they should occupy, giving them equal chances to learn with others, teaching all children that liberty of conscience is as necessary to a free country as patriotism.
