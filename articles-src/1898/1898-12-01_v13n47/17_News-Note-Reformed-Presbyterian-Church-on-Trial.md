SEVERAL members of the Reformed Presbyterian Church were put on trial before the Presbytery of New York, at Newburg, for voting at a political election. The Reformed Presbyterians advocate that the national Constitution should be amended so as to "recognize God," and that moral obligations should be made compulsory upon all citizens by the law of the land. Until this shall be done they refuse to vote, on the ground that this would be an act of participation in a "godless" government; but they urge that other people ought to vote these changes into existence, and after the Government shall have been thus modeled upon their ideas the Reformed Presbyterians will be willing to take hold and run it. The trial resulted in the acquittal of the accused parties, owing to the absence of any positive proof that they had committed the offense charged against them.
