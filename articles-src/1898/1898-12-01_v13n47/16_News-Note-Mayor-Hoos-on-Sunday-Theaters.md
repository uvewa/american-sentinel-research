MAYOR HOOS, of Jersey City, who recently declared in favor of open theaters on Sunday, thereby brought upon himself such a storm of clerical indignation that his political friends have thought it necessary to come to his relief,—one of them, a Democratic leader, giving out a statement in which he defends Sunday ball playing and sacred concerts. The mayor had previously explained to the irate clergymen that his utterance in behalf of Sunday theatres was only meant to refer to Sunday "sacred" concerts.
