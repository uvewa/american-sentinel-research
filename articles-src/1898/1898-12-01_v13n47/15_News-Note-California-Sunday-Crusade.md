A CRUSADE for legislation to enforce the observance of Sunday has been started in California. A public meeting was called in Oakland for the purpose of organizing a permanent association, whose purpose shall be to besiege the legislature until such legislation as they demand in support of Sunday as a religious day shall be granted. It is by the clergy and church people, of course, that the movement is being pushed.
