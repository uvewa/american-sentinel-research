MR. KEELY, of motor fame, is dead. He was the inventor of the "Keely motor," which purported to be operated by a new and mysterious force, the nature of which for some reason could not be disclosed. He discovered this mysterious force about thirty years ago, and has been busy in utilizing it in a very practical way so far as his own interests were concerned, ever since. He found plenty of men with money who were waiting for the advent of a new motor which would revolutionize everything in the motor line previously made, and had little difficulty in getting the tidy sum of $100,000 subscribed with which to prosecute experiments. Mr. Keely constructed a model of his motor, which was exhibited on various occasions, but which he carefully guarded from the inspection of mechanical experts. On these occasions he would take pains to enlighten his audience concerning the nature of his discovery, by talking about "triune currents of a polar flow of force," the "reflex action of gravity," "chords of mass," and "sympathetic outreaches of distance," in a way which implied that he was on familiar terms with these things. The charm worked, and many persons including even some of repute for scientific attainments, became convinced that Mr. Keely really had hold of some wonderful occult force which could be dragged forth from its hiding-place and put in harness for the benefit of mankind, if only sufficient funds were put at the inventor's disposal for that purpose.

A STOCK company was formed, in which a credulous public subscribed liberally, paying at times several hundred dollars a share. And when shares of stock were low, individuals whose confidence remained unshaken kept up the supply of funds; so that in all the sum of $500,000 was put into the inventor's hands between the date of his great discovery and that of his death. With this supply of cash at his disposal he managed to secure a fairly comfortable living. Meanwhile, as an evidence of good faith and of progress toward practical results, Mr. Keely occupied himself in manufacturing models of his motor; none of which however seemed exactly adapted to the mysterious force which it was designed to display. Of these he constructed and discarded in all one hundred and twenty-nine; and yet the mysterious force refused to yield itself up as the revolutionizer of motive power. But those who have fallen heir to Mr. Keely's wonderful discovery announce that it will not be lost to the world by his death, but that the work will be continued the same as before. A discovery which has proved itself so potent as a magnet for drawing cash from the pockets of credulous people, is too good a thing to be let drop simply because the original beneficiary under it no longer lives to reap its harvests.

On the whole, it must be said that Mr. Keely's wonderful discovery, hovering for thirty years on the border line between the realm of occult mysteries and that of tangible and practicable things, and all this time drawing funds from the pockets of apparently intelligent and sensible people, to the amount in all of $500,000, throws the late Mr. Jernegan and his gold-from-sea-water scheme quite into the shade. Whether it will survive its ingenious origin or collapse with his demise remains to be seen.
