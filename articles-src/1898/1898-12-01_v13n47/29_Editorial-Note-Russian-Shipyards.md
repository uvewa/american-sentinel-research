The Russian Government is negotiating with the Krupp and Vulcan iron works of Germany for the construction of new ship yards in Russia, and for the employment of German engineers and workmen, in contemplation of a great increase of the Russian navy. The Berlin papers refer to this as being "an interesting satire on the Czar's appeal for international disarmament and universal peace."
