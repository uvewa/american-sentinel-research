The papacy has it in mind to observe the close of the century with a grand celebration which will mark in a fitting manner the exit of the nineteenth century and the advent of the twentieth. This celebration of course will do honor to the papacy. It will be of a nature to convey the impression that the papal church is the vanguard of the procession that moves in the direction of progress and modern enlightenment. The committee having the matter in charge have published an extensive program, which includes pilgrimages to various "holy" places in France, Italy, and Spain. "In particular," it is said, "there is to be a dedication of the Catholic world anew to the divine Heart of Jesus." Certainly the Catholic world is in need of something—Spain especially—but it would seem that if former dedications had been of value, a turn of fortune would not be so sadly needed now.
