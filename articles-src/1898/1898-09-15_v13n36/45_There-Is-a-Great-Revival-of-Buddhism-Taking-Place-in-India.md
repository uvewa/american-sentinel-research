There is, says the Open Court, a great revival of Buddhism taking place in India. Buddhistic schools and journals are being established in Colombo, Calcutta, and other places, and one prominent Buddhist journal is sounding a loud call to all Buddhists to unite in one grand crusade to recover India. It is not strange that it should be so. These are days when nothing that is positive for evil or for good remains inactive, but is, on the contrary, being infused with new life and intensity. And this is but a token of the approaching climax of the long contest between good and evil, and after that comes the end. Are you watching these things, reader, and are you ready for the end?
