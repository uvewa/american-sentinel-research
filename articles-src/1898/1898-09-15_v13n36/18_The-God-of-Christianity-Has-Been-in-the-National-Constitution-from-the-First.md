The God of Christianity has been in the national Constitution from the first, his name being inscribed there in the principles of justice and liberty which it embodies. But the National Reform party—the party which confounds Christianity with politics—wants to put into the Constitution a god which would crowd these principles out. They want the Constitution to distinguish between religious classes, giving to the larger the authority to coerce the smaller, contrary to the American and Christian principle of equality before the law in matters of conscience.

The god which could not be put into the Constitution without crowding justice out of it, is not the true God.
