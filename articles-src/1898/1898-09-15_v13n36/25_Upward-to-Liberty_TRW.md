# Upward to Liberty.

BY T. R. WILLIAMSON.

Columbus found a new world in the West,
Waiting to be the place of Freedom's rest.
Here then the humble freeman built his hearth,
Or tilled the bosom of the fruitful earth.
And while his tasselled corn waved o'er the sod,
Reared up a place of prayer to Freedom's God.

Rains fell and sunbeams warmed his smiling fields,
Kindly the earth her bounty to him yields.
Love blessed him with the clasp of childish hands;
Employment gave him health and broader lands.
Each night sweet sleep her pinions o'er him waved,
Renewed his strength that dangers might be braved.

So grew Columbia to a nation grand.
How bright the picture, O that we might see
Ever a growth toward true liberty;
No tyrant influence usurping right,
Restraining human steps from Freedom's height!
Yearning, we pray, "Our Father, keep us free."

Keep heart, keep heart, our work, if bravely done,
Shall count for God, and though all lands should run
E'en unto measures tyrannous and strong,
Oppressing Truth, uplifting all that's wrong.
Still for a future free and glorious state,
Look, labor, pray, and with all patience wait.

Long has earth suffered for a righteous reign;
Day soon will dawn and Christ will come again.
Around the world and on the sky we see
Inscribed the signals of His jubilee.
Kingly and noble, from his brow of light
Eternal sunshine banishes the night.
Established truth shall rule o'er land and sea;
Redeemed and blessed, God's saints shall then be free.
