## The Genesis of Sunday.

[This article is one of several which appeared in *The Commercial Advertiser* at the time when the New York Legislature had under discussion a bill prohibiting Sunday fishing. It was called out by a statement by Senator O'Connor that Sunday fishing is in harmony with Scripture.]

If the position taken by Senator O'Connor be correct, that fishing on Sunday is justified by Scripture, and the arguments therefor be sound, the question naturally arises, How can Sunday be such a day as is claimed in our times by believers in the Bible when those very Scriptures show that in the apostle's age it was put to secular uses?

The arguments taken from Scripture to show that Sunday was a secular day and the instances of its secularization could be multiplied, if need be, but it better serves the purpose of this article to paes at once from the biblical to the historical consideration of the subject, since Sunday was never made sacred by any biblical writer nor by any writer for several centuries after the apostolical period.

The present status of Sunday is the result of civil law and custom. There is no historical proof in controversies. On the 7th of March, 321, Constantine issued his famous Sunday edict, commanding that there be no labor, except in the fields, on the "venerable day of the sun." This edict contained no allusion to any Christian sentiment. With the pagans comprising the largest portion of the empire, Sunday was already the chief day of the week. It was the day they had consecrated to the worship of the sun. Being already in the habit of abstaining from labor on that day, they were obliged to abstain from secular pursuits on their conversion to Christianity on the Sabbath or sacred day, which the newly adopted religion brought with it.

As the pagan converts became more numerous than the Jewish, and the abstinence from labor on two days—the Sabbath of the Bible and Sunday of Pagandom—was found to be irksome, the two coalesced, and thus Sunday became the sacred day.

Again, to blend as far as possible into one harmonious whole the discordant systems of paganism and Christianity, was the height of Constantine's ambition. As a result, it is charged by Protestants that Christianity was corrupted, and all history and candid scholarship sustain the charge. In order to unite the young and rising faith with the old and waning one compromises were effected, but our theologians are loath to face the fact, and often, being in possession of it, are loath to make it known, that one of these compromises resulted in the overthrow of the Sabbath of the Bible in favor of the Sunday of Pagandom.

Years afterward, when in a controversy, the Puritans of England charged inconsistency on the part of the Episcopalians because they, claiming to be anti-papists, yet observed without scriptural warrant the holidays of the Roman Church, the Puritans were met with the countercharge of similar inconsistency because they observed Sunday, since it, too, was clearly an ecclesiastical institution of papal pagan origin, with as little foundation in Scripture as the various saints' days and holy days of the papacy. To extricate themselves from these straits, scriptural reasons had to be given for their practice.

Nicolaus Bound, a preacher of that time, formulated and promulgated the theory that Sunday had rightly taken the place of the Sabbath, since on that day Christ arose from the dead. In the process of time additional arguments were added to this, and among those arguments is the one that Jesus met his disciples after the resurrection on the first day of the week in honor of that event, and hence thereafter that day became the day of Christian assembly and worship. The disciples, however, did not themselves all this time believe that the resurrection had taken place.

This brings me back to the basis for Senator O'Connor's statement that it is scripturally correct to fish on Sunday, for one of the meetings between Jesus and the disciples took place after they had fished all night and caught nothing, the night being the first part of the day, according to the Biblical division of time. See Gen. 1. Jesus that morning himself commanded them to cast their nets into the sea again, which, according to the story, they raised so full of fish that with difficulty could they lift them.

This is the history of Sunday sacredness, and shows what a shallow institution it is in behalf of which so much legislation is sought, which laws are contrary to our nanational Constitution and subversive of the principles Jesus of Nazareth taught, even if they were in favor of the Sabbath he observed. His teachings, until the time of the pagan butcher Constantine's "conversion," had no help from civil powers, yea, rather the powers of this world opposed the Nazarene. By what principle of Americanism or of Christianity is one man to be forced to observe any particular day according to the notions of another, so long as he does not interfere with another man's rights?

The State's province is in things civil; let the church look after the conduct of its own members in things religious.

The moral natures of both the friends and the opponents of Sunday laws are injured by their existence, the former because they must invent all sorts of hypocritical pretenses for their enforcement and continuance; and the latter because they are also constantly planning devices by which to evade them. When the falsity of the claims for Sunday is shown, and that "holy" day is shown to be a fraud, then its friends begin to talk about the poor laborer, on whose behalf they want the laws enforced. It is true that the laborer needs more rest. He ought to have more than he receives. But who is to determine when he is in need of rest—the minister or the laborer himself?

In justice, I have as much right to demand that one man shall work on Sunday as he has to demand that I shall rest on that particular day. But why should the efforts of Sunday law advocates be confined to rest on Sunday only? Is Sunday rest the only rest the laborer needs?

It is to be hoped that soon the day will come when we shall have a separation of church and state, when each will attend to his own business, and when every citizen will enjoy his own rights without interfering with another. This is American and Christian.
