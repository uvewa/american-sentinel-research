**The Gist of the Whole Matter.**

The strictest interpretation of any one of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, as applied to any particular case, is the only one admissible: for if we, for policy's sake, or to suit some strong element, or a new sentiment, are to relax by degrees and gradually waive the benefits of its protection in the effort to give a broad or so-called "liberal" interpretation, it would be better to commit the act openly and at one blow, for its complete destruction would be but a question of time by the other process. If done openly, no man need be deceived by plausible sophistries into lending his influence towards the destruction of this guardian of our liberties, but could intelligently decide what course to pursue.

The most indifferent man believes it would be wrong to annihilate it at one blow, and the most crafty and designing knows it could not be done. Since it is admittedly wrong to destroy it at one blow, it would also be equally wrong to take the first step in the direction that might end thus by degrees, even though the act was done in innocence or ignorance. The act must be measured by the results that may be produced, and not by what it appears to be.

Notwithstanding these self-evident truths, there are a number of people who seem to be well-meaning who are striving to have the name of God inserted in the Constitution, and to give it an undeniable religious phase; the next step will be to embody in it a religious test for citizenship, for by their own public admission, they do not propose to relax their efforts nor be content until the full measure of their desires become an accomplished fact. If they were pressed to give a definite and satisfactory reason for their course, or required to tell what results are likely to be produced, we believe it would be impossible for them to do so.

Now, concerning religious liberty recognized and guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States as the natural and *inalienable right* of every man: According to a strict interpretation of this provision, we deny the right of any court in the land to try any man on a charge of so-called "Sabbath desecration," *viz.*: because the highest legislative body in the land is enjoined by the Constitution to preserve inviolate every man's right to "worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience," and not according to the "consciences" of some religious zealots, as crystallized into so-called "religious" laws. The only proviso (a reasonable one) being that no man shall interfere with another in the exercise of his rights. The same supreme legislative body is prohibited, in addition, from legislating on any religious question.

Where there is no power to create a law, there can be no law; there can be no violation, nor trial for any so-called "violation," of any "law" passed by such legislative body in usurpation of powers denied to them. Such powers as are denied to the highest legislative body, in the creation of proscribed laws, cannot be passed upon nor interpreted by the Supreme Court, and cannot by right or logic be found in the function of any lesser legislative body or court, for they cannot enact nor enforce anything in contravention to the Constitution of the United States.

Since the civil power, therefore, has no right to create religious laws, there can be no civil judgment of religious matters. Hence, there exists only one view of such matters, viz.: their religious aspect.

For instance, the Sabbath being purely a religious institution, it can be considered only as a matter of religion, and the civil power having no right to deal with religious questions, cannot create a "civil" Sabbath, such as we frequently hear so much about; consequently, from the very nature of the case, there is not, and indeed cannot be such a thing.

Further, the prosecution of anyone for a "violation" of a civil "law" designating any particular day as the "Sabbath," is a violation of that man's sacred and inalienable constitutional rights, regardless of whether he be religious or irreligious. Such an action is a blow at religious liberty, one of the great pillars of our free American Republic, without which the other great pillar of political freedom would not be worth a straw, and the ultimate of such action is to knock these two props from under our beloved country, when the whole fabric of government would fall into a religious despotism or open anarchy.

The man who would deny either of these rights to another ought to be prepared to sacrifice the same for himself. He who deliberately persists in such a course of action is, therefore, to all intents and purposes, a traitor and an anarchist, especially if religious motives impel him, although he may not realize it or mean to be so, even remotely. This sounds harsh, but truth cannot be modified to compromise with error, and there is no other just or logical conclusion in the matter. Truth is the property of no man, but belongs to God, for it is written, "Thy Word is truth," and "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;" and those who, in the blindness of their error, array themselves against the light of palpable truth, are denying the Word of God. For such the only remedy lies in the convicting power of the Holy Spirit.

CHAS. L. MANNING.
