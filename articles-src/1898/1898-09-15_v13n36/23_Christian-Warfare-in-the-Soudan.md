"Christian" Warfare in the Soudan.

"New York Journal."

According to London dispatches, "there were no wounded Mahdists left after the battle of Omdurman. Cruel and bloodthirsty as it may seem, the wounded, almost without exception, were massacred by the British and Egyptian soldiers." Since Gordon's death, it is stated, "this has been the custom."

Thus is Christian civilization introduced and commended to the benighted heathen of the Soudan.

Naturally, the massacring being done by Englishmen, it is done from wise and benevolent motives. But when the Japanese soldiers, infuriated by seeing the mutilated corpses of tortured comrades, fell upon their Chinese prisoners at Port Arthur and wreaked vengeance, the whole Christian world, including England, held up its white hands in horror and cried that these Orientals, in spite of their veneer of Western manners, were still ruthless barbarians.

And when the Journal made it known that the Cubans had put to death four Spanish guerillas—the practice of such guerillas being to fire on the wounded as the latter were being borne to the hospitals—the chorus of denunciation of the Cubans as sanguinary savages rose to the international skies.

In the case of the Soudanese, however, it is explained that "a wounded fanatic is more dangerous almost than a well one." Therefore it is expedient to put wounded fanatics out of the way. And we do not need to be told at this late day that whatever Englishmen find it expedient to do in war or peace becomes, by the fact, pleasing in the sight of heaven.

The English are singularly like ourselves, and other people.
