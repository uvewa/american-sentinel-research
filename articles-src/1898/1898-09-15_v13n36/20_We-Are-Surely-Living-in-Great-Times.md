In an article contributed to *The Independent*, on Russia's Peace Proposition, Prof. Benjamin Ide Wheeler recognizes the momentous nature of the present hour, in these words:—

> "We are surely living in great times. Events are all on the grand scale. It seems almost as if history were conscious of the division of time by centuries, and were hastening to make out a balance sheet."

The thoughtful observer, whether a believer in prophecy or not, sees that we have reached a time which answers to the description which prophecy gives for the last days.
