## The Unfolding of Two Principles.—I.

### OUTWARD AND INWARD SUBMISSION.

THERE is no youth past the age of twelve who has not had an experience by which he may be enabled to comprehend the difference between the two principles that underlie two kinds of government. The government that is simply outward, that compels an action that is dissented from in the heart, is one with which we have all had more or less to do,—one in which we ourselves have acted a part of governor or officer as well as subject.

For illustration, a child is found playing at some innocent game, and an irritable father, who fails to consider his own rights or the rights of his child, uses his power to compel the child to cease his play. Burning with rebellion within, the child yields an outward submission, but the seeds of tyranny sown in his rebellion bear fruit in his action toward others; for he in turn compels his younger brothers, or weaker playmates, to submit to his wishes.

This kind of control or government is simply the control or government of selfishness, backed by power to compel an outward submission. But there is a more powerful government, and the principle upon which it is based is the principle of love. This is illustrated by the dealings of a loving father with his beloved son. Such a father does not ask his child to cease from that which is innocent, and is invading no right of others. Full of gentle tenderness, full of desire for his son's happiness and highest success, he asks him (for instance) to give up the cigarette habit, reasoning with him of its hurtfulness, persuading him by his own example, until won in heart, he yields obedience to his father whose government is based on love.

### DESIGNED FOR ALL CREATURES.

This is the manner of government designed of God for all creatures. In it is a liberty to do good wide as creation, kind as sunshine. The principle of love is the basis of true government, and indeed is proved to be the only substantial basis for government. It is by the principle of love that all things consist or hold together. Once let this principle die, and speedy disintegration follows. Where love is lacking the family separates, the government declines: for love is the basis of trust, and without trust no commercial or political relation can be sustained, much less social. Let love die out and the whole fabric of society would crumble, the whole relation of worlds would be disestablished.

## BASIS OF UNIVERSE.

God is love. Were he not love, there could be no universe. Were his characteristics developed in all his creatures, a government would exist upon earth as in heaven, and his will would be done upon earth as it is done in heaven. The law of God would be in each heart, and as his law is the expression of his character, every one would be like God, and would thereby be enabled to love his neighbor as himself. But this glorious government of love has been sadly marred on earth. Not only in the government of the family is it distorted, and force is employed to compel outward submission to unjust commands, in which the heart has no part; but even the governments of states and kingdoms wield the sword to enforce unjust enactments in the name of law, supposed to be for the preservation of society. But behind all human enactments in the home or the state still works the power of love, which is indeed the only power after all to keep humanity together.

How can we account for this foreign element that has entered into government? How is it that God being love, and by virtue of this character existing as universal sovereign, there exists another manner of government, based on a principle antagonistic to the principle of love.

## THE BEGINNING.

This question takes us back to the beginning. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made."

This beginning, back of which no one can penetrate, presents to us God and the Word, or the expression of God revealed and made visible. Of him it is written again, "God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son [or the Word] whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high." Heb. 1:1-3. Again it is written, "Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature: for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist [or hold together]." Col. 1:15, 16, 17. The Son of God reveals to the universe that God who dwells in light unapproachable, who is immortal, invisible, before whom the highest intelligences of heaven veil their faces.

## THE OBJECT OF CREATION.

Christ manifested the character of omnipotent Love in the creation: for every work reflects the character of its author. Angels, man, the beasts of the fields, the fowls of the heaven, the wonders of the sea, the splendors of space, all tell one story—the love of God. All were created for one purpose,—to proclaim and exemplify the government of love. "For the invisible things of him [his qualities of character] from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead." Rom. 1:20.
