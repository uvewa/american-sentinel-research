However the czar's peace proposal may be received in various lands by the people, events are already mocking at the plan by precipitating a war crisis more serious than has arisen before in years. The dissolution of the Austrian throne—and with that of the empire—which may follow the assassination of the empress Elizabeth, is regarded as a source of much danger to the peace of Europe, but more serious than this is the news that a French force has established itself directly in the path of British conquest in the Soudan. British ambition has as one of its brightest dreams a railway running all the way in British territory from Cairo to Cape Town; and no rival power may think to shatter that dream with impunity. An imperial ruler may propose peace, but imperial ambition never dreams of it.
