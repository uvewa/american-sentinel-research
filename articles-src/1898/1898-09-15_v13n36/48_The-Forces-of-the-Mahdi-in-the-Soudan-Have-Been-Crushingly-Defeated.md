The forces of the Mahdi in the Soudan have been crushingly defeated by the British and Egyptian forces that have been penetrating southward into the heart of the dark continent under the command of General Kitchener. For the first time since rapid-firing guns were invented, an opportunity was afforded at this battle to test the effectiveness of these weapons against a large army of courageous fighters; and the resulting slaughter seems to have fully justified the expectations of their inventors. The Arabs were mowed down like grass, and more than 10,000 of them lay dead upon the plains when the firing ceased,—as great a number as were killed on both sides at the battle of Gettysburg. Though the Madhi's army was treble the size of the British and Egyptian force, and fought with the most reckless courage, the whole loss of the latter was less than three hundred men.
