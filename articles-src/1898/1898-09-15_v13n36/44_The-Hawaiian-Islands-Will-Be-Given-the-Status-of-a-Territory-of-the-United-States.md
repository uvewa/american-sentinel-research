The Hawaiian Islands, it is said, will be given the status of a Territory of the United States, being governed as such Territories are upon the American Continent. In time, they may be admitted as a State of the Union. Porto Rico will probably be put upon the same footing. Previous to this United States territory has been acquired by purchase or treaty; but the natural method of imperialism is by conquest.
