## Studies in French History.—38.

"About this time," began Professor Carman, "there was to be an emperor elected for Germany, and, true to his ambitious nature, King Francis I., joins in the mad race with Henry, of England, and Charles, of Spain. The King of Spain, though at this time only nineteen, was a very cunning fellow, having as much foresight and diplomacy as an old man, so he was able to outwit the others, and was finally crowned Emperor of Germany, Charles V."

"I can pretty easily imagine that King Francis wouldn't like that one bit," remarked Milly Brown, "for I remember that he was a very self-willed fellow."

"Yes, Milly, he was fond of having his own way, and he was quite used to having it, too; and so now he could hardly endure the thought that another should be preferred before himself. You know he was called 'The King of the Gentlemen.'"

"I dare say he thought his rival was not a gentleman, to take away the honor from him," said Max Smith.

"Yes, he hated the Spanish king most fiercely, and as long as he lived, he tried to injure him in every way possible. He tried to gain the sympathy and friendship of the English king, but in this also the young Spaniard outstripped him in the race, for Henry was quite won over to his cause before the tardy Francis could ingratiate himself into Henry's good graces."

"I wouldn't give very much for that kind of friendship," said Julia March.

"No; such friendship is worth but little to anybody. When Francis found that King Charles had secured the royal friendship of England as well as the crown of Germany, his disgust and anger knew no bounds; so the foolish fellow at once declared war against him."

"Maybe he thought he could whip him as easily as he did the Milan folks," said Fred Green.

"But the trouble was," said the professor, "his success in Italy was turning into a defeat; for he had hired some Swiss soldiers to help hold the territory for him, and now they suddenly left the French army and ran off home."

"I had understood, someway, that the Swiss helped the Italians," said Edna.

"Many of them did, but these men had been *hired* to help France, and now they claimed they could get no pay for their services, so they ran away, and Milan reverted again to Italy."

"I can't understand why the French king was not more sensible. Didn't he know that soldiers want their pay—and especially foreign soldiers?" asked practical Jack.

"O, he did not forget to send them their wages, my boy; he was too cunning and, let us hope, too just to forget that. But it was afterwards proved that the king's mother had kept the money her son sent for the soldiers, and spent it all for herself."

"The selfish creature!" exclaimed Florence Ray. "What was her name?"

"Louisa, of Savoy," replied Professor Carman.

"I think I remember reading her name in history," said Edna Phillips, "in connection with the Duke of Burgundy."

"I presume you are thinking of Duke Charles, of Bourbon—not Burgundy—this scheming woman tried to win the affections of this man, who was at that time Constable of France, and one of the greatest men in the country. Because she could not do this, she became his bitterest enemy, and coaxed her son the king to so torment and persecute him, that at last the foolish fellow turned traitor to his country and joined the Emperor of Germany—King of Spain—against France."

"I dare say the Spaniards made a great deal of him after he left the French and joined them," suggested Jenin Jacobs.

"You are quite mistaken, Jenin; for instead of that they despised him."

"Nobody likes a traitor,—he's not to be trusted," said Joe Palmeter.

"No; for you will remember that even the English had no respect for Benedict Arnold."

"France now had three powerful enemies," continued the teacher, "the King of England, the King of Spain, and the traitor duke,—all were plotting her ruin."

"Poor Francis!" exclaimed Milly Brown; "he must have had his hands full."

"He did, and yet he was insane enough in the midst of all his troubles again to rush over into Italy to try to recover his lost territory."

"O dear!" again exclaimed Milly. "How foolish of him! do tell us what became of him."

"Why, he was taken prisoner and carried over to Madrid, where he was kept in close confinement a long time. But at last he made a most humiliating treaty with the King of Spain, in which he promised to give up a considerable portion of his country to him, besides other considerations."

"I don't see how the Spanish king could be at all sure that Francis would do as he agreed if he let him have his liberty," said practical Jack.

"I presume he was afraid of treachery," said the teacher, "at any rate, he sent and brought the two little sons of Francis and kept them as a surety, before he would let their father go. But even then he did not keep the first particle of his agreement, and as soon as his feet touched his native soil, he exclaimed fiercely: 'Now I am again a king.'"

"Don't you think he ought to have kept his promise," asked Julia March, "even if it was humiliating for him?"

"He certainly ought to have kept his word, but he did not, nor did he accept the invitation which the King of Spain sent him, to return to Spain at once as his prisoner. But as the pope had by this time become angry with the Spanish king, Francis found in him a ready ally. So he at once entered into another 'Holy League' with the crafty pope, and hostilities continued."

"I should think if the league had been very 'holy' at this would have put an end to the fighting," smiled Joe Palmeter.
