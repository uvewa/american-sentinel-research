# NEWS, NOTES, AND COMMENT

A correspondent who professes a strict adherence to the principles of the Christian religion, writes us that he has no use for the SENTINEL because it teaches that Christians cannot consistently participate in civil government. He says he is taught, and fully indorses the idea that it is his duty to "use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government;" but "when I go to the ballot box and exercise the right of a citizen of a civil government, I am told that I am mixing in politics and bringing a reproach upon my profession as a Christian. In fact, I am told by the SENTINEL that if I am a Christian I am not a citizen of any earthly or civil government, but simply a citizen of the kingdom of heaven."

***

Yes; that it what the SENTINEL teaches; and it teaches it because it teaches the separation of church and state. And in teaching this separation it wants to be consistent, and not teach separation of church and state in one place, and union of church and state in another place. Let us briefly consider the matter.

***

We say that church and state should be kept separate, because they belong in different spheres of action. The church is set in the world to be the channel of the love of God, flowing down to the sinner, offering him mercy, and bidding him escape the penalty of his transgression of the law. The state, on the other hand, is established to lay the hand of force upon the transgressor and without mercy proceed to deter him and all evil-minded persons from the commission of crime, by inflicting the penalty prescribed by the law he has transgressed. Unite the two, and force would interfere with love, and love with force; mercy with justice, and justice with mercy. Each would nullify the other, and the good purposes of both God and man would fall to the ground. There would be no gospel to win souls to righteousness, and no guarantee of protection to men in the enjoyment of their rights.

***

The state is a political institution. It is of the world; for politics cannot be separated from the world. It opens its doors to all classes. To shut any class of the people out of politics—to deprive them of political privileges—would be a flagrant injustice. And it would be an unheard-of thing even to suggest that political rights should be denied to the worldly-minded. No separation of politics from the world can be thought of. Worldliness must be in politics; it has a right there; and as a matter of fact it is there and always has been. And we may look in vain to find a more complete embodiment of every principle of worldliness than politics affords.

***

POLITICS means force. Every ballot that is cast means force. There is no mercy in it, no persuasion, no love. Its word is inexorable,—carried out, if need be, by bullet and bayonet. It represents government by force, and that alone.

***

CHRISTIANITY, on the other hand, is not of this world. It contains not one element of worldliness. Were one such element mixed with it, it would no longer be Christianity. The Christian must therefore be separate from the world. He is not of the world, but has been chosen out from the world. It is Christ himself who has done this. And those who have thus been called out from the world constitute the ecclesia, the church of Christ.

***

CAN the Christian, then, maintain his separation from the world, and at the same time take part in that which is of the world? Can he represent both a government of love and a government of force? Can he practice both politics and Christianity? Can he be both a part of the state and a part of the church? And can he do all this without uniting, in his own self, church and state?

***

CAN he be a part of the state and at the same time be separate from the state? or a part of the church and at the same time separate from the church? Since he cannot, as is obvious, can church and state both be joined to him without being joined to each other? Obviously, he himself is, in such a case, the joining element in their union.

***

OUR correspondent does not believe in a union of church and state. He would not have the legislature enact religious laws; he is as much opposed to that as anyone. He would not have the legislature or any state body act in a religious capacity. But he says it is all right, and even a duty, for an individual representing the state to do this very thing. The individual voter is no less truly a part of the state than is the body of individuals known as the legislature; the state is represented as truly by the one as by the other. In each case the same principle is involved—that of state participation in religion.

***

This is not a mere theory. It is what the people are doing in practice; it is what they are exhorted to do by the men who believe the state ought to be religious. It is just the way in which they propose to make the state religious; that is, by the votes of the people. All they want is to get a preponderance of religious votes; and they are continually exhorting the church members to put their religion into their votes. This is what they mean by a "Christian vote." And certainly, if a Christian is to vote, he ought to vote as a Christian. "Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus," is the rule of Christianity. The Christian cannot lay aside this rule when he comes to the ballot box.

* * *

There being a "Christian vote," there must of course be "Christian politics;" and of "Christian politics" we are hearing on all sides. And when the "Christian politicians" can command in behalf of their schemes sufficient "Christian votes" to put the mold of such politics upon the state, we shall then have a "Christian state." And then, by extending the "Christian state" to the various lands of the earth, by "Christian" and "humanitarian" wars, etc., they will have all the world made Christian and then will come the millennium! And all this starts with the "Christian vote;" all of it grows out of the idea that the Christian ought to take part in politics.

* * *

All this, we are told, will not be a union of church and state. Oh no; the people who want this are as much opposed to union of church and state, they assure us, as anyone can be! And they are just as consistent as the person who says it is a Christian's duty to vote, but does not believe in a religious state. The "Christian vote" is simply the first step in the development of church and state union in full. Union of church and state in the individual is the starting point of union of church and state in the legislature, and in the nation. Let professors of religion go into politics, and union of church and state will inevitably follow. Let them keep out of politics, and no union of church and state would ever be possible.

* * *

And because the SENTINEL will not be so inconsistent as to approve of church and state union in the individual, while denouncing it in the nation at large, our correspondent says he has no use for the SENTINEL. Very well; it may be there are many more who hold to the same view. But if they had all the use in the world for the SENTINEL, that would be of little value to the cause for which it stands; for that cause cannot be helped on by inconsistency. Sooner or later, when the controversy shall have waxed too warm for inconsistency to hide itself, such individuals will be obliged to take their stand squarely on one side or the other of this great question. But far better is it to go to the root of the matter now, stand squarely on the foundation principle of separation between church and state, and not be obliged to shift from one position to another in the crisis of the battle that is coming.
