MRS. HOBSON is not an example of the "new woman;" no doubt can exist on this point. Yet what higher type of woman has civilization developed? What higher type has been furnished by the "new" ideal of womanhood? What higher type, indeed, does the nation need? In this we take into account the fact that the highest training is that which trains the character for God; but in this training the foundation is laid in the inculcation of manly principles,—in the development of love for justice, mercy, and truth.
