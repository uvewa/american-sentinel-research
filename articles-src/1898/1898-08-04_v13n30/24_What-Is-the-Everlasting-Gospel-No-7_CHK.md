The everlasting gospel is the Word of God. This will be seen by comparing verses 23 and 25 of Colossians 1st chapter, where in the one text the Apostle Paul says he was made a minister of the gospel, while in the other he says he was made a minister to "fully preach the word of God" (margin).

The word of God is the truth (John 17:17); therefore the gospel itself is the truth. Col. 1:9.

All truth must be consistent with itself.

It is impossible therefore for the gospel to call anyone to that which is not the truth.

We have seen however that the everlasting gospel of Rev. 14:6, 7 calls upon all "them that dwell on the earth, . . . every nation, kindred, tongue, and people," to "fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters." This it has been shown is nothing less than a call to keep the commandments of God.

But as stated above, the gospel cannot call one to anything that is not the truth, and as it calls on all to keep the commandments, it follows that the commandments themselves are truth. And this we know is so, for we read, "Thou art near, O Lord; and all thy commandments are truth." Ps. 119:151.

It is not enough to say that the gospel is truth. It is that to be sure, but it is a great deal more than that; it is the truth. That is to say, the gospel is not simply a part of a great whole, but it is the whole thing itself; it is the sum of all truth. And this is because the gospel is simply Christ himself, and he is "the truth." John 14:6. There is no truth outside of Christ.

Nor is it enough to say that the commandments are simply truth, and a part of a great whole. As we have seen, God's law is truth. And it is more; it is "the truth." It is not a part, but the whole truth. Hence we read again: "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness; and thy law is the truth." Ps. 119:142.

From this it will appear that there is practically no difference between the law and the gospel—they are both "the truth," and the truth is Jesus Christ.

What then is the real object of the preaching of the everlasting gospel of Rev. 14:6, 7 to earth's remotest bounds? As it reads it is that all men should "fear God and give glory to him . . . and worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters." This however is a call to keep the commandments of God—a matter of absolute necessity in the one who fears God.

But we have seen that the commandments are "the truth," and also that Jesus Christ is "the truth;" therefore the real object of the everlasting gospel is to call men to Jesus Christ and the fulness that is in him.

This of course is what the gospel has ever been; but it is here (Rev. 14:6, 7) emphasized in view of the fact that the mark of the beast (papacy) is to be enforced upon the consciences of the people; and which can only result, to them that yield, in their being drawn away from Jesus Christ. To save people from this it is necessary that they should know the relation of the commandments of God to Jesus Christ, that they may know that the rejection of the one is the rejection of the other.

Let us for a moment look a little further at the law of God. Speaking of this law the Psalmist says, "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth." Now that which is true of any thing as a whole, must be true of all its parts. It will therefore follow that the law as a whole, being the truth, it is equally true that all its parts are truth.

That law is set forth in the ten commandments. It must therefore be true that each one of the commandments spoken of separately is truth; and that any one of them is as much the truth as any one of the others; and all of them together are necessary to make up the whole.

All this is as certain as that two and two are four. Each of the commandments being truth, and all of them together being "the truth," it must be evident that any thing that is not in harmony with any one of them can not be truth, and is therefore to be rejected.

But the fourth precept of the law plainly states that the seventh day is the Sabbath. This is the truth. Any other day therefore claiming to be the Sabbath is in direct conflict with the fourth commandment, and with the law as a whole. And that being so, Sunday, which is the first day of the week, cannot be the Sabbath, is not the truth, and is therefore to be rejected.

Furthermore, the law is the truth, and the gospel is the truth. This being so it must be mathematically true that whatever is not in harmony with the one, can not possibly be in harmony with the other.

As therefore Sunday is not in harmony with the law, it likewise is not in harmony with the gospel; being no part of the law, it is also no part of the gospel, and has therefore no connection with Jesus Christ.
