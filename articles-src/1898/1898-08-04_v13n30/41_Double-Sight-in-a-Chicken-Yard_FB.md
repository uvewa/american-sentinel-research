WELL, Hanner, I've been in the chicken yard,
A seein' some double sights.
It's putty middlin kinder hard
For the weak ones to get their rights.
Old chanticleer of the blooded stock
Showed nary a courteous feather.
He scratched for himself, and not for the flock,
And the strong ones huddled together.
The weak and the old and the little blows
Were kicked and pecked and scattered.
If I hadn't a owned them all, I s'pose
I wouldn't a thought it mattered.
But suddenly I felt full of wrath,
And I made it understood;
Fur I cleared them big fellers out of the path,
And gave all the other ones food.
I took a rake from the top of the fence,
And kept 'em all at a distance,
And gave 'em a chance to have a sense
Of a stronger one's resistance.
I gave 'em a lecture on chickens' rights,
And the danger in greed and rulin'
And Hanner I saw some double sights
That was most as good as a skewlin'.
Fur it 'peared the world was a chicken yard,
And the weak gave way to the stronger;
But a Watcher saw how his plan was marred,
And waited a little longer.
And it 'peared I heard a whispered sound,
And saw a double sight;
Fur I heerd that the Owner of men all round,
Will suddenly set things right.
