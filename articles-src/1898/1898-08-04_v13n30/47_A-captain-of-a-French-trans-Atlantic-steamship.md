A CAPTAIN of a French trans-Atlantic steamship recently took his vessel about one hundred miles north of his regular course, to gain time, with the result that he gained so much time for most of those on board that they reached the further end of their life journey at a single bound. There is never any time gained profitably by going out of the course of duty.
