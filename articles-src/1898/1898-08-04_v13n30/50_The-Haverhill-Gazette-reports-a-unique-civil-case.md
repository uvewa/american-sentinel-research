THE Haverhill Gazette (Haverhill, Mass.) of July 21, reports "a unique civil case" which was tried the previous day in the city court. The defendant conducted an eating saloon and fruit store, in which he was tenant, and the plaintiff sought to secure his ejection from the premises on the ground that he had been doing business on Sunday. Thus the Sunday laws continue to be invoked.
