THE religious papers have been calling attention to the prominence of the religious element in the navy of which all the country is so proud. Admiral Sampson, it is said, is a member of the Church of the Covenant, in Washington. Admiral Dewey is a member of the Episcopal Church. Commodore Watson is Elder Watson in St. John's Church, San Francisco. Captain Philip's denominational connection is not given, but from his speech made at the sinking of Cervera's ships, it is evident he is a devout communicant somewhere. Lieutenant Hobson was president of a Y. M. C. A. in his native State. And it may be remarked in passing that the able fighters who battle without firearms in this country are mostly members in good and regularly standing in the Roman Catholic communion. We fear there is much in all this to justify the saying made by the irreverent that it takes religion to make a good fighter.
