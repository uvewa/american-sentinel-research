IT is proper parental training that creates material for patriots. The true patriot is nothing more or less than the noble man. Patriotism is not shown by fighting; the worst men will fight as readily as any others, or more so. Patriotism of the true sort is shown by unselfishness in sacrificing for the good of others. True patriots are made in the home, not in the public school; and through the development of right principles of conduct rather than by being drilled in patriotic phrases. It is the life of the true patriot that counts, and not the death. It is living for country, rather than dying for it, that makes patriotism worth to any country what it is.
