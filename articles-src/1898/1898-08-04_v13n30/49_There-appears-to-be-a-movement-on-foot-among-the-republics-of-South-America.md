THERE appears to be a movement on foot among the republics of South America, having in view their common defense against possible Anglo-Saxon encroachment. It is evident that they look with suspicion upon the turn which the United States has taken in conducting her war with Spain, and this no doubt is not in any wise allayed by the rumors of an Anglo-Saxon alliance.
