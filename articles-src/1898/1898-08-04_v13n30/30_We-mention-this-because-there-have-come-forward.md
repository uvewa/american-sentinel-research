WE mention this because there have come forward at the present time certain new ideals of womanhood and of patriotism which may well be challenged before being received into favor. We have to-day before us the "new woman." No definition or description of her need be furnished to any intelligent observer; examples of the new genus are too numerous to require that. The development of the "new woman" means that the former type was not, under any circumstances, a full success. Something more was needed before such success in the sphere of womanhood could be realized, and the "new woman" represents the reaching out for this further attainment. So it appears from the point of view of a certain class of the people.
