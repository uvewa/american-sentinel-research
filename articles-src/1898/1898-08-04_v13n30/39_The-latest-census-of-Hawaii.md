THE latest census of Hawaii gives the number and classes of the inhabitants as follows: "Of pure Hawaiians, there were 31,019; of part Hawaiian blood, 8,045; of Japanese, 24,407; of Chinese, 21,616; of Portuguese, 15,191; leaving 8,302 Americans and Europeans." The 8,300 Americans and Europeans, of course, are "the people," especially the Americans.
