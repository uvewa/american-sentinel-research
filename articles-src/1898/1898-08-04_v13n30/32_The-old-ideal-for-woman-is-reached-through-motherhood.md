THE old ideal for woman is reached through motherhood. The new ideal is attained by a different way. While not professedly antagonistic to the old, its essential opposition to it is instinctively felt and recognized. The "new woman" and the woman whose chief claim to recognition is her well trained children are not expected to be one and the same person. The "new woman" is expected to make a name directly for herself, by her own achievements in fields hitherto undertrodden by her sex, rather than to become eminent by making a name for another. Measured by the principle of unselfishness, the difference between the two becomes strongly marked.
