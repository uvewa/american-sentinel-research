CERTAIN bishops in the Episcopal Church have admonished their clergy not to preach on topics connected with our war with Spain. Recently the Presbyterian Ministers' Association, of Richmond, Va., formerly declared their "conviction that, while ministers and people in public and private should pray God's blessing upon our rulers, upon the officers and men of the army and navy, and that peace with honor may soon be established, yet it is the duty of ministers to proclaim from their pulpits at all times nothing but the glorious gospel of the blessed God, according to our commission from the great Head of the church."
