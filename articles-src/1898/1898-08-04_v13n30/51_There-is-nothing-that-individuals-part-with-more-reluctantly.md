THERE is nothing that individuals part with more reluctantly than with a thing of such little worth as an opinion; their own opinion, of course. When Peter said to his Lord, "Lo, we have left all and followed thee," he was still holding fast, as events showed, to his own opinion about the kingdom of God; and the other disciples were doing the same. If men would hold as fast to the Word of God as they do to their opinions, their moral footing would be vastly more stable than it is.
