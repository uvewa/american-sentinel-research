THE nation has special need of all women who can excel in the sphere of motherhood. The world has always needed such more than any or all others. And no names among women have more inherited the reverence of mankind than have those of the mothers of its eminent men. The mother of Moses, and the mother of Samuel, the mother of Wesley, and the mother of Washington,—these and many more that might be named survive in history to present before us the true ideal to be reached in the sphere of womanly endeavor. The "new woman," meanwhile, has yet to demonstrate that she is a necessity or even an advantage in any sphere of social and moral life.
