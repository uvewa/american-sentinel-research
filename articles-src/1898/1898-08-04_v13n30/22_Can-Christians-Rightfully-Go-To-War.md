I should think not. And I think so even though it becomes necessary to differ in opinion from the greatest pulpiteers of the world.

What a good thing it is for a humble Christian that he need not take his conceptions of duty from great men, not even from great preachers.

Three millions of slaves, embruted by the lash, and hardened by severest labor, understood inspiration at first hand, from God's lips at Sinai, and from Moses' lips for forty years afterward. Fishermen understood Christ, and the "common people heard him gladly." Then of course common people can understand his words now, and all the words of Scripture, as well as can the great preachers, and with a prayer for the Holy Spirit for guidance, all may and will see Bible teaching alike, while preachers differ. Their learning has often too much "higher criticism" in it.

Bible words just as they stand are not final authority to many of the preachers.

And what do Bible words say on the war question? Why they say to those who love God, "All ye are brethren." "Love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous." "We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."

All who love God are related one to another, and these brethren of the Lord and of one another are scattered over the world, through all countries.

They are of all churches and all nationalities, and can they "love as brethren," "be pitiful, be courteous" as brethren, and yet meet in deadly battle and fire into one another's faces? Can a Christian say to a man, Brother, I love you, and at the same time plunge a bayonet into his brother's heart? Would it be possible to express a heart full of affection for a brother and at the same time blow the brother's brains out just because that brother lived on the other side of some national boundary that separated the two nations to which these men belonged?

Could a Christian yearn in care and kindness for a brother of another nation, and fire the other's home, drive away his family, and loot his household goods?

Would it be in accordance with these quoted words of the Lord and his apostles, for a ship manned with Christians to aim, some day during worship hours, a monster gun, at a town where Christians dwelt, and send a shell into a worshipping congregation, perhaps a Bible school of little scholars, and maim and slay a score or two?

When Christ was here he bore blows, hard words, shameful spitting on, and even a slave's dreadful death, with never a return blow, though an army of angels was at his call.

He lived as he would have his followers live. Can it be thought that if Christ were here now, he would lead the troops in some terrific charge, or command a fleet in furious battle? And if it be answered that such action by him is not by any means credible to our minds, or conceivable, then where do we get any warrant whatever for thinking that his followers may take part in scenes of blood, willingly, and with desire to mangle, and maim, and slaughter?

No doubt the Heavenly Father wishes, and the great Elder Brother wishes you and me, Christian brother, to live just such lives as they would live if they lived just here in our places.
