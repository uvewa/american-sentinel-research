THE men in power, commonly spoken of as the government, are not the government itself, but merely servants who are placed in positions of power as executives to enforce the government upon the people; they are not the power itself, but they possess and wish the power for a limited time.

Government is an intangible, impersonal force which is omnipresent within its prescribed boundaries. It is intangible, because if the executives be removed and their places remain vacated, the force itself is no longer brought to view and no man can place his hand on it and say, "Lo, it is here; or, lo, it is there." It is everywhere, but the presence of the officials makes its power felt more in their presence than elsewhere, or in such places or upon such persons as they may direct by law.

Being impersonal it has no soul, hence cannot be saved; and no individual need ever fear that they will meet this or any other government in heaven lording it over the saints. But every soul which is a true child of God, a true Christian, and none other,—not simply by profession, but in reality,—will be there, and should a million supreme courts impute Christianity to this Government, it would still be insufficient to give it enough Christian character to save it and admit it to the New Jerusalem.

Our form of government "derives its just powers from the consent of the governed," and if it be true that "this is a Christian nation," then Christianity must be one of its "just powers." And if that be true, then we have no further need of Jesus Christ as a Saviour, for the Government may then exercise its power and compel us to accept its "Christianity" and be saved according to the plan it may prescribe, even against our will. That would be tyranny; and it is impossible for a true Christian to be a tyrant.

But this is not "a Christian nation," for while it "derives its just powers from the consent of the governed," no man can impute righteousness, nor delegate his Christianity or any portion of it, to another or to the government. It then remains for those who contend that "this is a Christian nation," to explain from whence it derives this one of its "just powers," and how an intangible, impersonal force can accept that which is designed solely for the individual.
