AS THINGS are constituted in this world, it is not possible for woman to accomplish the work—to compass the achievements—that can be done by man. The superior strength of his sex carries him up the farthest heights of human attainment. But the preparation of the man for such achievements is confided to the hand of woman; and thus, as a mother, her position is one of the highest responsibility and of honor. "The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world," but it rules the world only through the cradle.
