A GLIMPSE at the conditions prevailing in the provinces of Cuba outside of Santiago, which is now under American control, is furnished by the following appeal which has been addressed to Rear-Admiral Sampson by citizens of Cienfuegos:—

"Honorable Sir: The Cubans, old men, women, and children, resident in the town of Cienfuegos and this neighborhood, are all dying of hunger. The young men are all in the field with the Cuban troops and have not shoes, neither food. All the provisions in this town are in the hands of the Spaniards. Cubans cannot obtain a piece of bread, as it is necessary to send everything to the field. The Weyler's system is in his way. The situation is terrible.

"If you, honorable sir, do not come quick with your squadron in our help and take possession of this town, we shall be lost. We beg you to precipitate your operations. About five thousand old men, women, and children shall die of hunger in this poor town. Some of these old men have four or five sons fighting for his freedom. This is our horrible situation.

"If the great people of the United States do not come quick in our help we are lost.

"SOME CUBANS."

Thus far death has no doubt brought more relief to the starving people than have the forces of the Americans.
