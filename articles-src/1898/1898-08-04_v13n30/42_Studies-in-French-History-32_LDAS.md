"WELL, what had I promised you to-day?" asked Professor Carman, taking his place at his desk.
"You were going to tell us something about Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, I believe," said Milly Brown.
"Yes; it seems that he must have been a very fiery-tempered, hot-headed fellow, or he never would have attempted to carry out so many warlike schemes."

"I presume he was a little vain of his good looks and fine proportion. Don't you think that helped to make him ambitious for a higher place of honor?" asked Julia March.
"Perhaps so; pride and ambition go hand in hand almost always. But at last he made up his mind to let Louis XI. alone; so he turned his quarrelsome eyes over to Switzerland."
"What! did he pick a quarrel with those honest Swiss people just for the fun of quarreling?" asked Will Palmeter.
"No, not just for that, I suppose; but he was ambitious and he wanted fame as well as riches,—and he got it,—but not the fame of a proud victor. The Swiss fought for their honor and their country, and they were victorious. Charles was driven back at the famous battle of Granson, at which place he lost not only many men, but a vast amount of wealth."
"Why, I can't see what he wanted to take much wealth with him for, if he was going to fight. What good did he think that would do him?" asked practical Jack Smith.
"He wanted to impress the poor peasants with his grandeur; so he took large quantities of solid silver plate with him, besides a very valuable crown, which was completely covered with precious gems."
"O, the foolish man!" said Florence Ray. "Just imagine George Washington loading down his boat with gold and silver when he crossed the Delaware and took so many Hessian prisoners!"
"Or imagine Dewey attacking the Spaniards at the Philippines with his big ships full of gold and silver, and crowns and pretty things, instead of cannon!" exclaimed Rob Billings.
"Yes; and I have not yet told you of the most foolish, senseless part of his cargo;—just think of it! He took with him to the bloody fields of battle a great array of costly cloth,—pieces of luxurious velvets, and hundreds of yards of elegant silks, besides yards and yards of cloth of gold, which together formed an array of magnificence and luxury almost priceless."
"Why!" exclaimed Joe Palmeter. "It was in pretty nearly as bad taste as it was for those kings of France who went to fight the crusades to drag along with them a lot of feeble women and crying children."
"Surely; you are right. Who can give me the name of any French king who did that thing?" asked Professor Carman.
"I think Louis VI. is one of the first who allowed women to go to war," timidly suggested Milly Brown. "Father was speaking of it this morning."
"Yes; this was in the twelfth century."
"Charles the Bold was not very sensible, you see, or he would have known better than to trust such valuables so far away from home. Nowadays if a fine lady wears a quantity of diamonds to a grand party, she hires a detective to keep watch near her all the time, but although Charles was just as foolish he was not as wise as the vain women of our own day. Of course in the defeat which followed, he was glad enough to escape with his life, and leave his vast riches behind him."

"I wonder if the Swiss people were not awfully glad to get the silver and diamonds and things," said Maggie Palmeter, who had always longed to be rich and to have magnificent things.

"Perhaps not 'awfully' glad, Maggie; I hardly think that is just the right adverb to use to express what you probably mean. I think, however, that they were very glad of such a victory. But really, the silver and valuable cloth were considered almost worthless, and they supposed that the solid, massive plate worth thousands of dollars, was pewter, and sold it as such, while the velvets and silks and cloth of gold were carelessly measured off and sold for a few cents per yard."

"My! wouldn't I like to buy some of it!" exclaimed Milly, with sparkling eyes.

"I am almost afraid, Milly, it would not do you any more real good than it did the Swiss. The duke also lost a very valuable diamond, which was found by a poor fellow in the road, and which he sold for a trifle, thinking it to be a pretty piece of glass. It had once been worn by a great Indian prince. The foolish duke was also vain enough to carry with him bushels of money, which of course he lost."

"He must have been very rich!" exclaimed Harry Ray.

"He was when he started, but he was not nearly so rich when he went back home."

"I suppose he got enough of fighting the Swiss that time, and was glad to stay at home," suggested Will Palmeter.

"O no; he was by no means satisfied yet; he felt sure he could punish the Swiss, and I presume he thought he might perhaps recover some of his money and valuables; so he sallied out again, giving himself and his silly followers a rest of only three months. The battle of Morat was soon fought, when the duke was again defeated with tremendous loss and horrible slaughter. In fact, there were so many men killed that they were piled one over the other until there was a great, frightful heap of dead bodies, which were then covered with earth. This heap was so large that a veritable hill was made, which was named 'Bonehill,' and this name it carried for hundreds of years. At last, some time in the eighteenth century, the hill was leveled to the ground.

"In our next we will learn how this quarrelsome and ambitious duke came to his end."
