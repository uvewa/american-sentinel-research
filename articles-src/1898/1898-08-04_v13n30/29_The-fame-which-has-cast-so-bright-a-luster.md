THE fame which has cast so bright a luster upon the name of the young naval officer, serves to call attention to the mother as an example of the truly successful woman. We do not mean that success in this case consists in the military exploit which was so daringly performed in the harbor of Santiago. The success was achieved before that, in the training which resulted in the formation of a strong, virtuous, manly character. The tragic incident under the city's battlements only served to throw the light of publicity upon the character which stood back of it. It did nothing to make that character; the character was made long before by the mother's training.
