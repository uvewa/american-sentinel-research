Must the individual conscience give way to the "State conscience," expressed by act of the legislature? A large religious element in this country boldly says that it must. At the hearing before Congress on the bill for a religious amendment to the Constitution, in 1896, Dr. David McAllister, its champion, said: "Here is the nation, which gives its decision according to its sense of right and wrong. That is the national conscience, and when the nation thus gives its decision, . . . the individual conscience must yield to the conscience of the whole people." This religious party are trying hard to become conscience for "the whole people," and to secure legislation which will recognize their views as the nation's "sense of right and wrong."
