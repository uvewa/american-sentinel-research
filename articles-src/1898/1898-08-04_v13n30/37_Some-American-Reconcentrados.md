In the anthracite regions of Pennsylvania women and children are starving because sturdy, industrious men, inured to the hardships of mining and ready to brave its perils, can find no work. Gaunt misery is afoot in every mining town. The wolf is at every door. There life at its best offers to little children nothing but stunting toil in debasing associations, to women naught but squalid poverty and that aching fear of the future which makes motherhood a burden instead of a joy, and to men such a denial of opportunity for advancement that every high aspiration is stilled, and such a daily round of worry that the pleasures which brutalize and stupefy are the ones that most appeal to natures which may justly envy the brute.

Such is the situation in the anthracite regions. Such it long has been, and newspapers of every varying shade of political belief and social honesty have described it and denounced it. In the midst of a nation which went to war to relieve the sufferings of the reconcentrados, exists and long has existed a condition of destitution and wholesale starvation hardly outdone by Weyler. This is matter of common notoriety. . . .

This execrable and un-American situation is the outcome of corporate greed, and corporate greed is about to make it more unbearable still. Day before yesterday the presidents of the anthracite coal lines met in a New York office and agreed to raise the prices of coal to the consumer and lessen the amount of work for the miners. Hitherto the miners have had the fruits of two days' labor a week on which to support their families. Now they are to have but one day's work, on which to starve. Who profits by this remorseless economy at the pit's mouth? Not the consumer of coal, for the very men who cut down the miners' pay put up the price of the product.

How long shall the inhuman conditions which surround coal mining in Pennsylvania be permitted? How long shall a trust, fortified by its control of railroads, be allowed to rob consumers of hard coal and slowly murder its producers and those dependent upon them?
