Rome has refused to permit a parliament of religions in connection with the World's Fair at Paris in 1900. At Chicago, in 1893, she participated in the parliament of religions as actively as did any of the other bodies.

The difference is that in America Rome did not rule, being in the minority, and hence participated in the parliament as a guest; while in Catholic France the parliament would be under Catholic auspices. And this Rome will not permit; because in a parliament of religions all religions stand on an equal footing; and Rome will not for a moment recognize any other religious body in the world on terms of equality. She alone is the Christian church, and all other bodies are heretics. This is the plain meaning of her refusal to allow a religious parliament at Paris. Instead of this there will be, it is said, a "parliament of religious science."
