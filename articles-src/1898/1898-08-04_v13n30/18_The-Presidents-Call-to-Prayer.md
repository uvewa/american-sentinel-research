There is real weight in the criticism of those who charge the President with the sort of unwisdom and bad taste that always is involved in the giving of unasked and unnecessary advice, however good the advice may be. There are rumors that more than one clergyman has shown a trace of irritation over this earnest and public appeal for him and his class to do something which they were sure to do anyway, and the same feeling exists among religious laymen to an extent greater than they would care to reveal. It may be said that the President's proclamation had at least as much justification and was as inoffensive as those which he and state governors issue in November. The cases are slightly but materially different. Long custom has turned the Thanksgiving Day proclamation into a formality about which nobody thinks very much, and though the people who object even to an oblique hint of a connection between church and state sometimes find fault with it, they are not seriously troubled. In the present instance the gratuitousness of the exhortation to prayer is not mitigated by a knowledge that the action taken is merely a survival from the past.
