THE "Church of the Saviour" is to be "consecrated" in Jerusalem shortly, in the presence of Emperor William, of Germany, who will make a sort of pilgrimage there for the purpose. But while the eyes of earthly sovereigns are being more and more drawn to the earthly Jerusalem, those who are "pilgrims and strangers" here keep their faces turned toward the Jerusalem above.
