### HE ABSOLUTELY FORCES HOST AND HOSTESS INTO UTTERING FALSEHOODS.

FRIEND STAYLATE makes a call in the evening. Conversation blithe and joyous, and repeated requests for him to remain yet a little while, lead him, not at all unwillingly, to prolong his visit. He looks at his watch with a gasp of genuine dismay, and hurries away slowly at last with profuse apologies for keeping us up until such an unearthly hour. "Oh, indeed, no!" choruses the entire family. "This is early for us! We never think of going to our rooms until an hour later than this." Friend Staylate loiters a moment after he gets outside the gate. Slam goes the door; bang! wang! slam! go the shutters, calling harshly to each other, "Thought that fellow never would go!" Bang! "Why didn't he stay all night?" Slam! And the rattle of the chain cries, "Gone at last!" The darkness of the dungeon settles down on the house; the family has gone to bed, having relieved its mind by doors and shutters that are ready to tell the truth any time they are given a chance.—Robert J. Burdette, in August Ladies' Home Journal.
