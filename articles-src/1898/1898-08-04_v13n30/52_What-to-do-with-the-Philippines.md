WHAT to do with the Philippines, is now the question that is causing most perplexity to Uncle Sam. The natives having been led to believe they would secure independence, are ready to fight the United States forces if the latter seek to impose a different condition. Spain cannot hold them, and the earth-hungry Powers of Europe would only quarrel among themselves over the prize if left to them. Altogether, the situation is very interesting, and one need not be surprised at surprising developments.
