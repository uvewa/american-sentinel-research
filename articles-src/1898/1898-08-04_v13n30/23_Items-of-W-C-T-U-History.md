About two o'clock Mrs. Scott came and conducted me to the drawing room, where, indeed, a genuine surprise awaited me. A little platform with castors on the side had been rolled out of its closet into position; two chairs and a small table placed upon it. The two parlors were filled with camp chairs and seated with a company of decent, intelligent, working women. We took our seats together on the little platform, and Mrs. Scott explained:

"These are my women; my mother's circle. Many of them have been picked up out of the gutter. The majority have been truly converted, and are making Christian homes out of what used to be the most disreputable places that could be called by that name."

As we were talking the door opened and a belated guest came in dressed in a well-patched, but exceedingly neat, and in spite of its patches, a becoming dress.

"That woman," said Mrs. Scott, "was one of the worst women who ever walked the street, her husband a drunkard, and herself everything that was bad. They had a family of children growing up to follow in their footsteps. She has been converted and is one of our best workers."

It is needless to say that my heart was full as I sat before this company of women, who were looking at me with expectation in every face. They had been told of the relation between them and me in the work by which they had been rescued, and the greeting which I received from their expressive faces struck deep.

At the close of the service Mrs. Scott and I held a little reception as they passed by, and I took the hand of each. This was on Thursday; Mrs. Scott said:

"I will not attempt to surprise you any farther, but will tell you that to-morrow evening, Friday, you are to meet the men of these homes. We have read your "Pledge and Cross" in our gospel meetings. We women were none of us speakers, so we took "Pledge and Cross" with the Bible as the best way of reaching them. They will all come bringing others with them, perhaps some half-drunken man, expecting you to give them something fresh and very practical for their help."

I was told that many of these men had already been converted, and that they were always reaching out after some drunken comrade; they very seldom had a meeting that was not attended by some who were under the influence of liquor.

I will not take time to describe that Friday night meeting, only to say that it was an almost ideal gospel meeting in one of the most elegant parlors of the city; perfectly informal; every man feeling that he had a right to make the most of every moment, and get for himself all of Christ that he could out of any one who knew more about him than he did. We were honored by the presence of two men who were under the influence of liquor, who both signed the pledge, asked for prayers, and professed conversion before the meeting was over.

The next day we had a meeting for the children in the same double parlors. These little people had already come to appreciate the difference between a drunken and a sober father and mother; between starvation and plenty; between rags and comfortable clothing; between quarreling and peace and quietness in the home.

Mrs. Scott said: "At our last month's meeting these women gave us a surprise, the like of which I think, never was before enjoyed. The supper has always been furnished by the Union, and in this we have made an effort to teach how to set a table neatly, and all the little nice ways that could be transferred to their humble homes. We have endeavored to lead them to see how large a part neatness in the home plays in the temperance reform; that before a man can be expected to leave the saloon and bring his earnings home, he must have a home to which he can come, and in which to spend his evenings.

When the time arrived to arrange for our last monthly meeting some of these women came to us and said: "Let us serve the supper at the next meeting." At first we thought it would be a great risk; that it would make a drain upon the resources of those who could not afford it; but as they urged their wish in the matter, we consented, keeping out of the way until we were ushered in as guests of honor, and I doubt if it would have been possible to find a dry eye in our company. For myself, I was not ashamed of the tears that came to my eyes. It was a nice, daintily-prepared and neatly-served supper, which furnished by these women so recently rescued out of the slums, was a remarkable demonstration of what can be expected by patient, sympathetic effort, with the blessing of God upon it. There was no linen, but the cloths were very white and clean. They had the good taste, or rather the principle not to try to do better than they could. There were a few flowers tastefully arranged, and everything showed that there was not only a desire to please, but a genuine appreciation of the principles upon which beauty and order in the government of heaven depend. Their husbands came, all deeply interested to witness the success of their wives in this effort to entertain the Union.

From first to last the exhibit of results was so simple and practical, so after the divine order of "every seed bringing forth fruit after his kind," that we could but rejoice at what God had produced out of small human beginnings.
