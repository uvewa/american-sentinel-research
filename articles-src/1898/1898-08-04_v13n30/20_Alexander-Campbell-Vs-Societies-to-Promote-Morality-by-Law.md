I shall, for the sake of argument, suppose that the members of these societies are all Christians, and that they are associated for the express purpose of suppressing vice and immorality by civil pains. I shall further suppose that they are about to inflict civil pains on some men of the world, who are not convicted of the crimes of drunkenness, Sabbath-breaking, and profane swearing. In this case, then, I say they are positively prohibited, both by the letter and spirit of Christianity, from exercising judgment and inflicting punishment upon them. The apostle, in the fifth chapter of his epistle to the Corinthians, when he forbids Christians to associate with or to retain immoral professors in the church (some of which he specifies as fornicators, drunkards, railers, etc.), in regard of such characters out of the church, he peremptorily, and by the strongest figure of speech, prohibits any interference, in the words (verses 12, 13), "What have I [as a Christian or an apostle] to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without God judgeth." No precept was ever more definite, more authoritative, or more perspicuous, than this.

It is, however, no more than following the example of the founder of Christianity, who, when solicited to divide an inheritance, or to use his authority between two brothers who acknowledged him a master in settling a quarrel about an inheritance, replied, "Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?" He confessed before a Roman governor that his "kingdom is not of this world." Consequently his servants as such have no right to interfere with men of the world in anything pertaining to God and conscience. Let the men of the world alone; let them stand by their own master and judge.

"Follow peace with all men," and take heed to yourselves and those who profess to be under your guardian care, and then your mild, peaceable, upright example will do more to reform the world than fines and imprisonment; walk wisely toward them that are without. Such is the spirit and tendency of Christianity. What a contrast! Constables, fines, imprisonment, to make men wiser and better!

But I shall place the above supposition in another point of view. I shall suppose that a society of Christians assemble for the above purposes, and that they have before them a number of professed Christians convicted of the aforementioned crimes: what then is the course to be pursued in relation to them? Does Christianity allow or authorize them to call on the civil law or civil power to punish them?—"Yes," says the Romanist; but the Protestant says, "No." The Protestant asks, "What are the means commanded to be used toward offenders in the Christian Church?" The Catholic replies, "Excommunications, bulls, racks, gibbets, fire, and every species of cruelty." So they said in former times; perhaps they are wiser since the establishment of the cortes and constitution. But the Protestant replies, "Admonition and exclusion, or excommunication." The heretic and immoral professors are treated alike. Hear Paul: "A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject." With respect to the immoral, his words are equally plain and conclusive: "Put away from among yourselves that wicked person." After the heretic and the immoral are excluded from the church, they are to Christians ecclesiastically dead. They have no power or jurisdiction over them. The words of their Master are, "If he neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican." "But," says the moralist, "let us fleece him after he is ecclesiastically dead; let us send after him and devour his substance! Let us raise him from the ecclesiastical grave, and plunder his sepulcher. Who knows but he may be brought to life again!" If their proceedings have any meaning, if they are not deliberate robbery, such is the meaning of them.

I hope, sir, there are many members of these associations who are led in unawares; but their leaders are crafty and designing men. No people more richly deserve the ordeal of criticism, the keenness of reproof, and the fulness of exposure, than these would-be heads of the inquisition.

Of these things which I have spoken, this is the substance:—

If the "moral societies" are heterogeneous, if they claim jurisdiction over all things civil, moral, and religious, they are antichristian.

If they are all Christians, they are prohibited from the exercise of any power over them that are not members of the churches, by the express law of Christ.

And, if they were even a Christian church, and the offenders professed Christians, it is antiscriptural for them to punish them by any civil pains.

In a word, I affirm that the Bible will justify them equally in burning a man or stoning him to death, as it will in exacting money of him, for his sins. Yea, I will go further, and say that it is more scriptural to stone a man to death for sinning against God, than it is to take four dollars or four cents from him on the same account. The former has been done in Old Testament times; but the latter was never done in the days of the Bible. But in New Testament times we read of but one instance of stoning a man to death for the good of his soul; this was the martyr, Stephen. And in it we read of but one society of covenanters—this society bound itself by a solemn league and oath that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.

In the epistle of James, I read these words: "He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not steal." The doctrine deduced from these words is, that as it is the same authority that prohibits all vices, all immoralities, he that is guilty of any one of them equally offends that authority as he who is guilty of another, or he who is guilty of all. "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." Now, sir, how I shall bring this to bear upon the subject, you will see when I have done.

The law of Pennsylvania, I understand, values the profanation of the Sabbath at four dollars, the profanation of the Divine name at less than one dollar, drunkenness at so much, etc. Now let me ask why is each sin valued at a different price, and why is any of them at a fixed price? Sins, like other commodities, if they are to be valued at a certain price, should bear a proportion to the state of currency; what was worth four dollars three years ago is worth but two now. From a parity of reason I would suppose that two dollars is the full value of the above, provided that four dollars was its full value three years ago. But why fix upon four dollars, if this was not supposed the full equivalent of the guilt contracted; why was it not one thousand dollars, or only six and one-fourth cents, if they did not think that four dollars was the precise price? If one thousand dollars was too much, and if six and one-fourth cents was too little, four dollars must, in their judgment, be something equivalent.

Then why is the violation of the third commandment fixed at about one fourth of the sum which pays for the violation of the fourth? Is the former a sin only against a demi god, and the latter a sin against the mighty Jove? Or, is there but one fourth of the guilt in profaning the Lord's name that there is in profaning the Lord's day? He that said, Thou shalt sanctify the seventh day, said also, Thou shalt not take the name of God in vain. So much for my text.

But, sir, it is not because there is four times as much demerit in the sin of Sabbath-breaking as there is in that of profaning the Lord's name, that this difference in price is allowed. I will make you acquainted with the philosophy of the principle! When a man sins against his Maker by profane swearing, he sins against heaven alone. But when he does not observe the seventh day, he sins against heaven and the clergy, in not honoring them with his presence to hear them preach. Now, sir, all sins being alike, as they affect the Creator, the one dollar pays for the sin in that sense as it pays for other sins; but the three dollars pays for the insult offered to the clergy.

What other grounds there are for this difference I can not see. Again, when a man is fined for any offense, the fine is proportioned to the damage he has done, and the fine is designed to cover the damage, so as to become an equivalent to the injury sustained. Thus, when a man is fined for slander, the fine is proportioned to the injury done the slandered, and the slandered receives it as a compensation for the loss sustained. Thus, when a man is fined for Sabbath-breaking, the fine is unquestionably, as in other cases, designed to atone for the damages. The informer is to receive a part for the damages he has sustained in giving the information, and the risk to which he has exposed himself in so doing. The injured party, in this case, if we are to suppose the crime to affect Heaven, cannot receive the fines; but it is bequeathed to his favorites on earth, to dispose of for their own ends. If they cannot show such a bequest, I do not know by what authority they take it. It comes naturally to this conclusion, from the above considerations, that it is as immoral to take that from a fellow creature to which we have no right, as it is for him to sin against the divine law. And he that pockets four dollars is as great a sinner as he who breaks the Sabbath.—Published in "The Reports," Washington, Pa., June, 1820.
