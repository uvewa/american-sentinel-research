PROBABLY there is no prouder woman in the United States to-day than Mrs. Sallie Hobson, mother of the young lieutenant from Alabama, who so distinguished himself in connection with the military operations before Santiago. What mother is there who could see her son so honorably recognized by the nation without feeling a pardonable pride stirring within her to the deepest depths.
