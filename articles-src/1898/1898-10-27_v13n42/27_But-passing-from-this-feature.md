But, passing from this feature of the case, it is plain to be noted that an alliance with the state in which the state is the controlling power, will not be satisfactory to the church. For if there is one thing above others in which a clergyman does not want to be curtailed, or to be answerable outside the church of his choice, that point is the exercise of his gift of speech. He is accustomed to speak with a certain authority derived from his office as an ambassador for God, which does not attach to the words of men in secular callings. He desires to have what he says received by the people with a deference begotten of the idea that he is a successor of the ancient prophets. With this view of his office and prerogatives he will not readily fall in with a system which subjects him to the supervision and control of the secular authorities. The church has assumed to speak with the same authority upon affairs of state, as she does upon matters of the soul's welfare. She aims to have here the directing and controlling voice in public affairs, rather than to be bound by an authority making no claim to be endowed by a higher than human wisdom.
