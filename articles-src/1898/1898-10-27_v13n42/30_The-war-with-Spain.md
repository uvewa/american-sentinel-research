The war with Spain, it will be remembered, was started with a view to the rescue of the Cuban "reconcentrados." This was the principal plea of those who urged most strongly a resort to arms. But what the war has accomplished for these poor people may be inferred from the following which is published by the New York Christian Advocate:—

"Dr. José Congosto, Secretary General of Cuba and Press Censor under General Blanco, passed through this city on his way to Paris as an attaché of the Spanish Peace Commission. He says that there are at least six thousand sick Spanish soldiers in Havana. He affirms his belief that the great question how to bring prosperity and happiness for Cuba is primarily not political, but social. His opinion is that if General Torál had not lacked courage and gone into negotiations with the enemy, the end might have been different. Dr. Congosto, before going to Cuba, was special consul at Philadelphia and speaks English fluently. He was asked as to the condition of the reconcentrados. He replied, 'There are none. They are gone.' 'Where?' 'God knows.' 'Do you mean they are dead?' 'That probably explains it better than I can. This is a subject which I prefer not to discuss.'

"Whatever, then, we have done by the war, and it is much, we have not saved the reconcentrados."

That the suffering of this class of the Cubans became more acute upon the outbreak of war is a well-known fact. And it now appears that practically none are left to reap the benefits of freedom.
