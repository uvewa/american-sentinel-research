One hundred prominent residents of Santiago have sent an urgent appeal to President McKinley asking him to recommend to the Vatican that a certain Cuban priest be appointed to the archbishopric of that city. We have not learned that the President paid any attention to this appeal to offer advice at the Vatican, notwithstanding he has been the recipient of considerable advice from the pope.
