A short time ago I was impressed by a remark made concerning an individual who is considered rather eccentric in some respects, but who nevertheless, according to the remark, possesses the very commendable trait of "pushing his own wheelbarrow." It brought to mind the familiar saying of Emerson, "Hitch your wagon to a star."

There is in the human heart a desire to progress, to rise above present conditions and surroundings, no matter what these may be. And this desire springs from the Eternal, having been implanted in the heart of man at the dawn of creation. The fact that before every human soul are great possibilities, appeals to the youthful hearts with especial force; for whether or not these possibilities will ever be realized depends upon the decisions made in the springtime of life.

"Truth belongs to God. The pursuit of truth belongs to man." Yet there are those with seemingly the most favorable surroundings for advancement, who, despite an inward longing for something better which they do not possess, are prone to settle down and be content with present attainments, become a captive to indolence, a slave to inertia, with by far too little energy to push their own wheelbarrow.

Each milestone gained on life's acclivity
Increases the circumference of view.
The broadest fields lie nearest to the sky;
They see the most who highest paths pursue.

No mountain summit was ever reached without effort and the overcoming of great obstacles. But there is an awful grandeur surrounding the grotesque peak which somehow does not reach in all its fullness to the "half-way house" and the winding valley below. So it requires earnest efforts to reach higher attainments in the pursuit of truth. And the nearer we approach to the throne of God, the more we realize his majesty and omnipotence. "The path of the just is as a shining light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day."

The idler is not reckoned—has no place in God's universe. He has given "to every man his work"—the work of glorifying him in every thought and act of life. One cannot afford to rest his eternal interests on the advice and assistance of others. He must push his own wheelbarrow, so to speak. He must become self-reliant; must learn to think for himself—"to think God's thoughts after him," instead of allowing the thoughts of other men to come in and control the acts of his life.

It is laudable to pay due respect to those of mature judgment. But there are times in the life of every individual when decisions must be made upon which depends his future destiny. One cannot afford to risk such weighty matters with even his dearest friends. There is but One in all the universe who can render him advice at such a time, which he may know positively is not mistaken. "If any man lack wisdom let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally." And when one is thus perplexed, not knowing of himself which way to turn, how precious is the promise which has echoed through all the ages, "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go." The wisdom and instruction which God gives always leads in the right direction; and how precious it is to have him as our counselor in every detail of life's experience.

There are crises in human life—turning points which affect the whole after trend. And he who would pass through these experiences with a consciousness that he has been victorious, that he has chosen the way which leads to a blessed eternity, must follow in the divine footprints although surrounded by loving friends who would fain point him to a different way. "There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; but the end thereof are the ways of death." "The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; and he delighteth in his way." There are social questions and religious questions to be decided by every individual. But "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape." "Wine is a mocker." Therefore the divine command is, "Look not upon the wine when it is red." But perhaps our dearest friends are wine-drinkers, and urge us to participate with them in the follies of the social glass, knowing full well that "at the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder." It is one's God-given right to refuse to follow such dangerous advice. It is his duty at such a time to adhere firmly to what he knows to be right; to "guide his affairs with discretion," —to push his own wheelbarrow no matter how many kind-hearted friends may offer their assistance. By their being firm to principle, others may be led to abandon the ways of sin.

We read again in unmistakable characters, "The seventh day is the Sabbath." But our dear friends tell us, and perhaps sincerely, too, that the first day is the Sabbath; that the Sabbath has been changed. Great men have said so, and it must be true. If we are not careful at such a time, we shall find it most agreeable to encourage a spirit of indifference, and permit our dear friends to guide our wheelbarrow into some by-path diverging widely from the straight and narrow way.

Ah! when God brings us to these cross-roads in the path of life, it is that he may manifest more fully to us his loving care. When he leads us into difficult places, where of ourselves we cannot tell which road to take, it is that we may learn to trust him more implicitly, while we let self and human wisdom sink from sight. The weary tourist would be at a loss to know which path to take were it not for the advice of his faithful guide who is acquainted with every turn in the way. And every pilgrim in the maze of life may have a trusty Guide who knows at all times just which road to take because he has trodden the way before us. It is said that "all roads lead to London;" but only one road leads to the new Jerusalem. With an infallible Guide to direct us, it is hazardous to follow the advice of even our dearest friends, if that advice is not in harmony with the divine Word. God wants every human soul to stand alone with him. And a soul is "never less alone than when he is alone" with God.
MRS. M. A. LOPER.
