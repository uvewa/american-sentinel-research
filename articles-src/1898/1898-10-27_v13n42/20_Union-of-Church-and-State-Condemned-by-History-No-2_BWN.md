When the churches began to be corrupted by the increasing wealth of their ministers, this pagan union of the state with the priesthood was extended to them; and emperors with the Christian name sought the aid of a corrupt Christian priesthood, as heathen emperors had sought the aid of augurs and of heathen priests. Constantine, who first openly protected the Christian churches, can scarcely be supposed to have done so from religious feeling. The progress of Christianity had been very considerable. If, before this reign, the Christians did not amount to more than one-twentieth part of the population, as asserted by Gibbon, still this number of avowed Christians, at a time when the profession of faith in Christ exposed them to martyrdom, indicates that a larger number were secretly convinced of its truth. Licinius, the rival of Constantine, could not, by his heathen zeal, raise any popular enthusiasm in his support; and if we had no other proof of the numerical extension of professed believers, we may infer it with certainty from the recorded habits of the clergy. "During the third century," says Mosheim, "the bishops assumed in many places a princely authority; they appropriated to their evangelical function the splendid ensigns of imperial majesty. A throne surrounded with ministers exalted above his equals the servant of the meek and humble Jesus; and sumptuous garments dazzled the eyes and the minds of the multitude into an ignorant veneration for their arrogated authority. The example of the bishops was ambitiously imitated by the presbyters, who, neglecting the sacred duties of their station, advanced themselves to the indolence and delicacy of an effeminate and luxurious life. The deacons, beholding the presbyters deserting thus their functions, boldly usurped their rights; and the effects of a corrupt ambition were spread through every rank of the sacred order."

The splendor and ambition of the clergy manifest clearly that the Christians were become a powerful body, whom Constantine would desire to attach to his cause, and their number renders it very probable that policy was the earliest ground of his Christian profession. "His conduct to the Christians was strictly in accordance with his interests; and it is very probable that the protection with which he distinguished them may, in the first instance, have originated in his policy."—Waddington.

But if it began in policy, political considerations would still more powerfully urge him to continue it. He had learned, no doubt, from the disturbances continually excited by Licinius, that neither himself nor the empire could enjoy a fixed state of tranquility as long as the ancient superstitions subsisted; and, therefore, from this period, he openly opposed the sacred rites of paganism as a religion detrimental to the interests of the state.

On the other hand, it is too plain that he was an irreligious man. It was in the year 313 that he published the edict of Milan, by which he proclaimed universal toleration, and secured to the Christians their civil and religious rights. But, in the year 325, he ordered his rival, Licinius, to be strangled; and the same year in which he convened the Council of Nice was polluted by the execution, or rather murder, of his eldest son. "It is not disputed that his career was marked by the usual excesses of intemperate and worldly ambition; and the general propriety of his moral conduct cannot with any justice be maintained."—Waddington. After his conversion to Christianity he still continued, as supreme pontiff, to be the head of the religion of heathen Rome, and thus continued to be invested with more absolute authority over the religion he had deserted than over that which he professed. But, as he had been the head of the heathen priesthood, it seemed to him right that he should make himself equally the head of the Christian priesthood. He, therefore, assumed a supreme jurisdiction over the clergy.

One of the earliest objects of his policy was to diminish the independence of the church; for which purpose he received it into strict alliance with the state; and combined in his own person the highest ecclesiastic il with the highest civil authority. The entire control of the external administration of the church he assumed to himself. He regulated everything respecting its outward discipline; the final decision of religious controversies was subjected to the discretion of judges appointed by him; and no general council could be called except by his authority. Though he permitted the church to remain a body politic distinct from that of the state, yet he assumed to himself the supreme power over this sacred body, and the right of modeling and of governing it in such a manner as should be most conducive to the public good. Thus he exercised at once a supremacy over the heathen and the Christian priesthoods. He was the chief pontiff of heathenism, and the chief bishop of the Christian church. And this state episcopate he exercised many years before he was baptized; and long before he was a member of the church he was its *summus episcopus*; and only a few days before his death received from Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, the ceremony of baptism.
