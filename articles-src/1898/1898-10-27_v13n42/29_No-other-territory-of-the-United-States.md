No other territory of the United States was ever in time of peace under military rule, save in case it was the scene of riot demanding suppression by an armed force. There is nothing in the Constitution or in the principles of American Government upon which the Republic was set up, which sanctions military rule over any people in time of peace. Military rule is despotism in its very nature; and it must be resorted to now because the principle of government by the consent of the governed, if applied in Hawaii, would at once throw off the yoke of a foreign power. As well might the Government set up a monarchy in Hawaii, so far as the Constitution and the principles of free government are concerned.
