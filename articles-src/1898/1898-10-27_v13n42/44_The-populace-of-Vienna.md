THE populace of Vienna are reported to be in a state bordering on panic on account of a threatened outbreak of the "bubonic plague" in that city. Through the indiscretion of a physician who was making a study of the germs of the disease, he became inoculated, and with several of his attendants, succumbed to the disease; but not until they had exposed others to the infection. The disease seems to be extraordinarily contagious, and of a nature which baffles medical skill in its attempts at relief. It may be doubted, seemingly, whether science is really able to stand to-day between the human race and a terrible scourge of death such as those which swept over the civilized world in medieval times.
