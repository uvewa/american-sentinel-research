THE Baltimore Synod of the Presbyterian Church, after a lively discussion over the question of passing resolutions defining their view of the nation's policy of expansion, arrived at the very sensible conclusion that such matters were out of its province of action as a church body. As stated in the published report, "it was agreed that the Synod, being a court of God, had no right to meddle with the questions of statesmen and statecraft; that as these questions were puzzling and perplexing the minds of the country's diplomats, they, as laborers in other spheres, were not competent to judge of them on other than moral grounds."
