One thing that adds zest to the diplomatic game being played for the supremacy in China is the knowledge of the undeveloped resources of the country. It is not like fighting in the wilds of Africa for land that has only limited commercial prospects. In China is a steady, quiet population, and mineral wealth which has only recently been understood. Speaking of this and of the ignorance of the fact when China began to be opened for trade, a writer says in the *Journal of the Colonial Institute*:—

"Few people had any idea of the mineral wealth of the south of China. Coal, iron, copper, lead, silver, antimony, and gold were all there close to these waterways, awaiting foreign enterprise and skill. Few people realized how little the resources of the south of China were properly utilized for the support of its people. Within 400 miles of Hong Kong aborigines roamed about over vast tracts of unsettled country. There was no reason why China should send one of her sons to foreign soils, as was done to so considerable an extent. The peasant of Kwangsi planted a few sweet potatoes, and barely existed; hundreds were swept away by the first approach of famine. Yet at their very feet was fabulous wealth. Mr. Wenyon said he had seen a peasant arduously carrying on his back a load of wood for fuel, over a path cut through unexploited coal in the hillside. There was more mining work in China than labor could be found for even in populous China, yet millions were living on two shillings per head, and less, per month."—*Oriental Watchman.*
