The commissioners appointed by the United States and Spain to frame a treaty are in session in Paris.

The American commissioners demand that Spain cede to the United States the whole Philippine group of islands. As soon as Pope Leo XIII, heard of this he was glad and expressed his approval of the transfer of the islands to the American Government. At first thought this might be wondered at, but by looking a little closer, it can be seen why he has so expressed himself.

A few years ago when the National Reformers were presenting petitions to Congress in favor of a Sunday law, they represented that 7,200,000 Catholics in this country were in favor of it. Although their claim was untrue, yet let us calculate that there are that number of Catholics in this country at the present time. Now a little sum in addition will not be out of place:—

|  Number of Catholics in the United States before the war with Spain | 7,200,000  |
| --- | --- |
|  In Porto Rico | 300,000  |
|  In Cuba | 1,500,000  |
|  In Philippines | 9,000,000  |
|  Total | 18,000,000  |

Total number of Catholics under the protection of the Stars and Stripes at the close of the war with Spain, 18,000,000,—a number nearly equal to the total membership of all the Protestant denominations in this country put together.

Is it any wonder then that Pope Leo XIII. is glad when the prospects are that there will be two and a half times as many Catholics belonging to this country at the close of the war as there were before? Rome will not be slow to take advantage of this new power. She knows that she has reasons to be happy, and it is time that the people of this country should be on their guard and know what the purposes of Rome are in regard to this nation.
