A STRONG sentiment is making itself felt in favor of the annexation of Cuba to the United States, notwithstanding the assurance of Cuban independence given by the Government. A reason for this sentiment can be perceived in the light of the fact that holders of Cuban property anticipate an immediate and marked rise in property values in the island in case of annexation. It is money that speaks first and loudest generally, these days.
