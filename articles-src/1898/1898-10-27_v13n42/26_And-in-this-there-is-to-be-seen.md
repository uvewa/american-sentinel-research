And in this, there is to be seen as plain an example of union of church and state as is furnished in lands where there is an established state church. The General Government might just as properly maintain some church for the welfare of its citizens, and create and depose the officials of the same, as to maintain chaplains for the men in its army and navy. The principle of state maintenance of religion is the same in either case.
