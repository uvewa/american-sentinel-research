An individual who wants to be favored in his community because he "keeps the Lord's day," writes thus to *The Defender*, organ of the "Sabbath Protective League" of New England:—

"I keep the Lord's day. My store is open three hours, while all the other drug stores are open all day. I refuse to take a license to sell liquors, and do not sell even alcohol. On Sundays I am open for the sale of medicine only. Do the temperance and Christian people try to help me by trading with me? No; not over two per cent. They would let me go hungry, so far as they care by substantial assistance. They go to the stores that keep open Sundays, and sell all the liquors that are called for. They make these places respectable by their presence and trade."

All of which only reveals the selfish character of the sentiment which is behind the Sunday crusade.
