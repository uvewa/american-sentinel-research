THE Maine State Sunday school Association, in session recently at Skowhegan, passed resolutions making note of "the appalling increase of Sabbath breaking," and calling for the enforcement of the State Sunday laws. It seems strange that intelligent people will still try to suppress "Sabbath breaking" by legal measures, in the face of the historical fact that such means have always failed to bring about the desired reform. Moral reform by law has never succeeded, for it is impossible that it should succeed. It is useless to erect legal barriers against the impure stream that flows from the evil heart. The stream, dammed up, will still find an outlet or burst its banks and cause worse ruin. The only remedy is in purifying the fountain head; and this cannot be done by the law, but by the gospel.
