MR. CROKER, a well-known character of this city, is acquiring no small notoriety as an honest politician. That is, he had the honesty to frankly state that because Justice Daly, of the State Supreme Court, would not allow "Tammany" to dictate his judicial conduct, "Tammany" would not allow him to retain his official seat. "Justice Daly," Mr. Croker said, "was elected by Tammany Hall, after he was discovered by Tammany Hall, and Tammany Hall had a right to expect proper consideration at his hands."

Of course, every political party expects "proper consideration" at the hands of the person it elects to office, and is ready to "turn down" the individual who would choose to be guided by his own judgment rather than the party's will; but it is not political wisdom to make a frank statement of the fact as applying to one's own party. Mr. Croker is likely to discover the day after election that honesty and machine politics do not go well together.
