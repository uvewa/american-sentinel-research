The court-martial itself shows that the Government views the office of chaplain as being a military office, like those in any regular branch of the service; otherwise this form of trial would not have been resorted to in dealing with the offense. Government chaplains may now understand, if they have never realized it, before, that the religious character of their office in no way exempts them from the discipline to which all secular officials are subject. As chaplains, they will be treated as mere creatures of the Government, to be created, disciplined, and deposed at the pleasure of those in governmental authority.
