"We are now studying the history of quite modern times, only a little more than 300 years ago," began Professor Carman. "Let us not forget that. The tragic death of King Henry III. occurred in the year 1589."

"You promised to tell us something about it to-day, professor, and as you call it tragic, I presume the particulars will be quite interesting," said Harry Ray.

"You shall hear all that is profitable or necessary. It was dreadful,—in fact the poor king was coolly and deliberately murdered by a young man—a monk—who, it is presumed by some may have been actuated to the terrible deed by motives of revenge. As the Duke of Guise was almost a saint according to the Catholic idea, the misguided monk no doubt thought he was doing a good work to kill his murderer."

"Did he poison or shoot him?" asked practical Jack.

"Neither; he stabbed him while the king was reading a letter which he had brought him. Of course the wicked and foolhardy monk was immediately killed. Thus the three sons of Henry II.,—Francis II., Charles IX., and Henry III., have risen to the throne of France and passed away, and with them the last of the Valois branch."

"Then Henry III. didn't leave any sons?" inquired Edna.

"No; so as there was no nearer heir to the throne, Henry of Navarre, brother-in-law of the king, comes forward and receives the crown. He is the first of the Bourbons."

"Let's see; he was a Protestant, wasn't he?" asked Fred Green.

"Why, of course," replied Bert Mathews. "He was the great Protestant leader."

"Perhaps you would better write in your note books:—Family of Valois reigned from 1328 to 1589. They were preceded by the Capetians, who reigned from 987 to 1328, and were succeeded by the Bourbons, who reigned uninterruptedly until 1793."

"Did King Henry of Navarre change his religion after he became king?" asked Julia March.

"I see you are a little suspicious of poor Henry, Julia, because he changed his faith once, thinking thereby to save his life. Yes, he did become a Catholic after he ascended the throne; but not until he expected to lose his kingdom if he refused. Of course it is only natural to suppose that the Catholics were very much disgusted at the idea of having to acknowledge a Protestant king. Among his soldiers were many who were of the opposite religious party, and so very great numbers of them ran away from his army."

"Don't you think, professor, that if he had given them all freedom to worship God as they had a mind to, Catholics and all, it would have been better?" asked Joe Palmeter.

"That is just what he did do, Joseph, and in so doing he proved himself to be a wise ruler, to say the least. But alas! the foolish Huguenots were not satisfied that the ones who differed from them in religious creed should have the liberty which they now enjoyed."

"What did they do about it?" asked Ed Barnaby.

"I am very sorry to tell you that they began fighting their enemies, instead of loving them as Christ bids us do."

"I am quite ashamed of them, really!" exclaimed Jennie.

"Indeed, but they are no worse, my child, than any man to-day who is not perfectly willing that anybody and everybody shall enjoy the same freedom which he himself desires,—and there are many such even now. I assure you the selfish people did not all live in France a few hundred years ago.

"As I said, Henry IV. did profess Catholicism, the second time, this last time in order to save his throne. Of course this was a very blameworthy action, for I am quite sure he could not have been sincere. However, let us remember that the poor king was almost forsaken,—in fact, there were not more than one sixth of his own subjects who were true to him, and he had no friend but the Queen of England, Elizabeth."

"Was that any excuse for him to do wrong, do you think?" asked Julia March.

"None whatever. Still he proved to be a kind and humane king, and so we should not be too harsh in our judgment of him. And though popular opinion would stamp him as a weak-minded turncoat,—and rightly enough too,—yet because of his apparently unselfish love for his people, his memory is revered by them, even after a lapse of 300 years."

"O teacher!" exclaimed Julia March, "Isn't he the French king who used to say that he wanted everybody in France to have a chicken for his Sunday dinner? Aunt Eunice said this morning that this is what a French king said, but she didn't know what his name was, or when he reigned."

"Yes, Julia, said Professor Carman, smiling, "I rather think your aunt referred to an old saying of Henry IV., which has passed into history. The exact thing which he did say was this: 'I want every man in my kingdom to have a fowl in his pot for Sunday.'"

"O, Professor Carman, if you please, Milly Brown has something to read about this king," interrupted Julia March. "She has hidden it away in her desk, but I know she has it!"

"Well, Milly, we have just about time to listen to a short paper before closing; will you kindly favor us?"

"I meant to add more to it, and read it next week, professor; but I will read what I have if you like," and Milly stepped to the desk, by her teacher's side, and began:—

"Henry IV. was first called King of Navarre. He was also called 'The Great' and 'The Good.' He was born in 1553. His mother was a Protestant, and she was so afraid her little boy would be stolen away from her and be brought up a Catholic, that she took him one day and sent him over to the Huguenot army. When he was only nineteen he married the sister of the King of France. He would have been killed even if he was the king's brother-in-law, along with the other poor people at the St. Bartholomew massacre if he had not pretended to be a Catholic. He again became a Protestant and again recanted, to save his throne. But after all he seemed to have a great deal of faith that God would be with him and prosper him in spite of his being so weak and fickle. Once when about to be attacked by a large army, he answered the fellow that told him about it and laughed at Henry's small army, by saying pleasantly: 'You don't see them all. God and the right are always with me.'"

"The one thing that made a good many friends for Henry IV. was his good temper; and then, he would not hardly ever punish any of his personal enemies, but would be so kind to them that lots of times they became his best friends."

"King Henry the Fourth never lied to his people. This was such a strange thing, and so different from the way the other kings acted, that every other king and queen in Europe was surprised at him."

"There was a man that wrote a book to prove that it was necessary and just and right for kings to be hypocrites. But Henry did not believe it at all, though even the Protestant English queen Elizabeth was influenced quite a good deal by it."

"Is that all you have, Milly? that was well done. If you will kindly finish your paper this week, we will be glad to hear the remainder at our next study."
