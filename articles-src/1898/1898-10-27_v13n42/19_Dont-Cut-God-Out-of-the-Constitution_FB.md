**WHAT** would you do with the Constitution?
That you're here with your knives and scissors,
Cutting out this and that good conclusion,
And littering the floor with slivers.
What's this you've cut? "equal rights?" of all things!
Congress makes no religion!
"Inalienable rights," that you say are small things;
But you're letting in devils legion.

"Making room for God in the Constitution?"
Say, stop it! you're off the track.
Don't dare to make such a substitution,
The god you'll get in is black.
For where "equal rights" are found for man,
And "inalienable rights" protected,
The eyes of those who have power to scan,
See the God that you've never detected.

God is found in the Constitution
With love and equality,
Keeping the State from a mad intrusion
On conscience and liberty.
To cull these out of the Constitution,
O never have we a doubt,
But behind it all is a resolution
To cut our adored God out.

To cut out "inalienable rights" indeed,
"Equality with the law,"
To leave the State to enforce a creed,
And to make men bow with awe,
To say all men are not free and equal,
That God may be in. O shame!
Can we not read in the past the sequel
Of God and his creature's blame?

God is always in love and freedom,
God is always in right.
Take down the tomes of the past, and read them,
And learn what is dark and light.
You've put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter,
Of righteousness made a sin.
I see from the things you've cut out in your litter
That you're letting the devil in.
