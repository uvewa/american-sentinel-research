NOTWITHSTANDING the czar's call and plea for international peace, there is every prospect of an immediate outbreak of war involving three of the most formidable powers in Europe, the czar's own nation being one of them. The cause of all the trouble is that England and France each want possession of a certain tract of land in the Soudan. Rather than give up what each claims as its rights in the matter, they are willing to waste hundreds of millions of dollars and sacrifice countless thousands of human lives, and bring untold suffering upon their people. This shows how much is really to be hoped for from the sentiment to which the czar appeals in behalf of peace. Every nation wants peace, of course; but each wants it not for the sake of peace itself, but because peace under ordinary circumstances is to its monetary or political advantage. When peace no longer subserves these ends the nation is ready to go to war.
