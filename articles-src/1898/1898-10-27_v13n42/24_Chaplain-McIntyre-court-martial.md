Chaplain McIntyre, who served in the navy on board the "Oregon" during the latter part of the war, has been court-martialed and dismissed for having uttered statements reflecting upon Admiral Sampson and Captain Evans relative to their actions in the engagement with the Spanish fleet off Santiago. Doubtless this will be a sufficient reminder to other chaplains that the Government does not solicit any activity on their part in the line of critics.
