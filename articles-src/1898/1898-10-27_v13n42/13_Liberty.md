We want no flag—no flaunting rag—
In Liberty's cause to fight;
We want no blaze of murderous guns
To struggle for the right;
Our spears and swords are printed words—
The mind's our battle-plain;
We've won our victories thus before,
And so we shall again.

We love no triumphs gained by force—
They stain the brightest cause;
'Tis not in blood that Liberty
Inscribes her sacred laws;
She writes them on the people's hearts,
In language clear and plain;
True thoughts have moved the world before,
And so they shall again.

We want no aid of barricade
To show a front to wrong;
We have a fortress in the Truth
More durable and strong.
Calm words, great thoughts, unflinching faith
Have never striven in vain;
They've won our victories many a time,
And so they shall again.

Peace, progress, knowledge, brotherhood,
The ignorant may sneer—
The bad deny; but we rely
To see their triumph near
No widow's groans shall mar our cause,
No blood of brethren slain:
Kindness and Love have won before,
And so they shall again.

—Mackay.
