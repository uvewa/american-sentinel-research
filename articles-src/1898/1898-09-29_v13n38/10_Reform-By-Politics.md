The practical working of the theory of moral reform by politics is well set out in the following verses printed recently in the *L. A. W. Bulletin*. It is what must ever be the practical working of this theory so long as human nature remains what it is,—that is, until it is supplanted by the divine nature; and then no politics will be needed to secure good government. But the earth will not be peopled with individuals possessing the divine nature until the wicked have been removed from it by the final judgment. The author of the poem is Mr. Joe Lincoln:—

They're holding meetings everywhere,
Said the "Heeler" to the "Boss;"

"In every alley, lane and square
That one may come across;
They say they're going to 'clean us out'—
They're going to 'smash the ring,'—
And now they swarm to shout 'reform!'
And all that sort of thing."

The "Boss" winked at the "Heeler,"
And the "Heeler" chuckled sweet;
And the "Boss" said "Yes? Well, then, I guess,
We'll have to let 'em meet."

"They've got the good folks on their list,"
Said the "Heeler" to the "Boss;"

"The great and kind philanthropist
Who speaks of gold as 'dross,'
The clergymen, the orators,
The pure of every walk,
And all the time they rail at crime,
And talk, and talk, and talk."

The "Boss" winked at the "Heeler,"
And the "Heeler" smiled a smile;
And the "Boss" said, "Stuff! Talk's well enough,
But work is more our style."

"They have a big procession out,"
Said the "Heeler" to the "Boss;"

"And music rings and children shout,
And banners wave and toss;
And in each crowded church and hall
Good speakers cheer their souls,
As oft they tell how quick and well
They'll thrash us at the polls."

The "Boss" winked at the "Heeler,"
And the "Heeler" grinned a grin;
And the "Boss" said, "So? But do they know
Just where to spend their 'tin'?"

"The last returns have just been read,"
Said the "Heeler" to the "Boss;"

"And we're some 'fifteen thou' ahead,
And their's will be the loss.
The 'moral party' spent its breath
We spent the 'long green notes;'
They talked and shirked, we simply worked,
And now we've got the votes."

The "Boss" winked at the "Heeler,"
And the "Heeler" roared a roar;
"It seems to me," said the "Boss," that we
Have done this thing before."
