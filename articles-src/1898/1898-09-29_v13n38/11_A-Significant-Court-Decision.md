JUDGE EDWARDS, of Scranton, Pa., has given a decision which affirms that religious exercises in the public schools are proper under the laws of that State. In support of this affirmation, among other things he says:—

"It must be considered that Christianity, which is the religion of the Bible, and the Bible itself, occupy a unique position in the early and subsequent history of Pennsylvania. In the year 1700 it was enacted that 'Whoever shall speak loosely thereof and profanely of Almighty God, Christ Jesus, the Holy Spirit, or Scriptures of Truth, and is thereof legally convicted, shall forfeit and pay five pounds and be imprisoned for five days in the house of correction.' This law in substance is in force to-day."

And this law being in force in Pennsylvania, this judge is not ashamed to call attention to the fact and to cite it in support of a practice which plainly cannot be justified by any other principle than that of church and state union. The attention of people everywhere in this country needs to be called to the fact that decisions of the courts, from the Supreme Court down, do not indicate that the Government is progressing toward more complete separation of church and state, but rather the contrary.
