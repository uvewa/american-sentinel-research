WHILE the moralists have been discussing the question whether a man has a right to commit suicide, the scientists have been considering the question, Why do men commit suicide? A Dr. Haig, who has been looking into the subject, and telling a Scotch audience his conclusions, finds the cause of suicide to be uric acid in the blood, and the reason for this is found in a bad diet, and especially meats, beer, tea, and tobacco. The Hospital speaks as follows of Dr. Haig's researches:—

"Dr. Haig is of opinion that suicide may be traced to error in diet, the error being the eating of meat, the drinking of beer and of tea, and the smoking of tobacco. His facts all fall comfortably into their places in support of his hypothesis. Are there not more suicides among men than among women, and do not men consume more meat, more beer, and more tobacco than the women? Again, suicide is more common in England than in Scotland, not apparently because the Scotch are a more canny race, but because the English eat more meat and drink more beer, while the Scotch eat less meat and drink whiskey instead of beer. After maintaining that suicide was less common among the Scotch, it was perhaps hardly polite, when addressing a Scotch audience, to go on to say that suicide increased with civilization. But the fact was explained on the ground of the more injurious diet, that of civilized man being more productive of uric acid and thus of suicide, than that which prevails where civilization is less advanced. Uric acid is, in fact, at the bottom of all this, and, according to Dr. Haig, the incidence of suicide tallies with the daily, annual, and life fluctuations of uric acid in the blood, being commonest when uric acid is most abundant, namely, in the mornings, in spring and summer, and in childhood and the full prime of life.

"We have no doubt that errors of diet are responsible for much, and, among other things, for a certain number of suicides; nay, we would go farther and admit that unsuitable diet, derangement of the proper relation between nutrition and waste, and the consequent loading of the tissues and the blood with abnormal products of metabolism, have much to do with that ill-temper and discontent which leads men to lay their hands violently often upon their neighbors, and sometimes on themselves."
