That religious teaching is wholly out of place in institutions maintained by the state, is evident to the candid thinker when he considers what is absolutely necessary to make religious teaching successful. An exchange quotes the testimony of a Catholic archbishop on this point, and comments thus:—

"In his annual lenten pastoral letter to the Roman Catholic clergy and laity of the archdiocese of Melbourne, last February, Archbishop Carr, speaking of the attempt to introduce religious instruction into the state schools in Victoria, said:—

"'If religious instruction is to be given in any way that can be regarded as efficient, it must be given in practically denominational schools. It must be given, not as if it were a deadly poison, in the smallest possible doses, nor as the residuum of all the heresies, which is known as common Christianity; but it must be given in full and flowing measure, as being the water of a fountain springing up to life eternal.'

"This is true. And the very fact that those who demand that religious instruction shal be given in the state schools find it necessary to guard the proposal with "conscience clauses" and "double roll calls," and limit it to so small a range as they do, in the hopes of suiting everybody and offending nobody, is itself proof not only of the inefficiency of the proposed scheme, but that it is altogether out of place in a state system of education, and incompatible with the genius of civil government."
