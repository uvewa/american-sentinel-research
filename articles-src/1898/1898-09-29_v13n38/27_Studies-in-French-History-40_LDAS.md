The next Tuesday afternoon when Professor Carman called his little troop of young historians together, it did not take them long to see that there was a light in his eyes, which told them as plainly as words could have done, that he had some unusual treat for them.

"Well, girls and boys," he began, "what do you imagine I have for you to-day?"

"I just believe you have a letter from Charlie and Rob," cried Maggie Palmeter, excitedly.

"I had begun to think they were forgetting their promise," smiled Max Smith, "but I guess I'd better change my opinion."

"Yes, you are right; I have a letter to read you, but first I want to say that the period of time which was covered in the last lessons, comprising the history of about fifty years, was called the Renaissance, or the new birth of cultivation, and during the most of this period up to 1547, Francis I., King of the Gentlemen, reigned in France. Francis then died, and his son Henry II. succeeded him.

"Now we will hear the letter. I received it this afternoon just in time to bring it into the class:—

"Paris, August 30, 18—

"Our Dear Teacher: Here we are, at last, in this big city, and we are two as busy fellows as you ever saw—busy just seeing the sights. We are so glad we learned a little about France before we came, and we wish we had learned more.

"We had a pretty middling quiet voyage "over the deep," as Milly Brown would say, but once we had a storm that made our teeth chatter some, and our stomachs forgot to attend to business for a few days, which gave us no end of trouble.

"Charlie gets me to write this, for he says I'm better at it than he; though he sits by and tells me what to say next.

"Mr. White and father were in a hurry to get their business done up, and get home before the bad weather in the fall, and so we came almost direct to Paris.

"We are trying to pick up a few French phrases, and I wouldn't wonder if we astonished the natives when we come home. Mr. White found an old French fellow when we first arrived, to show us boys around, but he makes a funny mess of the English language. He laughs at our French, and we shake our sides till they ache over his "Yankee talk," as he calls it, though we manage to understand each other pretty well.

"I must tell you a little about the Tuileries. There is a fine garden, or park, which our guide tells us contains fifty acres, here. It is lovely. We boys don't wonder that Francis II. bought the place and gave it to his mother; we wish we could buy it for our mothers. The funny old Frenchman says the palace was spoiled by the Commune, in 1871.

"It seems strange to think that this fine city was ever a little village, and that it was called "Mudtown." I guess I would have forgotten that, only I brought my note book with me.

"Charlie and I love to walk down a lovely avenue, which they call Champs Elysées; it is a perfect bower of beauty. At the foot of it, there is a kind of open space—beside the palace—called the Place de la Concorde. Of course you know, professor, that a good many important things have happened hereabout.

"Please tell Practical Jack the reason why the place was named the Tuileries is because there used to be several tile works near by,—but then it was not included in the city.

"I don't think King Clovis ever dreamed what a great city he had really chosen as his capital. Wouldn't he be "took back" as Grandma Palmeter says, if he could visit Paris now after these thirteen centuries and more?

"I wouldn't wonder if Edna Phillips will remember how much Philip Augustus II. did for Paris in the twelfth century. He was quite ambitious to be like Charlemagne; and Charlie and I thought, when we visited the magnificent palace of Louvre, which Philip fixed up and enlarged, that his ambition ought to be quite satisfied, even if that was all he did. This building is quite filled with magnificent pictures, sculptures, etc., which it almost makes our eyes ache to see, because there is so much of it.

"This old man,—who tells us to call him Miguel,—is going to take us tomorrow to the Cathedral of Notre Dame, which we must also thank Philip Augustus for, because he finished building it. It is built on an island in the river. Miguel says it is one of the finest buildings in the world.

"We have seen much that is very grand, but I can tell you there are some poor people, very poor, too, in this magnificent city. We both think we would enjoy it better to see fewer palaces, and know that more money was given to help the poor. But Miguel says he can remember when there were a great many more nice buildings than there are now; but since the war with Germany and since those awful Commune fellows have burned and spoiled so many nice buildings, he says he don't believe Paris will ever be quite what it was before. You see we have got quite used to him, so we can understand his queer English pretty fairly.

"Now I must quit writing, for my arm aches, and my fingers feel like cramping. I guess I'll make Charlie write next time.

"Don't forget us, and don't let the girls and boys, either, will you? Of course you'll all write to us.
"Your affectionate boys,
"'ROB, and CHARLIE.'"
"That's a pretty entertaining letter for as busy boys as they to write, don't you think so?" asked Professor Carman.
"Yes; and what a nice time they are having! I only wish I could be with them," sighed Max Smith.
"We can't go to Paris, of course," said practical Jack, "but there's one thing we can do,—we can stay at home and be contented, and learn French history, and write the boys letters."
"I hope you will do so. Next week we will begin our study with the year 1547."
