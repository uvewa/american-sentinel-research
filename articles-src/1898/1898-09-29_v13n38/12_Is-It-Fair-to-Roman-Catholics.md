ROMAN CATHOLICS, in common with other people, are taxed for the support of the state schools. They educate their children in their own parochial schools, and claim that for this educational work they should be given a portion of the fund raised by taxation. Under the American system of government no part of this fund goes for the maintenance of any sectarian school. The question whether this is fair to people who educate their children in such schools is well answered in the following dialogue between Dr. Clifford, of Australia, and a Roman Catholic, during the agitation for state support of religious schools in that country:—

*Romanist.*—"What we want is no more than justice. We ought to have our share of the public funds devoted to education. We do the work; why cannot we be paid for it?"

*Dr. C.*—"Simply because you will do the work in your own way, and not in the way the state finds to be the only way that is fair and just to all the citizens."

*R.*—"Yes; but we have to contribute to the support of the state schools, and maintain our own at the same time."

*C.*—"Certainly; what else can you expect? I have educated my own children in England, and yet I have had to contribute to the support of the state schools; but I need not have paid a penny towards the cost of the education over and above what I paid in the rates. The state schools were open to me, but I preferred to send them to University College School, and I paid for my preference. On your principle you could contract yourself out of all duties of citizenship. Suppose you have half a dozen poor relatives, and out of love for them you provide an institution for their support out of your own pocket, instead of sending them to one of your asylums. Will you therefore ask that you should not pay a poor rate, or be taxed for the maintenance of the state's poor? Again, you want your letters to go without risk, and so you send them by hand. Do you object to pay taxes for the Post Office Department?"

This is a fair presentation of the case, and makes plain that to apply the full amount raised by taxation to the unsectarian schools, is entirely fair to all religious bodies.
