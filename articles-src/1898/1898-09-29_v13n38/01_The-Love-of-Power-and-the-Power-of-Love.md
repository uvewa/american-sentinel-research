These are opposite principles, which are constantly exemplified in the controversy between righteousness and sin. The one is Christian, the other is antichristian. The one brought the Prince of glory from his throne in heaven down to hang upon the cross as a malefactor; the other exalted a man from among his fellows to a position of supreme authority over them, so that he receives their worship as a god. The love of power in the Christian Church led the disciples to dispute as to which should be the greatest, which dispute led finally to the exaltation of the bishop of Rome to the supreme place, as pope. This was the result of politics in the Christian Church. But the true power of the church, which alone she may rightfully employ, is not political power or any worldly power, but the power of the cross of Christ.
