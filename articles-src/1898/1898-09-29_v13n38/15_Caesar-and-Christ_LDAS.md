**TUNE.—"Suwannee River."**

O BROTHERS, have you heard the story
Of long ago,
How Christ, the blessed King of Glory
Men sought to overthrow?
How Scribes and Pharisees in envy
Asked him one day,
"Pray, tell us, Master, unto Cæsar
Shall we our tribute pay?"

## 1st and 2nd Chorus:

"Is it lawful unto Cæsar.
To pay tribute due?
O Christ, thou mighty Son of David,
Answer and tell us true.

"We know thou teachest man in wisdom,—
Teach us, we pray;
O shall we cease to render tribute?
Or shall we tribute pay?
Come, tell us, that the world may hear it—
Gentile and Jew—
While Scribes and Pharisees are waiting,
Answer and tell us true."

And then the blessed Master answered:
"Why tempt ye me?
Haste ye and bring me forth a penny,
That I may quickly see.
Whose image and whose superscription?"
"Cæsar's," say they;
"Then unto Cæsar, now and ever,
Thou shalt his tribute pay."

## 3rd Chorus:

Render that which unto Cæsar
Doth belong alone;
Give unto earthly kings their tribute,
And unto God his own.

Strange, strange that men forget this lesson,
So just and right;
Why seek to join Christ's hand with Cæsar's?
Why Church and State unite?
Why seek to form a hateful union
'Tween Church and State?
Let's build a mighty wall and keep them
Forever separate.

## 4th Chorus:

Still adown the weary ages,
Hear the answer true:
"Render thy tribute unto Cæsar,
And unto God his due."
