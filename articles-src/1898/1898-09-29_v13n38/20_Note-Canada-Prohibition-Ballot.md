Or the 29th of the present month, a ballot will be taken throughout Canada to determine the will of the people on the question of prohibiting the traffic in intoxicating drinks. The vote will have no political significance so far as political parties are concerned. The text of the ballots is this: "Are you in favor of the passing of an act prohibiting the importation, manufacture, or sale of spirits, wine, ale, beer, cider, and all other alcoholic liquors for use as beverages?"
