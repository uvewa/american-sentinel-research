"It is said that Admiral Dewey spent part of the night before the battle of Manilla in prayer and Bible reading," says the *Christian Endeavor World*. The idea seems to be growing that prayer and other religious exercises are a fitting preparation on the part of a military commander for a coming battle. That is the way it was back in the days of the Roman emperor Constantine. But his religious devotions did not consecrate his slaughter of his enemies; and it is equally impossible to make the slaughter and ruin of war any more Christianlike by similar means to-day.
