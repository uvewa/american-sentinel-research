NOTWITHSTANDING the sensationalism of the New York Journal—"An American paper for American people"—it has some admirable traits.

To help bring about good times it is doing its best to bring employers and laborers together. One method it is following is to advertise, without charge, "Helps and Situations Wanted."

This is commendable. It is certainly right that one should do all in his power to make things better. "Live and let live" should be the motto of all. But for all that, are the good times of which the Journal speaks so glowingly and confidently, before us? Granting that "war is over," there is a big little word which the Journal is compelled to use. That word is "If."

Doubtless the Journal knows a great deal; but unquestionably Providence knows a great deal more.

Instead of the good times which the Journal anticipates over and beyond its big "If" at the heading of its columns, the "sure word" of God has shown otherwise. If that Word is any criterion, instead of employers and laborers coming together, the breach between them will widen more and more. For thus "saith the Lord:" "Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and your silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieft; and the cries of them which have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter." James 5:1–5.

We are not pessimistic from choice in this matter, and would not appear to throw cold water on the Journal's efforts to better the condition of things. But over and beyond its big "If," the Journal, from its general tone in the past as well as the present, expects a future for the United States more glorious than anything they have ever experienced. And herein lies the danger.

And because of this we write. The Journal may not believe it, but it is true nevertheless, that the present financial situation—the great "gulf"—as impassable as that which separated Dives and Lazarus—between the capitalist and the laborer will not, cannot, be crossed.

And the only good times for which one can consistently look, are those which are to be ushered in at the coming of the Lord. He who looks for anything else will be grievously, irretrievably disappointed.
