WISCONSIN REPUBLICANS have put into their State platform the following:—

"We believe in perfect liberty of conscience, non-sectarianism in public affairs, separation of church and state, in free schools, and the utmost independence of individual thought, speech, and action consistent with law and the rights of others."

According to this, Republican government in Wisconsin will be very nearly the perfection of human government, provided the party belief is carried into effect. But it is a mistake to think that human liberty should be limited by law in addition to "the rights of others." Any restrictions upon liberty which are not demanded by regard for human rights, are neither necessary nor just.
