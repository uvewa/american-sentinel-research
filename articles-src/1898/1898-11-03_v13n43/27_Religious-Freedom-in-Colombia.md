An advance step towards the establishment of religious freedom has been gained in Colombia, S. A., in that the circulation of the Bible is no longer to be prohibited by the government. A New York religious journal says:—

"The long contest with regard to the circulation of the Scriptures in the United States of Colombia seems to have been decided at last in favor of the circulation. An official decision has been received from the authorities at Bogota to the effect that the sale of the Scriptures is not prohibited by the laws of the republic; that the articles of law which the Roman Catholic clergy were trying to use give no right to the church to interfere in the commerce of books not prohibited, and that the censorship prohibited is to be invoked only in the case of books for public instruction in government schools.

"The contest carried on by Mr. Norwood, the agent of the American Bible Society, has been long and at times very discouraging. Repeated reports have been made by lawyers and men of education in favor of the circulation, but uniformly overborne by the bishops, and occasionally by civil authorities under the influence of the bishops. At last, through an interchange of communications by Mr. Norwood with the governor of Santander and the American minister in Bogota, this decision has been reached, which it is to be hoped will close the difficulty so far as the government is concerned, although it is not doubted that the priests will continue to oppose wherever they can."
