In these days when so many assertions are made by Roman Catholics and others, setting forth the Roman Church as the champion of religious freedom and the defender of the rights of conscience, it is well to know and bear in mind what claims Rome actually makes for herself on this point. The authoritative statement, against which all contrary assertions are of no weight whatever, is given in the Syllabus of Pius IX., issued December 8, 1864. Of the Catholic Church it is there declared:—

"She has the right to require the state not to leave every man free to profess his own religion.

"She has the right to deprive the civil authority of the entire government of public schools.

"She has the right of perpetuating the union of church and state.

"She has the right to require that the Catholic religion shall be the only religion of the state, to the exclusion of all others.

"She has the right to prevent the state from granting the public exercise of their own worship to persons immigrating into it.

"She has the power of requiring the state not to permit free expression of opinion."

And all this has been approved by the present pontiff, Leo XIII. In a letter to the Bishop of Periqueux, dated July 27, 1884, Leo said:—

"The teaching given in this Apostolic See, whether contained in the Syllabus and other acts of our illustrious predecessor, or in our own *Encyclical Letters*, has given clear guidance to the faithful as to what should be their thoughts and their conduct in the midst of the difficulties of times and events. There they will find a rule for the direction of their minds and their works."

In an *Encyclical* dated 1885, the *Syllabus* is again approved, and the doctrine condemned that "each man should be allowed freely to think on whatever subject he pleases," and the government condemned under which "every one will be allowed to follow the religion he prefers." But it would be superfluous to quote testimony of this kind, since each pope is bound to approve all the doctrines set forth by his "illustrious predecessors," and to maintain that the church, under their guidance, cannot possibly err.

Such are the principles of Rome, by her own statement; and every lover of religious freedom and civil liberty is bound to oppose them everywhere and always to the utmost of his power. But in this he is not opposing Roman Catholic people. It is in the interests of no class more than of Roman Catholics themselves that these evil principles—this religious despotism—which the papal system embodies, should be obliterated from every mind.
