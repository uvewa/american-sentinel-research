The consequence of this union between an irreligious prince and the clergy, who were already much corrupted, was lamentable. At the conclusion of this century there remained no more than a mere shadow of the ancient government of the church. Many of the privileges which had formerly belonged to the presbyters and people were usurped by the bishops; and many of the rights which had been formerly vested in the Universal Church were transferred to the emperors and to subordinate magistrates. The additions made by the emperors and others to the wealth, honors, and advantages of the clergy, were followed with a proportionable augmentation of vices and luxury, particularly among those of that sacred order who lived in great and opulent cities.

The bishops, on the one hand, contended with each other in the most scandalous manner, concerning the extent of their respective jurisdictions; while, on the other, they trampled on the rights of the people, violated the privileges of the inferior ministers, and emulated, in their conduct and in their manner of living, the arrogance, voluptuousness, and luxury of magistrates and princes.

This pernicious example was soon followed by the several ecclesiastical orders. The presbyters, in many places, assumed an equality with the bishops in point of rank and authority. We find also many complaints made of the vanity and effeminacy of the deacons. An enormous train of superstitions was gradually substituted for genuine piety. Frequent pilgrimages were undertaken to Palestine and to the tombs of martyrs. Absurd notions and idle ceremonies multiplied every day; dust and earth brought from Palestine were sold and bought everywhere at enormous prices, as the most powerful remedies against the violence of wicked spirits.

Pagan processions were adopted into Christian worship, and the virtues which had formerly been ascribed by the heathen to their temples, their lustrations, and the statues of their gods, were now attributed by the baptized to their churches, their holy water, and the images of saints. Rumors were spread abroad of prodigies and miracles; robbers were converted into martyrs; many of the monks dealt in fictitious relics, and ludicrous combats with evil spirits were exhibited. "A whole volume would be requisite to contain an enumeration of the various frauds which artful knaves practiced with success to delude the ignorant, when true religion was almost superseded by horrid superstition."—Mosheim.

The number of immoral and unworthy persons bearing the Christian name began so to increase, that examples of real piety became extremely rare. When the terrors of persecution were dispelled, when the churches enjoyed the sweets of prosperity, when most of the bishops exhibited to their flocks the contagious examples of arrogance, luxury, effeminacy, hatred and strife, with other vices too numerous to mention, when the inferior clergy fell into sloth and vain wranglings, and when multitudes were drawn into the profession of Christianity, not by the power of argument, but by the prospect of gain and the fear of punishment, then it was, indeed, no wonder that the churches were contaminated with shoals of profligates, and that the virtuous few were overwhelmed with the numbers of the wicked and licentious. The age was sinking daily from one degree of corruption to another; and the churches were thus prepared for that fatal heresy which at one time seemed to threaten the extermination of evangelical doctrine throughout Christendom.
