The answers to the following questions are taken from Macaulay's essays:*

1. For what purpose does civil government exist?

"Government exists for the protection of the persons and property of men."

"It is for the good of mankind in this world to have civil government."

"Government exists for the purpose of keeping the peace, for the purpose of compelling us to settle our disputes by arbitration instead of settling them by blows, for the purpose of compelling us to supply our wants by industry instead of supplying them by rapine."

2. How do even bad governments compare with a state of anarchy?

"Men are probably better off under the worst governments in the world than they would be in a state of anarchy."

"The very worst of them is preferable to anarchy."

3. What logical connection is there between civil governments and religion?

"We see some sort of connection between the very worst of them and the temporal well-being of society. But it passes our understanding to comprehend what connection any one of them has with theological truth."

4. Why should not civil governments teach religion, and punish the irreligious?

"Shall Cæsar punish the robber who has taken one purse, and spare the wretch who has taught millions to rob the Creator of his honor, and to botow it on the creature? Shall an insult offered to the Cæsarean majesty be expiated by death, and shall there be no penalty for him who degrades to the rank of a creature the Almighty, the infinite Creator? We have a short answer for both: To Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's. Cæsar is appointed for the punishment of robbers and rebels. He is not appointed for the purpose of either propagating or exterminating the doctrine of the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son."

5. Whenever civil governments have been induced to take sides on religious questions, where have they generally stood?

"Have not almost all governments in the world always been in the wrong on religious subjects?"

"For one ruler who has been bound in conscience to use his power for the propagation of truth, a thousand have been bound in conscience to use their power for the propagation of falsehood."

6. What does the history of Christianity show respecting the union of church and state?

"The whole history of Christianity shows that she is in far greater danger of being corrupted by the alliance of power, than of being crushed by its opposition."

7. Because religion is a good thing, does it follow that the state should teach it?

"Many respectable people seem to think that when they have once proved the moral and religious training of the people to be a most important object, it follows, of course, that it is an object which the government ought to pursue. They forget that we have to consider, not merely the goodness of the end, but also the fitness of the means."

8. Does governmental interference in religious questions tend to help or hinder men arriving at the truth?

"Men are never so likely to settle a question rightly as when they discuss it freely. A government can interfere in discussion only by making it less free than it would otherwise be. Men are most likely to form just opinions when they have no other wish than to know the truth."

9. Does a state-established religion prevent the spread of atheism?

"We know that the restraints which exist in Spain and Italy have not prevented atheism from spreading among the educated classes, and especially among those whose office it is to minister at the altars of God. All our readers know how, at the time of the French Revolution, priest after priest came forward to declare that his doctrine, his ministry, his whole life, had been a lie, a mummery during which he could scarcely compose his countenance sufficiently to carry on the imposture."

10. What is a paternal government, and how is it regarded by a free people?

"Nothing is so galling to a people not broken in from the birth as a paternal government, or in other words, a meddling government, a government which tells them what to read, and say, and eat, and drink, and wear. Our fathers could not bear it two hundred years ago; and we are not more patient than they. Mr. Southey thinks that the yoke of the church is dropping off because it is loose. We feel convinced that it is borne only because it is easy, and that, in the instant in which an attempt is made to tighten it, it will be flung away."

11. When do sects which hold to the church and state theory of government, plead for toleration?

"Every sect clamors for toleration when it is down."

12. What is a fundamental doctrine of all bigots?

"The doctrine which, from the very first origin of religious dissensions, has been held by all bigots of all sects, when condensed into few words, and stripped of rhetorical disguise is simply this: I am in the right, and you are in the wrong. When you are the stronger you ought to tolerate me; for it is your duty to tolerate truth. But when I am the stronger I shall persecute you; for it is my duty to persecute error."

Macaulay was a close thinker and a sound reasoner on the province, nature, and object of civil government. His essays bearing on these subjects are worthy of careful reading, not only by statesmen and public instructors, but by clergymen and Christians in general.
