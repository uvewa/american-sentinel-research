Has the lust of empire and the passion of conquest made the people so mad that it cannot see the mischiefs and the misery that the imperial policy is destined to entail? Is it true, above all, that the followers of Him who came to teach men how to beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-hooks are eager, instead of striving to abolish the bloody and brutal duello of nations, to reënthrone it? Are "peace and happiness, truth and justice, religion and piety," to prevail among us by cutting one another's throats? For one, I disown so barbarous a conception of our calling in the world as at once a libel upon our civilization and a dishonor to our common Lord and Master.—Bishop Potter.
