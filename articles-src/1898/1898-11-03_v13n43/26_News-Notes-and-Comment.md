Taking a "bird's eye view," as it were, of the conspicuous features of political and social activity the world over, a New York daily is moved to comment as follows on the question whether nineteenth century progress is really as great as it seems to be:—

"After all, what progress have we made since the Vandal invasion, or, for that matter, since Cain slew Abel?

"In the Soudan the Briton and Gaul are quarreling over the land that belongs to neither, except by right of invasion and slaughter.

"In the land made holy by the birth of the Son of God a young Teuton is maturing plans to seize lands not his own and to rule peoples that neither know him nor will willingly accept him when they do.

"In China the powers of civilized Europe are already licking their chops in anticipation of dividing the spoil of a dismembered nation.

"In our own country whites and blacks are engaged in homicidal strife.

"It is the same story in all the world; the old story of 'might is right.'

"And yet some poor fools think they can abolish war."

THE Union Signal announces that "the annual convention of the Illinois Free Methodist Church passed resolutions putting the conference on record as unalterably bound to support the prohibition party, thus placing it in the position of the first church to actively enter politics."

This is a case of church activity in politics, certainly; but that is nothing strange or new for these days. Every church which is working to establish righteousness in the earth by legal measures is of necessity actively engaged in politics.

SENATOR M. S. QUAY, for many years the most conspicuous figure in Pennsylvania politics, is in trouble, being under a charge of having unlawfully appropriated State funds for his own use, for which he seems likely to be brought to trial. And we do not observe that anything is being done to help him by the party who stand for religious legislation. Have these good church people forgotten that it was Senator Quay who bore aloft the standard of Sunday legislation in Congress in 1892,—had the fourth commandment read by the clerk in the United States Senate in support of a proposed Sunday law for closing the World's Fair, and secured the vote of that body in favor of the law? Probably they have not; yet from all appearances it would seem that they are no more ready to stand by Mr. Quay in his trouble than they were to stand by Congressman W. C. P. Breckinridge, another champion of their cause, when he was in trouble some years since. This has an appearance of base ingratitude.

"EVERY question which affects the welfare of the people," says the Union Signal, "is a religious one. We do not want politics in religion, but we do need religion in politics."

Not "every question which affects the welfare of the people" can be settled by politics; and no religious feature of any question can be settled by that means. "Politics in religion" is confessed to be out of place; but if politics is kept out of religion, how much religion will get into politics? We cannot see a distinction where there is no difference. If politics is kept separate from religion, how can religion at the same time be joined with politics? This is a mystery to us. How can religion joined with politics make a different mixture from politics joined with religion?

We trust the whole SENTINEL family will take hold of our "special offer" which appears on the last page of this paper, and work with a will to make it a success.
