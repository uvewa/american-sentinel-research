This is the title of a leaflet which is No. 9 of the "Good Citizenship Series," issued by the League for Social Service. The leaflet sets forth that the people are the ruling power in this country, and is all very good in its teaching until it comes to this:—

"Ques.—Who is above the postmaster?

"Ans.—The postmaster-general.

"Q.—Who is above him?

"A.—The President.

"Q.—Who is above the President?

"A.—The Supreme Court."

This is a plain effort to exaggerate the office of the Supreme Court. A tendency to exaggerate the powers of this body has become manifest in various ways in recent years; there has even been a disposition to accredit it with having the attribute of infallibility. All this is wholly out of harmony with the truth and with the interests of American government.

There are three coordinate branches of the Government,—the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. The President is the chief executive. He is not answerable to the Supreme Court for any act performed in the discharge of the duties of his office. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial body. It is the head of the courts, and has no power outside the sphere of judicial authority.

The Supreme Court has in recent times given two decisions sustaining the validity of Sunday laws; and there is no question but that the Sunday-law interests will have full support at the hands of this court as now constituted. Possibly this is one reason for an exaggerated idea of the importance of this body in the minds of such persons as the League for Social Service represents.

The Supreme Court is all right in its place; and its place is sufficiently exalted to meet the requirements of any legitimate purpose of civil government.
