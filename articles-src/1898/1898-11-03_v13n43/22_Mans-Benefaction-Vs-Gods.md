That which expresses man's highest idea of benefaction is "the greatest good to the greatest number;" the gospel of God, however, brings the greatest good to everybody. It is itself the highest good,—salvation, complete salvation of body, soul, and spirit,—and it is "to all people." God leaves nobody out of his calculations. The free gift has come upon all men unto justification of life.

Many men think that they do very well if they do not do much evil. If in their great schemes for human advancement only a few people are made to suffer, they count it unto themselves for righteousness. But he who does injustice to a single soul is an enemy of the human race, for humanity is one. This fact may be a great encouragement to the many whose sphere is limited, and whose opportunities are few; for since humanity is one, he who does good to a single soul is a benefactor of mankind. More than this, he is counted a friend of the Lord.
