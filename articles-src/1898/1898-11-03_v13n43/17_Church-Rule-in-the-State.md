Some months since there was held in Brisbane, Australia, a "Council of Churches," a report of which was printed in the Australian Christian World. A prominent speaker at this gathering made the following declaration:

"The day has come when the Christian church must be the ruling power in the state. We do not want the control of all the machinery of government, as in the days of Calvin and Geneva, to be in the hands of ecclesiastics, but we think that now the Christian spirit in the churches should be supreme in the making and the administration of the laws of the land. Church and state will be less and less antagonistic as the world becomes more penetrated by the Spirit of Christ, and the church is more devoted to the practical work of turning society to righteousness. The church will ultimately rule in all departments of life, in commerce, the applications of sciences and art, and the education of the young. The dominion will be given to the saints of the Most High. As the wicked are out-populated by the good, so will the executive of a state become dominated by Christian brains and hands. The Council of Churches is working towards this end."

To be the ruling power in the state, is the aim of the church not only in Australia, but in other so-called Christian lands. A prominent ecclesiastic in the United States said, shortly after Congress voted for Sunday closing of the World's Fair, "I have learned that we [the church] hold Congress in our power;" and added that hereafter the voice of the church demanding legislation in support of her views of what was for the public good, would be heard more frequently than it had been before.

The church does not want "the control of all the machinery of government, as in the days of Calvin and Geneva;" for the present, she only asks that "the Christian spirit in the churches should be supreme in the making and the administration of the laws of the land." We fail to see in this a very modest demand, or one which if granted would result in a state of things essentially different from that which prevailed in civil government under Calvin.

The wicked will not be out populated by the good in this present world. That is a delusion which finds support neither in Scripture nor the facts of observation. It is of the nature of the delusive justification which the church accepts in behalf of her movement to control the affairs of the state.
