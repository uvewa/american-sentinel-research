In former articles it has been pointed out that the Holy Spirit was the prime mover in the work of the Reformation of the sixteenth century. This cannot be denied without acknowledging that the Catholic Church of that time was really the church of God. But for any Protestant to do this would be to confess that there was absolutely no cause for the existence of Protestantism, and also to prove himself unworthy of the name.

But the Reformation then was only a beginning. It began with the recognition of the principle that the "Bible alone" is the only standard of faith and morals. It could end only when every error, as well as every abuse, should be manifested, and its opposite—the truth—take its place.

We have further pointed out that in their confession of faith at the Council of Augsburg the Protestants made the fatal mistake of retaining the Sunday institution, knowing full well, and confessing it too, that it had no authority for its existence save that of the Catholic Church, which church had been denounced as anti-Christ.

Up to the time of the Reformation the doctrine had been, and still is the doctrine of the Catholic Church, that the Bible and tradition were the standard of faith and morals.

And when the Council of Trent was convoked to meet the "errors" of Protestants, it was found that this could not be done without the council defining the doctrine of the Bible and tradition, as taught previously by the Catholic Church to be the truth revealed from God by the Holy Spirit. Tradition must be upheld or the Catholic Church would fall to pieces—an event indeed which "would please the 'heretics' very much." But in defining this doctrine to be true, the council had to present evidence of the fact so as to confound the "heretics." The only thing by which they could do it was the Sunday institution which, as has already been pointed out, had been previously conceded by the Protestants. Therefore, we repeat, the "pillar and ground" of tradition is the Sunday. And as without tradition, the Catholic Church would have fallen to pieces, and the Sunday being the foundation of tradition, it is perfectly plain that without the Sunday the Catholic Church would have collapsed. Therefore, in the fullest sense of the word, Sunday is the mark of the Catholic Church. See Rev. 13: 15–17; Rev. 19:20.

Now as the principle of the Reformation was the "Bible only," and the Holy Spirit was the prime mover in that work; and as all this was in protest of the Catholic principle of the Bible and tradition; and as the foundation of this principle is the Sunday, it follows, as certainly as that two and two make four, that the Reformation cannot be completed until Sunday is repudiated by all who would stand upon the Protestant principle.

And as the Holy Spirit and the Protestant principle are inseparably connected, so is it undeniably true that all must be brought to the point where they must either reject the Sunday or reject the Holy Spirit. This is not to say, however, that those who now keep Sunday do not have the Holy Spirit, but it is to say that all who possess the Spirit will, by the Spirit, be brought to the knowledge of this question, and then they must decide which they will retain. They cannot retain both.

All this is carefully noted in "the Scripture of truth," and as the Scriptures cannot be broken, it will come to pass. And an important question may be asked just here: Is it now being fulfilled?

In the light of the foregoing, whenever it shall be fulfilled, the times will be no less interesting than those of the sixteenth century; and really, they will be more so, inasmuch as the very gist of the whole question will come up for settlement then, while back there it was overlooked and not understood. The battle will be fierce, but not long, for the Lord will cut short the work in righteousness.

Now if these things are noted in the "Scriptures of truth," as mentioned above, it needs no argument to prove that the Holy Spirit will lead the believer to that portion of the Word wherein they are contained. It could not be otherwise, inasmuch as the Protestant principle is the Bible alone. It can be settled only by the divine Word. And furthermore, when the question does come up, it must, in the very nature of things, introduce the question as to what day is the Sabbath.

But one thing must not be lost sight of. This question cannot come up, excepting in a secondary way, as between the Catholics and the Protestants. The Sunday question is settled for all time, so far as the Catholic Church is concerned. The issue now must be in the first instance between Protestants themselves.

But this will be considered more fully hereafter.
