The Civic Philanthropic Conference has just closed its second annual session, at Battle Creek, Mich. A very widespread, intelligent interest has been awakened in the social and economic problems of the day by the able presentations of the prevailing conditions in city, village and rural districts.

The speakers were not only men of ability, culture, and practical experience, but were also of earnest purpose, thoroughly alive to the perils of society, thoroughly possessed with the spirit of doing something to lift the low, to ameliorate the sorrows of the unfortunate, and to carry into the world the salt of practical love and salvation.

Rev. David J. Burrill, D. D., pastor of the Collegiate Reform Church, New York, was general presiding officer. The chair was yielded under special topics to Hon. S. M. Jones, mayor of Toledo, to Wm. E. Quine, M. D., of Chicago, and to others.

The question of the betterment of the World was dealt with under the general heads of Socialism, Sanitation, Education, Christianity, and Law. Under the head of Socialism the discussion covered the following topics: "social settlements," "systematic charities," "the social field," "a socialist's confession of faith," "the cooperative idea," "the wage earner," "social needs of rural districts," "social regeneration," "charity and coordination of social forces."

Under Sanitation, fifty prominent physicians discussed "public and personal hygiene," "proper dietetics," "city and country sanitation," "contagious diseases," and related themes.

Under Education, prominent educators discussed "the newer education," "the school of the future," and kindred topics.

Under Christianity, "the church and the masses," "the economics of Christianity," "district nursing," "relation of the Christian ministry to civic questions," "the Christian conscience and socialism," "social reforms of the Bible," "my brother," an "every day church," "the ministry of neighborliness," "Christly personal ministry," were considered.

The legal side was dealt with under the topic that the state of the law is the true test of a nation's progress.

While there was some variance in the theories of reform, there was the utmost unanimity in picturing the state of the world as progressing in sorrow, sin and crime. Not that anyone declared this in so many words, but it was the logic of all the arguments and statistics. While crime, poverty and suffering is growing in our large cities, villages also are becoming degraded, and country districts losing their independence. On the other hand, capital is growing in power; and luxuriance and extravagance make painful the contrast between the rich and the poor. Many predicted an inevitable clash of no small dimensions between the laborer and the capitalist.

The world in the past has suffered from the same causes, and has reaped the results in revolution that are promised in the strife of to-day; but never have the conditions existed that do to-day, making the outcome more bitter and inevitable.

In the past an undersupply has necessitated the underfeeding of the less fortunate; but to-day, because of the increase of commodities through machine power, men are thrown from their positions, and labor has depreciated. The capitalist becomes the hoarder of over-production, and while his granaries are bursting, his factories packed, the unemployed go hungry and unclothed.

The general deduction from the discussion of social conditions, was, a fast unsweeping revolution. Socialism in the sense of a new division of commodities was bound to come. The need of directing and controlling the movement was painfully apparent, lest in the swiftness of its arrival the suffering of the world would be unbearably intense. How to stay the tide and ease the pressure was a question that ought to concern every intelligent lover of mankind.

The very fact that trusts and corporations were becoming fewer, and more powerful, dictating terms to laborers and consumers, controlling larger interests in civic affairs, while laborers were becoming rebellious and even anarchical, foreboded the coming storm.

While listening to the socialistic presentations, we were forcibly reminded of Edward Bellamy's vision of the 20th century, when from such conditions, he pictures the State as finally becoming the conserver of wealth, with power to deal it out for the use of society. Many of the speakers looked forward hopefully, yet all agreed that the solution would come, unless miraculously hindered, by bitter revolution and social strife, such as marked the downfall of the fabled Alantis, or the realistic overthrow in the French revolution.

The frightful social conditions described, were substantiated by appalling statistics. Rev. W. E. McClennan, after portraying the slum and criminal districts of Chicago, branded both church and State as culpable because of the most selfish neglect of the poor and oppressed, and declared that the word "neglect" lay at the foundation of all that made the slum.

In the most densely populated districts of this wicked city, sanitation was utterly unknown. The streets and alleys reeked with filth, and no city health board did aught to clear it away, either for the sake of the poor, or for the general health of the city. Thousands of children in these districts were prohibited the advantages of education, because school buildings were not provided, although in richer districts there was more school room than could be utilized. And here where the poor congregated, the church was rarely found. Even missions were few and far between, and a light here and there shone feebly in the midst of crime, poverty, sickness and sorrow.

Prof. G. D. Herron of Grinnell College, presented a powerful appeal to the Christian conscience, pointing out the perils in the industrial systems of the day, that menace not only life but liberty, and seek not only to enslave men for material needs, but to fetter thought, and finally bind conscience. Not only are men becoming victims to the greed of gold, but women and children as well. Thousands of children toil in coal pits, not to speak of the thousands in shops, factories, stores, etc., from the age of six and seven. The almighty dollar stands behind the souls of men with its scourge of cords.

Professor Boone and others spoke of the education demanded by the times as one that would consider the individual, and his adjustment to social needs.

Under sanitation, Doctors Kellogg, Quine, Danforth, and others set forth the need of public sanitation and personal health. While they insisted on the quarantine of consumptives, and the victims of other contagious diseases, they also insisted that it was incumbent on every one to have and cultivate such health as would cope successfully with the germs and microbes of this degenerating age. They discussed pure diet, hygiene and proper training, and landed the conference out of the great general mass of miseries into the home, and set it face to face with the individual.

The discussion under the head of Christianity emphasized still further the need of individual, personal contact and brought us one step onward into the realm of morals. In fact, it was clear that the realm of conscience is the fundamental realm for reform. The question under this head was warmly discussed, and left the conviction firmly fastened upon us that every man owes it to every other to preach to him the gospel of Christ.

While much was said in regard to going to the polls, and the relation of the clergy to politics, the logic of the arguments led rather to persuasion than to law; for it was evident that each man must choose his life for himself. The need of reform brought the conference at this period to the hopelessness of reform without regeneration, and so step by step from the vast social, economic miseries, we were led back to Christ the regenerator of the soul. From out the mass of theories, one command seemed axiomatic—"Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature."

At this stage Doctor Cady and Rev. Brushingham emphasized the principle of neighborliness and Christly ministry. Man to man, heart to heart, the work of reform is to be carried out by the power of God, working with the coöperation of the human will.

W. S. Sadler and Doctor Paulson, of the Star of Hope Mission and the Sanitarium, brought forth examples, proving the value of this method, and urged that Christians scatter the salt of love that is to preserve the world. All other salt is non-preservative.

Doctor Mason (colored) gave an eloquent rehearsal of the progress of the colored race in our midst, also pointing out the Christian element that accounted for the uplifting of the oppressed people, and making it clear that their progress would continue in proportion to the dissemination of the gospel.

Doctor Pierson, the philanthropist; who has already given away millions in building and endowing colleges and in other philanthropies, put the capstone on the proceedings by showing how Christian men and women teachers influenced cultivated talent in the young to give itself to mission work, and to the dissemination of Christian principles. He demonstrated the fact by the success that had attended his own philanthropy, that money had a mission in regenerating society, and in bringing the world to a knowledge of Christ.

Under the head, "The state of the law a test of human progress," it was clearly shown by Hon. Fred. M. Maynard, attorney-general of Michigan, that where law is administered equally for the protection of inalienable human rights, where civic functions are confined to civic affairs, where thought and speech are unfettered, and conscience free, the true test of progress notes the nation as in a high state of civilization and happiness. The paper deprecated any reversal of this policy, and pointed out the duty of repealing laws from our statute books that tended in another direction.

Most of the speakers, in spite of the horrifying conditions they pictured, hoped for the millennium and the speedy reign of Christ on earth. With this conclusion many were obliged to take issue, as all the conditions pictured are signs, not of a millennium of peace, but of the overthrow of human kingdoms, the destruction of earthly governments, the desolation of the world, previous to a thousand years of chaos and silence. Not till the end of the thousand years, when evil will meet its final destruction, when the earth is renewed to Edenic beauty, can we hope for the reign of Christ on earth. Then the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. Then the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. Then the new Jerusalem, the city built by God, will present the type of the ideal city, and the redeemed, immortal beings will fill it with joyful hallelujahs.

Till then it is the Christian's duty to preach the gospel to every creature, and pluck men as brands from the burning, out of the soon-coming general conflagration. The warning of the Word is, "Say ye not, A confederacy;" but "Prepare to meet thy God."
