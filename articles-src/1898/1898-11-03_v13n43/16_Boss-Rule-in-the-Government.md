The attempt of "boss" Croker to dictate the official conduct of a judge upon the bench of the Supreme Court of this State, has produced no small stir in political circles, and elicited many expressions of condemnation from the various political organs. One of the most forcible of these is the following from the Sun of this city:

"The attack made in this town upon the independence of the judges is no mere local matter. Croker's judge, elected here, can be sent anywhere in the State. What is of immensely greater importance and concerns the rights of every man who is not a Tammany vassal, in every part of the State, if Croker's man is elected, the judges will thereby have notice that they must obey the boss or that they cannot be renominated, and the people will inevitably, however unjustly, be suspicious of the judges. A sinister element of compulsion will fetter or will be thought to fetter the free will and conscience of the judge. By his side Richard Croker will seem to be sitting, demanding tribute.

"Mr. Croker is now seeking to extend his power over the State; and wherever he extends it, this notion that judges are responsible to him will go with it. Under the name of Van Wyck he will rule at Albany. Under the names of Leventritt, Fitzgerald, and Andrews he will be sitting upon the bench of the Supreme Court of the State. And every judge within the limits of Croker's power will have to be a Crokerized judge or fall of renomination; and every future candidate for a judgeship within those limits will have to subscribe to Crokerism, to accept Croker as a higher law, or not to be nominated.

"Justice is one, and the courts are one great system. You cannot stab the integrity of the courts in New York and not have the wound felt in St. Lawrence and every other county. The arrogance of Richard Croker assailing the freedom of the courts here assails the freedom of the courts in every other part of the State, and touches to the quick the security and the equality of the citizen under the law."

All this is true enough; but it touches only one side of the evil of "boss" rule in the Government. Boss rule in the courts of justice is bad enough, certainly; but we cannot see that it is worse than boss rule in the legislature. We cannot see that it is really worse to have the law construed according to the dictation of a political boss, than to have the law enacted by the same rule. The boss can secure his ends about as readily by the one means as by the other. Of course, it is only natural that he should want to control the judicial branch of the State government along with the others, that nothing may be lacking to his investiture with absolute power.

When the political boss dictates the men to fill the offices of public trust in the executive and legislative departments of the Government, it is no very great step in advance for him to assume the right to control the remaining branch of the Government in the same way.

The legislature and the office of the executive are fountain heads of justice as truly as are the courts of law.

We hope the fight being made against boss rule over the courts in this State may be successful; but to be truly successful it must be extended to boss rule in every sphere of its pernicious work. Wherever such rule exists government of the people, by the people, and for the people, exists only in name.
