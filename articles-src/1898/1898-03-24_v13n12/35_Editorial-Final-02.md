"AND ye shall be my witnesses . . . unto the uttermost part of the earth" were Jesus' last words to his apostles before his ascension, and were meant for his followers for all time; but judging from the press reports of pulpit utterances, from all over the country, one would think that to-day the order of things was changed, that the duty of the "ambassador for Christ" instead of beseeching men to be reconciled to God, was to incite them to war, and send them forth, not to save men's lives, but to destroy them.
