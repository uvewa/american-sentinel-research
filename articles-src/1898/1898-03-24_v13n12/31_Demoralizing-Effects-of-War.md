*"The Christian," London, Eng.*

The demoralizing effects of war on all who take part in its fierce struggles is occasionally painfully evidenced in the letters sent home by the combatants. We had shocking illustrations of this in published letters of some of those engaged in the recent Matabele and Bechuana affairs. The present war in India furnishes some fresh examples. In one case it comes from the pen of the *Chronicle* correspondent. After describing the burning of some Aka Khel villages which ruined the homes of hundreds of non-combatants, some of whom begged our soldiers to end their lives out of pity (one old woman tried to burn herself with her home), this representative of Army sentiment goes on to say: "Everybody, from the general downwards, was pleased with the success of the day's operations. A hot bath, the snowy whiteness of the cloth and the brightness of the silver which adorned the mess-table, and a night between the sheets, were afterwards thoroughly appreciated." Such callous disregard to suffering inflicted, in contrast to the glorification of the comforts of the British camp, while those poor people were left to perish on bleak hillsides, is painful reading. Any employment that can thus dry up the springs of natural pity for the vanquished must be of the devil.
