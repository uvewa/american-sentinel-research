THE government depends upon force. Christianity does not depend upon force. It cannot be maintained by force. The government represents force; Christianity represents love. The government can accomplish its ends only as it makes use of force; Christianity can accomplish her ends only as she refrains from the use of force. Let those who are of the world employ worldly methods and worldly weapons. We can suggest none better for them, so long as they remain of the world. But let those who are not of this world employ methods and weapons that are not of this world. Let them employ love, not force; the "sword of the Spirit," not the sword of steel. And Christians are not of this world. Let Christians therefore protest against war; not as being contrary to worldly principles or worldly interests, but as contrary to Christianity. It is not the business of Christians to advise the world what to do from a worldly standpoint; from that standpoint the world is as wise as the Christian. The Christian's business is to advise the world from the standpoint of Christianity; in other words, to advise those who are of the world to become Christians; to point out the superiority of the principles and ways of Christianity to the principles and ways of the world.
