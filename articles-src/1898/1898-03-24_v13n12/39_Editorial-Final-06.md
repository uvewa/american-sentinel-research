The flat has gone forth, and from human lips, that "Christ is to be this world's king," and also the manner by which this is to be accomplished, namely, "through the gateway of politics." This of course cannot be accomplished in all the earth at one time, so the initiative has been taken here in America, and it has been purposed to "enthrone Christ on Capitol Hill" as this nation's king. And this being made an accomplished fact, the movement will reach out till, "through the gateway of politics," all the earth shall be brought into subjection to Him. Yes; Christ is to be given the kingdoms of this world (Rev. 11:15), and he is to reign forever; but is it to be accomplished in the manner described above? Is Christ to become king through the ballot? On the contrary we are taught in the Word that instead of becoming king through the puny efforts of men, God himself will give him the kingdom (Ps. 2:8; Eze. 21:27), and he shall reign forever. O that men would forsake the ways and means that are not of God, that they would realize their high and holy calling, that instead of seeking through the primary and the polls to set up the kingdom of Christ, they would seek to draw men away from the things of this present evil world, and prepare them to stand in that day when the kingdoms of this world, being given to Christ, he shall dash them in pieces like a potters vessel (Ps. 2:9), and set up his kingdom which, occupying the whole earth, shall stand forever. Dan. 2:35, 44.
