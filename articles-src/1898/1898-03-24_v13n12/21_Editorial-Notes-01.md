"AGAINST the barbarism of a resort to war," says a religious journal which speaks for the Reformed Episcopal Church, "it is the duty of every Christian to protest." This is true; and the Christian's protest should be sustained by action as well as by voice or pen. So far as his own actions are concerned, the Christian can never allow his convictions of right to be overruled.
