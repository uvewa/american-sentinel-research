In the previous article under the above heading it was stated that there is positively only one institution that the papacy claims as her own to which she points as the mark of her authority, and that that institution is Sunday.

That being so, it is in itself an unanswerable argument that Sunday is the "mark of the beast;" for it being a fact that the beast referred to (Rev. 13:1–10) symbolizes the papacy, it is utterly impossible that Inspiration, in speaking of this power could have one thing in mind as being the mark, and then that same power claim something else as being its mark. To claim such a thing is to at once impeach the inspired Word. It is therefore certain that whatever the papacy claims as its mark, that is the thing of which the prophet spake as the mark of the beast. That it is the Sunday, as before stated, is susceptible of the clearest proof.

The following quotations are from standard Catholic catechisms bearing the imprimatures of cardinal and bishops, thus receiving the fullest sanction of the Catholic Church:

"Ques.—Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept?"

"Ans.—Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her,—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural authority."—Doctrinal Catechism, p. 174.

Again: "Ques.—How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days?"

"Ans.—By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church.

"Ques.—How prove you that?"

"Ans.—Because by keeping Sunday they acknowledge the church's power to ordain feasts and to command them under sin; and by not keeping the rest by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power."—Douay Catechism, p. 58.

The same is also found in "An Abridgement of Christian Doctrine" (p. 58), by Rev. Henry Tuberville, D.D.

In the "Catholic Christian Instructed," in answer to the question, "Has the church power to make any alteration in the commandments of God?" Among other things, the following reply is given: "Instead of the seventh day, and other festivals appointed by the old law, the church has prescribed the Sunday and holydays to be set apart for God's worship; and these we are now obliged to keep in consequence of God's commandment, instead of the ancient Sabbath."—p. 204.

From these quotations it will be seen that the Catholic Church bases its power to ordain holydays and feast days upon the fact that it had the power to change the Sabbath from the seventh day of the week to the first. The sign that the church has power to command men under sin is this alleged power to change the Sabbath. Call in question the authority of the church to do this or that, and it will point to the change of the Sabbath as its authority.

That being so, it must be evident to every candid mind that Sunday is the mark of the papacy. And no more fitting mark could it have. When God, through Jesus Christ, made the heaven and the earth, he rested upon the seventh day, blessed, and sanctified it, and thus gave it to mankind as the memorial of his wonderful works. Ps. 111:4. It became the sign between God and his people that they might know that he was Jehovah. Ex. 31:13, 7; Eze. 20:20. It is the sign of his power to create, and thus of his divinity, and therefore of his power to sanctify. Eze. 20:12; 36:23.

Placed in the bosom of, and becoming a part of the eternal law of Jehovah—the ten commandments that "are done in uprightness and truth" (Ps. 111:7, 8) and which indeed are "the truth" (Ps. 119:142), the seventh day is as immutable and eternal as God himself. That day could not be changed without changing truth, and to change the truth of God is to change it into a lie. Rom. 1:25. For God to do this would be for him to deny himself, but this he cannot do. 2 Tim. 2:13. Consequently, God could not change the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first. A simple reading of the fourth commandment will prove this. Let anyone read it, substituting the word "first" for that of the "seventh," and it will be seen how utterly impossible it is for God to do such a thing—it would simply make him testify to a lie.

But the papacy claims to have the power to do that which God cannot do. That being so, she thereby declares she has greater power than God, and as this power is displayed in the change of the Sabbath, it must be, therefore, that Sunday is the mark of papal power.

Now, bearing in mind that Sunday is the only institution that the papacy points to as the mark of her authority; and that this same institution is the only thing that is sought to be enforced upon the people of this country, by the Protestants as the test or mark of true religion, it is again proven that Sunday is not only the mark of the papacy, but also that this country is the one symbolized by the two-horned beast of Rev. 13:11. God having thus pointed out this papal work, will it not be wise for every sincere Protestant to closely study these things? And the "wise shall understand." Dan. 12:10.
