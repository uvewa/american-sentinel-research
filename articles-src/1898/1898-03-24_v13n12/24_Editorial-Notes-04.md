It is perfectly natural that a government should employ force, even in the form of armies and battleships, to maintain the things which are deemed essential to its existence. Force is the natural agency of civil government; indeed, the government stands for force, and for that agency only. It does not represent love; it does not stand for persuasion. The government does not love anybody; is wastes no time in argument. It simply commands and exacts obedience. Importers of foreign goods are not persuaded to pay a tariff on their importations; the government wastes no breath, time, or money in persuading people to obey any of its requirements. It simply makes known its requirements, and then proceeds to enforce them.
