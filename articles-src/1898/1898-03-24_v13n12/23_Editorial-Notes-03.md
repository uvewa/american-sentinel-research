THIS IS NOT SAYING that a government is not bound under some circumstances to go to war. Governments are sustained by force, and war is but the last resort of force. Every government assumes the right to perpetuate its own existence; and to do this it feels bound to employ all necessary force, and make any necessary sacrifice of life and property. To attempt to overthrow the government is high treason, a crime punished by the severest penalties. The act in itself may be laudable, as in the case of the Declaration of Independence, by which the British Government was overthrown in the American colonies; but from the standpoint of the government it is the highest crime, and one to be repressed at all hazards. The Declaration of Independence was a crime of the highest magnitude; but it was no sin. A government fights its own battles; but the battles between sin and righteousness are fought by other agencies, even by those that are spiritual.
