"This is a Christian nation."—U. S. Supreme Court, 1892.

The word "Christian" being a descriptive adjective, reveals the fact (?) that the component parts of the nation (the individuals) are all Christians.

Defining the "Christian citizen," the *Christian Endeavorer*, of May, 1897, says: "The 'Christian citizen' is one who brings Christian principles to bear upon his political life."

This is saying that the principles revealed to the world through Jesus Christ, the author of Christianity, which to day are by the power of God, through faith, revealed in the life of the believer, are "to bear upon his (the 'Christian citizen's') political life."

These principles are "love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance," and according to the above quotation, the representatives of this "Christian nation," in Congress assembled, should bring these Christian principles to bear in all their deliberations.

But what are the facts?

Not only in Washington, but throughout all the land the very air we breathe seems to be heavily charged with the spirit of war, and preparations for slaughter are going on night and day without ceasing. The government arsenal at Springfield, Mass., is turning out 500 rifles a day, and in Ilion, N. Y., the working force is being increased as fast as new tools can be made ready for service in the manufacture of weapons of destruction. In Reading, Pa., the Carpenter Steel Works has an order from the government for $1,000,000 worth of projectiles, and in Bethlehem, Pa., 5,000 men are working night and day turning out big guns. A day or two ago a train of twenty-one cars, each car loaded with a twelve-inch mortar, arrived at Sandy Hook, and they are being placed ready for use; and in every military and naval station all is bustle. And this in the face of the statement from the highest judicial authority in the land that "this is a Christian nation."

Nor is this all.

When this nation was declared "Christian" it was for the sole purpose of enforcing Christian laws, institutions, and usages, and Christian morality upon all, and as the chief of all laws, institutions, or usages, and the supreme test of "Christian morality" is the observance of Sunday as the "Christian Sabbath," it does not surprise us when we read, "The American Government . . . is bound to maintain Sunday as a day of rest and worship," and that "Sunday is the test of all religion," and we would naturally conclude that this "Christian nation" should honor and revere the "Christian Sabbath." But, again, what are the facts?

We quote from the *New York Journal*, Monday, March 14:—

"No rest for war and navy chiefs. Busy all day [Sunday] issuing orders." Again: "Newport torpedo station busy Sunday. . . . For the first time in the history of the torpedo station, the shop was run on Sunday." Again: "There was no Sunday quiet around the Carpenter Steel Works to-day. Everybody was hustling and on the jump." And "The Bethlehem Works were run at full power to-day [Sunday]."

The above places are all working under orders from the Government, and turning out machines of destruction the most powerful the world has ever seen.

If there is one man above all others in this world that is held up to ridicule and contempt it is he who has made a profession of religion and proves false to it. This being so of the individual, what must it be of the nation? Professing religion, being declared "Christian" and yet proving false to every principle of Christianity, is it not time that the hand of fellowship be withdrawn, and the United States taken off the church books?
