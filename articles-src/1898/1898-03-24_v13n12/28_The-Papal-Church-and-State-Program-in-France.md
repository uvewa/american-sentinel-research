In the light of facts which are given full publicity in lands where passing events are open to the view of all the civilized world, it is strange that intelligent people in this country should believe that the purpose of the papacy is not a union of church and state. Note the testimony upon this point which is furnished by the clerical program in France, as set forth by a clerical organ in that country. We quote this with accompanying comments from the *Independent* (N. Y.), of March 10:

"Just how French clericalism proposes to make use of the present state of affairs in that republic is indicated by the official party election program as published in the *Revue des Clergé Français*. It begins as follows:

"The church has the recognized right to govern not only individuals and families, but also nations. In other words, the state is not independent of the church; it is the state's duty to accept, confess, and protect the Catholic religion. It is the object of the state to protect the secular welfare of the people; but it is the sphere of the church to guard their eternal happiness. The sphere of the church is accordingly infinitely higher than that of the state, and the latter sphere is subordinate to the former. This subordination of ends brings with it, also, the subordination of means, and, as a result of this, it is apparent that the state is subordinate to the church. Nothing can overthrow this argument."

"As a consequence of this position the program maintains that it is the duty of the state to render all possible service to the church. The church is both a divine and a human association, and possesses power to teach, to make laws and to inflict punishment; she has the right to punish heretics with 'material' punishments, *i. e.*, fines, etc.; she further has the right to ask of the state to use the powers at her command for carrying out the spiritual interest which it is the function of the church to preserve and protect. The program concludes with these words:

"By divine right the pope is the head of the church, the authority as the exponent of the highest morality which has the right of prescribing to the princes the directions and rules which they are in duty bound to observe in the government of their states."

"The official election program of the 'Catholic Republican Election Federation of 1898,' which has its headquarters in Paris, and has been making an active canvass since November, is somewhat milder in tone and tendency. This program laments the fact that hitherto the republic has been antagonistic to the highest interests of religion, and makes the following demands: (1) honest acceptance of the republican principle of government; (2) reforms of the laws which have been enacted against the Catholic Church; (3) harmonious cooperation with all those who are striving for a reign of peace and freedom and justice. In spite of this peaceful program it is generally thought that the aim of Federation is just as much a theocracy as that of the Catholic party proper, namely, the clericalization of the republic, including the army. At any rate, this is the view of leading European church papers."
