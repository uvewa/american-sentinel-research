OUR readers will notice a change in the price of the "Simplicity Vaporizer" from $1.25 to $1.50. This has been done for the benefit of the purchaser, as on those sold for the first price the buyer had to pay expressage, never amounting to less than 30 cents; whereas with the latter price expressage is paid by Mr. Armor. Please notice "ad" in next issue.
