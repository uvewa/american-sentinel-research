An Episcopalian who writes to the *Washington Post*, under date of March 4, takes his church to task for engaging in the movement for a Sunday law, which he truthfully declares is and must remain a political question. He says:

"Editor Post: I am very sorry, as a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church, to read in the *Post* the question that has been raised as to the Sunday law in this district, in which the Protestant Episcopal Church is interesting itself in a question which, in my humble opinion, should be left to persons outside of the church of any denomination. I have always loved the Episcopal Church for the reason that it has never meddled in politics. And the Sunday law must always be a political question.

"No greater evidence can be shown of this fact than the result of the election in New York City last fall—Van Wyck's election was aided in a great measure by the failure of the Sunday laws in New York City. . . . Leave the Sunday laws alone, particularly in this city. Let any unprejudiced person walk the streets of this city any Sunday and see if it is as quiet as any country village in any locality where any decent person is ever seen. . . . Please let it be known, once for all, that the Episcopal Church is out of political questions, and that Sunday observance must always be a political question.

"S. E. GITTINGS."
