WHEN we speak against war, we do not speak from the standpoint of the civil government. From that standpoint the use of force to secure any desired end is a necessity. That is the worldly standpoint, and force is the natural weapon of the world. One method of employing this force is through politics; the ballot represents force, and not love or persuasion. Politics are a necessity in civil government, and war may become a necessity. We do not say that the civil government could do any better than to employ force in either of these forms when it is deemed that circumstances require them. We do not see how the government could do differently. What we do say is, that in these the government does not stand for Christianity. We protest against the idea that the civil government, in politics or war, proceeds upon Christian principles, save in so far as it maintains separation between church and state. In keeping itself separate from religion, the civil government is in harmony with Christianity; and in the maintenance of this principle, and this only, the two stand upon common ground.
