It would seem from the following item taken from the New York Sun, March 18, that the "flag salute" has come to stay:

"The Senate at Albany, N.Y., passed Senator Coggeshall's bill requiring the school authorities of every school in the state to purchase a United States flag and display it on the building during school hours and at such other times as they may determine. When the weather will not permit it to be otherwise displayed, it is to be placed conspicuously in the principal room of the school-house. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction is to prepare a program for a salute to the flag at the opening of each day of school, and such other patriotic exercises as he may deem expedient, with special provision for the observance of Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, and Flag Day."
