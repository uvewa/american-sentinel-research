SOME very interesting news comes to us from the field of church and state controversy in Australia. A sudden revolution has taken place in the sentiment which seemed to be prevailing in the Federal Assembly against any union of church and state, and it came about on this wise. A motion was before the Assembly which was to incorporate in the fundamental law a provision that no state should enact any law interfering with the free exercise of religion. An amendment was offered to this, to the effect that no law of this kind should be passed by either a state or the Federal Government. Immediately an objection was raised, and the objection was that if such a provision were incorporated in the fundamental law, it would shut off any legislation for the observance of Sunday. But this was not all; the objector said further that the Seventh-day Adventists were there as the advocates of the principle of no state interference with religion, and that if this principle should be put into the Constitution, it would be a surrender to the Adventists. The result was that both the proposed amendment and the original proposition were swept aside altogether, and both state and federal governments are left wholly free to enact as much religious legislation as they may choose; and with a strong hint thus handed down to them that they are expected to enact some legislation of this kind, and especially some against the Seventh-day Adventists. So much for the effect of clerical lobbying in shaping the fortunes—or the misfortunes rather of the new-born Australian Federation.
