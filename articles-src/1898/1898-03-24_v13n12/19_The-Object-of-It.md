It is made apparent by the facts stated at the hearing on the Sunday Rest bill, and by the testimony of residents of the city, that Washington is on Sundays a very quiet and decorous city, comparing favorably in this respect with any other city in the land, whether under rigid Sunday restrictions or not.

This fact makes perfectly plain therefore the real purpose of the Sunday Law bill for the District. It was not for the District of Columbia at all; for the District had no need of it, even in appearance. It was simply and solely a scheme to commit Congress to Sunday legislation. First, a District Sunday law; and then, standing on this vantage ground, a demand for a national Sunday law. This is the program of the Sunday law agitators. A national Sunday law is their objective point.
