There is plenty of talk to-day concerning "Christian citizenship," and the duties of the "Christian citizen." This country is beyond question the grandest country in the world, but the Christian is a citizen of a better country than this. The citizen of this country may have privileges above that of citizens of all other countries, but the "Christian citizen" has privileges above even this, and the duties that pertain to the Christian citizen are far above and beyond, in every particular, the duties of him who boasts of his citizenship here. The Christian's citizenship is in heaven (Phil. 3:2, R. V.) and it is his privilege to have the "angels of God" (Heb. 2:6) do service for him. Heb. 2:14 (R. V.) Not only that, but he has been called to fill the position of fellow-worker with God (1 Cor. 3:9) and raised to the position of joint-heir with Jesus Christ as a child of God (Rom. 8:17) and been given the position of ambassador from the court of heaven (2 Cor. 2:20), his duty as such, grand and noble above all this earth can give, is to present the claims of God upon man to his fellow-beings, and call them from the kingdoms of this world unto the kingdom of God's dear Son. Col. 1:13.
