*"Sunday-School Times."*

INDEPENDENCE is one thing, obstinacy is quite another thing. Independence is standing all by one's self, without being dependent on another. Obstinacy is standing out against others, resisting all attempts to be swayed or influenced by others. An independent man is ordinarily not an obstinate man. He hears readily both sides, and willingly considers them. He may even adopt the view of another, as different from his former inclinations, but he does so because he of his own mind accepts that view without being controlled by anybody else. An obstinate man is ordinarily not an independent man. He sticks to his own opinion so closely that he cannot fairly consider any other, in order to see if it is better than his. An independent man is an open-minded man. An obstinate man has not an open mind. Independence is quite consistent with positiveness of nature and manner in expressing present views, even though these views may be changed by the reasoning of the next hour. Stubborn, unreasoning, blind obstinacy is never independent, although the man who is bound by it often deludes himself by thinking that he has independence.
