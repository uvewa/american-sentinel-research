*Present Truth* (London, Eng.), November 18.

The newspapers bring us the following note:—

"For refusing to touch a gun a young Hungarian conscript, Francis John Kiss, has been sentenced to five years' penal servitude with hard labor. The Pester-Lloyd, of Buda-Pest, gives details. Kiss was ordered to leave his home in the country and join the famous Honved Hussars in the capital. On the drill ground no persuasion or threat could induce him to shoulder arms; Christianity, he declared, forbade the use of deadly weapons. On being court-martialled, he was given the above sentence.

Christ said, "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Matt. 26:52. As a positive command, he also said, "Resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." Matt. 5:39. Now we know nothing of the young Hungarian's life, except what is told in the newspaper paragraph; but we do know that in that one thing he acted according to the precept of Christ; therefore it is an undeniable fact that he is now undergoing a cruel punishment for nothing else than for being a Christian, for following Christ.

"But no government on earth could exist, if all men should act as this young man did, and refuse to bear arms," is the universal cry. Of course they could not, and the sentence passed upon the young man is strictly in accordance with the law. There must be soldiers as long as there are earthly governments; but that very fact shows that these governments are not Christian, but anti-Christian.

Let no one decry human government, or revile soldiers; everybody has a right to be a soldier, who wishes to be one. The Christian must speak evil of no man, nor of men united to form a government; but every loyal follower of Christ is in duty bound to give a clear testimony as to what Christianity is, and, so far as his influence extends, to make it impossible for anybody to suppose that in killing men, or in learning to do so, he is serving Christ. Christ's kingdom is not of this world; therefore his servants do not fight. John 18:36. Earthly governments cannot exist without fighting; therefore they are directly opposite in character to that of Christ, the Prince of Peace. "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal." "If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed." 1 Peter 4:16.
