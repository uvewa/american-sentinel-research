It seems difficult for many people to grasp the truth that the battles of righteousness are never fought with carnal weapons. Whoever fights with such weapons is liable to defeat; but God is not liable to defeat. "The good fight of faith" is always victorious. If Spain and the United States should engage in war, the outcome would demonstrate nothing as to the rightfulness of the victorious side, any more than was demonstrated by the late war between the infidel Turks and the "Christian" Greeks.
