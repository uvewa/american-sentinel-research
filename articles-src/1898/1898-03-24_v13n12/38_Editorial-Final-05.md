A RECENT issue of the Journal (New York) contained the following interesting item:

Camden, N. J., March 11.—The new city council, in which the Reformers have a majority of five, opened with the recital of the Lord's prayer in concert by the thousand or more present. Before it ended a most disgraceful riot had ensued, in which City Clerk Varney was thrown out on his head and a certiorari, granted by Judge Garrison, was torn to shreds by angry citizens before the old council, controlled by Republicans, adjourned."

And yet, notwithstanding the above, which is only a sample of scenes occurring to a greater or lesser extent in both municipal, state, and national councils, we are told that it is nothing short of blasphemy to dare to open them without religious exercises. What a farce!
