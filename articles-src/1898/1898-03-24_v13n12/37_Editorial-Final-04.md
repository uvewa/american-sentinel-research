According to the Canadian Baptist March 17, there has been issued by the Ontario Lord's Day Alliance a request "that the first full week of April—3rd to 10th inclusive—be observed throughout the Province as a week of prayer for the Lord's day. . . . Besides special prayer it is hoped that on one of these days a special sermon on the subject will be preached, and also, where thought desirable, an offering be made for the work." What this "special sermon" may be we cannot tell, nor to what purpose the "offering . . . for the work" will be put; but we sincerely hope it may not be expended in haling before magistrates and courts those who, differing from them in their religious belief and practice, "remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy."
