A Chicago pastor, Rev. Frank Crane, in a recent sermon suggested that there was need in this country that "patriotism" be redefined. "It has been," he said, "a willingness to go out with a brass band and kill somebody for our country's sake; let it be also a willingness to stay at home and save somebody for our country's sake."

Referring to these tasks at home through which one may manifest a true patriotism, he said:—

"While glorious statesmen were champing the bit to get into the fore of battle, a little company of men and women were opening a social settlement over in the Gad's Hill district of Chicago. What about them? They wave no flags, shoot no bullets. They are patriots, however—real, not fustian.

"Open saloons and houses of shame carry on their nefarious trade of sapping the life and wealth from the common people? Why don't some of these fire-breathing patriots run a tilt at these?

"Giant trusts are monopolizing the free treasures of nature, more and more getting the tainted fingers of wealth firmly gripped upon the helm of state. Why don't a few patriots rise up to 'zealously and unselfishly devote themselves to the service of their country' by giving their lives, talents, and fortunes to remedying this state of things?

"Here is an army of worse than Spaniards; they are not across the ocean, they are mixed among us.

"Why don't some of our warriors go out to fight them? Alas! the reason is too plain. We can overcome this army only as we overcome ourselves. They are to be subdued only by daily righteousness, liberality, purity, and self-denial by us. We cannot meet them with blare of trumpets and beating of tom-toms, but only by love and service.

"It is always easier to die for a noble purpose than to live for it. If our country calls us to go and fight a foreign foe there is no doubt that plenty will respond. But the deeper, silent cry of agony of our dear land is for men and women who will give life and money to insure clean politics and honest councils, legislatures, and senates; for men and women who will give up—not their blood—but their greed and base ambition and petty pride and dishonest practices, in order that wealth may not be able to destroy a virtuous people, and in order that the swarming criminal classes may be lifted by persistent, devoted effort into a true citizenship."
