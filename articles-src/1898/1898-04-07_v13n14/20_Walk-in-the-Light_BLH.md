To Christian Endeavors of the Tenth Legion, and all others: Greeting,—Come and hear what the Lord hath said concerning the earth and man upon it.

The clear searching light of God's word (Heb. 4:12) has been shining in the darkness since redemption was made necessary by the fall of man, and it shines more and more unto the perfect day.

Christ said, "I am the light of the world." John 8:12. To us, as to every son and daughter of Adam, he hath said, "Yet a little while is the light with you" (2 Cor. 6:2); "WALK while ye have the light." John 12:35.

Walking in the light, we find the prayer of Christ effectual in our behalf, and the blessed Comforter sheds his bright rays upon our pathway. John 14:15–18. New life fills our soul as we sit under the breathings of our Master. John 20:22. All scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16, R. V.), and every time we hear or read the sacred word, Christ is breathing upon us and saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." O may we be moved by the same power that operated holy men of old. 2 Peter 1:21.

If any would contend with the word of God let him remember that he is opposing the Holy Spirit. John 6:63.

In the beginning, the Spirit of God was brooding over the void, "formless mass" (Gen. 1:1, 2, R. V. margin); and as he breathed upon it, forth from apparent confusion came forms of life and beauty. Six days he spent in organizing the matter which he had spoken into existence, and each day was the result of his creative power as well as the things created in that day.

In the seventh he stopped, stayed in it all day, and rested; then blessed it and made it holy; and he did it all for man. Gen. 2:3; Mark 2:27. Thus, he created the days and told us to work six days, just as he had done, but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holiness unto the Lord. Ex. 31:15.

So the Creator, our blessed Saviour, stands forever in the Sabbath, saying, Come unto me and I will give you rest. It is settled once and always just how the Lord wants us to use our time. Any other way of using time is robbing God and brings the curse upon the user.

Not only did the Lord create time but he created everything, and did it in such a way that it might be a pleasure to him forever. Rev. 4:11. Everything received form and life by the same blessed Spirit, breathed upon it (Ps. 33:6); so, "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof, the world and they that dwell therein" (Ps. 24:1); "The cattle upon a thousand hills" (Ps. 50:10–12); and the gold and silver is his. Haggai 2:8.

Abraham, the friend of God, had the correct idea of the Lord's ownership. When the wealth of Sodom was in his hand, though he did not claim so much as a thread of it as his own, he paid Melchizedek tithes of all. Gen. 14:16, 23, 20.

Christ is our high priest (Heb. 8:1, 2), after the order of Melchizedek (6:17–20), and he ever liveth to minister for us (7:23–25).

Levi received tithes when he ministered in the earthly sanctuary, but there "he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth." V. 8.

Of the tithe the Lord has said: "All the tithe of the land is holy." Lev. 27:30. If any one will use it for his own service, he must return it with a fifth part added thereto. V. 31. Nothing can be put in the place of it. If any man think to change it, both it and the change is holy. V. 32.

By the Creator himself was the seventh day made holy and if man should put all the other six in the place of it, it would not change the fact that the seventh day is God's holy day. So of our wealth; God has said the tithe is for the gospel.

"Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?" "Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel." 1 Cor. 9:13, 14.

The gospel worker who has no inheritance (Num. 18:23, 24) is as Christ was in this world (Matt. 8:20), and is a true ambassador, as though God did beseech men by him (2 Cor. 5:18–20). He is to live of the Lord's portion.

O brother, let us be careful how we use the Lord's holy things.

Of old he said of the city of Jericho, "It shall be utterly destroyed (Josh. 6); but the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron are holiness unto the Lord" (V. 19, margin). Keep yourselves from these things, was the word from Israel's King. But Achan took of the Lord's holy things and hid them among his own stuff. This man thought to save himself and family from possible want and enrich himself by robbing God; but he brought death and eternal ruin, not only upon himself, but his family and all that he had. Joshua 7:24, 25.

The Lord has said: "The seventh day is holy; it is mine;" "The tithe is holy; it is mine." How are we using God's holy things?

Are any of us robbing God? Are we under the curse? (Mal. 3:9) If we are, O let us come out immediately before the curse shall devour the earth and us too (Isa. 24:6), and show our faith in God by our works; and then, O then, we shall receive the latter rain,—a blessing poured out. V. 10.

Even though we are thieves and robbers, the Lord will pardon if we will come. Blessed be his holy name forever.
