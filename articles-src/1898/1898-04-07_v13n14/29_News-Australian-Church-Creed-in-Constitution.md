THE following statement was made in the Church News (Adelaide, Aust.), in March, 1897:—

"We, the members of the Church of England in Australia and Tasmania, desire that in the preamble of the bill which frames the Federal Constitution, some words may be inserted setting forth our national creed."

That it is the real object of all religious legislation—to get some of "our national [church] creed" into the fundamental law. That is what the churches always want on such occasions, but they are not always frank enough to say so.
