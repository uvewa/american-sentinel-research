In midst of darkness, when men slept as dead,
An angel found one wakeful in the night,
And bade him forth. They passed with quiet tread
Up through the paths of planetary light,
And saw the world's spin on as jewels of gold
Amid their silver moons in God-marked grooves.
The angel bade the waker earth behold,
And said, "She hath her orbit, aye, she moves."
This whisper of the angel thrilled his soul.
His eye grew keen with luster of delight.
Rolled back the clouds that shut him from the goal
Of the eternal God, whose throne grew bright.
Linked through creation to the God who made,
He thought the thoughts of Him who only loves,
And in men's ears again all undismayed,
He cried the angel's message, "Aye, she moves."
Then men roused from their sleep, then demons stirred,
Then hell drew up its hosts in war array,
Then smoke grew dense that morn might be deferred,
And night still hold o'er earth its fearful sway,
Then pope, priests, cardinals in splendor shone,
And banners flamed, and trumpets sounded out,
And stood the waker in the midst alone,
Derided by hell's hatred and men's doubt.
"Recant! Take back the word you've spoken out.
"How dare you so the learned and great defy?
"Your words the firm foundation stone shall rout,
"Unsettle thrones and cause the church to die."
"Minion of hell, inspired by hosts of night,
"This tumult all your heresy disproves.
"Shall we deny our feeling and our sight,
"To listen to your message that she moves?
"Death stares you in the face for lie like this.
"The church infallible gives her decree.
"So if a fate ignoble you would miss
"Recant, and it shall still go well with thee."
A moment light flashed o'er that eager face,
Then paled, the spirit in him seemed to pant.
Truth faltered on his lips, he lost his grace,
Faith wavered as he murmured, "I recant."
Yet scarce had the ignoble word been said,
Than strong conviction forced it from his soul.
A sudden majesty was in his tread,
As up he gazed to heaven's lighted scroll.
And suddenly tradition swept aside,
The fear of men his soul, made free, disproves,
And in the face of death, and hell, and pride,
He whispered, "Aye, and still she moves, she moves."
What good did pope and cardinals that day?
What good did priests and people who withstood?
Their work was only stubble, aye, and hay.
They built on the foundation only wood.
Build from the soul if ye would build for aye.
Build on the truth. Error itself disproves,
Or ye shall face a great vindictive day.
"The heretic was right, she moves, she moves."
