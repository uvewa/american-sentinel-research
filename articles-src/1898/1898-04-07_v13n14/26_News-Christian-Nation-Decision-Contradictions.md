Back in 1892 the Supreme Court of the United States gave a decision which was accepted by the advocates of National Reform as making this "a Christian nation." Recently, however, the Supreme Court decided that it is proper for the city of Boston to prohibit preaching in the city upon public grounds without a permit from the mayor; and now the Christian Statesman refers to this as an act of the nation "in direct contravention" of the gospel commission. Hence, by decision of the Supreme Court, from the Statesman's standpoint, the nation is both Christian and antichristian. But what, in the light of such facts, must one conclude as to the real value of a Supreme Court flat upon such a question?
