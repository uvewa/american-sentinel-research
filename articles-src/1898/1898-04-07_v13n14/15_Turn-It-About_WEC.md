In the *Union Signal* appears a call for the week following Easter, to be observed as a week of prayer "in behalf of the observance of the Lord's day."

Topics for consideration are given, the first one being as follows:—

"That good citizens may be led to give the ordinance of the Sabbath a new hearing, that its vital place in Christian civilization may be generally recognized, that Sunday protective laws may be provided for our national capitol, in the passage by Congress of the Sunday Rest Bill, that those states and territories which have no Sunday laws may secure them, and that existing laws may be better enforced."

Then next to the last topic suggested is this:—

"That the Christian Church may fully awake to the importance of the issue and Christian people set an example of consistent Sabbath-keeping in their homes and in public life."

Now Sabbath-keeping is a religious act—a matter of conscience between each man and God. There is nothing compulsory in it. Yet from the above it will be seen that the first thought is for an enforced (which means an unwilling) observance of the day, and after this comes an appeal to the church to do its duty. Query: If as much effort were put forth to secure the results hoped for in the latter topic as have been expended to accomplish the ends desired in the first—would these laws asked for be necessary?
