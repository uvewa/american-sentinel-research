The New York Sun calls attention to the curious effect of a Sunday closing proviso in the will of Mr. Lenox as regards the disposition of his library. This library is to be consolidated with the Astor library, and the two will constitute a great public library for the people of this city. This library is to be open on Sundays, so the committee having it in charge have decided; but they felt bound also by the Sunday proviso which covered a portion of it. The Sun says:—

"To the committee in charge of the consolidated library this fact has been not a little disconcerting. The Lenox collection was too valuable either to leave out altogether or to shut from view on a certain day of the week. Some one at length suggested that the difficulty could be solved by applying the rule only to those books which had belonged personally to Mr. Lenox. This it was decided to do, and a sub-committee was appointed to look into the matter. But when this sub-committee made its investigations it found that, of all the collection, those volumes possessed individually by Mr. Lenox consisted of a number of Bibles. These were accordingly set aside as coming under the law of the bequest, and on coming Sundays when the public throngs the new library, the only books that will be hidden from its view will be a number of Bibles."
