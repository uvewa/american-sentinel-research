OUT in a certain western town where theatricals and similar shows have been given a prominent place in the program of church work, an opera house manager has addressed a protest and memorial to the city council upon this point. He sets forth that the churches and the halls connected with them are ruining his business by giving entertainments and concerts of the same description as those for which he has to pay $100 annually into the city treasury; they, on the other hand, being exempt from taxation. He asks that either his license shall be rebated, or that the churches shall be subject to the same charge; and in case this is not done, declares that he will put in variety shows Sunday afternoon and evening, to meet the competition of the churches!

How long will it be at this rate before enterprising theater owners will be converting their play-houses into "churches," something after the order of the "Raines-law hotels" in this city, to evade a tax on their property, and thus stand upon common ground with their religious rivals?

Can anyone, in view of such facts, wonder that a message is going to the people of the earth proclaiming, "Babylon is fallen, is fallen"?
