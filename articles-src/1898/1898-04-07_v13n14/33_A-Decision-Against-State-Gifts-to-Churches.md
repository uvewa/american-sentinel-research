Such a decision has been recently rendered by the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana. It appears, however, that the grounds upon which the decision rests do not deny the validity of the principle of such gifts, and therefore the decision does not bar such gifts in future under certain conditions. The facts relating to this decision are set forth in the following quotations, taken from the Truth Seeker:

"In the city of New Orleans there are about two score institutions, all of them apparently sectarian, which have for years subsisted upon donations of money from the city. They have not been in any sense under the control of the municipality; they have been under no contract for the performance of any public service; they need not even report to the city how the money has been spent. Meanwhile legitimate public institutions have languished and the public schools been closed for want of funds to support them.

"In 1896 Henry Orr, Sr., sought in the District Court a 'citation upon the mayor, the treasurer, and the comptroller of the city, and also the common council, that relator have judgment against them decreeing all of said appropriations null and void, and prohibiting any further payment of the money appropriated by the budget of 1896 to the said private, charitable, and benevolent purposes, to said purposes and communities, and prohibiting the council from appropriating any money for said purposes out of the treasury for the year 1897, as proposed, or any subsequent year, and that the mayor be prohibited from approving and forbidden to approve any ordinance making such appropriation or appropriations; that the comptroller be forbidden from drawing and the treasurer from paying any warrant thereunder, or any money under color of appropriation for any private, charitable, or benevolent purpose whatever, to any person or community, or in aid of any church, sect, or denomination of religion whatever, and for all writs and orders necessary to enforce the judgment to that effect."

"At the time this action was brought, Judge Rightor, of the District Court, decided that the appropriations had not been made to sectarian institutions for the reason that all sects shared alike! Mr. Orr appealed the case, and has just got the verdict of the Supreme Court reversing the lower. The decision is a good one as far as it goes, but it does not promise to correct the abuse of public appropriations to sectarian institutions, for Chief Justice Nichols, by whom it was written, says that 'had the city made express contracts either with individuals or with private corporations by which the latter would have come under a well-defined civil, legal tie to perform such duties for the city, the officers of the city having legal power to exact performance according to the terms of the contract, and to hold such parties liable for breach of the same, and had the city passed ordinances appropriating money to carry out its obligations toward the other contracting parties under such contracts, and had the validity of such appropriations been submitted to us, a very different question would have been presented from that actually before the court.'"

We derive from this that Justice Nichols sees no objection to sectarian appropriations in themselves, but in the way they are made. Of course such a decision as that cannot be final. As hinted by the New Orleans Times-Democrat, the institutions will now have to revise and rearrange their scheme of charitable operations, and the city in its turn will have to make provision for the support of its indigent sick and poor and thus meet the points raised by the court. It is plain enough what kind of arrangements should be made. The city should take care of its own poor, in institutions under the sole management of the municipal officers, and the church should care for its own with its own means. Encouraging private enterprise in charity by means of public gifts or applications is a form of subsidizing calculated to increase the number of charitable institutions and to promote pauperism."
