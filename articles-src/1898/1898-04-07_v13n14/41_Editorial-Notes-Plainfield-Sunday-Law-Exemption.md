THE civil authorities of Plainfield, N. J., have decided that work done on Sunday by observers of the seventh day, in order not to be "to the disturbance of others," as the exemption clause provides, must be done so secretly that nobody except those engaged in it will know anything about it. See p. 213. This is about the value that this exemption for those who observe another day will have, in the heat of a Sunday law crusade.
