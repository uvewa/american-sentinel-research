THE pope has finally interfered to prevent war with Spain. It is stated that he has directed Archbishop Ireland to bring his influence to bear upon the President and others to secure a pacific attitude on the part of the Government towards Spain. But why should the papal influence be brought to bear upon the United States?

It takes two parties to make a quarrel, and in this case the other party is a most Catholic and "Christian" government—Spain. While the pope's influence with the American Government is unquestionably great, his influence with the Spanish government is unquestionably much greater. It is natural to suppose that he would exert his influence where it is most powerful, and hence would be most productive of results, if his aim is simply to prevent an outbreak of hostilities.

THE motive for the papal policy in this matter can be readily perceived when it is remembered that the Spanish government and the papal church are in the closest union. The Spanish government supports the papal church, and the latter is bound in turn to support the government to which it is joined. And it seems now that the pope is making an effort to do so. He wants peace; but more than that he wants disaster averted from Spain; because disaster to Spain means disaster to the church.

THE pope wants Cuba to continue under Spanish rule; because Spanish rule means papal rule. A new government in the island may not be as useful to the church as the Spanish government was; and a revolution in Spain, which would probably follow any serious blow to the present government, might inflict upon the church great damage. These are threatening evils to the church which the resources of papal policy are now employed to avert.

THE history of the smaller American republics within recent years furnishes plain evidence that the pope desires only such peace as is advantageous to the church. The clerical party in those republics are always the most active plotters of revolution when the government has become one of which the church does not approve. The church is the same in a republic of South or Central America that it is in Italy. The head of the church party in any country, is the pope; and Roman Catholics in every part of the world are by their own profession amenable to the pope, as the head of the church, in all matters having to do with the church and the Catholic religion. In all such matters they are bound by the word of the pope, and when they plot revolution in any country, in the interests of the church, it must be with the sanction of the church, which is the sanction of the pope. There is no other logical or reasonable conclusion.

In former times the popes secured compliance with their wishes from the nations by threatening the rulers and their subjects with excommunication. And as this was a proper and laudable proceeding then—from a Catholic point of view—and can be no less proper now than it was then, there can be no reason why the pope should not employ the same means to-day, except that it is not considered good policy for this age of the world. Mr. Moody is quoted as having said recently that the pope could, by a word, put a stop to the horrors in Cuba; and this is true. The Catholic religion cannot be separated from politics; and the pope can dictate the political action of his subjects, in any part of the world, in the name of the religion which they profess, and threaten them with excommunication if they refuse to comply with his instructions. And since he has not interfered to save the lives of the hundreds of thousands of victims of Spanish barbarity in Cuba, it is altogether too late for him to enter a plea before the American government in the name of peace and humanity.
