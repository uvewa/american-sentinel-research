The question of the legality of religious exercises in the public schools is before the Supreme Court of West Virginia for decision, and it is thought will be settled at an early date. The case was brought up by petition of Mr. John Kennedy, to compel the Board of Education of Grant District, Marion County, and the trustees of Boothville free school to discontinue the reading of the Bible before the pupils, this being a regular feature of the opening exercises in the schools.
