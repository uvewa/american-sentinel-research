PROBABLY with a view to the imminence of war between this country and Spain, a bill has been introduced in the U. S. Senate to provide for an increase of chaplains in the United States army. The most interesting part of this bill consists in its citation, as a basis of argument, of a number of resolutions adopted recently by the Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Pennsylvania. The bill says that, "Whereas, the Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Pennsylvania, held recently at Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, unanimously adopted the following resolutions," "Therefore, Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of War be, and is hereby, directed to consider the propriety of increasing the corps of army chaplains as suggested in the foregoing resolutions, and to report at the next session of Congress the advisability of the same."

The resolutions are as follows:—

"First That it is the unanimous judgment of this Synod that the present corps of Army chaplains should be increased to the number of the military posts, and to this end that our honorable Senators and Representatives in Congress be respectfully requested to give this important matter their early and earnest consideration.

"Second. That inasmuch as it is not the policy of the War Department to provide religious literature for the Army, therefore this Synod would suggest the manifest propriety of our Presbyterian people sending occasional gifts of Bibles, hymn books, and other valuable publications to the post libraries for the benefit of the soldiers.

"Third. That as ministers of the gospel believing in the power of prayer, we should ever deem it our sacred duty and privilege to pray often, both in private and public, for the salvation of our brave defenders on land and sea.

"Fourth. That the moderator, the stated clerk, and the chairman of the committee on army chaplains take such measures as shall most effectively bring the above resolutions before Congress; and that a copy of the report be furnished to each member of the Senate and the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania and West Virginia."

It is the policy of the Government—one of which most denominations approve—to supply the army with chaplains; but it is not the Government's policy (as the resolutions state) to supply the army with religious literature. But why should not the Government do one as well as the other? What difference is there, in principle, between them? It is certainly just as easy to select literature suitable for a proper ministering to the spiritual needs of the soldiers as to select men suitable for the same work. The latter, indeed, is the more uncertain and hazardous enterprise of the two.

It is all well enough to supply the soldiers of the army with religious literature; no class of men need such literature more than they, and it is, we believe, the privilege of any person or persons to supply it. But it is not necessary nor proper, that this should be done by act of Congress recognizing a particular denomination. If Congress would cease to assume the prerogative of a spiritual director, it would be better for the army and for the country.
