A few months ago there was an ordinance passed in Rio de Janeiro closing, with few exceptions, all shops and places of business at 12 o'clock on Sundays and prohibiting the sale of produce, merchandize, confectionaries, etc., etc., until the following Monday morning.

It is claimed that the ordinance has nothing to do with religion nor religion with it, but it is said to be simply for the benefit of clerks and employés, who were compelled to work all day on Sundays, that they might have Sunday afternoons for rest and recreations.

The ordinance did not give general satisfaction as it closed many shops where no clerks were employed.

A few Sundays ago a poultry dealer did not close his shop just at the hour appointed, and soon after the time to close, a boy came in and said that he would like to buy a chicken for dinner. The chicken was sold to him, and he had hardly reached the street before an officer entered and arrested the poultry dealer, brought him before the court and fined him $20. It was learned soon after, according to the poultry-man's statement, that the officer hired the boy to go and buy the chicken, and that the chicken was served on the officer's table for dinner, and the $20 was divided among two or three of his chum officers.

All sorts of iniquitous practices are carried on in Brazil under the pretense that might makes right.
