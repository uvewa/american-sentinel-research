Following this awakening in my own personal experience came a definite call to the work. I must ask to be pardoned for personal experiences, because, as I have before intimated, I can better serve the purpose of these articles by telling just what I know myself to be true. The experience of one harmonized so nearly with many another that this which I know best will serve as an illustration of the point of almost universal application which I wish to make.

I was engaged in literary work which kept me very closely confined to my study, but the interest which had been aroused by the crusade led me to read the accounts of its onward march each morning as they were published in the daily press. As weeks passed there gradually came to my mind a conviction that its progress meant something to me, to my own family of little children, and to the city in which I lived. But situated as I was, and with a constitutional shrinking from anything public, I made strenuous efforts to lay my burden off onto some one else. There were several ladies in my own church so situated in family, social, and financial conditions as to seem to me the natural leaders in such a movement. I tried by personal appeals to arouse in them this same interest with which I had been filled, but I invariably received the reply, "I am ready to help; I will do whatever the rest think best, but I am not ready to lead." I sent for my pastor and talked the matter over with him, and his reply was almost the same. "This is not a matter with which ministers have anything to do," he said "except to follow in the lead of those whom God has called to this work. This is a call to woman; I am ready to help, but I would not dare to think of leading."

At last, one day, one of these sisters of the same church to which I belonged came to see me. She was much older than I, and a woman of very strong Christian character and rich experience in the things of the Spirit of God. She said, "I have come to tell you something which has been impressed upon me. God never lays a burden upon one individual for somebody else. He never shows one person something which somebody else ought to do. He has not lain upon me any burden to lead in this work. I have no burden to get anybody to do anything. I am ready to help when there is an opportunity, but you have evidently been called to a special mission. I would advise you to stop trying to get somebody else to answer for you. Listen for yourself and ask God what this means."

I said, "Don't talk that way, I will tell you just how it is with me. I am very much in the same position as the little Hollander, who once found a tiny stream of water flowing through the dyke. He knew what it meant, as any intelligent Holland boy would have known. It meant that the ocean was coming. He felt the peril to the homes on the low lands, and instinctively thrust his finger into the little hole; it stopped the flow, but it also made a place for a larger stream, and when he understood what he had done he dared not remove his finger, for then it would not take long for the floods to break in upon all Holland; so he stood crying with weariness and fear until somebody found him. I do not dare move or speak, for the moment I do the ocean is upon me. I feel its pressure, and I am helpless before it." She replied, "Then, my dear child, take my advice; take this matter earnestly to the Lord, and submit yourself to him. The saloon is alive in this city: something must be done, and we must have a leader. If you are not the leader, God will make it plain; but if you are, do not dare refuse." She went away leaving me trembling and aghast before that which had been a growing conviction in my own soul for many weeks; that I had a call from God to something, but I knew not what.

That night, when my children were in bed, I went to my study, but not to write as I usually did until nine o'clock; only to pace my floor and to argue the question, What could I do? I was alone in the world with my little children, with no income except what I was picking up at the point of my pen; with no influence; with nothing but God. I spent that night walking, or lying upon the floor, or kneeling beside my chair, in earnest appeal to God that he should relieve me of this burden. But the more I prayed, the heavier it became, until at last it was a question of obedience or not. Will you obey or not? And when it was once uttered in this language in my soul, I had only one answer:—I must obey when God speaks so that I understand, whatever should be the consequences. I was lying upon the floor with my face upon my folded arms, and I said to Him, Show me what to do and I will do it. And for answer he gave me a task so simple that I laughed, and said to myself, How foolish I have been to make such a time over such a simple thing; done in a minute and ended. I will do this and then go back to my writing without anything to trouble me. I was only to send notices to all the church prayer meetings for the following Wednesday night, asking the women of the city to come together to consider what should be our relations to the saloon. I would write the notices and send them down to my grocer in the morning.

He was a leading member of the official board of the church to which I belonged; I would ask him for the parlors of the church in which to hold this meeting on the next Friday afternoon, that was all. I arose from the floor and wrote the notices; a brief call which I signed with my own name. I enclosed a note to him stating that if he was not willing that we should have the parlors I would like to see him, but if we could have the parlors, would he kindly send his delivery boy with the notices to the pastors of the various churches. I was immensely relieved as soon as this was done; in fact, so light-hearted that I had no sense of weariness after my night's vigil.
