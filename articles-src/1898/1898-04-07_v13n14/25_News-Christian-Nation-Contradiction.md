The Supreme Court flat that "this is a Christian nation," continues to be traversed by the action of the Government. On Sunday, the 27th inst., the President and his Cabinet, it is stated, instead of repairing to church, as is their custom, busied themselves in consultations with reference to the situation which has developed in the relations of the Government with Spain, just as would be done on an ordinary day of the week. Of course rest on Sunday is not an obligation of Christianity, according to the Scriptures; but having treated Sunday as an ordinary day, the Government—as represented by its chief executive and his cabinet—cannot even claim to be Christian from the standpoint of popular religious belief.
