SEVERAL bills relating to Sunday observance have this year been brought before the Massachusetts legislature, with the object of securing a more rigid enforcement of Sunday observance in that State. The principal one of these reads thus:—

"AN ACT

"Relative to the Observance of the Lord's Day.

"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

"SECTION 1. Section one of chapter four hundred and thirty four of the acts of the year eighteen hundred and ninety-five is hereby amended by striking out, in the second, third, fourth, and fifth lines, the words 'or an entertainment given by a religious or charitable society, the proceeds of which, if any, are to be devoted exclusively to a charitable or religious purpose,' so as to read as follows:—

"SEC. 1. Whoever is present at a game, sport, play, or public diversion, except a concert of sacred music, upon the Lord's day, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five dollars for each offense.

"SEC. 2. This act shall take effect upon its passage."

Another measure, having for its object "To further regulate the observance of the Lord's day," provided that "Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of chapter ninety-eight of the Public Statutes [relating to Sunday observance] or of any amendment thereto, shall be liable to a fine of ten dollars for each and every man, woman, or child employed by them in violation of such provision."

A third measure provided that unincorporated religious and charitable societies should be included in the exceptions provided for incorporated bodies of this nature, in the Sunday regulations.

A hearing was recently granted the advocates and opponent of these measures by a committee of the legislature, and the occasion proved to be one of much interest. A correspondent who was present at the hearing sends us the following relative to its results:—

"In brief, it was a grand victory for the principles of liberty. The issue was a surprise to me, and I am certain it was such to the promoters of the bill; although if the testimony given is to be taken, this bill is like Melchizedek, in that it has neither father nor mother. The secretary of the New England Sabbath Protective League, in his closing speech, after the speakers for the remonstrance had riddled the Sunday banner for three days with telling arguments, positively denied any responsibility concerning the initiation of the movement, although the secretary of the legislative committee told me in private that said organization did originate the measure. The attorney for the petitioners, also, denied any responsibility in the matter.

"But it was a grand affair. Mr. Geo. Fifield spoke for the International Religious Liberty Association. Three speakers spoke for the "Free Religious Society,"—an organization whose principles relating to the rights of conscience are identical with our own. I was overwhelmed with the thought all through the hearing that the future will witness a grand struggle over the rights of conscience here in New England, before the chains to enslave the souls of men are fully forged and fastened on the victims.

"It did me good to see those noble men declare so boldly for personal liberty. The hearing consumed four days, scarcely finishing on the fourth. When the committee reported to the general court, on the Sunday bills, the verdict was, 'Ought not to pass.' On the third, the principle measure, however, they granted 'Leave to withdraw.' That was the conclusion of what I regard as a very notable hearing. It was very evident that the members of the committee had been careful readers of the SENTINEL. Proof of this was evident from the manner in which the petitioners were questioned."

The great call of the hour is for education—education of the public mind relative to the principles which define the proper attitude of the state toward religion. There is no more imperative call than this.
