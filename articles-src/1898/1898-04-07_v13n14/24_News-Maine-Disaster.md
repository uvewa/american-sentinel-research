The findings of the Government Board of Inquiry charged with investigating the destruction of the U. S. battleship "Maine," fasten the responsibility for the occurrence upon the Spanish government. While the Board did not announce this as a part of its report, it found that the battleship was destroyed by a submarine mine; and the explosion of a submarine mine in Havana harbor under such circumstances as those prevailing at the time, could not have been accomplished without complicity on the part of the Spanish officials having supervision and control of the defenses.
