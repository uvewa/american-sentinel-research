The words stricken off from the French coinage were about equally significant with the words "In God We Trust," upon gold and silver coins of the United States. They in fact mean nothing, and hence are only superfluous. No nation—not even the most professedly Christian one—trusts in God; their trust is in their armies and navies; and to stamp the name of God upon its currency—which itself represents the god of most people—is only to take that name in vain.
