The "flag salute" is in evidence again, this time on the Pacific Coast, at Ashland, Ore. The salute has been made compulsory in the public schools of that place, the result being that four children have been suspended for refusing to participate in it, and more like cases are expected to follow.

The salute requires that the pupils shall stand and repeat the words, "We give our heads and our hearts to God and our country." As no person can be rightfully compelled to give either his head or his heart to either God or his country, there are some who naturally refuse to comply with the demand, and the consequence is they are punished by being suspended from the schools. Of course, these individuals are those who adhere most to the dictates of conscience. They are really punished for being conscientious.

Parents of these children have appealed to the principal of the schools and to the board of directors for relief, but they are told that there is no harm in the salute, and that they are taking an extreme position; also that they ought to be willing to strain their consciences if necessary for the sake of patriotism and discipline in the schools.

The public schools are established to instruct the children in the rudiments of scientific knowledge. With patriotism, or any other sentiment, they have rightfully nothing to do. Every person, whether child or adult, has a right not to be patriotic if he so chooses, and he cannot be molested in this or in the exercise of any other sentiment so long as he does no injury to the rights of others. This is true even conceding that the flag salute is an exhibition of true patriotism.

But as a matter of fact, it is nothing of the kind. True patriotism is spontaneous, never forced. The children may be taught to repeat certain patriotic phrases, but this is very much like trying to make a patriot out of a parrot. Patriots are not made in that way.

Teach the children to respect the rights of one another and of all people; and teach them this by respecting their own rights. This will develop in them the principles of true manliness, and only as these principles are developed can there be any development of the patriotism that is of real worth to the state.
