Very serious race conflicts are reported from Wilmington, N. C., and Greenwood, S. C., resulting in the death of twenty-two men, mostly negroes. At the latter place an election riot precipitated the trouble, a party of negroes going armed to the polls, with a view of enforcing their right to vote as they pleased; this by the ill advice of one or two white men. The effort to suppress the negro vote in the South, while it may be successful for a time, can never bring any permanent condition of peace, but on the contrary, must result in continual and ever increasing friction. For the negroes have, a right to vote, a right upheld by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution—and they are aware of this right, and the more they become uplifted in the social scale by education, the more intelligently and persistently will they contend for their political freedom. Either every movement in the direction of intellectual freedom for these people must be stopped, or the white people of the South must be prepared for the eventual rise of the colored race to the plane of political equality.

It is very natural that white people should prefer people of their own race for public office; but to deny to any people the political rights guaranteed by the highest law of the land only produces an unnatural state of things which can but be a constant menace to the peace and prosperity of the State.
