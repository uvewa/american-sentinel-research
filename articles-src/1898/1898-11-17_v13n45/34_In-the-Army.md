## In the Army.

Jack thought he would like to be a soldier. He had read about great wars, and men who were called great because they had led great armies to fight and kill their fellowmen.

The sound of a drum always set Jack's feet to stepping off the music, and made him wish he was big enough to be a soldier. He was always ready to run after a procession that had a band of music.

Jack's mother was sorry that he had such notions. She thought war was an awful thing. She said men ought to help one another, and that it was a great sin for them to spend their time trying to kill each other.

One day Jack was thinking over his favorite dream about war, and about being great, and at last he exclaimed, "Mother, I do wish I could soon be old enough to be a soldier."

"Why, Jack, you are old enough to be a soldier," said his mother, seriously.

"Yes, I suppose I might be a drummer boy," said Jack dryly. "I have read of drummer boys being only twelve years old. But I want to carry a gun or a sword."

"We are now at peace with the world," replied Mrs. Stark, "but there is a war that goes on all the time, with an enemy that none of us can see. I do wish you would become a good soldier in that war."

"What war is that, mother?" asked Jack, and he seemed to be very much interested all at once. "I didn't know there was any war now."

"I mean the war against sin,—bad thoughts, naughty words, and ugly acts. The enemy that carries on this wicked war against us is Satan. We cannot see him, and for this reason he beats us many times. The worst of it is that we too often help him to fight against ourselves, when we ought to be always against him. It is a poor soldier who turns against himself and against the army to which he belongs."

"But I don't quite understand how we help the enemy," said Jack.

"Well, I will tell you," replied his mother. "Satan knows that as long as he can get us to tell lies, or quarrel with each other, or steal, or cheat, even in little things, he can defeat us. As long as any of us do selfish things, we cannot have eternal life, and that is what our enemy wants to keep from us."

Jack became more and more interested as his mother told him that he could now be a soldier in God's army, which is fighting a much greater battle than the greatest man could fight. God wants little boys and girls for soldiers just as much as he wants men and women; and they can win just as great victories.

Who will be a soldier for Christ? It is much better to fight to save men than to fight to kill them. The boy or girl who, by Christ's help, keeps from doing wrong, is greater than the captain that takes a city.—Selected.
