Whether Jesus Christ would or would not say what the Rev. Dr. Burrell says he would on this subject, it is certain that if he gave an admonition to vote, he would tell how that vote ought to be cast. He would not merely say, "Vote right," but he would state what the right vote is. Jesus Christ never left his followers in the dark on any point of Christian duty. He always stated to them clearly what duty was. This was his mission while he walked and taught throughout Judea.
