The advent of America as a military power upon the scene of European complications in the far East, said Lord Salisbury, the English premier, at a recent speech, "is a grave and serious event, which may not conduce to the interests of peace; though," he added, "I think in any event it is likely to conduce to the interests of Great Britain." These are weighty words, spoken by one who occupies the position of a competent observer and judge.
