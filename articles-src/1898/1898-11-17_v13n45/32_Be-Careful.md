## Be Careful.

In speaking of a person's faults,
Pray don't forget your own;
Remember those with homes of glass
Should never throw a stone;
If we have nothing else to do
But talk of those who sin,
'Tis better we commence at home,
And from that point begin.

We have no right to judge a man,
Until he's fairly tried;
Should we not like his company,
We know the world is wide.
Some may have faults, and who have not?
The old as well as young;
Perhaps we may, for all we know,
Have fifty to their one.

I'll tell you of a better plan,
And find it works full well,
To try our own defects to cure,
Before of others tell.
And though I sometimes hope to be
Not worse than some I know,
My own shortcomings bid me let
The faults of others go.

Then let us all when we commence
To slander friend or foe,
Think of the harm one word may be
To those who little know.
Remember, curses frequently,
Like chickens, roost at home;
Don't speak of others' faults until
You've tried to see your own.

—Plank and Platform.
