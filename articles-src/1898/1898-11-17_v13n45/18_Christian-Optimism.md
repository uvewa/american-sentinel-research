Whether it is pessimistic or not to speak of the darker side of national or international affairs, it is always best to look facts in the face. That is the only way to be prepared for emergencies and avoid being compelled to face still worse conditions. The outlook would be hopelessly dark under all circumstances were it not for the hope of the gospel, and to him who has that hope no circumstances can make the outlook less than bright. The Christian is an optimist, always; and not to be such is to deny the Christian faith.
