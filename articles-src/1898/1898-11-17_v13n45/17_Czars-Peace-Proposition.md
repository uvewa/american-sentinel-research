In the same speech Lord Salisbury made this reference to the czar's proposition for international peace: "The czar has invited a congress to provide for the disarmament of the world; but while we offer our heartiest tribute to his motives and are willing to assist and sympathize in every way until the happy day when his aspirations are crowned with success, we must still provide precautions needful to counteract the dangers surrounding us." In this statement the English premier has outlined the position not only of Great Britain, but of all the leading powers of Europe. They all "sympathize" with the proposition in an abstract way, and are willing to lend it such assistance as is compatible with a continual extension of their own possessions and power in the earth, and increase of their military forces to counteract the surrounding dangers. But how long will it take at that rate to reach the sought-for condition of general and lasting peace?
