## Studies in French History. —47.

"Well, boys, I am very much rejoiced to see you once more," said Professor Carman, as Charlie and Rob took their old places with the others in the French History class.

After the hearty greetings were over, Charlie White said: "I suppose, professor, that you are getting along pretty fast with the studies. I'm afraid Rob and I can't catch up very soon."

"But I suppose you have learned far more while you have been gone than we who have been obliged to stay at home; for I saw by the letter you wrote us that you were visiting many places of historical interest; perhaps you would be willing to tell us of something you saw which impressed you the most," said Professor Carman.

"Well, I will mention one thing which had a sort of horrible interest about it, for us, boys, and that was, that on the 24th day of August last, Rob and I walked up and down the very streets where the poor Huguenots were mowed down like grass in that awful St. Bartholomew affair."

"Yes," said Rob, "we thought more about it on that day than on any other while we were in Paris, because that is the anniversary. Every time we heard a bell ring all that day it made us start."

"The next day after we wrote you the letter, we went over to Rheims, from Paris," said Charlie, "it isn't more than 100 miles, I think, by rail. Rob and I remembered that this is the town where almost all the French kings were crowned."

"Fie, Charlie," interrupted Rob, "I don't believe we would either of us have remembered a thing about it, if our interesting old Miguel hadn't told us,—he went with us, you know."

"I guess Rob is right," smiled Charlie; "for I remember how much Miguel had to say about Joan of Arc, and how she finally managed to get Charles the Victorious over there to be crowned."

"We took old Miguel with us because we had got so we could understand him quite well, and he was good and honest. When we first walked through the city gates he said in his funny brogue that 'dis vas de gate' where the English came out and handed the keys of the city to the French king. Miguel used to tell us her sad story over and over."

"Did you learn about how large the city of Rheims is at the present time?" asked Professor Carman.

"I think father said this morning that it was said to contain about 90,000 people or more," replied Rob. "It is very pleasant just outside the city, for it is real hilly, and on almost all the hills there are pretty vineyards growing."

"Well," said the teacher, "perhaps it would be best to go on with our regular studies now. Of whom were we speaking in our last lesson, Edna?"

"I think Cardinal Richelieu was the character we were talking about; he seemed to be a greater man even than King Louis XIII. himself."

"He was; for the king was almost constantly under his influence. It was through him that France was placed, as history states, 'at the head of all European nations.' And he did a still better deed for his people than that. He made a very vigorous protest against dueling, which in his time—the 17th century—was getting to be horribly common; the cardinal made it a law that any one who was caught fighting a duel should be executed just like any other murderer; and the seconds on both sides should share the same fate."

"I should not think it would have been very fashionable to fight duels after that," smiled Milly Brown.

"Indeed it was not. But though this man did some good deeds, his record is marred by acts of folly. He was a very vain man, and dearly loved to make a show. Once when he had occasion to go to Lyons, he had a regular house built for himself to ride in; of course there was only one room in it, but he had it furnished just as elegantly and expensively as a palace. This little house he had carried on men's shoulders—with himself inside of it;—there were eighteen men chosen for this work, and he could walk about or lie down at any time he chose."

"I don't see how he could get through the city gates with such a big concern," said practical Jack, with a puzzled look.

"I'll tell you how they did it," smiled his teacher, "they just went to work and tore the walls down to make a gate big enough for the big gentleman to pass through! and if they came to any ditches, they either had to fill them up or build a bridge over them."

"How grand! exclaimed Milly Brown. He must have felt just like a fairy prince. I tell you, I wish I could ride around that way!"

Professor Carman smiled as he said:

"Well, but Milly, remember that the cardinal was getting to be an old man now, and he was sick at the time; this is the only excuse for his vanity that I can make. I will venture to say that he did not look at all like a fairy prince; age and gray hairs and wrinkles do not become fairies, Milly.

"At last," continued the teacher, "this great man died. He was great indeed, as the world esteems greatness."

"I don't see how King Louis ever did without him," said Harry Ray.

"Poor Louis died in a few short months afterward. I dare say he found the burdens he had to bear too much to carry alone. Though he only said coolly, when told of his friend's death, 'There is a great politician gone!'"

King Louis died at the age of forty-two, in the year 1643—just thirty-three years to a day after the death of his father, Henry of Navarre.

"Next week," said Professor Carman, as he dismissed the class, "we will take up the history of France under King Louis XIV."
