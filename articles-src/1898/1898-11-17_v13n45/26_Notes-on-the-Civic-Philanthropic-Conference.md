## Notes on the Civic-Philanthropic Conference.

BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

*(Concluded.)*

THE Rev. P. J. McVeety, presiding elder Albion District, Mich., told how he had at one time, when threatened and cursed by certain men who were trying to establish a gambling house in town, and which he was trying to prevent by calling on the officials and prominent citizens of the place, shook his fist under their noses—and he went through the performance on the platform—and told them to do their worst but that they would find out who would get the worst in such an affair.

When Dr. Holmes had a chance to speak again, he said that however strange, impracticable and extreme might seem his propositions, he never expected to advocate and proclaim any such method as had been advocated and proclaimed there by a preacher and a missionary. That even though men might be seeking his life, he could not but regard it as morally wrong for him to retaliate by taking their lives. He would offer no resistance. As to Roman slavery being worse than the present, he pointed to particular trades and instances that he knew of in which men were driven so hard that they could last only a few years and then were turned out physical wrecks to starve. No such state of things had ever existed in any previous system of slavery, because the slave was property and it did not pay to abuse him. Strong objection had been made to his proposition that all men were of equal value and that they should all receive equal—namely, what they need. It was declared that all men are not of equal value—that some were worthless; that those who were industrious and frugal in early life would be comfortable in old age, but that those who were improvident and wasteful would not be comfortable in old age, and that no system could be devised that would make them comfortable. Some men had more talents and abilities than others and were therefore worth more to society. He replied that he remembered that a great teacher had once given a parable in which the truth of his proposition was illustrated, that in this parable some labored all day long, and others labored only one hour, but "he gave to every man a penny."

President Blanchard, of Wheaton College, gave a most impartial and judicial exposition of the question. He said that the time had arrived when it was almost impossible to consider this question from anything but a partisan standpoint, if one expected to be listened to with approval, or indeed heard at all. He carefully and at length stated all the grievances that are brought forward by the average wage-earner against capital. Then he stated the case of the wage earners as made out by themselves. It was easy to see that there was justice and injustice on both sides. It was true that labor was not getting its fair reward, that it was in many instances defrauded by capital. But equally true were the statements by the wage-payers that many of those who make the loudest complaints are worthless and that it is a loss in most instances to employ them, that they are improvident and spend their money recklessly; that those persons who are sober, industrious and frugal get along all right. That a mining town in which it was necessary to distribute food to the needy inhabitants, and yet in which fifty-one saloons did a thriving business, could not be made comfortable at any wages or by any sum of money. Each side insists that the fault is entirely on the other side, and they have no use for a person who takes any other view of the matter.

President Blanchard thought that the great mistake that was made by socialists and other reformers, and also by rich men who had attempted to help their employés, was the ignoring of the fact that man is more than so many pounds of flesh and bone; that he has a spiritual nature, and that the remedy which only ministers to and comforts his body can never supply his needs. He did not believe that any system that simply made the bodies of men comfortable would be able to maintain even that comfort long. Owing to the constitution of man, he could not believe that any system would ever come in which all would be equally comfortable and well cared for. It seemed to him a law of nature and a law of God that industry and frugality had their reward, and that idleness and improvidence had their penalty. That those who were saying and industrious in youth would be comfortable in old age, and that those who were not, who would not deny themselves at present for future needs, would not be comfortable, and could not be made so under any system. That a system that made all men comfortable and provided equally for all their wants regardless of these things would be a turning aside of what the Creator of men had ordained, and a putting a premium on things upon which he had placed his curse.

In the evening, Labor Commissioner Cox, of Michigan, was present and made the opening speech. He thought this was a grand and glorious country. He would rather be a citizen here, however mean his position, than the most exalted person in any other country. This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Never mind who or what party is in power, things will come out all right. If those in power do not do what they should, the people speak and they are no more. Naturally enough he drifted into the Spanish war, and told how, since the birth of the present year, this great country had fought a glorious war in behalf of liberty and humanity. The workingman and the millionaire and the sons of millionaires fought side by side in this war for God. An iniquitous despotism had been crushed by them and millions of people set free with a loss of only seven men. "God carried the banner," he exclaimed, "for it was a war in behalf of humanity and God. I call it a holy war."

When he was through the mayor arose and quietly made the following remarks: "Let those who wish take what comfort and satisfaction they can from the Spanish war. The governor of Michigan told me the other day, and it is evident to everyone, that it would have been vastly cheaper to have bought the Island of Cuba outright at any price that might have been named. The most exorbitant price could not have equalled the cost of this war. So much for it as a matter of dollars and cents. The governor also said that there were in Michigan alone two hundred families in mourning as a result of that war. As to the war itself, I believe with Benjamin Franklin, that there never was a good war nor a bad peace. War is hell, and to say that there is or can be a Christian war, is to say that there is or can be a Christian hell. It is a contradiction in terms and cannot be."

The audience manifested its approval by hearty hand-clapping.

The mayor next introduced Prof. George D. Herron, of Iowa College, Grinnell, Iowa, from whom he said he had learned more than from any other man of his duty to his brother out of a job. Professor Herron gave an address which indicated deep earnestness and thought. He took more radical positions than any previous speaker. Some of the things he said were:

The economic system under which we live en-laves not only the bodies but the souls of men. The system must be changed in order that both body and soul may be made free. That the present economic system, the corner-stone of which is supreme selfishness, is the root of nearly all the moral evils that afflict society, and that as long as this system continues no headway can be made against these other evils.

That the saloon and other evils were actually supplying a need, a social want, for millions of people. That here only could they meet and in obedience to the cravings of their natures, associate with and open their hearts to one another. The saloon was therefore supplying a human need which the churches did not supply. That was the secret of the saloon power.

That under the present system our supreme virtues were our supreme immoralities. That greed, the worst of all sins, for it was covetousness, was the supreme virtue of the American people. If he should stand before a representative religious congregation in this country and ask them to practice, just as they were spoken, the principles of the sermon on the mount, he would be looked upon as mentally unbalanced. But if the head of some great combination that had overridden the law and robbed the people, should stand before them with an endowment in his hand, their applause would be tremendous, and they would be ready to fall prostrate before him.

He said that what was wanted was not that the corrupt should be turned out and the "good" people put in. The very worst enemies of the liberation of the people were, as had been in all history, the "good" people. That there was a certain manliness in the magnate of wealth utterly foreign and beyond those "good" people who fawned before him and excused his methods. The very worst difficulty to be met to-day in liberating the people was the pious subterfuge that if the heart of the individual was set right things would be all right. He declared that under the present system the heart of the individual could not be set right; that this was not only a slavery of the body but a slavery of the soul as well; that when the time came for the children of Israel to worship God and understand his law, Moses did not go among them distributing tracts and telling them to set their hearts right as individuals. No, he did not waste his time in that way. He went to the despotic ruler of the country, who had oppressed them so that they were in slavery both soul and body, and said, "Let my people go!" That is what is demanded to-day—that the people shall first be liberated from the present economic slavery so that they may indeed become all right as individuals.

He declared that profit was a moral evil. That any man who worked for wages, no matter how kind his employer or how high his wages, was a slave. That the present system of wages was but an evolution of the slave system. He did not blame anybody any more than he blamed himself. That it was time to repent of our industrial sins, or it might be that we should be called upon to repent with barricaded streets flowing with blood.

On Saturday evening, Attorney-General Maynard, of Michigan, gave an address in which he showed that the progress of a people was indicated not by art, sculpture, architecture, literature, etc., but by the state of the law. If they had truly made progress they would know that all men were equal and that equality would be recognized and guaranteed by their laws. Justice would be impartially administered. All progress that had been made in the world had been made by the humble and the lowly who have always had to push onward and break the crust that is being continually formed by those who are at the top who are satisfied, and therefore want no change. He hoped that progress would continue until every unjust law would be abolished; when every law would be based upon the great principle, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Only then could there be perfect liberty.
