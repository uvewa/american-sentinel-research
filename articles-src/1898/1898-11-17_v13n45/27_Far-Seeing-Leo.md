## Far-Seeing Leo.

A New York paper of October 27, announces the appointment, by the pope, of Archbishop Chapelle, of New Orleans, as Apostolic Delegate to Cuba and Porto Rico: also of the Philippines, in the event of those islands coming into the possession of the United States.

It is said that the archbishop is a warm, personal friend of President McKinley, and "as the question of church and state is one of the most serious problems facing the government in the new territories, the importance of Monsignor Chapelle's opinion, derived directly from the pope [italics ours] can hardly be exaggerated. That is so. The importance of such opinions, coming as they will, directly from the pope, cannot possibly be exaggerated. They bode no good for this country; although it is highly probable that those for whose benefit such opinions are to be formulated will not regard them in that light.

He who has the least knowledge of the papacy knows perfectly well that the pope's first consideration is always "the church." Whatever movement the pope makes, political or otherwise, is always for the good of "the church," that the Catholic religion may become a force in public as well as in private life. Thus in a speech a few years ago, to the pontifical household, among other things, he said, "It is of great importance that all work together to make religion a force in public as well as in private life. It is the duty of rulers to lend their support to religious creeds." And not a great while ago he charged the "faithful" that they should do all that lies in their power to the end that the nation should be molded after the papal idea of government.

The pope's solicitude for the United States is well known. In 1892 (July 11), the New York Sun published a letter from the Vatican in which are found these words: "He [the pope] wants America to be powerful, in order that Europe may regain strength from borrowing a rejuvenated type."

Now that Porto Rico has come into the possession of the American Government, and the possibility of the same being true of Cuba and the Philippines, the ever-watchful Leo, recognizing the serious religious problems the United States must face in dealing with these territories, has promptly appointed a territorial "apostolic delegate," so that the President might get the benefit of the pope's opinion upon this question. That an intimate friend of the President should be chosen to fill this office is perfectly natural. To do otherwise would be worse than useless.

As apostolic delegate, Archbishop Chapelle feels very confident that in these church and state problems he can help our Government. Thus he says: "As a thoroughly loyal American I may be able to help our Government in the work of reconstruction. The political and social welfare of the people of the islands will greatly depend upon proper reorganization. The United States will readily understand that its political and economical interests, as well as the honor of the country among nations, require that this work of reorganization should be carried out with justice and equity to all. My duty will be to look after the liberty of conscience and the protection of person and property."

While much is expected to be gained from the close friendship existing between the President and the archbishop, there is danger of the papal scheme being recognized as such. The pope therefore must be made to appear as in thorough harmony with the United States on the question of religious liberty.

Later this will be made still more plain.
