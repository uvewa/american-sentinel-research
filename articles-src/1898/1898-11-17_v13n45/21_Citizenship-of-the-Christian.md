Recently the Rev. Dr. Burrell, a clergyman well known in this city, preached a discourse on the subject of "The Citizenship of the Christian." In stating some of the duties of this citizenship, he said:—

"Third, cast your ballot. Jesus Christ could not do it. He belonged to a subjugated race, but if he stood here to-day he would say, 'Vote, and vote right.' This is a duty that no Christian man should think of neglecting."
