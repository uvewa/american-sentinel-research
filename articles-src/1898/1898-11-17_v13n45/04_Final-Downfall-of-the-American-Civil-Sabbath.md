THE two supporting pillars upon which the "civil Sabbath" structure rests, are Tradition and Legislation. Tradition asserts that Sunday is the Christian Sabbath—contrary to the testimony of Scripture—and Legislation has always been resorted to in support of the day as such. But neither of these can afford it any real and permanent support, being themselves of human origin, and partaking of the weakness of all merely human things. Tradition will be swept away by truth, and all human Sabbath laws by the divine Sabbath law, which speaks nothing in support of the first-day Sabbath, but declares the true Sabbath to be the seventh day, "the Sabbath of the Lord." As Sampson, under the power of the divine Spirit, overthrew the Philetine temple of old, so must this modern temple of error fall by the agency of the same Spirit, and involve in its ruin those who have thought to take refuge in it.
