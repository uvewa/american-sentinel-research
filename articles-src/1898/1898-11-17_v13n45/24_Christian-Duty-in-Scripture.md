But it is certain, nevertheless, that the inspired Word gives a complete statement of Christian duty, not only for the time in which it was written, but for Christian people and all others to-day. To say less than this would be to impeach the wisdom or deny the power of God. And therefore it is certainly true that whatever so-called Christian duty cannot be found stated in that Word to-day, is not a Christian duty at all.
