**Worship Governmentally Enforced at Annapolis.**

*Truth Seeker.*

If advices from Annapolis are reliable, church attendance by the naval cadets has been made compulsory. The regulations of the naval academy recite:—

"Cadets will not be excused from religious service at the chapel on Sunday, except upon their declaration in writing, with the written approval of their parents or guardians, when living, that they cannot conscientiously attend, or that they prefer, on the ground of their religious faith, to attend the services at some other place of worship in town."

A reason assigned for the order is that it is calculated "to maintain a loyal support of the religious services that the government has provided."

It is useless to inquire with what consistency a government which proclaims its separation from the church provides religious services for its citizens; we know that not consistency but corruption is responsible for the fact; but a remark of Admiral McNair in defense of the regulation is worthy of notice. He is quoted as saying: "This rule was laid down in the English navy as far back as Charles II. We have copied it and have not changed the language as much as the English have."

Now Charles II. was a 'depraved' monarch who occupied the throne of England one hundred years before the American Revolution, at which time monarchy and the union of church and state were both repudiated. The regulation quoted by Admiral McNair is wholly congruous with the institutions of a country which maintains an established church, but the admiral seems to be too dull to see that it is no more applicable to American affairs than the regulations concerning the maintenance of a throne are to the office of a president of a republic.

If Admiral McNair can find no authority for his rule in the Constitution of the United States—which he certainly cannot, for that instrument prohibits everything of the kind—his first duty is to see that it is repealed. Treachery to our fundamental law in time of peace is as infamous as betrayal of the nation's cause when the country is at war.
