Some time ago it was announced that the French government had decided to strike off the words "Dieu protege la France" from all French gold and silver coins. It appears that no definite action has been taken on the point up to the present, but now the intention is to be carried into effect. A Paris paper, the Gaulois, in making note of the fact, intimates that Frenchmen no longer have faith in Providence, but view God as being too high and far away, and that the republic needs protection nearer by. It is but natural, of course, that in view of the calamities that have fallen upon France in recent years, the idea of God as the national protection should have waned in the minds of the people. The false conception that the nation is Christian, and therefore bound to be under the divine protection, leads naturally, under adverse conditions, to the equally false idea that God is too high and too far off to pay much attention to human affairs, especially the comparatively small affairs of a single individual; and thus it leads naturally to loss of faith in God.
