# Bartholdi's Statue.

BY FRANCES E. BOLTON.

ALONE the sculptor sat and silent yet,
Wide was his vision, though hills barred him round.
The scenes of ages his wide gazing met,
And truth to truth linked as a chain new found.
As doth clear lightning smite an electric path
Through clouds of blackness in one vivid flash,
So through the clouds of Time's historic wrath,
He saw truth's meaning in a statue mask.

As in a wide, unseen kaleidoscope,
Shifting from scene to scene, there met his view
Age upon age, where flickering rays of hope,
Now darkened, burst again in radiance through
In light of liberty, and springing up,
As one inspired, he smote the shapeless block,
Cleaving away superfluous scales, that hope
Might take new form, and spring forth from the rock.

As swift he wrought, he saw the ages move
From Calvary's hill to the last martyr slain,
And felt how hell's malignity 'gainst love
Had filled the centuries with unjust pain.
Yet light fell o'er his brow; for far and near
The Sun of Liberty had burst and shone.
His statue springing up with gleaming star
Would tell the history in its speaking stone.

High at our Eastern harbor, lo, it stands,
Bartholdi's statue, outlined in the bar,
Holding a torch mould in its outreached hands;
But where has fled its world-wide gleaming star?
Has Freedom's land no light? Why seems it dim?
Why gleams no more its glory from afar?
Ah, sentinel, up! 'tis time to fill and trim,
And light up Freedom's beacon at the bar.
