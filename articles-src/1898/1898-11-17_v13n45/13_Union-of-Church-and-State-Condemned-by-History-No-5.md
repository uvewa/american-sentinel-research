# Union of Church and State Condemned by History. — No. 5.

By B. W. Noel, M. A.

THE effects of the union have been so palpably and universally bad as to render positive evidence on the side of freedom unnecessary; still, as there are some persons to whom unknown possibilities of evil seem worse than any amount of existing evil, and who think that the union could not have been so general, unless there had been a real necessity for its existence, let us briefly notice the experience of some free churches.

The churches of the first three centuries were free. Unsalaried by the state, they could determine their creed, organize their discipline, and choose their pastors, according to their pleasure; each church, supporting its ministers, was entirely independent of external control. And in this state of poverty and freedom they so proclaimed the truth, and so recommended it by their lives, that their numbers and influence continued to increase, till the Emperor Constantine found it expedient, for the establishment of his throne, to profess himself a Christian.

During the ages of defection from truth and duty, which followed the union between the church and state, effected by that monarch, one community alone, which has preserved the appropriate motto, "Lux in tenebris," held forth the word of life to the population around it. In the valleys which lie between Mont Cenis and Mont Viso, in the southeastern declivities of the Cottian Alps, a few Christians, refusing to wear the yoke of the church of Rome, were also happily saved from union with the state. The churches formed by these peasants of the Alps were almost the only ones which, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, retained sound doctrine, simplicity of worship, and spiritual life. And to this day, notwithstanding the periods of declension to which every church, alas! is prone under every system, they remain the only evangelical churches in Italy.

While they were preserving the doctrine of the gospel in Italy, another free church rose on the eastern frontier of Saxony. At the close of the seventeenth century, when the Christians of Austrian Silesia were cruelly harassed by the church in union with the state, a few of the persecuted peasants sought refuge in Saxony, under the protection of Count Zinzendorf. June 17, 1722, they cut down the first tree in a forest on the road between Zittau and Lobau, where they raised the first wood house of the village of Herrnhut. Eighteen other immigrants soon joined them; and for ten years these emigrations for liberty of conscience continued till some hundreds of these poor and persecuted followers of Christ had built for themselves the village of Herrnhut. In 1731, when their numbers amounted to only six hundred, they were visited by Anthony, a negro, who described to them the melancholy state of his fellow-slaves in the West Indies. Moved by that recital, two of the brethren offered to go as missionaries to the island of St. Thomas; and the church having approved of their design, they left Herrnhut Aug. 21, 1732; and October 8, they embarked at Copenhagen for that island.

The zeal which was thus excited in the church continued to increase, and within ten years did those poor exiles send missionaries to St. Thomas, to St. Croix, to Greenland, to Surinam, to Berbice, to several Indian tribes in North America, to the negroes in South Carolina, to Lapland, to Tartary, to Algiers, to Guinea, to the Cape of Good Hope, and to Ceylon.

Great as are the services which have been rendered to the cause of the Redeemer by that simple and fervent community, they have in one respect, at least, been surpassed by the free Protestant churches of France. I do not reckon it as the higher glory of these churches that they could count upon their members Sully, Coligni, and Andelot, D'Aubigné, and Duplessis Mornay, a band of companions more distinguished for virtue and for valor than any equal number of contemporary soldiers and statesmen in any period of French history; I will not dwell on the piety and talent of their ministers, Du Moulin, Du Bosc, Morus, Daillé, Drelincourt, Claude, Jurieu, Saurin, Abbadie, etc., whose writings have enriched our Protestant literature; but I allude to their sufferings for the sake of Christ.

The following are some among the numerous edicts by which Louis XIV., the licentious slave of a Jesuit confessor and abandoned mistresses, sought, as the head of the union between church and state, to exterminate the Protestantism of his kingdom. In 1669 his subjects were forbidden to quit the kingdom, on pain of confiscation of goods, etc. In 1680 Protestant children of seven years old were allowed, on abjuring their religion against the wishes of their parents, to leave them, and to demand from them a legal maintenance. In 1683 the reformed worship was forbidden in all the episcopal cities of the empire, and all books against the Roman Catholic religion were likewise prohibited.

At length, October, 1685, appeared the Edict of Revocation, by which Protestant temples were demolished, Protestant worship was forbidden, Protestant ministers were banished the kingdom; no other Protestant might leave the kingdom on pain of condemnation to the galleys; the children of Protestants were to be brought up as Catholics; and the goods of those who did not conform within four months were confiscated. Next year was added a decree, addressed to the king's attorneys (procureurs royaux), to seize Protestant children above five years of age, and to place them under the care of Catholics.

May, 1686, the king decreed that every Protestant minister apprehended in France should be executed; those who assisted a minister should be sent to the galleys, or imprisoned for life; 5,500 livres were to be given to each informer; and all persons detected and taken in the act of assembling for Protestant worship were to suffer death. Multitudes of Protestants conformed to the established religion; many more contrived to leave the kingdom; and at length, the worn-out debauchee coined a medal to celebrate his triumph as head of church and state over "the extinct heresy." But the same year in which the edict of Nantes was thus savagely revoked, the churches of the desert began to assemble in the mountains of Languedoc.

The same month in which the temple at Charenton was demolished, the religious assemblies of the Cevenols met under the vaunt of heaven; and the same year in which Louis the debauchee expired, glorying in his abolition of the Protestant worship, did a noble peasant youth collect a few preachers in the caverns of the Cevennes, and there undertake, in the name of God, the revival of the crushed and bleeding churches of France.

Generally, their precautions enabled them to elude the vigilance of their oppressors; the place of meeting was announced to the brethren by faithful men, who visited them in their dwellings, and brave and prudent guides escorted the pastor to the spot by night along concealed paths. The brethren in the country communicated with the brethren in the towns. Every night, on these occasions, the pastor changed his lodging; and his brethren counted it an honor to welcome him at the risk of their own lives. When they were assembled, scouts on the neighboring heights warned them of the approach of the enemy, and thus often they escaped discovery. But if persecution raged too severely, the meetings were discontinued, and the churches seemed to have vanished, while every family, by reading of the Scriptures and by domestic worship, cherished its faith and piety for a happier day. Thus their constancy triumphed over the savage efforts of the church and state during half a century to destroy their property, their religion, and their existence.
