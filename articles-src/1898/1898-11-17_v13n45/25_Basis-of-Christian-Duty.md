It is not enough for clergymen to say, "Vote, and vote right." It is not enough for them to say, on their own authority and by their own wisdom, what vote is right. Christian duty rests on no such basis. Let them point out that duty resting on the basis of the plain words of Scripture; and if they cannot do this, let them cease to talk further of it as "Christian."
