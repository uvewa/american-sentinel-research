Of course, if voting be a Christian duty, the duty is to "vote right." But at this point we get into difficulty. What is the right vote? There are plenty of people ready to tell us, including clergymen; but, they do not all tell the same story. If we follow their instructions on the subject we shall be voting several different tickets; and not being allowed to vote more than one ticket, we can not be sure that we are casting this "right" vote. And when we appeal to the Scripture to settle this point of Christian duty, we find no instruction on the point at all. To say nothing of instructions as to how a Christian should vote, we cannot even find any declaration that he should vote at all.
