THE *Herald and Presbyter*, a well-known Presbyterian journal, says that "The fourth commandment enjoins industry and thoroughness. For six days we are to labor, and during this time we are to do all our work. Anything less than this is idleness and neglect. The man who falls short here does not keep this commandment."

This being so, how then can Presbyterians support Sunday laws, which would compel conscientious observers of the seventh day to rest two days in the week, unless they should abandon their conscientious convictions.

By their own statement of the case—if this journal represents Presbyterian belief—a Sunday law would compel an observer of the seventh day to break the fourth commandment. And by the Lord's statement of the case, the seventh day, and not the first, is the Sabbath, and is to be observed by all persons who would respect the moral law.
