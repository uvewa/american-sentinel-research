It is declared by both Catholics and Protestants in this country that "this is a Christian nation."

Now it is a fact that Catholics do not admit that Protestantism is Christianity. Even the stoutest defender of Catholic "liberality" must admit this.

When Catholics, therefore, say that "this is a Christian nation," they mean that it is a Catholic Christian nation. Whatever Protestants may mean by the expression, it is certain that this is the meaning, and the only meaning, it has for Catholics.

Roman Catholics and Protestants, therefore, are arrayed against each other in this claim for national recognition,—each one claiming to be the party which makes the nation Christian, and the Catholics at least, denying the position of the Protestants.

The Supreme Court decision raised this controversy, and now it "will not down." It is here and must be settled. That it is not very prominent as yet does not lessen the significance of the fact. It will grow more and more prominent as time goes on.

And what a bitter controversy must ensue before it is settled! More than this: what a change its settlement must effect in the principles of this Government! for it can be settled only in accordance with papal claims. The principle of both claims is papal.
