Public interest centers just now upon the news from the seat of war. People would like to know in advance what is going to happen during the continuance of the conflict; but this not being possible, they scan the "extras" and the bulletin boards to get the news of an event as soon after it has happened as the facilities of modern science can set it before them.

What events may transpire before the present war is concluded, no one can foretell. What other conflicts between the nations may be inaugurated, and what results may attend them, are matters hidden behind the veil which no human hand can draw aside. It might not be of any benefit to us if we could know them. But there is one thing we can know, and it is the thing we would naturally want to know most, and which it would be most to our benefit to know; that is, what is to be the final outcome. How does it all end,—all the war fervor and all the vast preparations made by all the powers for an expected conflict? We may know the answer to this question because the Word of God has set it plainly before us.

Turn to the 19th chapter of Revelation. There is given a description (v. 11 and onward) of One who comes forth from heaven upon a white horse, followed by the armies of heaven, down to the earth. The description leaves no room for doubt that the One who thus rides at the head of the armies of heaven is the Son of God. He goes forth to war, and "out of his mouth," says the Scripture, "goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations"; and all the fowls of the air are called to come and eat "the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great." And what of the nations at that time? What will be their attitude? The chapter says (v. 19):

"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him that sat on the horse, and against His army."

The prophet saw the "kings of the earth and their armies," gathered in battle array against the Son of God and his army. Whatever power we may believe to be represented by the "beast," there can be no uncertainty as regards "the kings of the earth and their armies." This is a plain reference to the powers of earth,—the great powers—the nations of Europe, and of America as well. These are found, with their armies, arrayed against the forces of heaven. It is a "holy war," but the holiness is not on the side of the powers of earth.

Of course there can be but one result. The prophet describes it:—

"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword of Him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth; and all the fowls were filled with their flesh."

This is the last war scene in earthly history; this is how it all ends. And there is no discount on this "news." No sensational rumor or "fake" of "yellow journalism" is this, but a strictly "official" announcement from headquarters. It is absolutely reliable. Now, we see all the world arming for war. We see the war spirit overtopping every other sentiment. We see everywhere the "kings of the earth" getting their armies in readiness to take the field. Nothing like it was ever witnessed in the earth before. Never such a general preparation, such a general sound of war, was known before in human history. It is the beginning of the end, and the prophetic description tells us what the end will be. The final gathering together of armies and navies will be to make war against the forces of heaven, in the great day of the second advent of the Son of God to the earth, in power and glory.

It is certain that no Christian will be found in the armies of the kings of the earth at that day. No Christian will be found fighting against God. Every Christian must, before that day comes, draw out from the military forces; he must renounce the spirit of war and fighting, notwithstanding what may be said by ministers of the gospel in its favor. And since he who is a Christian, or would be one, must do this sooner or later, or be found ere long on the side of opposition to the Commander of heaven, is it not obvious that the best time to take the step is just now? Since the Christian must separate himself from all this, as being contrary to God, the separation cannot be made too soon.

The Word of God throws more and surer light on this subject than can be derived from any other source of information.
