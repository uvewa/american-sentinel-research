An editorial in *The Outlook*, of May 14, presents some interesting ideas relative to the historical significance of the war with Spain. The writer points out that the present conflict is but the breaking out in acute form of a struggle that has been going on for centuries between Spanish and Anglo-Saxon civilization,—a conflict involving the destiny of the world,—the first great act in which was the attempt of Philip II. and his Spanish armada to overthrow Protestant England.

"The war now being waged," says the writer, "is the end of the campaign which began in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It is the last act in the great drama which stirred the world when little England faced the immense power of Spain on the high seas, and English pluck, skill, and audacity nobly dared and won, as did American pluck, skill, and audacity at Manila. Between Anglo-Saxon and Spanish civilization there is an irrepressible conflict. The differences are not merely in habit, dress, and taste; they are divergences of principle so fundamental that they cannot co-exist in the same quarter of the globe. The two civilizations are mutually antagonistic at every important point in civil, religious, and social ideas; wherever they meet they are compelled by their very nature to close in a death struggle.

"That struggle began when America was discovered, and it will be ended only when the last Spanish official leaves the shore of the New World. Martin Luther nailed his theses on the door of the church in Wittenberg in the same year in which Spanish troopers were exploring and conquering Central America. In the struggle for religious and civil freedom which the Reformation inaugurated, Spain stood for merciless and arbitrary suppression of freedom of faith, worship, action, and thought. The implacable bigotry of the Spanish priest has left an indelible image in the memory of Christendom. England and the Low Countries fought not for their own existence alone; they waged a war for humanity. All the dearest interests of the race were in their keeping; and nobly did they guard the spiritual and civic life of the future. The heroic figure of Drake stands out, despite his faults, like a minister of light against the relentless and saturnine genius of Philip II.

"In that struggle for the right to live, breathe, think, and worship, England and the Low Countries fought against great odds. Spain had the treasuries of the New World at her hand, and she set the New World against the Old. When she was driven out of the Netherlands in 1609, she had already taken from this continent hundreds of millions in gold and silver, and had spent the greater part of it in the futile endeavor to annihilate Protestantism, and with it civil and religious liberty. The great English sailors saw early that the only way to destroy the power of Spain was to destroy the sources of her revenue, and it is to the foresight as well as courage of such men as Drake that the English speaking peoples in all parts of the world to-day largely owe their freedom and their prosperity. The indomitable admiral 'singed the King of Spain's beard' on both sides of the continent, and his name became a terror in that far Pacific which had until his coming been like an inland sea of Spain.

"Out of that deadly conflict Spain emerged crippled and maimed. The Dutch had taken her Eastern possessions, and the English had secured the conditions necessary for English supremacy on the American continent. For the fate of America hung in the balance when the armada sailed; if Philip had crushed England, no English-speaking colony would have been planted in the Western World. 'The defeat of the invincible armada,' says Mr. Fiske, 'was the opening event in the history of the United States. It was the event which made all the rest possible.'"
