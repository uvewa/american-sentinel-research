"The powers that be are ordained of God." So saith the Scripture; and strangely enough, this text is used to justify obedience to the "powers that be" in opposition to the commands of God.

Can the thing ordained be superior to Him who ordained it? If not, as is self-evident, then cannot the command of men be superior to the precept of Jehovah. "His kingdom ruleth over all."
