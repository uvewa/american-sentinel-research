He who engages in war, must obey absolutely the commands of his military superiors. This is the first principle of military discipline.

Now there is a command of God which says, "Thou shalt not kill;" and another which says, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy." In time of war the soldier must disregard both these precepts at the order of his commander. He must kill men of the opposing force, and must do this, if so ordered, on the Sabbath day.

Is it not plainly evident, therefore, that the soldier must have another god than the Author of the Ten Commandments? Is it not evident that the Government stands to him in the place of God?

But what man can afford to make this exchange? God has not authorized it, and the eternal interests of every man forbid it; for what James Russell Lowell wrote of war is the truth,—

> "If you take a sword and dror it,
> And go stick a feier throu;
> Guv'ment aint to answer for it;
> God 'll send the bill to you."

Alas for him who expects government to answer for his misdeeds at the bar of God.
