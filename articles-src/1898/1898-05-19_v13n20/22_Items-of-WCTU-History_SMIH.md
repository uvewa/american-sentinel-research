I HAVE often tried to recall the mental processes out of which the events that followed that eventful interview were evolved, but they seem to have left not the faintest trace in memory. I only know that I was under the most intense pressure of earnest determination; that things altogether undreamed of before, developed day by day under my hands, as though by order of a Master mind, until we had before us the nucleus of an almost perfect system for preventive and educational methods, which has since in other hands ripened into the Loyal Temperance Legion of the world.

From the office of the lawyer referred to I went quickly to that of the agent who had the rental of "Brown's Hall," the largest auditorium in the city at that time, and where many of our mass meetings had been held.

"Is the hall engaged for Saturday afternoon," I asked, "or can I have it for a mass meeting of children, and how much will it cost?"

"It is not engaged," he replied, "and if you want it for a children's temperance meeting, you can have it and welcome."

I thanked him and hastened to the place where our daily meeting of women was held. I told the women what had transpired, and to what I had pledged them; and every woman of them saw the logic of the argument and accepted the conclusion to which I had come, and promised to "stand by" in this effort to get hold of the children, and make Saloon Destroyers out of them.

On Saturday afternoon (my readers will remember that that was all the day was to me then) we had the hall filled with children, who were fired with enthusiasm at the thought that they were at last to have a share in the great temperance movement. This was about the middle of April, 1875, and as a result of what was then begun and carried forward, in three weeks' time we presented to the public on the Court House Green a "Cold Water Army;"—three full companies of a hundred men each (the men between the ages of eight and sixteen), uniformed and equipped with wooden guns. The guns had painted on the barrel in white letters the legend

"Our guns are ballots,
Our bullets are ideas."

One of the manufacturers of the city who had three boys in the army had turned all his force of workmen into making the guns for us gratis; others had helped us to the uniforms, which consisted of white blouse waist and cap, with belt and bands in the national colors; and an old army drill master, who had been rescued from drink, undertook to teach and exercise the "soldiers" in the manual of arms. They had daily practice in one of the parks, followed by a study in temperance principles in an adjacent church, which the soldiers called "loading up." The Bible was our only resource as to the lessons, and it did not fail us, although our knowledge of the subject, and of how to teach it, was meager.

As I look back to that time and realize the ignorance and error out of which we were struggling, I can but wonder that God could use us at all; it was only because he knew we were *struggling out* that he could use us. I have felt during this narration that I am writing of the days when I was a heathen; and before I proceed farther I must leave recorded on the same page with the story of the guns, the fact that it did not take us long to find out that our leader was the *Prince of Peace*, and that anything like an instrument of war was not pleasing to him; so that the gun was replaced by a rattan, and the manual of arms by a simple code of physical exercise suitable for both boys and girls. But this was not yet; and I must give the history as it was, even if I reveal how obscure was the light which was as yet shining on my own path.

The day that our Cold Water Army took its first march and formed in hollow square on the Court House Green for the first time was a memorable one. Our progress had been noted in the city papers, and everybody knew about our movements. I think it is safe to say that this little army excited an interest as deep, as true and tender as any that had ever started out on its first parade. Thousands of people came from all the country about to witness the ceremony of "swearing in the troops" which was to take place on the Green. This was to consist in the public administration of the Triple Pledge which had been adopted by the army, and which as nearly as I can remember was as follows:—

"I do solemnly promise that I will forever abstain from the use of all alcoholic beverages, including wine, beer, and cider, and from all profane and impure expressions, and from tobacco in all its forms, God being my helper."

The army had met on the drill ground, had gone through a little exercise to freshen them up, and then had marched through the throngs that followed and with wet eyes watched their every movement; and at last stood in a perfect hollow square in the wide open Court House yard.

A dense mass of men, women, and children surrounded them and stretched off down every street; windows and roofs were filled with eager spectators. How beautiful, how brave, how pathetic is that scene as I look back on it through the years! Those little white-capped and jacketed men, with the soft blending of the red, white, and blue; the guns held at rest; the banners at the head of each company, and "Old Glory" dipping and swelling from the standard in the gentle May breeze; and about them loyally "standing by" those six hundred girls in white with national sashes, ready to "do or die," which to them meant to sing, smile, and be happy for the blessed temperance cause.

When at last the moment had come it was my office to step to the center of that hollow square and "administer the oath" as the men and newspapers called it. I lifted my right hand and every soldier standing with his gun at rest in his left hand raised his cap with his right, and repeated after me the solemn promise, which meant so much more than they or any of us had as yet dreamed.
