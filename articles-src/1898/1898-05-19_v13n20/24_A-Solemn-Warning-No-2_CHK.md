The worship of Jehovah could have nothing in common with idolatrous worship, and especially was this so of sun-worship.

When in Egypt the children of Israel had been brought into contact with this degrading worship. And when the Lord delivered his people from Egypt he purposed to separate them entirely from it.

Accordingly, wherever the Israelites encamped, God gave instruction that the tabernacle should be pitched so that the entrance should face the east. This would necessitate the people of God, in coming together to worship him, facing the west, and so turning their backs upon the sun. This would be a continual reminder to them that the two systems of worship could have nothing in common.

Notwithstanding all this, it can be plainly seen in the Bible that as often as the people apostatized from the Lord and turned their backs upon him, they turned to the worship of the sun.

Nor was this sun-worship confined to the nations prior to the coming of Christ. It was the prevailing religion long after his time. And we are told that it was the plan of some of the Roman emperors to unite all the religions, including the Christian religion, into one; the sun to be the central object of adoration. Thus we read of Elagabalus, the Roman emperor: "If we may believe the biographies on the Augustan history, a more ambitious scheme had dawned upon the mind of the emperor. The Jewish, the Samaritan, even the Christian, religions were to be fused and recast into one great system, of which the sun was to be the central object of adoration."—*Milman's History of Christianity*.

Later the ambition of this emperor was accomplished to the extent that even before the beginning of the fourth century Christianity had united itself to paganism in the worshiping of the sun.

This may appear strange to many who have been taught to look to the early "fathers" for example. But it is nevertheless true.

Even of Christianity of the second century, Mosheim, in his Church History says: "It is certain that to religious worship, both public and private, many rites were added without necessity, and to the great offense of sober and good men. This was because the Christians did not wish to appear inferior to the Greeks, the Romans, and the other people."

The simplicity of the worship that the Christians offered to the Deity was such that they were by the pagans pronounced Atheists. And to silence this accusation the Christian doctors thought they must introduce some external rites which would strike the sense of the people; so that they could maintain that they really had all those things of which Christians were charged with being destitute, though under different form. So that it is said, "A large part . . . of the Christian observances and institutions, even in this century had the aspect of the pagan mysteries."

What connection all this had with the prevailing sun-worship may be seen from the following: "Nearly all the people of the East, before the Christian era, were accustomed to worship with their faces directed towards the sunrising; for they all believed that God, whom they supposed to resemble light, or rather to be light, and whom they limited as to place, had his residence in that part of the heavens were the sun rises. When they became Christians, they rejected, indeed, the erroneous belief; but the custom which originated from it, and was very ancient and universally prevalent, they retained. Nor to this hour has it been wholly laid aside."

The above quotation from Mosheim will also show that the then prevailing Christianity had become so effeminate and weak, that when they left the grosser forms of paganism, on becoming Christians, they retained some practices that were "very ancient and universally prevalent."

The foregoing quotations pertain to the second century of the Christian era.

Of the third century, during the reign of Diocletian, Milman says: "From Christianity, the new paganism had adopted the unity of the Deity, and scrupled not to degrade all the gods of the older world into subordinate demons or ministers. . . . But the Jupiter Optimus Maximus was not the great supreme of the new system. The universal deity of the East, the sun, to the philosophic, was the emblem or representative; to the vulgar, the deity. Diocletian himself, though he paid so much deference to the older faith as to assume the title of Jovius, as belonging to the Lord of the world, yet, on his accession, when he would exculpate himself from all concern in the murder of his predecessor Numerian, appealed in the face of the army to the all-seeing deity of the sun. It is the oracle of Apollo of Miletus consulted by the hesitating emperor, which is to decide the fate of Christianity. The metaphorical language of Christianity had unconsciously lent strength to this new adversary; and in adoring the visible orb, some no doubt supposed that they were not departing far from the worship of the 'Sun of Righteousness.'"

This proves what has already been stated—that Christianity had united with paganism on sun worship.

With all this there came in the Sunday—"so called because the day was anciently dedicated to the sun, or to its worship" (Webster), "the wild solar holiday of all pagan times"—and finally displaced the Sabbath of the Bible—the seventh day.
