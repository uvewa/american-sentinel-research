A London journal reports these words from the Bishop of Marlborough, spoken recently in allusion to the martial aspect of affairs throughout the world. They are the words of one who distinguishes between Christianity and "patriotism":

"Look out upon the world from Klondyke to Rhodesia, and from the banks of the Niger to the Far East where the four Christian vultures, Russia, England, Germany, and France are gloating over the moribund Empire of China, claiming it not for Christ, the Master of the Nations, but passionately claiming it for commercial purposes. Mammon, Mammon, Mammon! Can your Christian consciences be satisfied with the aspect of things represented by those Christian vultures, not having claimed China for Christ, but for cotton or gold?"
