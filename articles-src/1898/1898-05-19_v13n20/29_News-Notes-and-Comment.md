The other day—Sunday—we listened to a discourse by one of the best known ministers of this city, based upon the text, "Be ye also ready." The words are a part of the solemn admonition of the Saviour to his followers with reference to the time of his return again to earth, to reward the just and bring doom to the wicked. For that most solemn event we are to be ready; we are to have our "loins girded about," and our "lights burn-fing," and to be waiting for the return of the "nobleman" from the "far country."

* * *

A discourse with this thought as its theme would have been most timely. It would have been spiritual meat to his congregation, upon whom, in common with so many others in the church as well as out of it, the great day of God is coming unawares; nigh at hand even now, and stealing on like the thief with muffled tread in the gloom of night. It would have set before them the matter of their highest possible concern.

But what did this preacher say? What were they told to be ready for? Oh, it was to be ready to invade Spain with an army of 500,000 men! They were to be ready to fight, so that they—or the nation—could enforce its demands in the face of the opposition of other powers.

* * *

We mention this as a sample of the way in which ministers who profess to speak the words of Christ are feeding with chaff the people who are perishing for want of bread. Words of Scripture have no force when separated from the theme to which they plainly relate.

The leading organ of the Methodist Church in this country—the Christian Advocate, of this city—in its issue of May 5, lays down the law for the people of the country regarding expressions of opinion upon the war. All who are opposed to the war, it says, must keep their views to themselves, or at the most indulge them only to their families and intimate friends. Anything more than this is denounced as savoring of treason.

It sounds a little strange for a religious journal to come out with a pronouncement upon such a matter, especially before the Government has thought it necessary to say anything on the subject; but it is only a natural result of the growth of the religio-political spirit which has become so marked a feature of the times. When the church goes into politics, she goes in to lead in that as she does in religious things, and in the natural course of events she soon assumes to lead the government itself. The extent of the prohibition which the Advocate assumes to lay upon the people may be seen from the following:—

"Nothing short of silence meets the conditions of patriotism. If one shall say, 'How can I be silent when I believe the war uncalled for, sinful, unjust?' the answer is, 'Let every soul be subject to the higher powers; the powers that be are ordained of God.' The subjects of this Government must obey it."

* * *

It is, then, declared by this leading organ of the Methodist Church in America, that it is the duty of every person, to obey the command of the civil power, in that which he believes to be unjust and SINFUL! A strange position, truly, to be taken by a journal which calls itself Christian!

And this only illustrates what becomes of the Christianity of the church which goes into politics.

* * *

We have said, and shall continue to say, that we regard war—all war that is fought with carnal weapons—as wrong. But mark, we do not say this from a political standpoint. We speak from the standpoint of Christianity. We do not say the Government should not go to war. We do not pretend to advise the Government, or any political body, as to what they should do and how they should do it, save only that they should keep the state separate from the church; and we say that on the authority of God's Word. We say it because it is a Christian principle.

* * *

Let civil governments, and all non-Christian bodies and individuals attend to political matters as they see fit. War is a political measure, and whether it is justifiable or not, as such, we do not pretend to say. Let the question be settled by the authorities in whose province such things belong. And let those whose opposition to war is political, be governed by the decision of those in political authority. We have nothing to say on that point. But we do say that war is not Christian. A great deal is being said by ministers and religious journals to the effect that the war with Spain is Christian; that it is a "holy war," etc. We say that it is not Christian, and that no person can engage in it and be a Christian while doing so. Christianity is not carnal warfare; its weapons are not carnal, but spiritual. This is plain Bible doctrine; and when the church denies it, and then says that those who hold it as such must not proclaim it, but must be enjoined therefrom by the civil power, it shows plainly enough that the church has become a political, and has ceased to be a Christian, organization. It may be that the Methodist Church would not endorse this utterance of its leading representative journal; we hope so. But these are times when things are being said and done which give occasion for the most serious thinking; that much is certain. And we hope that this thinking is being done by the observing, seriously-minded people of this nation.

NEWSPAPER report states that the plan is being considered of employing magnetic preachers to visit the camps of the soldiers engaged in the war and talk to the men for the purpose of counteracting the effect of the moral evils which naturally attend the life of a soldier in active service. Doubtless much good will be accomplished if the plan can be carried into effect. But the greatest difficulty of all, we think, will be that of convincing men that they ought to abstain from all evil ways, at the same time that they are taught that it is their duty to kill their fellow men. Somehow men who take their guns and shoot other men down in battle—men against whom they have no personal grievance at all—cannot feel over scrupulous with regard to deeds which injure their fellow-men to a less extent. There is a natural instinct against taking life which cannot be blunted without disastrous moral effect.

THE Madrid correspondent of the New York Evening Post. writes that the war is strongly supported by religious sentiment in Spain. "Patriotic demonstrations," he says, "are reported to have occurred everywhere. Special religious services of prayer, day and night, are being organized for the success of the Spanish arms." Doubtless they think in Spain even as strongly as people do here—perhaps even more so—that the war is a "holy war," and doubtless "patriotism" coincides as fully with "religious duty" there as here. It is customary in war for both sides to go to the conflict calling heaven to witness to the justice of their cause, and professing an implicit reliance upon the favoring assistance of the Omnipotent. Of course, at least one side of the controversy must be mistaken and suffer defeat; but mankind seems never able to learn the lesson taught by such an experience.

CHAPLAINS in the United States navy are regular officials of the Government, like any other persons who fill positions by virtue of governmental appointment. And to be eligible to such office, it is required by the Government that they "must be, upon appointment, ordained men, and in good standing in their respective communions." And yet there is an article of the Constitution of the United States which plainly says that "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." As religious fitness—real or supposed—is made the primary qualification in all such appointments, it is perfectly plain that every such appointment is a violation of the Constitution, the fundamental law of the land.

And this plain violation of the fundamental law is demanded by, and made in deference to, the papal principle that religion and the state should be united.
