"O PROFESSOR CARMAN!" began Milly Brown, "I have thought so much of the dreadful state of affairs you were telling us about in our last study! Please tell us if the poor, outraged peasants had things their own way very long."

"I see your sympathy goes with the poor serfs, Milly," answered her teacher, with a smile, "and I cannot blame you for feeling pity for them, for although they certainly did at this time some acts of great cruelty, their provocation was so great, that, looking back, as we now do, over a number of centuries, we are inclined more to pity than to censure them. But to answer your question more directly, No. Though at first the aristocracy seemed to be too dazed to fight back, they soon aroused from their stupor, and the vengeance which they wreaked upon the peasants was terrible."

"What did they do to them, teacher?" asked Jennie Jacobs.

"It is not always best, I think, Jennie, to describe too minutely such scenes of horror," said Professor Carman, "so we will let it suffice to say that they were hunted down like wild beasts, and it was not long before a deathlike quiet in their old homes told the story of their miserable fate more eloquently than words could do.

"King John, you will remember, was still in England; for his ransom money had not yet been paid. But after a deal of diplomacy, Edward finally allowed him to go home again if he would leave his second son, as assurance that it would be paid."

"It is something like Simeon's being left in Egypt as a pledge that his brother Benjamin should be brought to Joseph," said Julia March.

"Yes, only in this instance, unlike Simeon, Louis, the son left in England, managed to escape. He considered liberty more to be desired than the honor of keeping his word—which is quite doubtful, I am sure, even in time of war."

"What did King John do then, I wonder?" asked Charlie White, eagerly.

"He did a very strange and unexpected thing indeed. He voluntarily returned and delivered himself up to Edward again, which deed ought to have made the sneaking son quite ashamed of himself. I think John must have had a very high sense of honor, for he said that 'good faith ought to be found in the heart of kings if nowhere else.'"

"Did Edward receive him kindly?"

"Yes, with every demonstration of kindness, but John died shortly after his return to England as a royal prisoner, and the dauphin, or Charles the Wise, took his place, in 1364.

"That's right, Joseph; I am glad to see you making a note of this date. I hope none of you will forget your pencils and notebooks, and then at the close of these chats on French history, you will each have a little history of your own, which you yourselves have written.

"Charles did not have very good health, and he looked so thin and pale that people did not think he would amount to very much in the way of governing. Then besides his own natural ill health, he took a dose of poison which was treacherously given him by his own cousin. Yet still he lived, and as it turned out finally, he knew better how to govern France than his father had, and Edward III., who still lived, counted him as one of his most dangerous enemies. About this time, Charles sent his great general, Du Guesclin, to help conquer the king of Spain, Pedro the Cruel, who was finally driven from Spain, into Bordeaux, which the Black Prince of England had taken possession of."

"Was the Black Prince able to hold this conquered territory of France very long?" asked Will Palmeter.

"No; the people rebelled against his cruelty and unjust taxation; and as his health had failed, after a few years he went back home to England to die. Meantime, the brave Du Guesclin kept fighting to win back French territory which Edward and the Black Prince had taken away. But it was not destined that he should live to enjoy the fruits of his hard-earned victories, for a fever laid him low, and he died just as a place he was besieging was about to surrender; for the man who commanded the fortress having given an oath to surrender on a certain day if help did not arrive from England, kept his word by pulling down his flag, and solemnly marching out with his men, and laying his keys upon the breast of the dead warrior."

"Well, that's what I call honorable," said Joe Palmeter.

"It was indeed; and it is refreshing to learn of deeds like this occasionally, in those dark days, when it sometimes seemed that integrity and honor were perished.

"Now what practical lesson can we learn from the talk to-day?" asked the teacher.

"We ought to learn, for one thing," said Julia March, "that to tell the truth and be honest-hearted, is more noble than anything else, and that truth even in a prison is better than liberty—"

"Yes—even in a palace," echoed Joe Palmeter.

"I would be glad to have Charlie White make a note of everything he can learn concerning the duties of knights, how they were educated, etc., and bring it in and read to us what he has written at our next study," said the teacher, giving Charlie a kindly smile, as they marched from the class-room.
