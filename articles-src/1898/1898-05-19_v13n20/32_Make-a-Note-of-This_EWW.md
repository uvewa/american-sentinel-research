All advocates of Sunday sacredness; all zealous opposers of Sunday labor; all who believe and teach that God favors those who show special regard for Sunday, and frowns upon those who desecrate it; all who maintain that God will prosper this nation in proportion as it honors Sunday by enacting Sunday laws, closing all places of secular business, stopping all work in navy yards and other government works on that day; but that on the contrary he will not fight for them in their battles, nor prosper them otherwise unless they do thus exalt the man-made institution of Sunday as a holy rest day, should make careful note of the fact that the most important event and victory for the United States forces in the present conflict thus far, the destruction of the Spanish fleet at Manila, occurred May 1st, on a Sunday.

This circumstance would not appear so peculiarly noteworthy were it not for the universal exultation in the victory and praise for the man who led in it, equally by these zealous advocates of Sunday sacredness as by others, and without even a protest heard against such a battle being fought upon Sunday, so long as the victory was ours. Had the issues of the engagement been reversed we, no doubt, would have heard much from these people giving as a reason for the defeat the fact that the encounter was upon Sunday, and therefore the Lord could not prosper our forces. But the glory of conquest, the spirit of pride and boastfulness over an enemy, for the moment outshine and eclipse the sentiment of religious regard for the day, whose only sanctity, at best, is that with which man has attempted to invest it.

And what could more conclusively show that the glory and honor claimed for and bestowed upon the Sunday is but on a par and of the same character, in principle, with the glory and honor conferred upon the warrior and conqueror in human warfare, viz., the glory in and honor to men?

"Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that gloriethe glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord." Jer. 9: 23, 24. E. W. WHITNEY.
