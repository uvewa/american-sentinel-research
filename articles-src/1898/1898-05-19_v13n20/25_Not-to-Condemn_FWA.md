CHRIST came not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. Let us beware lest we play the Pharisee, and glibly condemn our fellow-creatures instead of trying to win them by mercy unto the Lord. We frail, feeble, faulty mortals have no right to condemn anyone. Our condemnations are such hypocritical performances. One man condemns his drunken brother in the harshest manner, when all the while he is as much the slave of avarice as his brother is of drink; when, perhaps, one of the strongest motives for his abstinence from liquor is a mercenary one; when perhaps he keeps from drink more for the sake of economy than from any higher motive.

One man glibly condemns his brother for telling lies because he himself has no temptation in that direction, and yet he himself is as close-fisted as a miser. Another condemns the foolish, youthful pursuit of pleasure and worldliness, when he himself is too old to have any temptation that way, while all the time he is as tricky as tricky can be in business transactions. Another condemns his gambling brother, when perhaps he would gamble himself if he could only be sure of winning, and not losing his much loved gold.

If we only look honestly into our hearts we find so much that is shaky, so much that is faulty, that we cannot consistently condemn our brethren. We can only rejoice with joy unspeakable that Christ does not condemn us if we are truly penitent.

> Who now shall accuse and arraign us?
> What man shall condemn and disown?
> Since Christ has said only the stainless
> Shall cast at his fellows a stone.
>
> For what man can bare us his bosom,
> And touch with his forefinger there,
> And say, "'Tis as snow, as a blossom"?
> Beware of the stainless, beware.
