EVENTS of recent occurrence in the city of Lewiston, Me., throw more light upon the nature of the exemption for seventh-day observers, which is usually contained in the state laws for the observance of Sunday. And very interesting to such people is the court decision from which this new light comes. The matter is reported in the Boston Globe, of May 8. Speaking of the closing of business places in Lewiston on Sunday the Globe says:—

"Two or three of these places are kept by Hebrews, who have closed their places regularly from sunset Friday night until sunset on Saturday, and have therefore claimed the right to keep open on Sunday, but most of them have been kept by people who, whether Hebrews or Christians, have made no pretense of closing on any day of the week.

"A test case of the former was brought this week in the municipal court. Herman I. Berman, a Hebrew, who has conscientiously closed his store every Friday night for the last five years, and kept it closed until sunset of Saturday, and then opened it all day Sunday, was brought before Judge Cornish, of the municipal court.

"He claimed that section 23 of chapter 124 of the revised statutes, which provides that 'no person conscientiously believing that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath, and actually refraining from secular business and labor on that day, is liable to the penalties for doing such business or labor on the first day of the week, if he does not disturb other persons,' applied to him and released him from the penalties provided for the transaction of business on Sunday.

"The court held, however, that the provisions of this section, while it permitted him to labor and transact business for himself, did not permit him to open his shop Sunday and solicit business from the general public, and fined him $10 and costs.

"Mr. Berman appealed to the Supreme Court. But it is understood that his counsel has since advised him to pay his fine and keep closed in the future, as the precedents are clearly against him, the question having been decided in precisely similar cases in Massachusetts in accordance with Judge Cornish's ruling."

In the light of this decision, it can be clearly seen that no exemption can be relied on to shield an individual from attack by those who, moved by the spirit of religious prejudice and intolerance, are determined to override it. Religious animosity always finds a way to reach its mark; and Christians need not expect that a different order of things will ever prevail in this world.
