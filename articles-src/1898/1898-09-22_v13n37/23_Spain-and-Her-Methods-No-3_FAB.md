The tribunals of the Incas were conducted in such a way that the judges and lawyers could not get rich over disputes. They were obliged, says the historian, to determine a suit in five days from the time it was brought before them. Yet there were provisions for the security of justice. A committee investigated the character of the magistrate at intervals, and any neglect of duty was punished in a most efficient manner. The lower courts making monthly returns to the higher ones, and these in like manner to the viceroys, the monarch could from these reports, look over and know his most distant people.

Laws were few but severe. They related to criminal matters. Theft, adultery, and murder were capital crimes. Blasphemy against the sun, and the Inca, was also punished with death. Removing landmarks or turning water away from a neighbor's land to one's own, burning a house,—all these were severely punished. To burn a bridge was death. The laws were simple and the application plain. With an honest judge cases were liable to be determined correctly. The inspection of a board of visitors, and the monthly returns of the tribunals afforded a strong guarantee of their integrity. Thus the evil of a long protracted suit was avoided, in which the man who wins is often financially ruined when he pays his lawyer's fees.

The property laws were the most remarkable of the Peruvian polity. Here the historian is very accurate. The territory was divided in three parts, one for the sun, another for the Inca, and the last for the people. The lands devoted to the sun furnished the support of the temple and costly ceremonies. Those given to the Inca supported the royal state and supplied the various needs of the government. The remainder was divided in equal shares amongst the people. The law made it necessary that every Peruvian should marry at a certain age, at which event the district in which he lived provided him with a house and a piece of land large enough for the support of himself and wife. An additional amount was granted for every child. This division was renewed every year and the possession of the tenant was increased or diminished according to the number in the family. The whole territory was cultivated by the people. The land belonging to the sun was first attended to; then the land of the old and sick, the widow and the orphan, and of the soldiers actually in service. The people cultivated their own ground each for himself, but under a general obligation to assist his neighbor if it seemed necessary.

Lastly they cultivated the land of the Inca. This was done with great ceremony by the whole people in a body. A similar arrangement was carried out in the manufactories and in the weaving of their fabrics. Occupation was found for all, from the child of five to the aged matron not too old to hold a distaff. Idleness was a crime severely punished.

The different parts of the country furnished those who were peculiarly suited to the different employments. One district supplied skillful miners, another workers in metals or wood. But no one was required to give more than a given portion of his time to public service. So no one was over-burdened, and each had time to provide for his own. A certain part of the agricultural products and of the manufactures were sent to Cuzco, for the Inca and his court; but far the greater part was stored in magazines, established throughout the provinces. Any deficiency in the contribution to the Inca was supplied from the granaries of the sun. A part of the royal stores was removed to a third class of magazines to supply the people in years of drouth or flood, to furnish relief for the sick, thus justifying the historian's testimony that a large share of the revenues of the Inca found its way back again into the hands of the people.

These storehouses were found by the Spaniards stored with maize, coca, quinia, woolen and cotton of the finest kinds, vases, and utensils of gold, silver, and copper,—in short, every article of luxury or use. No one could be rich, no one could be poor, in Peru; but all enjoyed a competence.

The most remarkable part of that great tract are the broken parts of the great roads which connected the most distant points with the great center. Over rocky Sierras, through leagues of heavy stone, suspension bridges, stairways scaling precipices hewn in the rock, ravines filled with solid masonry,—fifteen thousand miles of such a road as this existed. It was built of free stone covered with a cement harder than the stone itself. The art of making this cement is lost. Another kind of road on sandy land, was made beautiful by trees on either side, shading the traveler from the burning sun, and filling the air with rich perfume. By means of posts stationed five miles apart along these roads, dispatches were carried to and from all parts of the territory, at the rate of one hundred and fifty miles a day, by runners.

But these sun worshipers offered no alternative to those whom they conquered. They must bow to the sun or yield to war. But they tried gentle means of conversion first, trying to soften the hearts of the tribes around them by acts of kindness. They allowed time for their example to have an effect, and even tried the effect of negotiation, by making presents, by all subtle arts at their command. When these failed, then only they prepared for war. But in every stage of war, they were open to propositions of peace. Having conquered them, their next act was to introduce the worship of the sun.

Then a census was taken, a division of the land taken was also made according to the plans already stated. The conquered people were consulted as to preference of climate and occupation.

The historian has given us some idea of their system of education. Arithmetical computations were made, registries were kept, history and poetry had their place, geography was studied, as also astronomy; and they divided the years into twelve lunar months, and the months into weeks.

Architecture amongst them marked their high degree of civilization. This was superb. Some of their methods of work, perhaps, may now be classed among the lost arts.

Such were the people and the country which the Spaniards found,—a gentle race, and a people amongst whom true Christianity ought to have found deep root. It was in the year 1502 that Columbus first discovered the South American coast not far from the bay of Santa Marta. He heard of the wealth of the interior and spent a little time searching for the rich country. Reports reached Spain and new adventurers were sent out. In the year 1525 Santa Marta was taken by the Spaniards and a fort-built. Then came that greatest of wild adventurers, Pizarro. With nothing behind him but death and imprisonment, he could well afford to risk all rather than return to Spain unsuccessful. His first voyages along the coast were successful enough to give great hope to the crown of what he could yet do, and so once more he returned to conquer that happy people, in the name of Spain and the cross.

Having won the simple hearted people by gifts and kindness on his first voyage, they were totally unprepared for his treachery a few years later. He had explained to some of the natives he met on that first voyage that he represented a greater power than the Inca, and a religion better than theirs. This report together with a description of the fair men had reached the ears of the Inca, who made the prediction that the nation would ere many years be conquered by a strange people, and died believing this. Before dying he made the greatest mistake an Inca could have made. He broke for the first time the law of inheritance among the Incas, and divided the kingdom into two parts, one to the legitimate heir and the other to a favorite son by a favorite wife. The Inca himself could have a plurality of wives. Five years afterward, the two brothers were at war with one another, and the downfall of the Incas was insured.

Of all the hardships suffered by Pizarro and his followers, of the time employed in gaining court favor, his gifts of gold and silver and other products of South America, I must leave the reader to learn from the historian. It is my purpose only to show the methods of warfare pursued by these Christian(?) representatives of a Christian(?) religion, in conquering this peace loving, harmless people. From the historian I have drawn largely, in describing their happy, peace loving life, that the reader may realize more fully the comparison between that people and the present Indian population of the same countries.
