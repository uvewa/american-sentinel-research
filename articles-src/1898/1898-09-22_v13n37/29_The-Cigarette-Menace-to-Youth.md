"New York Journal."

Little Jacob Strauss, of Paterson, might share with other American boys a chance for that success in the world which hard work and good habits will win. Instead he lies in a hospital, broken in nervous and physical health, wrecked at fourteen years of age by the use of cigarettes.

The State guards minors in many ways. They may not mortgage their future by incurring debts. Designing men cannot take advantage of their youth and inexperience to lure them into contracts which may be harmful to them. Liquor cannot be sold to them lawfully. But the insidious and poisonous cigarette can be put in the hands of a child as often as a conscienceless man finds it to his profit to do it.

The State should guard the children against this evil. It should supplement the tender care of parents. It should make criminal the selling of cigarettes to minors, and enforce the law.
