## The Unfolding of Two Principles.—2.

### THE UNACCOUNTABLE ELEMENT.

For a time harmony prevailed throughout creation, all things proclaiming and exemplifying the character and government of love. But sin, the transgression of love's law, the discord in love's harmony, the foreign, unaccountable element, intruded itself into God's government, and brought in the jangle, the sorrow, the discord, the disorder, that now prevails to so large an extent on earth. This disorder, permitted to grow and disseminate, would hurl the whole creation into chaos, and if possible jeopardize the throne of eternal omnipotent Love.

### WHEN IT ORIGINATED.

Sin originated in one who filled up the sum of all created intelligences. Christ or the Word was the only begotten of the Father. But Lucifer was the highest of all created beings, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. Eze. 28:12. The very beginning of that first sin, originated in a doubt of the love of infinite Love, a doubt of the existence of that very character by which a sovereign of all things may exist and may reign: for only one who could deserve, and because of this, command the trust of all creatures, could exist as universal sovereign, as it is not in the nature of anything else but love to command trust by which all things may consist.

The first doubt of infinite Love questioned its existence, the next led to the deception that it dwelt in the heart of the doubter alone. The first doubt of infinite Love underrated God, miscomprehended him, and the second overestimated the source of doubt; for Lucifer, son of the morning, or light-bearer, turned to his own glory, given him of infinite Love, and because of the beauty he found, corrupted himself. The record says, "Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness." Eze. 28:17.

### WHERE IT LED.

Doubt of infinite Love perverted the mind of the great angel, until the very blessings of God, given him to proclaim and exemplify the character and government of love,—the highest possible mission—he turned to such a use as wrought his degradation. He sought by them to depose the God of love, and exalt himself to a placein the universe that could only be held by God. Had it been possible for Lucifer to have dethroned omnipotent Love, that moment of his success would have been the moment of universal overthrow and disaster, and he would have perished in the ruin he wrought. Yet so deceived was he that he said, "I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. . . . I will be like the Most High." Isa. 14:12, 13, 14.

## INWARD LIKENESS THE OBJECT AND DESIRE OF GOD.

Infinite Love desires that every creature shall be like the Most High. Had Lucifer truly desired to be like the Most High in his intrinsic nature, no rebellion would have marred the peace of heaven. To be like the Most High is to be love, and love turns the attention to others, forgetting self. It is the very nature of love to pour out blessing on others, blest in so doing. He who is like the Most High in deed and in truth is an almoner—a love-giver, a bestower of comfort, a fount of consolation; for the Most High is the "Father of mercies, the God of all comfort."

## GIVEN UP TO A VILE AFFECTION.

This, Lucifer had once known, but he chose that which led to self, which led to the conception of doubt of God's infinite meekness and kindness. When he knew infinite Love, he glorified him not as infinite Love, neither was thankful, but became vain in his imagination, and his foolish heart was darkened and given up to a vile affection. Rom. 1:21. This vile affection (the foundation of all others) was the love of self. Self-love originated in that first turning away from infinite Love. The next step was self-pity. Doubt of infinite Love brings this disposition in and charges God with injustice. When Peter tried to induce the Saviour to turn from Calvary by bidding him pity himself, Jesus said that which is intrinsically true, "Thou savorest not the things that be of God."

No self-pity can enter into the heart of infinite Love, nor into the heart of him who implicitly trusts in infinite Love. Pity of self led to a desire for the pity of others, and to the opening up of his supposed grievances, and many angels, though having no reason for so doing, followed the great angel's course, and were led to take the same steps as he had, until they were alienated in heart from God, and there was division in heaven.

## THE END KNOWN ONLY TO INFINITE LOVE.

Infinite Love forbade the extinction of these self-deceived creatures; for heaven wavered and waited, not knowing what malignity, cruelty, horror, and death, was wrapped up in the principle that had wrought already the first sorrow in the heart of the Omniscient. God alone knew the outcome. Cast out of heaven by their own self-wrought destiny, they bound themselves in chains of darkness. They were not hindered from assailing the hosts of the universe with their misconceptions; for full liberty of speech was theirs. The law of love, while forbidding the action as against themselves and the universe, in another sense did not forbid their liberty to try the hearts of all. To love, nothing is worthy save that which will stand the test. God could not but afford to wait. Clouds of doubt as it were, rolled through the fair creation, but those who looked for light had light, and stood loyal to God, reassured of his love, and sharers of his rest of spirit. Those who doubted were filled with unrest and bitterness.

Though the first working of the self-principle was manifested at first in persuasion rather than force, yet it used in that persuasion false reasoning and misstatements, and laid the foundation for that which afterward followed,—the use of force to coerce opinion and action. There was war in heaven, the beginning of all the long years of bloodshed and horror that have cursed the creation, proving that in the self-principle is wrapped up lust, war, cruelty, and death; and in infinite Love, the irresistible force that conquers through meekness and long-suffering.
