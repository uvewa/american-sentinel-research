The New York Times, in discussing the subject of "the Roman Church in our new possessions," says that that church "must be maintained in full efficiency in Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines." No view of the subject could be more short-sighted than this. Deliverance from papal domination and a knowledge of the gospel of salvation through faith is the one great object which Providence has had in view for these poor people through all the changes that have led up to their present state. God has had a hand in all these, and with him all things are secondary and made subservient to the proclamation of his truth. We are in the closing days of time, and the proclamation of the "gospel of the kingdom" is going to every tribe and people. It is going to the benighted dwellers in the far-off isles,—to the Philippines, and to every other quarter of heathendom; and nothing can stop it. All the wars, the revolutions, the changes of government which these tracts of earth have experienced hitherto, or will experience, are but side issues compared with that.
