## Studies in French History.—39.

"So ir would, Joseph," answered Professor Carman, "but you see the league was not so 'holy' in character as in name."

"I wonder what became of those poor little boys over in Madrid; were they there yet?" asked Milly Brown.

"O yes; and there they had to remain for four miserable years, until their father and King Charles had enough of war, and finally made peace through the mediation—not of the pope—but of Francis' mother, and Charles' aunt. This agreement went by the name of the 'Ladies' Peace," and lasted long enough for the little princes to be returned safe and sound, and for Francis to give up Italy entirely; on the other hand, the king of Spain was to give his sister in marriage to the French king."

"I suppose the poor lady's wishes did not count for anything—whether she was willing or not," said Julia March.

"O no; that was a small consideration. When two kings decided upon any such question, everything went as they wished. Though such shameless barter in human beings seems almost equal to the dark days in this land, before the Proclamation of Emancipation gave sweet freedom to the poor slaves.

"This peace, however, lasted only a few short years, for the fickle and ambitious Francis again sets out with an army to recover Milan—which it seems so hard for him to give up—regardless utterly of his treaty."

"Well, I imagine that this must have made King Charles furious, for he didn't have any too lamblike a temper, himself," said Joe Palmeter.

"O yes, he was very angry, and vowed he would make Francis repent it. So he enters France at once with his army, and devastation and famine follow in his steps."

"My sympathy is almost always with the French," said Max Smith, "though I know they scarcely deserved it, sometimes."

"The poor country people always deserve sympathy in times of war, for they are quite often the innocent victims of barbarous cruelties; and in this instance it was particularly true. They were not in the least to be blamed, because their king did not keep his word; but on his account their beautiful country is desolated, and the peaceful inhabitants are driven into the mountains to die of hunger. O, war is always a cruel, horrible thing; the misery and distress which it brings can never be overestimated."

"How long did this war last?" asked practical Jack.

"Not long. The pope, now, for a change in the program, undertook to fill the position of peacemaker between the two angry kings. He succeeded, and King Charles went to make his old enemy and new-made friend a visit."

"I am real glad of that," smiled Julia March, with a sigh of relief. "I presume that was a good thing for both countries,—for of course it meant peace. I'm glad the pope did that much good."

"The trouble is, Julia," replied their teacher, "there was anything but peace in the heart of one of them, at least, all the time. King Francis was treacherous and wicked enough to regret his own action in letting King Charles return home in peace. You see, there is no depending upon the human heart, unless ruled by God's Spirit. It is altogether bad. So it proved now. King Francis determined again to invade Italy at all hazards. He did a thing which it is hard to believe that any descendant of the good St. Louis could ever do,—he joined with the cruel Turks in making war with his own people."

"O, impossible! did they succeed?" asked Fred Green.

"They succeeded so well that a cruel pirate named Barbarossa, sailed back to Constantinople with 1,400 Christian slaves—Christian dogs—as they were called."

"I don't suppose that the word 'Christian' meant then quite what we understand it to mean to-day, did it, professor?" asked Joe Palmeter.

"O no; they were called Christian, because they were not Mahometans; but to us the word has or should have a deeper meaning.

"Francis was now getting along in years, and as if it were not disgraceful enough to join hands with the Turks, he disgraces himself still more by cruelly persecuting the poor Protestants. He was not one of those people who 'grow old gracefully,' for age seemed to make his disposition more sour and ill-tempered. If he had been a truly good man, this need not have been. But history gives a sad account of his excesses and dissipations, and at last he became so hard hearted that he cared no more for human life than for the life of a worm that crawled at his feet."

"O, I am afraid I shall not have any feelings of respect left for him," said Milly Brown, "but I will confess I did rather admire him at first."

"Milly always admires handsome people," smiled practical Jack; "so I suppose she could hardly help admiring the 'King of the Gentlemen.'"

"Well, we will not laugh at Milly, Jack, for really King Francis had some very good traits of character," said Professor Carman.

"Mention them, please, will you?" smiled Joe Palmeter. "I presume it will not take you long."

"Why, he was fond of art and education, and did all he could to encourage it. He did very much to beautify and enlarge many splendid palaces, and best of all, he founded the Royal College, where anyone who wished to be educated could study without any expense to themselves. This was certainly a good work, and people have given him the name of the 'Father of Letters and the Arts.'"
