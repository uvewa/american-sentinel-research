SUNDAY, the 11th, two newsboys were arrested in this city for shouting the name of a newspaper "extra," to attract the attention of prospective buyers. The magistrate before whom they were taken told them they had made themselves a nuisance; and fined them three dollars each.

But what makes the shouts of the newsboys a nuisance on Sunday when it is all right on other days of the week? Oh, it is religion,—that religion which holds Sunday as a sacred day, during which everybody ought to keep quiet. There is no other explanation that can be offered.

The civil government of the city of New York lent itself on that occasion to the maintenance of a religion. This is an undeniable fact.
