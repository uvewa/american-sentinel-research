# NEWS, NOTES, AND COMMENT

A correspondent calls our attention again to the subject of faith as a cure for disease. A few weeks since, we mentioned the case of a young girl sick with typhoid fever in one of the villages on Long Island, whose parents refused to call a physician because they believed it wrong to employ any other means than prayer for healing the sick. We said that the remedies employed by those having a knowledge of physiological laws, in combatting disease, were from the Lord, and should be recognized and employed as such. To this our correspondent takes exception.

This subject of "faith cure" is one that needs to be carefully considered. It is a subject that is coming more and more prominently before the people, and one upon which very many will be deceived. When there are so many people in the world who do not know what faith itself is, what else is to be expected but that many should hold wrong ideas on the subject of faith cure? How can a person know what faith cure is who does not know what faith is? And it is a fact that few people in this world today know what faith is. The word is almost universally confounded with belief. But while there are hundreds of religious beliefs in the world, there is, and can be, only one faith.

Faith is belief of the Word of God; it is that which says "Amen" to that Word. "Without faith," we read, "it is impossible to please him [God]; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." We do not see God, but faith assures us that he is, and that he is even where we do not see him. It is "the evidence of things not seen."

The Word of God says that God "is not far from every one of us;" and that "in him we live and move and have our being." It says that all power is of God, and that by his power all things consist, or hold together. All life is maintained by the power of God. Faith reveals all this, and he who has faith keeps all this in view. He sees God in all things, and feels that he is indeed not far from him. This is giving to God only the credit and glory that is his due.

And the faith that is in faith cure is this faith; for nothing else is faith. Faith recognizes the power of God in the healing of disease. But faith does not limit the working of the power of God. It does not refuse to recognize the power of God unless it is shown in some unusual way. Faith does not prescribe the manner in which God's power shall be manifested.

What is commonly known as "faith cure" discards physicians and all forms of treatment. It repudiates all "remedies" of every kind. And why? Oh, because it says that God ought to have the glory. And this is to say that there is no God in it unless the recovery from disease is by prayer and the laying on of hands. When a person recovers by taking treatment, God is not in that; that is something altogether different from a manifestation of the healing power of God,—so different, indeed, that to employ treatment is counted as an actual denial of the faith!

But how do these people think any individual can recover from sickness in any other way than by the healing power of God? Who heals an individual when he is sick? The doctor? No; every doctor entitled to his diploma knows better than that. Neither is there any power in the medicine, or the treatment, to effect a cure. People often suppose that there is some mysterious power in drugs or herbs or something else, to impart vitality and health to the human body; but the idea is sheer nonsense. No; neither the doctor, nor the treatment, nor the individual, does the healing. Perhaps the doctor himself would say, It is nature that does it. And this would recognize the truth that the system builds itself up, repairs the waste caused by disease, in accordance with certain established physical laws. All the doctor with his treatment can do is to provide conditions under which the operation of these laws can be effective. The power which does the work of recovery is in the human organism itself.

And what power is this? Men call it nature; but what is nature? Is there any other power than the power of God? The Scripture says there is not: "There is no power but of God." God created all things, and from whence did created things derive their power? Did they get it somewhere else than from the Creator? Reason repudiates the idea; reason and revelation together point to the Creator as the one and only source of power. Anything that existed by its own power, would be independent of God; but nothing is independent of him, for he is the Creator of all. And the power that men call "nature," the power that works in the human organism to rebuild it when impaired by disease, to recreate the wasted parts, in every case of recovery from sickness, whether of one who recognizes God or not, is the power of God. And faith recognizes this fact. "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth *all* thy diseases." Don't forget, when you recover from any illness, that it is a benefit of God, and that he is entitled to the praise.

* * *

Now what right have these people who repudiate all treatment of disease as being contrary to the faith—what right have any people, to prescribe to the Lord in what way he shall work to restore an individual to health? What right have they to say that he shall not work through the operation of "natural laws"? Certainly, to presume to dictate to God in anything is the very height of impropriety. The aim of prayer, for the recovery of the sick as for any other thing, should be the glory of God. But he himself must be the judge as to what manifestation will best glorify his name.

* * *

And since God is the healer of all disease, since God is in the recovery from sickness in an ordinary case as well as in the most extraordinary—for with God no such distinction exists—why should not any person be perfectly satisfied with it? When God is doing the work, working as he himself sees fit to work under the circumstances of the case, what more can anyone possibly ask?

* * *

Faith cure by prayer and the laying on of hands is Scriptural, certainly. Not a shadow of doubt would we try to cast upon that, nor in any way would we detract from its importance as a part of the gospel of God. We do not ask our "faith cure" friends to close their eyes to that truth, but only to open them wider and take in the truth that God is the one great and only healer of disease, to whom all the credit is due in every case. We ask them not to refuse to recognize God in the operation of "natural" laws for the recovery of health. We ask them only to see God in every place where he is; for this is to the glory of God, and the great spiritual advantage of every believer.

* * *

This subject of faith cure is one that concerns not alone the individual; it touches the interests of society and the state. The state concerns itself, as it is bound to do, with the protection of the lives of its citizens. It views wilful neglect to save life as a crime akin to taking life. And in faith cure, as commonly practiced, the state sees that there is wilful neglect, so far as any treatment of disease is concerned. It cannot judge of the efficacy of prayer to save the sick, while at the same time it feels bound to protect the life of the individual. It therefore feels bound, in case of death or the prospect of it, to hold those in charge of the stricken person responsible for the use of such remedies as have been found to be of value in combatting the disease. If all remedies are discarded and death ensues, it feels bound to regard the responsible parties as criminals. Of what Providence may interpose to do in any case it cannot know. It cannot in any case feel relieved of its own responsibility.

* * *

To ignore the state's position in this matter is not an act calculated to be productive of any good. We think, on the contrary, it is calculated to do harm to the very cause it is meant to serve. Incidents are continually occurring which illustrate this point. Some one sent us recently a copy of a "faith cure" journal, the *Gospel Trumpet*, published in Michigan, which mentioned the case of a woman in Marion, Ind., who was treated by "faith cure" for a disease attending child birth; stating that "three of the saints" were, after the woman's death, "unjustly cast into prison." Cases of this kind are not calculated to impress people with the idea that faith cure rests upon a divine foundation. The impression given is rather the opposite. The death of the young girl in the Long Island village, in the case we have mentioned, doubtless did much to give faith cure a backset in that vicinity. This was an injury to the truth; for faith cure is a doctrine of Scripture, and a truth which is designed to glorify God. But like other Scriptural truths, it has in the practice of some become perverted.

* * *

God's power is seen and known where man's power fails. Often at such times God manifests his power for the comfort of believers and the instruction of others. Recovery from some slight illness, or even in many cases from serious illness, does not testify to the world of the great Physician; for though accompanied with the offering of prayer, and professedly in answer to it, the world would say, O, that is a common thing; people don't always die when they are sick, even when they have no physician. But where human power is of no avail, the testimony to the power of God in the recovery is clear even to the world. If human power had done what it could to save life in the cases we have mentioned, the state could have found no fault, and no one would have been prejudiced against the truth. Many cases might be mentioned where the great Physician has given the healing touch to the victim of disease under such circumstances, by which He has proclaimed His name and His power among the people, by a testimony which none could gainsay.

* * *

All healing of disease is divine healing; it is the work of God. Faith recognizes it as such. God alone knows in what way to work in each case for the advancement of his truth. Civil government is instituted to preserve rights, "among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." It cannot be a judge of any religious question. It cannot lay aside its responsibility; it cannot, in the name of Christianity, be asked to do so. And to ignore the state in the pursuit of its appointed work is not in the interests of the true faith.
