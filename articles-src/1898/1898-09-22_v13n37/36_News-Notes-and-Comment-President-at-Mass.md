## New York, September 22, 1898.

The anarchist who assassinated the Austrian empress said that such deeds were necessary to call attention to the anarchist's unhappy lot. In this he defined anarchy as being the exact opposite of Christianity, since the true Christian is continually calling the attention of men to the happiness of his lot. Christians, of all people on the earth, are least open to the charge of being anarchists.

In what is said in this issue on the subject of "faith cure," we would not be understood as saying that prayer should always be the last resort for the restoration of the sick. What we do say is that the "faith cure" idea that no treatment should ever be used in any case of sickness, is wrong, and contrary to faith itself. The pathways of faith and fanaticism are sometimes not far apart.

Among the demands which will be made by the American peace commission upon Spain respecting the Philippines, it is said, is that of entire separation of church and state in that portion of the islands which it is proposed to leave under Spain's control. This would be asking Spain to maintain a colonial government radically different from the government at home, or to renounce the union of church and state to which she has strictly adhered for centuries. In any case it would be a demand at which Spain would stand aghast. The Spanish people must be brought to see and abhor the evil of such union before they can be expected to embody the principle in their government.

Mr. George Gould, millionaire, just returned from England, predicts for the country an era of great business prosperity. We hope he may prove a true prophet, but sometimes rich men see prosperity where there is nothing for the poor, and the increase of their wealth tends only to increase the poor man's stock of envy and discontent. But there is one way in which any and every person may secure prosperity, and that is by laying hold of the wonderful opportunities brought to him by Christianity. The cost at which those opportunities were secured for him, and the wisdom of Him by whom they were secured, is sufficient guaranty that they mean prosperity of the highest degree to him. They bring him riches—riches real and literal—and safer and more enduring than the gold in the Bank of England. There is prosperity for every man in this world, any time and all the time, if he is willing to accept it in Jesus Christ.

An unwonted spectacle was enjoyed by the official head of the Roman Catholic Church in this country, Cardinal Gibbons, on the 17th inst., in the city of Washington. It was that of the President and his cabinet in attendance at a mass conducted by the cardinal in St. Matthew's Catholic church. The Supreme Court was also represented in the person of Justice Harlan.

The mass was in commemoration of the murdered empress of Austria, and was under the auspices of the Austrian Minister to this Government. It was thus an official act of the Austrian government, but it was no less truly a religious ceremony of the Roman Church.

It is entirely proper, of course, for the President to express sympathy to the afflicted persons and the people upon whom this tragedy has cast its shadow. It is entirely proper for him and for any official of the Government to be present in official capacity at a ceremony for the purpose of showing proper courtesy to a foreign government. But it is not proper for him or any official, in official capacity, to do honor to an institution of the Catholic Church, or of any other church. On the contrary, it is highly improper.

The Austrian government represents a union of church and state. A mass performed by a Catholic prelate is deemed therefore by representatives of that government, a perfectly proper occasion for their presence in official capacity. But the President of the United States is the chief representative of a Government fundamentally opposed to union of church and state. For him to do honor to the principle of church and state union represented in the Austrian official mass performed by Cardinal Gibbons, was to dishonor the principle which is fundamental in his own government; and to honor it in his official capacity was to dishonor this American principle in the name of the American people.

The Sentinel emphatically dissents from any act done in honor of a foreign government, at the expense of the honor due the Government established upon the foundation of religious freedom. It is entirely too much to ask of this Government that it shall honor another government by dishonoring itself.

Rome sees all this with rejoicing and will know how to make use of it at the proper time.
