**Learn to Forgive.**

Learn now to forgive. Do not carry an unforgiving spirit with you through your life; it will hurt you more than anything else. It will destroy the happiness of many around you; yet its chief feeding ground will be found in your own heart.

You hate your neighbor. Yonder is his dwelling, one hundred and fifty yards away. Suppose you pass by a wood fire, and, as you pass, you pluck a half-consumed brand from it, flaming and gleaming, and thrusting it under your garment to hide it, you start for your neighbor's dwelling to burn it. Who gets the worst of it? You will find your garments on fire and yourself burned before you can harm your neighbor. So is he who carries an unforgiving spirit in his bosom. It stings the soul like an adder shut up there.

I know of some who call themselves Christians who are miserable because of their own revengefulness. Forgive your enemies and get down on your knees and pray for them, and salvation will come into your soul like a flood. "Father, forgive them." Sweet prayer and blessed example!—Selected.
