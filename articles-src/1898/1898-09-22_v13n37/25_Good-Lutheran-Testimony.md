A late issue of the *Lutheran Witness* contains the following as voicing the Lutheran sentiment in this country on the subject of the fad of patriotic(?) religious exercises in the public schools:—

"We heartily agree with Fr. M. in *Lehre und Wehre*, who, speaking of the unconstitutional religious exercises still perpetrated in our public schools, utters this Christian and patriotic warning: 'Would that we on our part, each in his respective environment, would not neglect to keep ourselves informed, whether all religious exercises are really barred out from the state school. The law is entirely on our side. Let no one act according to the principle: What is not my business, I shall not meddle with. No, here the maxim applies: 'Obsta principiis!' (Resist an evil in the beginning!) By the way, the *Lutheran Witness* is in position to show authentic evidence that the movement against the religious state school is not at all confined to the 'foreign element' in the Lutheran and Roman churches of this country. In one of our next issues we shall submit material on this matter, which will fully bear out this claim. Meanwhile, let us resist, earnestly and persistently, the encroachments of American church people upon the religious liberty of the country. For it is mostly our native born and bred American Christians who cause the present disturbance of the non-religious status of our public schools. Moreover, English Lutherans will find that this question of admitting religious exercises into the public school concerns them more vitally than their German or Scandinavian brethren."
