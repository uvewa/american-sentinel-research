It was the Lord of the Sabbath who said, "Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." It is He who gives this same invitation to every weary soul to-day.

The Sabbath was made for rest, and the Sabbath law commands rest; but He who made the Sabbath and gave the law, bids all men find rest by accepting his invitation, "Come unto me."

And by this He testifies that rest can be found by men in no other way. They cannot find rest except they come to Him. They cannot therefore find it through the compulsion of law or in the formal observance of the law.

The purpose of the Sabbath and the Sabbath law can be realized only in Christ. He who remains separated from Christ can find no benefit—no rest—in the Sabbath.

And as no Sunday law can bring any soul to Christ, it is certain that no Sunday law can in any way promote Sabbath observance.

Jesus Christ is "the end of the law for righteousness." There can be no observance of the law of righteousness outside of him.
