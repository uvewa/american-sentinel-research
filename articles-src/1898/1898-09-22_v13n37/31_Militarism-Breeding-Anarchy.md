# Militarism Breeding Anarchy.

The tragic death of the Austrian empress very forcibly calls attention to the menace which great standing armies offer toward the very persons and institutions they are supposed to be maintained to protect. It appears that the assassin who enacted the tragedy which has shocked all Europe and made more uneasy every head that wears a crown, was trained in the principles of anarchy by the hard experience which militarism imposes upon many thousands of citizens in every nation of Europe. A New York daily presents some important facts relating to this subject, as follows:—

"The coward who stabbed the old Austrian empress 'joined the anarchists after his discharge from the Italian army.'

"The attention of Americans is again called to the interesting fact that the great standing armies of Europe, maintained in the foolish hope of preserving monarchical systems of government, are really the most dangerous menace to such systems.

"In the Italian army, as in the German and other European armies, scores of thousands of young men are forced against their will to enlist every year. They are treated more like beasts than human beings. Their petty officers abuse them, curse them, and strike them. They are worked mercilessly, fed but little, paid two or three cents a day, and filled with hatred of official power and with hatred of the national uniform.

"In old days the peaceful peasant on his farm looked upon the king as a fighting leader, who hired soldiers for life to fight for the country and defend the farm. The peasant lived and died in sight of the house where he was born, and he never thought at all save thoughts such as come from the association with cows and pigs and other peasants of the same hamlet. He was content.

"The peasant to-day, when he reaches manhood, is dragged from home and forced to enlist. He is separated for three years from his young wife or sweetheart, treated like an animal, and often made one. He is taken to the big cities, associates with old men eager to fill his young mind with ideas of revolt. He is forced to see, feel, understand, and resent social and financial in equality.

"At home, in the village, he was as fortunate as those about him. He dug in the fields and walked long miles each day. His fellows did the same.

"But he goes to Berlin or to Paris, to be splashed by the mud of fine carriages and filled with envious longings for what he can never have.

"The abuse of officers completes the work."

That is the way it is under the system of militarism in Europe; and there can be no doubt that militarism would create essentially the same conditions here. Idleness, hard times, discontent, anarchy,—these are the fruits of militarism, in their logical order. And we have enough of them in the country as it is. Militarism is not a protection, but a menace, to the nation.
