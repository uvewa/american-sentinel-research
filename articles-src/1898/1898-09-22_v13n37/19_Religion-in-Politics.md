It is said that politics and religion ought to be united; and this, by individuals who profess total dissent from any union of church and state.

But can politics be separated from the state? and can religion be separated from the church? The Christian religion, certainly, is bound up in the Christian Church.

Since then politics cannot be separated from the state, nor religion from the church, how can politics and religion be united without making by that very act a union of church and state? And through what other means did church and state ever become united?

Justice alone does not represent Christianity; justice alone is not the aim of Christianity. To deal with the sinner as he justly deserves, is directly contrary to Christianity. And therefore any power instituted for the purpose of securing justice alone, cannot join with Christianity. Christianity does not call into use anything which aims at securing justice only. This is why Peter, when he drew the sword to resist the attack upon Jesus, was told to put it up again into its sheath.
