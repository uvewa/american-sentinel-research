From "Patria," New York organ of the Cuban Revolutionists.

When Philip II. began to reign, Spain was the most powerful nation in the world. So vast were her possessions in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, that "the sun never set on her dominions;" but with the beginning of the decadence, before his death and in the first years of the reign of his immediate successor, nearly all her possessions in North Africa, Burgundy, Naples, Sicily, and Milan were lost.

In modern times her losses have been as follows:—

- 1628, Malacca, Ceylon, Java.
- 1640, Portugal.
- 1648, Officially renounced her rights over Holland.
- 1649, A number of strong fortresses in the Netherlands.
- 1659, Roussillon and Sardinia.
- 1648–1713, Flanders.
- 1697, Island of Hayti, except Santo Domingo.
- 1704, Gibraltar.
- 1795, Santo Domingo.
- 1797, Trinidad.
- 1800, Louisiana.
- 1819, Florida.
- 1820–21, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, San Salvador, etc.
- 1898, Cuba, Porto Rico, Philippines, Marianas or Ladrane Islands.

What will remain for her to lose in the twentieth century? Perhaps the home country.
