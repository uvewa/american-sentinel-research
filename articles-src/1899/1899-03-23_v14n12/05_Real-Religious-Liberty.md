Some people are accustomed to sound the praises of religious liberty, who only seek religious liberty for themselves and would deny it to others not of their particular way of thinking. Such will probably oppose the movement now on foot to secure protection, not only to the Jew, but to the various church organizations who "keep Saturday" instead of Sunday as their holy day, against annoyances and petty persecutions, which would not be practicable were their convictions regarding the Sabbath fully respected, as they ought to be in a free country like ours.

Religious liberty is the right of every American citizen —the right of the "Sabbath keeper," the Moslem and the agnostic, as well as that of the propagandist of any ism in the lengthening list of denominational peculiarities. All may claim it, but no one religious body or any "combine" of such bodies are entitled in the least to monopolize it. Religious liberty means the right of the few as well as the right of the many.
