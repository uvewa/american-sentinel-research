Press dispatches announce that "Hanna's Syndicate" is plotting to rule Cuba. The plan is to lend the Cuban government about $20,000,000, taking in return bonds which are to be guaranteed by the United States. The syndicate will combine politics with finance, using all its influence to create sentiment in favor of annexation. It is believed by those interested in the scheme that a vote in favor of annexation can be secured with comparative ease under the pressure of political and financial power which the syndicate is able to wield.

The other day nine negroes who were in jail at Palmetto, Ga., were seized by a mob of several hundred whites, led out with ropes tied around them, and shot, four of them being killed on the spot. The crime with which they were charged was not murder, but arson. The governor of Georgia has offered a reward for the conviction of any of the participants in this outrage.

How reassuring this news would be to the black men in the Philippines, if they knew of it! They would be more than ever willing to be "benevolently assimilated" into the American Government.

The principle is now fixed in American policy that governments derive their just powers from the consent of some of the governed. This principle has been plainly stated and upheld in Congress, and upon it the Government is now proceeding in the Philippines. The question therefore arises, Who are the "some" whose consent is to be obtained in government? What law can separate them from the others? What fixed line can be drawn between them and the others? In North Carolina the legislature could not draw a line between negroes and white people on a basis of intelligence, or of wealth. Upon what basis can a line be drawn which will not put white people with the races sought to be excluded?

Obviously, the principle of deriving governmental power from the consent of "some" of the governed, applied in American politics, will separate not between races, but between classes; and the government will simply fall to the hands of those who have the power to take and hold it. The government will become an oligarchy, and from that the step is but a short one to a monarchy.

That phrase—"the consent of some of the governed"—contains the seeds of a tremendous and bitter conflict.

The "benevolent assimilation" of the Filipinos is justified by the Government's chief executive as follows:—

"Did we need their consent to perform a great act for humanity? We had it in every aspiration of their minds, in every hope of their hearts. We were obeying a higher moral obligation which rested upon us, and which did not require anybody's consent."

In other words: I am doing something to which you have decided objections; but in answer to these I tell you that in administering your affairs without your consent I am only acting according to every aspiration of your mind and every hope of your heart. I am the judge of what your hopes and aspirations are, and also of the proper means for them to be realized. If you think that your hopes and aspirations are not as I say, it is because you don't know as much about them as I do.

Would you not feel flattered by this explanation?

COUNT TOLSTOI, the Russian philanthropist and philosopher, says that the only way to attain general disarmament is for individuals to refuse to serve in the armies. He regards the czar's Peace Conference as absurd, and says he will remind it that as long as governments will continue to require territory, international conflicts will be inevitable. He will recommend, therefore, that first of all the various nations pledge themselves to call a halt on imperialism, and give all their colonial dependencies autonomy or independence.

There can be no real peace that is not the result of individual effort. Each individual can make peace for himself by refusing to fight; and only to the extent that this is done can peace prevail. So long as people are willing to fight, there will be war.
