A Sunday bill has been for some time pending in the legislature of Colorado. The provisions of this bill are:—

"SECTION 1. That the first day of the week, commonly known as Sunday, is hereby declared to be a legal holiday, and as such, a day for the rest, recreation, and amusement of the people.

"SEC. 2. All places of moral amusement may keep open on Sunday the same as any other day of the week; provided, that the provisions of this act shall not apply to saloons or other places where spiritous, vinous, or malt liquors are sold.

"SEC. 3. Any person or persons interfering with the privileges and rights of the people as conferred by this act shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in a sum of not less than fifty dollars ($50) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500), or may be imprisoned in the county jail for a period of not less than ten nor more than ninety days."

The present Sunday law of the State forbids any person to "disturb the peace and good order of society" on Sunday "by labor or amusement," "works of necessity and charity excepted." As this can only be construed as a general prohibition of labor and amusement on Sunday wherever there are people whom Sunday labor and amusement would "disturb," the proposed bill aims at a decided modification of the present law. It also aims to discourage arrests for Sunday breaking, as is evident from section 3.

The proposed measure has elicited numerous protests, and the prospects for its passage are not favorable.
