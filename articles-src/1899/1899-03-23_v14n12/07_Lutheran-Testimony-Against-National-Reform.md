THE Lutheran Witness, a prominent organ of the Lutheran Church in this country, has in its issue of February 21 some very pertinent observations on the subject of the proposed "Christian Amendment" to the Constitution, and the National Reform movement in general, from which we quote in part, as follows:

"The defenders of this movement quote passages from Psalms 2 and 110, then the words: 'All power is given unto me in heaven and earth,' and again: 'In the name of Jesus every knee shall bow,' together with others in which Christ is called the Lord over all, the Ruler of the Gentiles, or in which in any other manner dominion over the world is ascribed to Him. These passages treat in part of the divine majesty of Christ which was communicated to him according to his human nature, and in part, it should be noted, of his spiritual kingdom. Or did he say without a purpose: 'My kingdom is not of this world?' Is he, then, after all, to be made the guardian of the United States?

"That the endeavors of our deluded fellow citizens are utterly wrong, can plainly be seen from the fact that they desire to have the statement inserted, that the revealed will of God is to be acknowledged as the highest authority in civil affairs. This can only mean that the Bible is to be made the law of the land. That this is so, can be seen from the following questions and answers: 'Question: If this amendment were adopted, would not the Bible thus become the acknowledged Law of the Nation? Dr. McAllister, editor of the Christian Statesman, and defender of the amendment: Yes, that would be its effect. Question: Would not the Supreme Court then give its construction to the Bible as law? Dr. McA.: Yes, the Supreme Court would have to decide in that case, as it does now, what laws are in harmony with the Constitution. Question: If, then, the Supreme Court decides that the Bible Sabbath is Saturday and not Sunday, will not all citizens be compelled by law to keep Saturday instead of Sunday? Dr. McA.: In that case the seventh day would be legally recognized as the Sabbath as the first day now is (?); and if the nation itself observed and wished to maintain the first day Sabbath, they would make the Sabbath law based on the Bible so explicitly in favor of the first day, that the Supreme Court could not rule to the contrary.' (Hearing before the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, from Christian Statesman, 1896, p. 20.)

"Surely, this is enough to open our eyes. According to these statements, the Supreme Court is to interpret the Bible for us. At the same time two possibilities and probabilities are indicated, which fill us with horror. The Supreme Court may reach a wrong decision—it decides that Saturday is made binding upon us by Scripture. But now the nation quickly makes a law to interpret the Bible, and also interprets it wrongly by saying, No, Sunday is the 'Christian Sabbath.'"

"The Supreme Court of New York decided in 1811 and 1861 that Christianity is a part of the common law. A famous case also came before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1822. A certain Updegraph had declared that the Bible was a fable, that it contradicted itself and contained lies. He was punished as a blasphemer. The Supreme Court sustained this action, and said among other things: 'Christianity, general Christianity, is and always has been a part of the common law of Pennsylvania; not Christianity with an established church and titles and spiritual courts, but Christianity with liberty of conscience to all men.'

"Fortunately the declaration of the Supreme Court of the United States is not so emphatic. In the Girard will case we read the following: 'It is said, and truly, that the Christian religion is part of the common law of Pennsylvania. . . . It is so in this qualified sense, that its divine origin and truth are admitted, and therefore it is not to be maliciously and openly reviled and blasphemed against, to the annoyance of believers or injury of the public.' (3 Howard, p. 83.)

"It is disgusting to find such a lack of clearness in high places on such a weighty matter. Where else can the fault lie than in this, that it is not known what the Christian religion is? There are those who imagine the Christian religion to be a collection of precepts and regulations for the outward life, or at the highest, for charity. But this is not the nature of the Christian religion."

"A United States senator, who defended the amendment, was once asked as to who the Christ was, that is to be recognized. He expressed great surprise that he should be asked a question on which the churches were not agreed. He thought that this need not be determined at all, that nothing depended on the question whether Christ is true God. If we were to ask those who would make Christianity a part of the common law, and who demand the profession of the same in our Constitution, we should be certain to find many who are not ashamed to speak of a Christianity without Christ the true God-man. This movement may therefore be looked upon as one of the wiles of Satan to rob us of the gospel.

The State cannot be governed according to Christian principles. It can only be governed according to natural law and reason. This truth we must hold fast. Those who would force a Christian State upon us have a wrong conception of the doctrine of Christianity in general. To illustrate: Is there such a thing as a Christian shoemaker,—does a shoemaker who is a Christian, cut his leather and drive his pegs in a different manner or does he use a different kind of last from his neighbor who is an atheist? True, he has different motives and a different spirit in working, but he does not carry on shoemaking itself according to Christian principles. Likewise a Christian who is a lawgiver will have altogether different motives for his decisions from the unchristian, but the laws which he makes will not differ from those which even a heathen, endowed with the same natural wisdom and experience, would make under like circumstances.

"The cardinal principle of Christianity is this: that grace precedes justice. Now, if this is to be our civil law, we must let all criminals go free, just as God did with us when he raised Christ from the dead. But there are also those who busy themselves with the civil law and reject the view that Christianity is a part of the common law. The eminent jurist Cooley says: 'It is frequently said that Christianity is a part of the law of the land. In a certain sense and for certain purposes this is true. . . . But the law does not attempt to enforce the precepts of Christianity on the ground of their sacred character or divine origin. . . . Christianity is not a part of the law in any sense which entitles the courts to take notice of and base their judgments upon it, except so far as they can find that its precepts and principles have been incorporated in and made a component part of the positive law of the State.' (Constitutional Limitations, pp. 588 ff.) The Supreme Courts of California and Ohio have also declared that Christianity is no part of the common law.

"Although it was stated above that in New York two decisions had been given in favor of the movement, we also find there the opposite view. One judge has pointed out, and rightly so, that in case Christianity were law, which it would be if made part of the common law, every one who did not accept it would have to be punished, and that then a decision of the court would have to be given as to what Christianity is, a thing which was never done with the common law; so that the difficulty in making Christianity common law is not only great, but insurmountable. We heartily agree with what was said in the treaty with Tripoli in 1797, with the consent of at least two thirds of the senators: 'The government of the United States is in no sense founded on the Christian religion.'"
