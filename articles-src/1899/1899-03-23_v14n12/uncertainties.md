# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, March 23, 1899 (v14n12)

## General Notes

This issue was processed from Mistral OCR output. The following items were noted during splitting.

---

## Article 02 — "The Present Situation" (ATJ)

- **Page 3, quote from Whitelaw Reid:** The OCR reads "gov, ernment derives its just powers" — the comma and line break appear to be a hyphenation artifact from the original column break. Transcribed as "gov, ernment" exactly as OCR delivers it, which likely reflects "government" broken across a column. Confidence: LOW. The original likely reads "government derives its just powers."

---

## Article 04 — "The Church Will 'Get the State'"

- **Page 4, quoted speech:** The passage includes "coöperating" (with diaeresis) — preserved exactly as OCR renders it.

---

## Article 09 — "A Threatened Danger to Our Republic" (Warren Graham)

- **Author:** Warren Graham is not in the known authors list. The byline reads "BY WARREN GRAHAM" and appears clearly as a subheading beneath the article title. Treated as explicit attribution with initials "WG." This author may be a contributor rather than a staff writer.

---

## Article 10 — "Some Wise Sayings of Eminent Men" (John McCarthy)

- **Attribution:** The compiler is identified as "John McCarthy" in the subheading "*Compiled by John McCarthy.*" Treated as explicit attribution with initials "JMcC." Not in the known authors list; likely a one-time contributor.

---

## Article 17 — "The Truce of Christ"

- **Page 13, penultimate paragraph:** The OCR reads "Open ye the igates" — likely an OCR error for "Open ye the gates." Transcribed as OCR delivers it ("igates") per accuracy guidelines; flagged here.
  - **Confidence:** LOW — "igates" is almost certainly "gates" with a dropped letter or OCR artifact.

## Structural Notes

- The page 1 editorial aphorisms (short one-sentence observations) are treated as a single article "Editorial Paragraphs" (file 01), since they form an undivided column with no individual headings.
- The "News, Notes and Comment" section (page 9 onwards) was split between file 11 (main block) and file 18 (page 16 continuation), as there is a clear page/section break between them with intervening named articles.
- Two very short unnamed editorial notes between the Lutheran Testimony article and "No Reform Without Religion" were given their own files (07b) and between Colorado and Sunday Trains (12b), as required by project guidelines.
- "Facts Wanted," "A Card," subscription/pricing blocks, and all book advertisement pages (pages 14–15) were skipped as notices/advertisements.
- The "Notice" and "Back Numbers" items on page 16 were skipped as boilerplate/subscription information.
