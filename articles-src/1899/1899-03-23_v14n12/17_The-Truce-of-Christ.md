In the National Magazine for February are two remarkable articles, presenting two widely-differing theories, supposed to solve the perplexity of nations, and to point out in both cases a way to the "highest altruism" in world wide civilization, peace and brotherhood.

Thomas Jay Hudson, LL.D., treats of the Spanish-American war from the view point of evolution, showing (as he believes) that the war was of a humanitarian character, and was the logical outcome of the first war in matter, beginning with unicellular organism, too minute for the microscope.

He says: "With few exceptions, every species of animals obtains its food by preying upon other species, which are inferior in strength and sagacity. This warfare is carried on with relentless energy on land and ocean. It is the process of evolution. It is an agency by which each and every outward and upward step was made possible in the progressive development of animal life from the monera to man."

He writes further: "Everybody knows that the instinct of self-preservation, together with its concomitant, the instinct of reproduction, constitute the grand primary agency that renders organic evolution possible. But the fact is not so generally recognized that precisely the same agency, modified only by environment and development, is the prime factor in the evolution of all civilization worthy of the name."

The law of evolution, as viewed by this writer, justifies "the survival of the fittest," through superior skill and prowess of war. In fact the article is a justification of war, and of keeping all the spoils of war. He says: "To say that our Constitution deprives us of all power to acquire new domains, or to govern the inhabitants of conquered provinces, is to impugn the wisdom of our fathers and the intelligence of the American statesman. It is equivalent to a declaration that ours is the weakest nation on the earth, and that our danger is constant and imminent; for it is axiomatic that a nation without the means of adapting itself to the changes incident to evolutionary development, is without the means of its own conservation."

The justification of war on the processes of evolution, beginning in the first war in matter, justifies war in the results of the transgression of God's law; for war in nature (upon which hypothesis the argument is based), is a result of the curse of sin, and the logical outcome of sin is war certainly, and makes inevitable the survival of what men call "the fittest," and the destruction of the weak and inefficient. This principle certainly does away with the Declaration of Independence, equality, and the consent of the governed, and enthrones force, while deposing love. But the strangest part of the article is the conclusion that this mode of procedure (namely war, and the holding of spoils by force) will lead up to the purest altruism, and establish the brotherhood of man. While advocating and justifying war, this writer crys "peace and safety," and prophecies the swift coming of universal brotherhood.

The other article on "The Truce of Christ," by George C. Lorimer, represents Russia, France, and the United States as recipients of a visit from the Christ-child. The article opens with a description of St. Petersburg at Christmas time,—gay, glad, and gorgeous. The Tsar, just having read a book on the curse of militarism, looks from his window and declares, "God can never have destined these happy throngs to the ravages of war."

The Christ-child says to him, "Militiarism has usurped the throne, and though often disguised and lamely apologizing, sways a terrorizing sceptre over the councils of cabinets, the policies of princes, and the hopes of humanity; and nowhere find I a dwelling place." The Christ-child declares that the world is ready to receive him as a potentate, a conqueror, a priest, as anything denoting force; but not as a child whose mission is to war on war, and to exalt the banner of peace on earth.

The article next deals with France, and the people's hatred toward the Jews, and especially their derision and injustice to the Hebrew officer Dreyfus, who lies in jail for supposed unfaithfulness. The Christ child glides through the streets of Paris, and finally visits Dreyfus in his lonely cell, and in dreams the prisoner sees the vision, and hears the voice that bids him "hope."

Then the Christ-child visits America, proud of her late conquests, dreaming of world empire, and here and there listening to a language strange to Freedom's ear, of imperial power and military supremacy.

When men's strife is hushed in the Christmas peace, the Christ child's voice is heard, bidding America to extend Christ's empire through love. America's greatness is due to religion, liberty, enlightenment. So he bids her to free the islands of the sea, and evangelize, and educate. He rebukes the unchristianlike spirit to the poor and oppressed within her borders, and the voice dies away, it may be, the writer intimates, never to be heard again. But some heed and hear the voice, and a "peace pilgrimage" is organizing to plead for common humanity, to dethrone militarism, and to inaugurate "the parliament of men, the federation of the world;" and he holds out, as does the other writer, the hope of the millennium and world wide brotherhood.

While Mr. Hudson justifies war, and upholds militarism, and the reign of force, and declares that only in this way is the world to reach peace, Mr. Lorimer shows up the horrors of such a method, deprecates war, and calls for organization against militarism, in the name of the Christ child, the Prince of Peace. He also holds out to the world the hope of the long-sought peace through the disarmament of nations, and in a spiritual reign of the Prince of Peace.

But there is an old book that says, when they shall cry "peace and safety, sudden destruction cometh." The Prince of Peace is about to appear to gather those who love peace to his kingdom of peace. Those who love war will have war—even the battle of Armageddon. The talk of truce will not hinder the preparation for war, and when men fondly imagine that "the federation of the world" is accomplished, the roar of artillery will break in upon their dream. There will be "confused noise and garments rolled in blood."

There is in Mr. Lorimer's article one suggestion of most practical importance to every one: Who is hearing the voice of the Christ-child, and partaking of the spirit of the dove? The war spirit is consciously or unconsciously, taking possession of the hearts of men. Imperialism for the United States, with all its pomp and power and its following oppression, is developing of what spirit we are. Do we partake of ambition to rule, the love of power, the overriding of the rights of men?—then we hear not, or hearing, heed not, the voice of the Christ-child. The world is put to the test in these days, and we are in times that try men's souls. On which side do we stand—the side of force or love?

Two opposite kingdoms, ruled by two opposite principles, are calling for our allegiance. The kingdom of peace proves us its subjects if we stand for peace, for human rights, for the survival of every soul for whom the Prince of Peace died. The kingdom of force claims each one who cries for militarism, for imperialism, for the survival of the fittest only, and who ruthlessly casts aside the God-given rights of men.

The test will be brief. When men have taken their stand for peace or war, manifested of what kingdom they are, the heaven will roll away as a scroll, and in celestial pageant, the king of glory will appear. Those who have chosen the sword will perish by the sword; but to those who love peace will sound the invitation, "Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

Then will come the truce of Christ. The brotherhood of men will be manifested in the chosen race who make up that happy company for whom the angels will cry, "Open ye the igates, that the righteous nation that keepeth the truth may enter in."

Happy souls who 'mid earth's battles rest in Christ-like peace and love,
Where the war mad spirit rages, they but feel the gentle dove;
Angel arms will bear them kindly to their fatherland above
When God comes marching in.
