The Czar's famous call for a peace congress was published August 17 of last year. In connection with this, it is interesting and instructive to note the attitude of the Russian government towards the question, as indicated by the following events:—

Sept. 20.—Order for the reinforcement of the Russian naval squadron in the Caspian Sea.

Nov. 15.—Order for the building of two new cruisers, each of 12,764 tons.

Dec. 14.—Order for the building of ten new torpedo boats.

Dec. 20.—The Minister of the Navy asks for 250,000,000 roubles for vessels destined for the defense of St. Petersburg, the coasts of Finland, and Port Arthur. Orders also are issued to increase the Pacific squadron by four ironclads, six cruisers, and a torpedo flotilla.

Jan. 12.—The budgets of war and navy are respectively increased by 80,000,000 and 43,000,000 roubles.

Jan. 18.—Russian troops on the frontier of Afghanistan are increased by 20,000 men.

Jan. 19.—The Minister of the Navy proposes the building of a new cruiser of 6,250 tons and of two torpedo boats. He orders also the construction of three ironclads of 12,700 tons each, and of two cruisers of 6,000 and of 3,000 tons.

Of course, when Russia herself goes on increasing her armaments, other nations cannot be expected to take the peace manifesto any more seriously. It is only to be expected that they will follow suit, as they are nearly all doing to-day.

The question of Sunday rest for the workmen engaged on the buildings of the coming World's Fair in Paris, has been considered in the French Chamber of Deputies, where it was voted that the workmen should have one day of rest in each seven. The effort to fix Sunday as the day of rest, however was voted down.
