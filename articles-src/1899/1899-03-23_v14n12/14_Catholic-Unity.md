THAT all is not harmony in the Church of Rome, despite the apparent unity to which Rome is wont to point as evidence of her divine character, is a fact which often crops out upon the surface of events, and is evident just now in the controversy which has arisen over "Americanism." An article in *The Outlook*, by the Abbé Victor Charbonnel, throws much light on the conditions existing in the church of Rome from which that controversy arose. The Abbé recently left the papal church, where he had enjoyed the confidence of Cardinal Gibbons and other high prelates in this country. He is therefore prepared to speak with authority upon this matter.

In his article the Abbé says:—

"Personally, it would be easy for me to make known Cardinal Gibbons's private opinion as regards the excesses of ecclesiastical authoritativeness. I had an interview with him, three years ago, when he passed through Paris. The Congress of Religions was then being agitated. Our talk was very free and candid. He told me how difficult all initiative and courageous innovations became when one needed constant assurances from Rome, and had to seek supporters amid the most complex and inert administration of affairs that one can possibly find anywhere, and to move forward only by intrigue alone. Then, as if summing it all up, he suddenly exclaimed: 'The church is a bureau of administrators, and it ought to become a group of apostles again!'"

Another interesting paragraph is the following:—

"The Jesuits are not without powerful support. Cardinal Satolli, the former Apostolic Delegate to the United States, who had sharp controversies with the bishops there, has retained enough of the old feelings to write M. Charles Maignen a letter of singular importance. He declares that he will 'pray God' to 'stop that baneful plague [Americanism] whose contagion is spreading over both worlds.' What will Cardinal Gibbons and Monsignor Ireland think of it? They are being nicely treated by the Roman Cardinal."

Such is a picture drawn by Catholics themselves of the unity which exists within the Catholic fold. It is the "unity" of clashing intrigues, of reason and conscience suppressed by the voice of "infallible authority." Such unity is far worse than discord.

The same discord which is openly manifested in the divisions and sects of the Protestant world, exists within the church of Rome wherever reason and conscience are not bound.

No person can be benefited by a "unity" which means intellectual death, or the supremacy of error. Truth is always superior to mere harmony. Better truth with discord, than harmony with error.

Real Christian unity comes not by intellectual death, but by a higher intellectual life.
