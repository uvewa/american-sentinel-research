THE Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railway has decided to run Sunday trains. This decision represents an innovation upon the policy and practice of this road which has been in effect for more than thirty years. It is the result of a change in the presidency.

"While Samuel Sloan was president of the line," it is stated, "he always held that to work on Sunday was wrong, and no one in his employ ever had anything to do on that day."

The new president, W. H. Truesdale, stands for a different policy, and has given orders accordingly.

Many petitions, it is said, have been presented at times asking for the running of Sunday trains on this road, but all were "freezingly denied" by Mr. Sloan. "Once the commuters declared to Mr. Sloan that they wanted the trains so that they could go to and from the city churches on a Sunday; but this argument was exploded by the New Jersey Clergymen's Union, which showed that its members dispensed just as good gospel as could be had in the city."

Railroads should be run to meet, not the religious ideas of the man who may be president, but the wants of the traveling public. In this as in all other things, the rights of the people should prevail.
