"The case of Mr. Quay," says the Chicago Times-Herald, "is without precedent. He is a candidate for United States senator while under indictment for unlawful use of state funds deposited in the defunct People's Bank. In the meantime he secures delays on the plea that he is not ready for trial. Bills are introduced in the legislature to change the jury law for his benefit and are defeated. A legislative committee is appointed to investigate charges of bribery in his interest by leaders of the Quay machine. Finally when Mr. Quay's attorneys announce that he is ready for trial the district attorney asks for postponement—a request that is explainable only on the theory that the jury panel has been tampered with.

"It is time to drop Mr. Quay, 'as a duty to the commonwealth.'"

But hold! If Mr. Quay is dropped, who will succeed him as leader of the Sunday observance movement in the United States senate? Who can champion that cause as ably as he did in the summer of '93? This question should not be overlooked.
