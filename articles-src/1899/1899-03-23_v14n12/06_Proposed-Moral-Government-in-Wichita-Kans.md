Some time ago a member of the Kansas legislature introduced a bill providing that the decalogue be incorporated into the laws of that State. The bill failed to pass, and the people of Kansas were spared the experience of attempting to enforce moral obligations by the civil power. Now, however, if press reports be correct, an attempt is likely to be made in this line in the city of Wichita, in that State. It is the aim of the National Reform party and the great religious societies which have been inoculated with the "reform" doctrine, to make the "revealed will of God"—the Bible—acknowledged as "the highest authority in civil affairs;" and what is now proposed in Kansas represents as far as it goes, this doctrine carried into effect. Let us hope the inspection of the sample will deter the American people from ordering any of the goods.

The report is as follows:—

"Wichita, Kan., March 14.—James W. Tapp, leader of the Salvation Army here, has been nominated by the Democrats and Populists of Wichita as their candidate for Mayor. Tapp promises, if elected, to institute some unique reforms, among them being the following:—

"Girls appearing on the streets wearing bloomers will be find $5 for the first offence and ten days in jail for the second offence.

"All policemen will be required to carry Bibles, and any of the force heard swearing will be discharged without further notice.

"Divine services will be held twice daily in city buildings, and all municipal officers will be requested to attend. The Mayor will, upon these occasions, deliver lectures upon morality.

"Special tax will be provided to rent street cars for free transportation to churches on Sunday mornings.

"Spitting tobacco juice upon sidewalks will be an offence punishable by fines.

"Immoral and variety shows will not be allowed in town, and show posters of an objectionable nature will not be allowed on bill boards.

"Theatrical performances, baseball games or any other outdoor sport will not be tolerated on Sundays.

"Minor reforms are also named in the campaign. All public meetings in connection with his campaign are being opened by prayer and the Salvation Army furnishes music for the occasion.

"Mr. Trapp has a large mercantile establishment in this city, which, with the Salvation Army, divides his attention. He is wealthy and is putting all his money into the campaign.

"In an interview to day he said: 'Since I have entered the race for Mayor of Wichita many people have asked me to run on a platform of morality, and, as that is what I believe this town needs, I am going to make the race on the lines set forth. I do not intend to tolerate any of the existing evils if I get in office.

"The world is rapidly going to the devil and some one must take the initiative in reforming it. Things attempted by the Salvation Army have been ridiculed. In my position they will be honored and respected. I will make an opening wedge for them.

"My friends say they will stand by me in this fight for the betterment of the town, and if they do I will give them a sample of the best town on earth in a few months. I will make prohibition the real thing here and put an end to vulgarities.

"Wichita will be the leading town of the West if I am allowed to run the city government for a few years. People like to live where there is morality; and I am going to give it to them here.

"Tapp, being the candidate of two parties, stands a good chance of defeating the present Mayor, Finlay Ross, who is the Republican candidate."

Let us by all means have the Bible, but interpreted by the Holy Spirit—not by man—and enforced in the heart by divine grace, not upon the person by the police and the courts.
