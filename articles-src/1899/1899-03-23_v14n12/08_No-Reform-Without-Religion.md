Some very timely truths relative to modern ideas of reform were stated recently by Rev. Otis Hughson, of Lexington, Ky., in response to a request from the ministers' Union of that place to preach against the city's lawlessness. The clergyman declined to do so, saying that such a sermon "would of necessity smack strongly of politics, at least in the public mind," and he was "opposed to what might seem political in the pulpit." "When people," he said, "have assembled in a church for the purpose of being instructed in religion, and when standing before them in my prophetic office, I deem it a malfeasance of office to side-track their thoughts upon politics."

Speaking of the work of reform leagues and similar bodies, Mr. Hughson said that while they might accomplish something for the moment, yet "working alone the result will be short lived, and in a few months we return to the same condition. Lexow committees may aid in the work of reform, but their history in other cities has proven only their inability to accomplish any lasting good. Unveiling the sins of the city officials is right and should be done, but even that has accomplished almost nothing with us. Spasmodic vituperation from pulpit and platform will only injure both the pulpit and the platform. Local option, in itself a very noble movement, has failed in doing any permanent good, for often at the next election the place goes 'wet.' All these things may be used, but they must be used by men whose characters have been made in good homes and by those who have strong enough faith in God to keep them right.

"The home system throughout the cities of the United States is bad. All history proves that a homeless people will be a lawless people. I tremble for the city that feels the necessity of a curfew law. It takes the management of the children very largely from the hands of the parents and puts it into the hands of the police, and reduces the respect of the child for the parent. It teaches the child that home is not a peaceful, sweet resort, but a prison to which he must be taken by an officer of the law. Either one of two things ought to exist with regard to boys staying at home when they are not engaged in some useful work outside the home. Home should be a place so pleasant they would desire to be there, or parental authority should be so strong as that they would be compelled to stay there. When we are dependent upon boys that have been reared practically without a home or home training for the voters and officers of our city, we need not expect much improvement."

The more ministers of the gospel give their attention to reform work through the agency of reform leagues, policemen and the courts, the less will they be able to diffuse the spirit and influence of Christianity, without which there can be no reform that is real or lasting.
