*Compiled by John McCarthy.*

It is not the legitimate province of legislature to determine what religion is true, or what is false.—*United States Senate Report.*

Every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided that he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.—*Herbert Spencer.*

The chief object of all good governments should be the protection of all the natural rights of their constituent members.—*Alexander H. Stephens.*

That all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and at all times amenable to them.—*Virginia Declaration of Rights, 1776.*

The Protestant doctrine, touching the right of private judgment, is not that opposite doctrines may both be true; but it is that there is on the face of the earth, no visible body to whose decrees men are bound to submit their private judgment on points of faith.—*Lord Macaulay.*

Among all the religious persecutions with which almost every page of modern history is stained, no victim ever suffered but for the violation of what government denominated the law of God.—*United States Senate Report.*

Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. . . . All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequence.—*United States Senate Report.*

The experience of many ages proves that men may be ready to fight to death, and to persecute without pity, for a religion whose creed they do not understand, and whose precepts they habitually disobey.—*Lord Macaulay.*

What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights. They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights, of which government cannot deprive any portion of citizens, however small. Despotic power may invade those rights, but justice still confirms them.—*United States Senate Report.*

There are many who do not seem to be sensible that all violence in religion is irreligious, and that, whosoever is wrong, the persecutor cannot be right.—*Thomas Clarke.*

It is only when government transcends its sphere, that it comes in conflict with the consciences of men.—*President Fairchild.*

Those rights which God and nature have established, and are therefore called natural rights, such as life and liberty, need not the aid of human laws to be more effectually invested in every man than they are; neither do they receive any additional strength, when declared by the municipal laws to be inviolable.—*Blackstone.*

Toleration is a concession which may be withdrawn; it implies a preference for the ruling form of faith and worship, and a practical disapproval of all other forms. . . . In our country we ask no toleration for religion, and its free exercise, but we claim it as an inalienable right.—*Dr. Phillip Schaff.*

If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.—*John Stuart Mill.*

There ought to be room in this world for all the consciences in it, without any encroachment upon the rights of each other; and there would be if all men, in their relations to each other, would be content to exercise their own rights of conscience in a reasonable manner. This would leave every man to determine the religious question for himself.—*Samuel T. Spear.*

Our Constitution recognizes no other power than that of persuasion for enforcing religious observances.—*Chief Justice Terry.*

True Christianity asks no aid from the sword of civil authority. It began without the sword, and wherever it has taken the sword, it has perished by the sword. To depend on civil authority for its enforcement, is to acknowledge its own weakness, which it can never afford to do. It is able to fight its own battles. Its weapons are moral and spiritual, and not carnal. . . . True Christianity never shields itself behind majorities. . . . A form of religion that cannot live under equal and impartial laws ought to die, and sooner or later must die.—*Supreme Court of Ohio.*

Keep the church and state forever separate.—*General Grant.*

Government is never the gainer in the execution of a law that is manifestly unjust. . . . Conscientious men are not the enemies, but the friends, of any government but a tyranny. They are its strength, and not its weakness.—*President Fairchild.*
