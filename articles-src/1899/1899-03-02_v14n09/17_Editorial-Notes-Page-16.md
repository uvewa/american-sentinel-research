POLITICAL complications are arising in the Philippines, and Admiral Dewey has cabled the Washington authorities to send the battleship "Oregon" "for political reasons." This request is regarded as an intimation of interference from European powers.

The fighting at and around Manila has continued almost daily since the first outbreak, and the Government has determined to send additional troops and warships to reinforce the armament already there. All of which adds to the certainty that the United States has entered the Philippines to stay.

Some time ago Russia "leased" the Chinese port of Talien Wan, and very soon afterwards proceeded to collect taxes from the residents; and the Chinese resisting the attack, several hundred of the latter were killed. This is an illustration of the pressure being brought to bear upon China on the Russian side, and both Russia and her ally, France, want not only Chinese trade, but Chinese territory. Facts like these lend a strong emphasis to the statements of Lord Charles Beresford, British soldier and statesman—that China must soon go to pieces unless England and America step in to prevent it. The situation has been vigorously set before the American people by Lord Beresford during his tour in this country, and definite results in the shape of an Anglo-American alliance can hardly fail to follow. See p. 139.

We have much to say about the policy of "expansion" just now because there is much in it of significance in relation to the subject of free government and the recognition of human rights. In this policy as portrayed by current events there is strikingly illustrated the extent to which this country has drifted away from its foundation principles of government,—a condition which might have been guessed at, but the truth of which could not have been realized as it now is from existing facts. When we know that we have been drifting for a long time, it is very fortunate to arrive at some means of knowing just where we are.

The Press, of this city, has told why it is that the Government has taken and means to hold the Philippine Islands. It says:—

"We have taken the Philippines primarily to secure our position in the East. No one is optimistic enough to pretend that the islands themselves will ever make a return on the cost of their keep. But it has been frequently urged that we may more readily possess an increasing share of the Asiatic market by reason of our military and naval establishment at or near its doors. Well, the Asiatic market is to a great extent the Chinese market. We need no such show of empire to increase our trade with Japan. But if the Chinese Empire falls, what Asiatic market will there be? None, in the sense in which the term has been employed. The Chinese market will be the Russian, German, French, and, in case Great Britain is driven to a change in her 'open-door' policy, the English market.' . . . To permit this state of affairs to come about, when we have acquired the Philippines for no other known purpose of rational self-interest except to prevent it, would be the height of absurdity."

There is little in this about "benevolent assimilation," or the duty of bestowing liberty, etc., upon downtrodden humanity; but a reason is given that is in harmony with the spirit of the times—the spirit of modern enterprise that says "There's money in it." This spirit is accustomed nowadays to disguise itself under a cloak of philanthropy.

A CORRESPONDENT in the West finds fault with us for laying so much stress just now upon the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, and informs us that the SENTINEL has "lost its charm" for him. We are sorry for the paper, of course, and still more sorry for him. Nevertheless, we can't apologize for laying stress—even great stress—upon these great charters of human liberty. With all the stress that we can possibly lay upon them, there is little enough—and far too little—importance given to them in this country to-day. And we never knew anybody to minimize the principle of government by consent of the governed, who was willing at the same time to take a humble position himself.

If the United States and Great Britain were Christian nations, there would be no need of the great effort now put forth to have them stand together.
