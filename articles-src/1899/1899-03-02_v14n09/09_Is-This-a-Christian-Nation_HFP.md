### H F. Phelps.

It is a principle of the Word of God, which is the text-book of the Christian religion, that to every man is given, as one of his inalienable rights, the right of the exercise of the individual conscience in all matters of religion; and that he is responsible alone at the bar of God upon all questions of religion. This is a Christian principle. If to deny this principle of Christianity, as is now being done in some of the States by dragging men and women before the courts of Caesar, to answer at the bar of the State, because they seek to understand the word of God and conform their lives thereto, in the observance of the fourth commandment—if this is Christian, then, without doubt, this nation is in a fair way to become a Christian nation.

If to seek a combination of the religious element in the nation for the purpose of securing the influence to Caesar by legislative enactment for the furtherance of the interests of the church, and the enforcement of her institutions, is Christian—if this is Christlike—then beyond question this is a Christian nation.

If it is according to Christian principles for ministers to enter the arena of politics and preach politics instead of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as is now being done in all the States of the Union; then, again, this is a Christian nation. But the Author of Christianity gave the plainest instructions to his church and to the ministry that they should have nothing in common with Caesar.

One of the plainest principles of the Reformation, and the foundation principle of Protestantism itself, was the denial of the right of the intrusion of the magistrate in matters of conscience. But by the masses of so-called Protestants this principle is forgotten and ignored today. If to forget a principle of the Christian religion, and to override and ignore it, is Christian, and if it is according to the principles of Christianity for this Government to repudiate that which stamps it as a Protestant and Republican Government, as this nation is now doing, then indeed may we admit that this is a Christian nation.

But to do all or any of these things is not Christian in any sense of the word.
