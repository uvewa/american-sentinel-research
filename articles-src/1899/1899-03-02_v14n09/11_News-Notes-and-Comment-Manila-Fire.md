A considerable portion of the city of Manila having been burned by the Filipinos, who are fighting the United States forces now occupying the city, the question has arisen whether the United States is not responsible for the loss of property caused by it to the residents, among whom are subjects of European and other governments. The settlement of this question will call for the exercise of diplomacy, and must at least be viewed as a token of the complications in which this Government as an occupant of the Philippines will be involved.
