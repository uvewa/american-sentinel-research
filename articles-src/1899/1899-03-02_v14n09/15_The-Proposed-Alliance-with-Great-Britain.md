Lord Charles Beresford, Rear Admiral in the British navy, is in this country as the representative of the British government, in the interests of a commercial alliance between Great Britain and the United States. The purpose of this proposed alliance is of course the protection of Anglo Saxon "interests" in China. So far as those interests are concerned, the alliance will be an offensive and defensive one, and under it the United States will be expected to "back up Great Britain's policy in the far East."

The reception accorded Lord Beresford in this country at all points from San Francisco—the point of his arrival—to New York City, has been very enthusiastic, and is understood to indicate the sentiment of representative and influential American people towards the project which has brought the distinguished Briton to these shores. In a number of speeches made along the way, the latter has outlined quite fully the leading features of the situation under which the proposed alliance is deemed necessary, and it will be instructive to quote some of his statements upon this point. In the opinion of Lord Beresford, it is, says the Chicago Times-Herald, "imperatively necessary that the powers act and act at once" to prevent the segregation of China and guarantee its integrity, for the "good of the world in general and of the commercial world in particular." Of the prospects for the realization of an Anglo-American alliance, he says:—

"I base my opinion of the success of this venture not only on the enthusiasm displayed by the American commercial bodies since my arrival at San Francisco last week, but on the letters and telegrams I have received from prominent business men throughout the United States in favor of the proposition. Even while in China studying this subject I was in receipt of letters from prominent Americans in all parts of the country. I have preserved all the letters and telegrams, which I shall display to the English commercial bodies as an evidence of the good faith of the Americans and their united interest in the project.

"Then, too, I am now gathering whenever possible, memorials, resolutions, and other forms of the expressions of the commercial bodies of this country in relation to the subject. For instance, in San Francisco I received most extraordinary encouragement and carry as souvenirs of the occasion numerous letters of commendation of the great plans I am contributing to. Many of these letters are from commercial men of the Pacific coast, and in addition I have a memorial from the Chamber of Commerce of that city which pledges its unqualified support of the plans I am working on.

"Of course I will exhibit all these testimonials in England, but the more practical advantage will be the influence these gentlemen in America will contribute toward the forming of a wave of public sentiment that will have some practical effect in urging the importance of the situation on the national congress of the United States.

"I can say that in San Francisco I did not meet a single individual who was not enthusiastically in favor of the great enterprise. Of course the Pacific coast expects to benefit very largely from the development of the trade in the far East, where the United States is concerned. This would really give the people of San Francisco a selfish interest in the success of the idea. But aside from that I believe many men favor the project through unselfish motives, because they see in it the only solution of the Chinese question, which, it not settled very shortly along these lines, must inevitably result in the partition of that empire among the great nations of the world, a consequent restriction of trade, and perhaps be the direct means of contributing to a world's war, in which life and treasure will be squandered in such volume as was never conceived of before.

Of his plans for pushing the projected alliance in this country he said:—

"I shall ask that the commercial bodies of that city [Chicago] adopt resolutions favoring the plan, pledging their support and active cooperation toward that end, and the urging upon the Congress of the United States of the importance of official action. In addition I shall secure, if possible, individual letters from the merchants of that city, especially from those of world-wide business reputation, showing their personal interest in the proposition and their determination to do what they can for the success of the alliance. These letters and commercial club resolutions I shall exhibit in England as the evidence of the unqualified support the American people are giving the question of alliance for commercial purposes in the Orient.

"In New York, which I will visit after leaving Chicago, I desire to secure about the same thing. I will also go to Washington, and probably get some testimonials, if possible, from men of public prominence there. I am quite anxious to visit other cities of the country before I return to England, but am not yet sure I can do so."

Lord Beresford has in view a formal alliance, rather than an informal one. On this point he says:—

"This is a question, no doubt that will bear the most careful discussion. My study of the proposition in the Orient and in other sections of the world leads me to the conclusion that a formal alliance is the proper manner in which the subject should be handled.

"Of course, community of interests is the mainspring of all national alliances, whether they are formal alliances or merely friendly arrangements for a given purpose. The subject matter for a community of action between America, England, Germany, and Japan certainly exists. If a formal alliance is entered into between these nations the object of the same can be fully set forth and there can be no room for a misunderstanding between the powers acting in concert nor those not in the alliance. The formal alliance will be notice to the civilized world of the determination of these strong nations to act in behalf of China, and I conceive that the best result can be obtained from a formal alliance."

But formal or informal, the alliance must, in his view, be concluded speedily. "Still I am satisfied," he says, "that an informal alliance with the same objects in view is preferable to the present situation. The present arrangement in China cannot long endure, in my estimation, without embroiling the powers in a war, the termination and scope of which no man can foresee.

"In fact, the status quo is not being maintained today. Russia on the one side is encroaching and extending its armies beyond its recognized sphere of influence. So are the French, and perhaps the English. Of course each nation is straining every nerve to secure its full share of the trade of this great empire of the Orient.

"Some of the nations—notably France and Russia—are not satisfied with trade. They want territory. Today England stands out as the grand exponent of unrestricted trade throughout the empire. The open door is our hobby. Trade, not territory, in China, is what the English people to-day want."

"I have been in the Orient many months as the representative of the English commercial bodies, investigating the situation and with a view to determining just what action may be taken, not only to preserve the open door but to increase British trade in that section. My close attention to this subject convinces me that the time for action has arrived.

"To delay longer is dangerous to the peace of the world. I consider the proposed alliance conducive to the world's peace. These nations can guarantee it, and really I do not think France and Russia would object very seriously to such an arrangement, as soon as they are assured of fair treatment and the maintenance of the status quo.

"To day China is helpless. Any nation of consequence can seize this or that territory, with nothing more to fear than a mild form of protest. Russian encroachments are worthy of close attention. She is pouring soldiers into north China and menacing the peace of the world thereby. At present she has an army of well-armed soldiers numbering something like 20,000 in the province of Manchuria, and the completion of the Siberian railroad gives Russia the means of placing an army of big size in that section on short notice. Therefore Russia is a factor that must be considered at an early date."

Of the present position of America in the Orient, and the opportunities and duties arising from it, as viewed from a commercial standpoint, Lord Beresford said:—

"America has some trade in that section of the world, and of course the prominence the late war has given the American Republic necessarily makes it one of the powers in that remote section of the world. Her trade to day is small in China, and unless something is done shortly to protect it there will be none left. The interests of the republic in the Philippines make it imperative that the American people take some interest in the Chinese question."

"I want to impress one thing especially upon the minds of the Americans. And that is the vast prestige the great American Republic has secured in the Orient through the magnificent work of its army and navy against Spain. The battle of Manila Bay did more to impress upon the higher classes of Chinese the efficiency of modern methods in war over methods used by effete nations than anything that could have occurred. Then, too, it gave the average Chinamen respect for the stars and stripes that they could have secured in no other way. Dewey's work was an object lesson not only to the Chinese but to the Orient. It placed the stars and stripes in the front rank.

"Americans, of course, appreciate the efficient work of their bold and gallant admiral, but in the east the naval victory at Manila and the celerity with which the administration rushed vast bodies of troops half way around the world to support its navy had the effect of impressing upon many nations of the Orient the boundless power of the great republic, the strength of the great nation on the other side of the world, which at a single bound has placed itself in the front rank of the powers of the world."

From all this it must be evident to the candid mind that the proposed alliance with Great Britain is not by any means a chimerical project; that the spectacle of the military forces of this country joined with those of Great Britain against the power of Russia and France—and other nations of Europe, it may be—cannot be considered an impossibility of the near future; that the spectacle of the United States "backing up British policy in the far East," at a tremendous cost of American blood and treasure, is one which can be pictured almost without the aid of imagination. These things are full of meaning. They mean much more than Lord Beresford has put into words; they mean more than the advocates of an Anglo-Saxon alliance can now foresee. There is an intensely serious side to this program, which only the developments of the future can fully reveal.
