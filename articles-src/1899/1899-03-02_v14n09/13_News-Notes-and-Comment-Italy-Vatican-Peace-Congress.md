The antagonism between the Italian government and the Vatican has again come to the surface in connection with the czar's coming peace congress. The Italian government has sent the czar an unqualified refusal to be represented in the conference in case there is a representative of the Vatican. This statement comes in reply to an effort by Russia and Holland to effect a compromise which would permit both Italy and the Vatican to participate in the congress.

It is important, of course, that Italy should participate in the deliberations of this gathering. Italy stands among the leading military powers of Europe, and if not bound by the decisions of the congress—as would follow if she were not a party to the agreement reached—the whole plan for disarmament would be left upon a very unstable basis. All the powers that are able materially to disturb the peace equilibrium of Europe by an increase in armament must be bound by mutual agreement in the matter, or there will be left an advantage to one or more powers over the others; and no power will consent to be placed at a disadvantage for the sake of anything there is in the scheme of the czar. So unless the mind of the Italian government can be changed, it would seem either that the Vatican will be left out or that the congress will not be held at all. The omission of a papal delegate would not, of course, be considered such an obstacle to success as in the case of Italy, since the pope commands no large army or navy, and has nothing to do directly with the increase of military armaments.

But if the papal representative is left out, this will be in effect a snub upon the Vatican; which is what the Italian government desires. The temporal and spiritual powers in Italy have for years been studiously snubbing each other, and the czar's peace congress offers an opportunity for one or the other to gain a decided advantage in this respect. The Vatican desires to be recognized among the powers of Europe. She claims the right to temporal dominion in common with those powers, and to be invited to sit and participate with them in the discussion of international problems, must have some effect in furthering this claim which she has so long and earnestly maintained. All these features of the situation are of course obvious to the diplomats of Europe, and between them the scheme for disarmament seems to be placed in a dilemma where only the most skillful diplomacy can save it from failure at the start.
