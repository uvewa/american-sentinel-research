## General Notes

OCR source: Mistral OCR transcription of scanned original.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 03 — "Sunday-Law Agitation in Pittsburg"

- **Location:** Paragraph 5, sentence beginning "In Sabbath observance,"
- **Issue:** The OCR renders "In Sabbath observance, [as] in any moral duty" — the word "as" appears in brackets in the OCR source, suggesting it may be an OCR insertion or an unclear word. The brackets are not original punctuation.
- **Transcribed as:** "In Sabbath observance, [as] in any moral duty" — preserved as found in OCR since it may reflect an original editorial insertion or an unclear reading.
- **Confidence:** LOW — the brackets are anomalous; may be OCR artifact or original printing quirk.
- **Second pass:** Not possible without access to the original scan; flagging for review against original.

### Article 06 — "Anglo-Saxon Government in India"

- **Location:** Extended quotation, passage about execution
- **Issue:** OCR renders "doom-! men" — this appears to be an OCR artifact where a comma or period in the original was misread, interrupting the word "doomed." The original likely reads "doomed men."
- **Transcribed as:** "doom-! men" — preserved exactly as in OCR to flag this for review.
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly an OCR error for "doomed men."
- **Second pass completed:** Cannot verify without original scan.

### Article 07 — "Fallen Protestantism" (Author attribution)

- **Issue:** The article is bylined "BY JOHN MCCARTHY" — this name does not appear in the known authors list. It is treated as a new contributor.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "John McCarthy", author_short: "JMcC"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### Article 08 — "The Everlasting Gospel: What Is It?" (Author attribution)

- **Issue:** The article is bylined "BY C. H. KESLAKE" — this name does not appear in the known authors list.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "C. H. Keslake", author_short: "CHK"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### Article 09 — "Is this a Christian Nation?" (Author attribution)

- **Issue:** The article heading reads "### H F. Phelps." — no period after "H", possibly "H. F. Phelps" with a missing period after the initial. The period after "Phelps" suggests this is a byline in subheading form.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "H. F. Phelps", author_short: "HFP"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the missing period after "H" is likely an OCR omission; "H. F. Phelps" is the probable intended reading.

### Page 16 Editorial Notes — Bound Volumes / Back Numbers

- **Decision:** The "Bound Volumes for 1898" section and "Back Numbers" notice were treated as publication boilerplate/advertisements and not given their own article files. They contain no substantive theological or political argument.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — consistent with project guidelines to skip advertisements and subscription info.

### "A Card" (Page 13)

- **Decision:** The brief "A Card" notice (soliciting donations to the Foreign Mission Board of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination) was treated as a short announcement and not given its own article file, as it contains no substantive argument — only a donation address.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

### "TO OUR PATRONS" (Page 13)

- **Decision:** Treated as publication boilerplate (subscription/remittance instructions). Not transcribed as an article file.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.
