BY FRANCES E. BOLTON.

THERE'S a scratch of your knowing,
You have drawn it yourself,—
A scratch for your toeing
You keenly-eyed elf;
But if for some other,
You think, sir, to watch,
Your own feet will wabble
Away from the scratch,
Simply toe to the scratch.

If others stand crooked
What matter to you?
The force of example
To them is your due.
Just look to the standard,
Lest error you match;
Be meek and be manly,
And stand to the scratch,
Simply toe to the scratch.

"I wouldn't do this way,
Or I wouldn't do that"
Without the right action,
Falls empty and flat.
The true to the sample,
The custom will catch,
And the room still is ample
To stand to the scratch,
Simply toe to the scratch.

The scale to the balance,
The yard to the tape,
The truth to the telling,
The fit to the make,
The right thing in secret,
And the pattern will match,
And you need not go shouting,
That you stand to the scratch,
Simply toe to the scratch.

But mark you, the person
Who's ready to fine,
And to punish all others
Who fail of the line,
Will bully and bluster
Delinquents to catch,
And his Dark-Ages measures,
His manners will match,
While he fails of the scratch.

Look all the world over
Look into all time.
One stands as a Brother
In meekness sublime.
No law of the tyrant
Some sinner to catch,
But there He stands LOVING.
(Who'll seek him to match?)
Simply toeing the scratch.

And if for your toeing
The line is too straight,
And you balance unequal,
Or your weakness too great.
O then for your helping;
That Brother will watch.
Lean hard upon Jesus,
Till life and line match
With Him toeing the scratch.
