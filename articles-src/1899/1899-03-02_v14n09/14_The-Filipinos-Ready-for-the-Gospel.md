According to press dispatches of recent date, the American Bible Society is in receipt of information which shows that the Filipinos, previous to the outbreak of war with the United States, were ready to welcome the labors of Protestant missionaries and were desirous of conforming to Protestant principles in government. The information comes from the Rev. John R. Hykes, D. D., who recently visited the islands as the Bible Society's agent.

It is stated that "a young man who was correspondent for one of the leading Chinese newspapers during the war, writes him from Hong Kong that the Filipino congress has passed by a large majority a bill providing for complete religious liberty in the Philippine Islands, and the entire separation of the church from the state.

"He states that in course of conversation with one of Aguinaldo's intimate native friends, he was assured that the Filipinos will extend a hearty welcome to Protestant missionaries, of whose religion they know only enough, he says, to convince them that it is a truer and far more elevating faith than that which has hitherto been taught in their unhappy islands.

"Aguinaldo's special representative in the Hong-Kong colony—said to be a most courteous and well-meaning gentleman—told him that Aguinaldo would be glad to give any help in his power to ministers of the gospel (Protestant) desirous to proceed to the islands. 'Ask them to come to see me,' said Aguinaldo, 'so that I may talk with them and give them letters which will be of use to them.'

"A Christian young man in the United States army at Manila writes to Dr. Hykes that the people are anxious to receive the Bible. Some Bible distributors went up to the terminus of the railroad with about one thousand gospels, and after distributing about half of them from the car window on the way up, they attempted to pass the remainder out to people on the streets; but a crowd collected, and they were forced to go into a Chinese shop and bar the door, and pass the books out through an iron-barred window.

"Books are not plentiful in the provincial dialects, and such as are obtainable are quite expensive; so the people were quite anxious to get books at a reasonable price.

"The gospels referred to were in the Pangasinan dialect, and some two thousand copies were disposed of in a few days. It is said to be gratifying that the Filipino congress has realized the fact that, if the natives are to have any part in the government of the islands, they must grant absolute religious freedom, because this is Americanism, as distinct from the union of church and state under Spanish sovereignty."

How unfortunate the present outbreak of hostilities is, cannot be fully understood apart from the facts here stated. The Filipino congress "passed by a large majority a bill providing for complete religious liberty," and "the entire separation of the church from the state" in the islands. That is Protestantism and that is Americanism. But it is greatly to be feared that Americanism has now lost the high standing it had in the islands, and that Protestantism in government, because it is Americanism and is recognized as such, will become, if it is not already, a fast-waning sentiment in the minds of the people. To this result the war must directly tend, though it may be hoped that the antipathy of the Filipinos to papal principles, developed by centuries of oppression, will be strong enough to survive even the shock of the war.

Let Protestant missionaries improve this opportune time—if it yet remains—to go to the Filipinos with the gospel; not as the representatives of a government hostile to them, or of any earthly government, but solely as representatives of the government of heaven. It is for this that they have been delivered from the Spanish yoke, and by this will the present purpose of Providence towards them be fulfilled.
