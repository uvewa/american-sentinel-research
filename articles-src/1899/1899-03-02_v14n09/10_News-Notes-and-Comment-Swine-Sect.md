A sect has arisen in the vicinity of Ottawa, Canada, who hold the belief that swine are possessed of the devil, and deem it their duty to conduct a war of extermination against all animals of that species. As the law of that district does not sanction the destruction of swine from religious motives, the sect has come into conflict with the civil authorities, and some prosecutions are threatened. Whatever exceptions are taken to this feature of their belief, it must be admitted that the view that swine constitute a habitation of evil spirits, is not without some degree of plausibility. The use of swine as food has been known to occasion actions and sensations in individuals which might well be considered as supporting this view; and it is to be remembered that on one occasion when the Saviour cast out a legion of devils, they went by choice into a herd of swine. And it is further recorded of those who in that day set great value upon swine, that they came and besought the Saviour to depart out of their coasts.
