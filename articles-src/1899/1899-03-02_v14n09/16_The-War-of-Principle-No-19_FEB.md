"Alex, that last question of yours has followed me day and night. What am I going to do? We studied the Bible till I am sure that your statement is right. But there's such a lot of things involved that it seems impossible to obey."

"It only seems so, Cecil. There can be no obstacle too great for divine power."

"No; but Aleck, there's my situation. I'll lose it if I keep the Sabbath."

"What if you do?"

"Why, that means bread and butter, home and advantages!"

"O Cecil. Where is your faith in the working of God for you. If you cannot trust in so small a matter as this, what would you do in the face of a Sunday law with prison bars and penalties behind? What would you do in the swelling of Jordan?"

"I do not know. I had no idea I was so weak. I've always counted myself strong before. Then, that's not all, Aleck; there's social position. I know if I keep the Sabbath I will be an outcast from society."

"Have I not been over this road, Cecil? This is not a new path. But Jesus walks ahead. Will the loss of worldly society outbalance the divine fellowship, or make greater advantages accrue to you?"

"N-no, but I can't see where I am going. Up to now I have known what I would do day after day, week after week. I have had a pretty clear idea of the society I would move in, and of what my future would be; but now I know nothing."

"Cecil, put the principle to the test. All your past has been marked by self-dependence. Swing loose. See what God will do for you. What will all your worldly advantages amount to if you are on the wrong side? 'What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?' Besides, Cecil, in the struggle that is sure to come, are you going to be on the side of force or of love?"

"Can't I be neutral?"

"No, indeed. 'He that is not with Me is against Me.'"

"Aleck, you believe in prayer. Pray for me."

Cecil and Aleck spent an hour on their knees together with an open Bible before them. They proved the promise that 'where two of you are agreed concerning anything it shall be done.' Gradually faith came into Cecil's heart, the first trembling faith that meets the outstretched hand of Christ. With that same faith came the first love—sweet, simple, childlike—that rests wholly on infinite power. Aleck and Cecil rose, and the scales had fallen from Cecil's eyes. He was beholding the heavenly vision, and was prepared to obey God. The joy and peace he had long questioned about were his as he laid hold of Christ as his portion forever.

"Let me know how the battle goes," said Aleck, as Cecil started away.

"Keep on praying for me," said Cecil.

He had a long talk with his employer. Cecil told him the reason he must close his work on Friday night at sunset, and was met with arguments he himself would once have thought feasible. When arguments failed, he had ridicule and sneers, and when that left him unmoved he was discharged from his position.

As for his companions—they thought him a "crank," spoke of him as a lunatic and a fool. Yet not all. Some heard his reasons, and turned like the noble Bereans to the study of the Word, and placed their reliance in God.

How did he live? He lived by "every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." He learned how God can fulfill his promise, and add every necessary thing. For those who abandoned him, he found a hundred-fold of friends; but best of all, he kept the Saviour with him.

"How are you getting on?" asked Aleck.

"Gloriously," said Cecil. "I'm working for others as you worked for me. How blind I was! How blind others are! The folks down my way are talking Sunday law more furiously than ever. My conversion and the conversion of others seems to have stirred them all up."

"You remember, Cecil, how you said you didn't blame the Ephesians for shouting, 'Great is Diana.'"

"Yes, I see what you mean. I don't blame our folks either for shouting, Great is the American Sabbath! The Ephesians threw away their idols when they learned the truth, and so will men to-day. But I tell you, Aleck, there's more in the principle than can be told in words."

"And experience to come will teach us still more," said Aleck.
