The subject of fraud in spiritualism has at last come to engage the serious attention of Spiritualists, who are stirred over the effect which counterfeit manifestations are having upon the "real truths" of their religion. At the conference of the National Spiritualistic Association at Chicago, February 16, this was a principal topic of discussion, and measures were considered for suppressing the work of impostors. A "strong organization" of the adherents of spiritualism was advocated as the most effective means of protection against those who assume the guise of "mediums" from mercenary motives.

There are many people who regard the "manifestations" of spiritualism as the work of impostors altogether. The Spiritualists themselves do not so regard them, and the measures taken by them at this conference constitute interesting evidence upon this point. Believers in the doctrines of spiritualism ought to be better acquainted with the character of these manifestations than are the general public who know of them only by hearsay and the exhibitions of traveling showmen. Spiritualists themselves know that there are genuine manifestations of "spirit" power, aside from the immense amount of fraud which is practiced in the name of spiritualism; and the public, while skeptical now, will yet be convinced that this is true. For it is a plainly-taught doctrine of Scripture that supernatural or "spirit" manifestations will abound in the "last days" in connection with the spread of wickedness and false doctrine, and that these manifestations will culminate in the working of actual "miracles." See Rev. 13:13, 14; and 16:13, 14.

In the last days, false doctrine as well as true doctrine will be supported by miracles, and the manifestation of supernatural power will afford no real proof of the doctrine in connection with which it is given. The doctrines of men must be tested in another way, and those who stand ready to be convinced by the sight of a miracle, are prepared for fatal deception. The divine counsel to all is, "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them." Isa. 8:19, 20. The word of Omniscience is surer evidence than the sight of the eye, or the testimony of any human sense. Judged by that Word, spiritualism is indeed a fraud, not as an unreal thing, but a fraud in its very reality, and therefore a deception of the most dangerous kind. It is evident that the time is ripe for spiritualism to assert itself with greater power than it has done for many years heretofore.
