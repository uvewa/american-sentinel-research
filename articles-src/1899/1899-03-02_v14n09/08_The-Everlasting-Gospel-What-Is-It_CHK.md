BY C. H. KESLAKE.

To say that true Sabbath reform is to be carried on through the preaching of the "everlasting gospel," with sole reliance thereon, may mean much, or it may mean little, according to what one's idea of the gospel is.

Without doubt all have too narrow an idea of the meaning of the gospel; yet a very large number of those who profess to believe it have little or no conception whatever as to its meaning. Only when we find God's own definition of this expression can we begin rightly to understand its true meaning.

It is of the highest importance for us to know what God's definition of "everlasting gospel" is; for those who stand upon the side of the gospel are to have arrayed against them the power of the "beast and his image." This power is something more than mere earthly or human power, although we are wont to speak of it in those terms. It really means that the true gospel believers are to have superhuman power arrayed against them.

Look at the following scriptures and see what they say. Of the government which is to cause the image of the beast to be made, the prophet says: "And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him." Rev. 13:12. But what power did this first beast possess? Here is the answer: "And the dragon gave him [the first beast] his power, and seat, and great authority." Verse 2. But who is the dragon? Again we read: "And the dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him." Rev. 12:9.

Retracing our steps, as it were, and reading these scriptures, beginning with the last verse quoted, it can be easily determined what power it is by which the two-horned beast will accomplish his work. And so leaving out the symbols, the agencies, through which Satan is to work, the prophet (Rev. 12:17), speaking of the remnant church, the people of God, who stand upon the everlasting gospel at the very time when the mark of the beast is being enforced, says: "And the dragon was wroth with the woman [church] and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God [the identical thing which the everlasting gospel requires], and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."

Such will be the situation of the people of God at this time, and the only thing that they will have to sustain them is the everlasting gospel. How necessary therefore that we get, as before remarked, God's own definition of this term.

Beginning our search we turn to Rom. 1:16, and read: "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation," etc. Thus we see that the gospel is simply the power of God. So that when we read the message of Rev. 14:6, 7, we can lawfully substitute "power of God" for "gospel" and read it thus: "And I saw another angel . . . having the everlasting power of God to preach," etc. Can we doubt that the power of God will be more than a match for the power of the dragon?

But there is still more to God's definition of the word "gospel." We read again (1 Cor. 1:24): "But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."

The center and circumference of the "everlasting gospel" then is Jesus Christ. Back of Christ there is no power. He himself is the "power of God." Some idea of this "power of God" may be obtained in beholding the work of creation. Says the prophet Isaiah, "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by name, by the greatness of his might; for that he is strong in power; not one falleth." (Chap. 40:26.)

What may be learned by lifting up our eyes on high is told by the Apostle Paul (Rom. 1:20): "For, ever since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes, even his eternal power and divinity, being perceived from his works, are clearly seen, so that they might be without excuse."—Noye's Translation.

In the things that are created we have before us continually an object lesson of the power of Jesus Christ. "For in him were all things created, in the heavens, and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions, or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him." Col. 1:16 (R. V.) No wonder that the shepherd Psalmist as he lifted up his eyes on high, and beheld who had created all these things, was led to exclaim, "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork." Ps. 19:1.

But much as creation tells us of the power and glory of its Creator, it does not, cannot, tell us all. Very beautifully Job gives us the truth concerning the matter when he says, "By his Spirit he hath garnished [made beautiful] the heavens: his hand hath wounded the flying serpent. Lo, these are but parts of his ways; they convey but a whisper of his glory: but the thunder of his power who can understand?" Chap. 26:13, 14.

Thus the power and glory of the Creator revealed in the things that are created as compared to the fulness of his power, is as but a faint whisper in comparison to the loudest thunder.

And it is the "thunder of his power" that is given us in the "everlasting gospel." Not simply is a portion of the power that is in Christ given to us in the preaching of the gospel: It is Christ himself, "in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily."

Very fitting is it therefore that when this "everlasting gospel" is preached, all people are called upon to "worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters."
