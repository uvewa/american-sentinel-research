BY JOHN MCCARTHY.

To prove how great has been the fall of Protestantism, we shall quote from the writings of celebrated theologians in the Protestant world; since many of the optimistic class may count us as being awfully pessimistic in our views, and reject the statements made as being full of prejudice, unsavory to the taste, and discordant to the ear of the modern Protestant.

Dr. A. de Moss, writing in the *Christian Standard*, in Aug. 13, 1893, said, "The saddest of all things is, that the church of Christ has stultified itself, and taken one step backward towards Romanism." Again in the *Lutheran Observer*, February, 1893, Professor Richards presented some startling facts from the writings of Doctor Stoecker, of Germany, who, writing of the progress of Catholicism in that country, says, "We can only oppose Rome with a better faith, which faith is not the 'liberal Protestantism,' nor a mish-mash of the liberal and positive; but the biblical, confessional faith of our church. We have the advantage of Rome in biblical truth, but we do not guard it. Professors and pastors, synods and church elders renounce the Bible, and deny the foundation of Christianity, the essential divinity of Christ; and still the church authorities are silent."

Is this a false accusation against Protestantism? Every truly honest-minded person must admit the veracity of this statement. Error, like a cancer, is gnawing away the very life of Protestantism; and the great majority of "Protestants" seem to be unconscious of the fact. Ministers of different denominations have accepted "new theologies," and have joined the mighty army of "higher critics;" they are ashamed of the "old time gospel" handed down to us generation after generation; some deny the divinity of Christ; others question the inspiration of Revelation; others regard as a first-class fable the fall of man; some with an assumed philosophical turn of mind, in a most authoritative and hypercritical tone, declare that the prophecies of Daniel are on a par with the "Arabian Nights;" while many who enroll themselves as benefactors of the human race view with especial horror the circulation of the Bible, since they maintain that the books of Moses must have a pestilential and immoral influence wherever they are disseminated; and with sanctimonious gestures they demand the exclusion of said books from the sacred records.

To prove how pusillanimous the Protestant church is to-day, we shall quote from the *Arena*, of Boston, June, 1893. It said: "The ministry of to-day in all great metropolitan centres, have so lost their power over the people, that they can no longer fill the pews. I received a letter from a leading orthodox minister of Boston, which contains the following frank, but mournful confession:—

"'The churches have all they can do to keep alive. They have no religion to spare. There is scarcely a church where religious truth is the central attraction. We ministers must conjure by the social principle, by amusing or lecturing to the audience in an engaging manner, or we have empty pews. Look at the topics we advertise.'"

From another paper from Oakland, we clip the following: "The pastors of this city are seemingly afraid that preaching Christ will not draw the people. On Sunday, the 5th, one of them preached Blaine, one preached Gough, another preached an ex-mayor of the city. A few weeks ago most of them preached Philips Brooks. The subjects of all these sermons are dead. When ministers of the popular churches get through preaching a living Christ, we may well conclude that 'Babylon is fallen.'"

The great Teacher said, "And I, if I be lifted up will draw all men unto me." Again the divine Book states that "there is none other name given under heaven among men, whereby we must be saved." Jesus only should be the theme of our preachers. But alas, it is not so. They are fed upon the husks of man's dramatical theorizings, instead of receiving the nutrimental wheat from the celestial table.

Listen to the rebuke from Cardinal Satolli, former papal legate to the United States. He says: "From the want of prejudice I have remarked in America, it looks as if many were Protestants more in name than in reality." When the Catholic Church can thus cast her darts at Protestantism, is it not time for us to look about, and ascertain wherein lies the defect? The primitive reformers stood upon the Bible as their "only" guide. They withstood the world for the maintenance of principle, nor would they compromise a single point. To them principle was worth more than life. They were true Protestants. To-day Protestants have not the backbone of former days, they are more pliable, not so "narrow," more compromising in character. They have no fixed principles, but are carried to and fro by every wave of false teaching that comes along. We take up the strain of Canon Farrar, in The Christian, Jan. 4, 1894: "Oh that God would give us one real saint among the conventional echoes of artificial churchiness; one living voice among the 20,000 priests. If He would give us but one prophet!"

We would say, "Oh that God might raise up living Christians, those having a living connection with Jesus; those who will oppose error and heresy uncompromisingly. Who will fall in line with the late Pastor Spurgeon, in his action against down gradism, when he said, 'To pursue union at the expense of truth, is treason to Jesus Christ. To tamper with his doctrines, is to become traitors to him. We have before us the wretched spectacle of men professedly orthodox, publicly avowing union with those who deny the faith, who call the fall of man a fable; and deny the personality of the Holy Ghost.'"

Dowling, the far-famed historian, says: "The Bible, I say, the Bible only, is the religion of Protestants! nor is it of any account in the estimation of the genuine Protestant, how early a doctrine originated, if it is not found in the Bible. The consistent, true hearted Protestant, standing upon the Rock, 'the Bible and the Bible only,' can admit no doctrine upon the authority of tradition. He who receives a single doctrine upon the authority of tradition, let him be called by what name he will, by so doing, steps down from the Protestant rock, and passes over the line that separates Protestantism from the papacy; and can give no valid reason why he should not receive all the earlier doctrines and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church upon the same authority."—"History of Romanism," book 2, chap. 1.

The gospel is the only remedy for all the social evils of the present day. It is an old remedy, one that has been well proven in every corner of the earth; and it has always been efficacious. This is the gospel of which Paul said, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to all who believe." True Protestantism is synonymous with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Let us not be content with the counterfeit, but let us procure the genuine. The excellent things are always imitated; and for this reason Protestantism is imitated on every hand; but such imitations lack the divine authentication, as is proved by their being opposed to the teachings of Holy Writ.

Brother, where wilt thou stand? upon the side of the Bible, and nothing else? or upon modern theology with its traditional innovations? "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve."
