In justification of the "expansion" policy it was mentioned by the attorney-general of the United States in a recent speech, that "we belong to a race that has governed India."

This was a pertinent remark, but its real bearing on the subject is quite different from that intended by the speaker. The governing of India, ethically considered, casts no glory upon the fact that "we" belong to the race that has done it, and affords no justification for a policy of following in their steps.

In "Around the World with General Grant," a book published by the late Mr. John Russell Young, well known as an official of the Government, are mentioned some facts connected with the administration of government in India which may be cited in evidence upon this point. A description is given of the methods employed by the British government for keeping the Hindoos in subjection. The occasion observed by Mr. Young when these methods were put into operation, was that of the flight of an unarmed native regiment of infantry, after one of their number had murdered an English major. He says:—

"The Twenty-sixth Native Infantry had been disarmed in May and kept under guard. On July 30 some madman in the regiment killed the major. The author of this murder was a favorite named Prakash Pandy, who rushed out of his hut, called upon his comrades to rise, and, seeing the major, killed him. The sergeant-major was also slain. The Twenty-sixth had served with distinction in many campaigns, notably in the Afghan campaign of 1842. It was thought that the fugatives would run south to Delhi to join the king.

"But they took a northern direction, away from the war, anxious to reach Cashmere, to be out of India. They had no guns. There was a drenching rain, and the country was almost flooded. The troops came up with them, shooting 150 and driving them into the river, drowned inevitably, 'too weakened and famished, as they must have been after their 40 miles' flight, to battle with the flood.' The main body escaped, swimming and floating to an island, where they might be described crouching like a brood of wild fowl. Mr. Cooper started out to capture them."

The men were captured, and the British officer proceeded to deal with them:—

"The doomed men, with joined palms, the Hindoo attitude of entreaty, crowded into the boats and were brought on shore. 'In utter despair forty or fifty dashed into the stream and disappeared.' No order was given to fire, and the fugitives, says Mr. Cooper in a spirit of playfulness, became possessed of a 'sudden and insane idea that they were going to be tried by a court-martial after some luxurious refreshment.'

"So they were brought on shore, one by one, tightly bound, their decorations and necklaces ignominiously cut off. 'Some begged that their women and children might be spared, and were informed that the British Government did not condescend to war with women and children.' They were marched to the town, 'the gracious moon,' Mr. Cooper informing us, coming out through the clouds, and reflecting herself in myriad pools and streams to 'light the prisoners to their fate.'

"They arrived at midnight. Next morning at daybreak Mr. Cooper took his seat. He had 282 prisoners, besides numbers of camp followers. He sent his Mohammedan troops, fearing they might hesitate to shoot Mohammedans, to a religious festival, and, alone with his 'faithful Sikhs,' proceeded to do justice. 'Ten by ten,' says Mr. Cooper, 'the Sepoy's were called forth. Their names having been taken down in succession, they were pinioned, linked together, and marched to execution, a firing party being in readiness. Every phase of deportment,' says Mr. Cooper, in a critical, observant spirit, 'was manifested by the doom-! men, after the sullen firing of volleys of distant musketry forced the conviction of inevitable death—astonishment, rage, frantic despair, the most stoic calmness.'"

Of the demeanor of the men as they passed by the commanding officer to execution, it is said:—

"Others again petitioned to be allowed to make one last salam to the sahib. About 150 having been thus executed, one of the executioners swooned away (he was the oldest of the firing party), and a little rest was allowed. Then, proceeding, the number had arrived at 237, when the district officer was informed that the remainder refused to come out of the bastion, where they had been imprisoned temporarily a few hours before. Expecting a mob and resistance, preparations were made against escape, but little expectation was entertained of the real and awful fate which had fallen on the remainder of the mutineers. They had anticipated by a few short hours their doom. The doors were opened, and, behold, they were nearly all dead. Unconsciously the tragedy of the Black Hole had been re-enacted.

"No cries had been heard during the night in consequence of the hubbub, tumult, and shouting of horsemen, police tehseel guards, and excited villagers. Forty-five bodies dead from fright, exhaustion, fatigue, heat, and partial suffocation were dragged into light and consigned, in common with the other bodies, into one common pit by the hands of the village sweepers. One sepoy was too much wounded to be shot and was sent to Lahore along with 41 subsequent captives, where they were all blown from cannon. The assembled natives, says Mr. Cooper, expected to see the women and children thrown into the pit, and because this was not done 'marveled at the clemency and the justice of the British.'

"Mr. Cooper's superiors approved his acts. Sir John Lawrence informed him that he had acted with energy and spirit and deserved well of the State. The judicial commissioner was more enthusiastic. 'My dear Cooper: * * * It will be a feather in your cap as long as you live.' 'You will have abundant money to reward all, and the (executioners) Sikhs should have a good round sum given to them.' 'You have had slaughter enough. We want a few for the troops here (to be blown from cannon), and also for evidence.'"

In justification of this it may be said that it was necessary. But for what was it necessary? "To maintain British dominion in India," it will be answered. That may be true enough; but for that very reason—because such horrors are necessary to the maintenance of Anglo-Saxon sovereignty over the people—is it not evident that humanity forbids such sovereignty? If to this it is replied that without that sovereignty the people would fight and massacre each other, the answer still is, that this does not excuse such deeds on the part of the governing race. If two men are fighting with intent to murder each other, this does not justify a third person in murdering one of them himself to prevent his murdering or being murdered by, the other.

"We belong to the race that has governed India;" that is true. But let us learn from the fact the lesson that it teaches, from a moral standpoint,—a lesson that will caution rather than stimulate us in considering a career of conquest.
