RECENTLY there was a divorce in "high society," in this city, followed immediately by the remarriage of one of the parties with another distinguished member of "society." Just what ground existed for the divorce the papers did not state, but the impression carried was that no adequate ground existed. It was stated that the officiating clergyman did not understand the situation when he married the divorced individual, and that but for the high standing of the parties concerned they would not have been able thus successfully to defy public sentiment and modern social proprieties.
