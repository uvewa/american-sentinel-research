## "That Evil Spirit of Liberty."

ACCOMPANYING a cartoon in a recent issue of *Puck*, the well-known illustrated journal, in which the pope is shown climbing up the dome of the Capitol building at Washington, carrying a papal cross and saying to "Uncle Sam," when "called down" by the latter, "I thought it was time to nail this cross up over the dome"—is the following from the editor, once himself a Catholic, summing up the meaning of the late papal encyclical on "Americanism":—

"The recent flurry of our Roman Catholic friends over Americanism proves to have been without good cause, from their standpoint. That is, no one has been guilty of the kind of Americanism that the Paulist Fathers and certain bishops were accused of; no one has been trying to establish an American Catholic Church. And so the pope's letter was based upon a misapprehension! Nevertheless it makes interesting reading, as his letters generally do. In spots it is delicious; in other spots it is magnificent: delicious in its Jesuitical indirectness, magnificent in its nerve.

"The old gentleman has no fault to find with the American people, their laws or traits, and yet—well, the truth is that the children of the church must beware of that evil spirit of liberty which taints all that Americans think and do. Especially would he warn them against 'the assumed right to hold whatever opinions one pleases upon any subject.' He suspects that this iniquitous heresy is peculiarly rife here, and it must be guarded against; for holding any opinion one pleases is as wicked to-day as it was when the Roman Catholic Church punished that audacious heretic who declared that the earth revolved around the sun. Nor can there be ever a change. 'For the doctrine of faith which God has revealed has not been like a philosophical invention, to be perfected by human ingenuity.' The sun still revolves around the earth, for 'that meaning of the sacred dogmas is perpetually to be retained which our Holy Mother the Church has once declared; nor is that meaning ever to be departed from under the pretense or pretext of a deeper comprehension of them.' It is possible that there will sometime be a Catholic American government; but there never can be an American Catholic Church;—that, we would say, is the sum of the letter."
