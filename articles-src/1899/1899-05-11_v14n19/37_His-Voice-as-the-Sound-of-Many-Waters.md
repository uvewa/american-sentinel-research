## His Voice as the Sound of Many Waters. Rev. 1:15.

**BY T. R. WILLIAMSON.**

The valleys sing with the voice of Spring,
And the pleasant plash of the rain;
The soft drops bound from the drinking ground,
Then sink to the buried grain.
At that music fine from the clouds' spilled wine
The dull earth robes with flowers;
And the tall trees don a green leaf crown
To be kings through Summer hours.

That voice of the rain that calls the grain,
And sings to oak and vine,
That pours in rills from green clad hills
To the thirst of lowing kine,
Is my Saviour's voice, in Him all rejoice,
And many waters say
"'Tis my dear Lord's love decks the skies above
And adorns Earth's Spring so gay."

See the rivers bear to the Ocean's care,
With many a burdened sigh,
The harvests great of the teeming states,
That along their borders lie.
That resistless sweep, so broad and deep,
Hath a voice, a song of power,
That includes the pour of the cascade's roar
And the purl of the Summer shower.

Oh that hearty voice, the full, strong tone,
Of the ruling, pushing flood,
'Neath the dazzling sun or the pale, true moon,
Singeth ever in changeless mood.
And my Saviour's voice, in Him all rejoice,
And the rivers' waters say,
"Give praise divine to the heavenly shrine
For the love of Christ alway."

Oh the tumbling wave where the surges rave,
And the great, gray rocks loom high;
There's a boom and a break as the billows shake
Their foam 'neath the storm-torn sky.
Oh the huge, slow, might, and the moving hight
Of the tides, majestic, broad;
And the rise and dip of each steady ship,
Faring on with her living load.

These call with a voice, a thunderous voice,
Like the trumpet's blare in the gale;
They command and plead in urgent need,
With a stormy, hoarse, sea hail.
"Come, come to my Lord at His longing word,
For our many waters say
That the vilest men are ennobled again
By the love of Christ alway."

From the light afar of each swinging star,
In the endless, endless blue,
Where the glories meet and the comets fleet
Like fire ships sail into view;
Where galaxies blaze and the faint, fine haze
Of sheeny nebulae shine;
From that pearly way where each new, pure day,
Comes, swift from the Throne divine.

Through the boundless course of the universe,
And from all things great and good,
Breathes the holy sound of a voice profound
In praise of our Father, God.
For my Saviour's grace and His Heavenly face,
And the shining worlds all say,
"'Tis my dear Lord's love lightens all above,
And gives help in Earth's rugged way."
