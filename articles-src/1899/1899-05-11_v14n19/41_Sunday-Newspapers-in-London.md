IN response to the outcry against Sunday newspapers in London, the editor of the Daily Mail has offered to suspend his Sunday edition if the editor of the Telegraph will do the same. That is the way it is with a great many people who "want to be good" in this country; they are willing to observe Sunday, and would like to do so, if it were not for the few dollars in trade they would lose by it. So they must have a law to prevent anybody else from trading on Sunday, or doing anything to earn money, so that they can be religious on Sunday free of cost. These individuals should remember that a religion that is good for anything costs something. The Christian religion is cheap enough at any price that can possibly be asked for it.
