# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, May 11, 1899 (v14n19)

## General Notes

The OCR source was clean with no significant scan artifacts noted. The following minor items were observed:

---

### Article 16 — "The Results of Disunion" (C. H. Keslake)

**Page 7, paragraph on Cain and Abel:**
- **Transcribed as:** "it was not hard for Cain, in his condition of unbelief, to see (?) clearly that his brother was in the wrong."
- **Note:** The "(?) " appears in the OCR source itself; this appears to be an editorial or typographical question mark in the original, used by the author rhetorically to indicate Cain's distorted perception. It has been preserved as "(?) " in the transcription.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the mark appears intentional, not an OCR artifact.

---

### Article 35 — "Religious Hatred the Source of Persecution"

**Page 8, last paragraph:**
- **OCR text:** "religious animosity has ever carried people to the great est lengths of inhumanity"
- **Transcribed as:** "religious animosity has ever carried people to the great est lengths of inhumanity"
- **Note:** "great est" appears split in the OCR source (likely a line-break artifact from the original). Preserved as written since it is a word-break artifact, but may need to be rendered as "greatest" in final layout.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — context is clear.

### Attribution Notes

- **John D. Bradley** (article 14, "The Constitution of American Imperialism — No. 4") and **Frances E. Bolton** (article 15, "The Town of Bondage — No. 2") and **C. H. Keslake** (article 16) and **H. E. Osborne** (article 17) and **T. R. Williamson** (article 37) are contributor bylines not in the known-authors list. These are treated as guest contributors with `attribution: "editorial"` since they are not editors of the publication. No initials are used in file naming since these are full names credited in the articles.
- **A. T. J.** initials appear at the end of "Christian or Heathen—Which?" — attributed to Alonzo T. Jones (ATJ) per the known initials list.
