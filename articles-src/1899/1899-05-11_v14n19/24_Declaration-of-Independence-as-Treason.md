We wonder, and we question seriously, whether the Government would be willing to transmit in the mails copies of the Declaration of Independence, directed to the people of the Philippines, and translated if necessary into their tongue, with those passages emphasized which set forth the equal unalienable rights of all men by creation, and the truth that the just powers of civil government are derived from the consent of the governed. From the expansionist standpoint, we know of no more treasonable document than this.
