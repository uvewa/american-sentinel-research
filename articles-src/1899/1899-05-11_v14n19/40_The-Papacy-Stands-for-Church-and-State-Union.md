THE papacy stands, everywhere, for the union of church and state. It represents the ultimate product of the development of that principle to its fullest extent. The AMERICAN SENTINEL is set to oppose the union of church and state, and must therefore oppose the papacy. This is why it has so much to say about the papacy. But remember, friends, that it is speaking against principles, not against men. The papal principle of church-and-state union is an enemy of all men, and of none is it a worse or more dangerous enemy than of those whose misfortune it is to hold and believe in it as being right. And therefore in opposing it to none, is the SENTINEL a truer friend than to the Catholics.
