Referring to the position taken by a prominent Methodist clergyman of New York City, and approved at a meeting of several hundred M. E. clergy, that a person should "reject all parts of the Holy Scriptures which are repugnant to reason," the *Freethought Magazine* says, "That is all that any Freethinker can ask." "The next thing we may expect to hear," it adds, "is that Colonel Ingersoll is called on to address some Methodist camp meeting."
