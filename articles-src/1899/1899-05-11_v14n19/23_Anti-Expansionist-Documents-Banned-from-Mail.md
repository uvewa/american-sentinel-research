THE Government has forbidden the transmission through the mails of certain anti-expansionist documents prepared by Mr. Edward Atkinson, of Boston, and designed by him for circulation among the officers and men of the American forces at Manila. This prohibition is made on the ground that the documents are treasonable in character, though they are in large part made up of extracts from the Congressional Record. It has been expected that Mr. Atkinson would be prosecuted on a charge of treason, but the Government has taken no action thus far in this direction.
