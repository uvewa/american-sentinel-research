While other nations are simply greedy land grabbers, whose motives in war do not rise above the love of conquest, "we" are moved to take up arms by high motives of regard for humanity and disinterested benevolence. We thank God that we are not as other nations, even as the publican nations across the water; and this assumed contrast in moral character is flaunted before the nations of the Old World, and that at the very time when this nation is crushing a people who are fighting for independence and the privilege of government by the consent of the governed.
