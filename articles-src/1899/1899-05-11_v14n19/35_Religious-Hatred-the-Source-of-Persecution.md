## Religious Hatred the Source of Persecution.

The Lutheran Observer, from which we copy the following, sees plainly that religious hatred has been the source of the great persecutions of past times, but is not so conscious of the truth that religious hatred is active in our own day, and seeks to-day the same methods of revenge. The Observer says:—

"The crucifixion of Christ was the supreme illustration of religious persecution in the annals of the human race. The hatred of the Scribes and Pharisees which prompted the stupendous crime was so intense and malignant that it scrupled not to violate any law—Jewish, Roman or divine—to accomplish its purpose. Christ himself characterized their hatred of him as diabolical. He declared to them: 'Ye are of your father the devil, and the lust of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth.' And yet, paradoxical as it appears, the hatred of the Scribes and Pharisees against Christ was a religious hatred. They were the orthodox rulers of the Jewish synagogue or church. As the highest officials of the synagogue, they were the special custodians of religion among the Jews; and their hatred and persecution of Christ grew out of their zeal for their religion. They were the 'conservatives' of that day, and they opposed Jesus because the spirit of his teachings rebuked their false professions and hypocrisy.

"There are many instances of this religious hatred persecution, and crime in the history of the church and the world. Indeed, many of the most atrocious crimes that darken the history of the race were of this character. Christ rebuked the Pharisees because they manifested the spirit of their fathers, who killed the prophets whom God sent to them; and yet they honored the very prophets whom their fathers slew, and garnished their sepulchers.

"The persecutions of the Roman Catholic Church—the atrocities of the Inquisition, the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the countless other crimes in her history—were perpetrated in the name of religion. The reformers of successive ages who sought to purify the church—Wickliffe, Waldo, Savonarola, Huss, Luther, Zwingli, and many others—were persecuted, imprisoned, tortured, and some martyred for declaring the truth of God. This has been, in a greater or less degree, the experience of God's reformers and the heralds of his truth in all ages. Those who dared to expose the false teachings and corruptions in the church were denounced, calumniated, and persecuted by the 'conservative' and orthodox representatives of religion in their day.

"But religious intolerance and persecution have not been confined to the Roman Catholic Church. The same spirit has often been manifested in the Protestant churches, but not carried out with the same extreme and cruel methods, because the methods of punishing 'heretics' or 'dissenters' from the customs or doctrines of orthodox churches have been changed in successive ages, and they can no longer, in civilized countries, be imprisoned, tortured, or burned at the stake, as formerly. But under the same intolerant and persecuting spirit in Protestant churches, they were misrepresented, denounced, imprisoned, or expelled from their churches."

Recent events however have shown with ghastly distinctness that people can be tortured and burned at the stake in civilized countries, even in the United States. It is only necessary that the spirit of hatred and revenge be roused to a sufficient degree of intensity. Individuals recently burned at the stake in this country were not tortured and burned for religious reasons; but it is to be remembered that the spirit of hatred is never more fiercely roused than in controversies over religion, and religious animosity has ever carried people to the great est lengths of inhumanity. The fact that the time has come when in civilized lands people are again tortured and burned at the stake, may be accepted as good evidence that the time has come when religious persecution is ready to be revived in its worst form.

In no age of the world, according to the instructions of Christ himself, were his followers to count on faring better at the hands of their enemies than he did at the hands of his enemies. As it was with the Master, so was it to be with the servants. It need not be thought strange, therefore, that a revival of religious persecution should occur at the close of the nineteenth century.
