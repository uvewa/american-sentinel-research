## The "Fast-Day" Farce.

BY H. E. OSBORNE.

Serious reflection with reference to the popular "observance" of the recent "fast day" proclamations, must prove prolific in queries as to the propriety of this state-appointed fast. No one could fail to observe that the thought of fasting and prayer was the remotest idea in the minds of the people on the "fast day" just passed. No one witnessed any "rush" on the churches, to take part in humbling hearts before the throne of divine mercy. Indeed, it was a rare and exceptional case to even find on that day an open door in the Protestant churches, and still more difficult to find the people who had entered in.

On the other hand, one could but be impressed with the fact that there was a conspicuous effort on the part of the people to secure the promised pleasure of numerous attractions, bidding for public patronage on this fast-holiday. Parties were formed for excursions into the country in search of the sweet spring flowers—an innocent pastime in itself to be sure, yet not peculiarly an act of piety. Fishing and hunting, parading and racing, wheeling and driving—how all these sports flourished! More painful to note was the fact that the saloon did a thriving business; the theater was taxed to its utmost capacity; and crowds resorted to the dance-hall, where supper was served to people who had partaken of three meals during this day of fasting and prayer!

Now that irreligious people would not be influenced by this "fast-day" proclamation is certainly to be expected. But why should even the Christian be moved upon to comply? When and where did God command the State, saying, "Proclaim ye a solemn fast among the people?" When and where has the great "Governor among the nations" even authorized the State to promulgate such a decree?

It may be argued that the proclamation, being non-compulsory, is at least harmless, but who will dare affirm that the cause of true religion is not hindered by this huge jest upon the sacred privilege of prayer? Since the day is one of feasting and not fasting, and since it is so hard for our governors to break away from the "time-honored custom" established by their predecessors, why should not these executives at least be frank enough to call things by their right name, and so proclaim a farce-day rather than a fast-day? Surely, a more genuine farce cannot be found, than is this annual State "fast," and if our governors are to exercise the functions of a *religious* office, it behooves them to "provide things honest in the sight of all men," as the good Book commands. This name would not only be in harmony with facts, but it also presents the advantage of an easy transition from the current title. By the indistinct pronunciation of the ordinary Yankee, it is difficult to tell whether your neighbor is talking about fast-day or farce day. Since this progressive age admits changes in our orthography, let us be honest and write and speak this name as it really is,—f-a r-c e-day.
