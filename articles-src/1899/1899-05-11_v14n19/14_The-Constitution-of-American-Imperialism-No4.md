## The Constitution of American Imperialism.—No. 4.

### BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

The philosophy of the transformation of the Constitution of American Republicanism into the constitution of American imperialism, is simply this: The noble sons of degenerate fathers who are now in charge of affairs are too good, too just, too wise, and too humane to be governed by law. They are better than the Constitution of their fathers; their acts are more just, righteous, and humane than the highest and best principles of which their fathers could conceive—the principles which have ever been the true glory of the American Republic. Common sense, therefore, requires that the Constitution should be made to fit their acts, and not their acts to fit the Constitution.

When it is pointed out that it is a dangerous thing to clothe men with arbitrary and irresponsible powers over their fellowmen; that it is neither wise nor safe for American statesmen to substitute the principles of despotism for the principles of liberty, imperialists ask with apparently great concern, "Can we not be trusted?" One of them said in the United States Senate:—

"We cannot be accused of not loving liberty and justice and equality and the rights of men with a love pure, earnest, and unselfish. . . . Let us have faith in the Government. Let us have faith that the powers of government will never be unrighteously exercised. Why should any man, why, especially, should any senator, wish to detract from, to diminish or belittle the power of his government? Why strive by subtle and metaphysical logic-chopping arguments to hamper its operations and circumscribe its province? Rather should we in our national love rejoice to see it invested with strength. Rather should we bid it Godspeed in its mission to relieve the oppressed, to right every wrong, and to extend the institutions of free government. For this is the people's government; the government of a great people, a liberty-loving people, a people that can be trusted to do right, and to guarantee to all men who shall come under its beneficent sway and be subject to its jurisdiction the largest measure of liberty consistent with good order and the general well-being."

After stating in the February Forum that the Constitution of American Republicanism has absolutely no binding force whatever upon the men who have sworn to support it, and that it is useful only to "consecrate" and to "stamp legality" upon the acts of the "men supremely great" who attend to the matter of its "expansion" and "contraction" as "time and occasion demand," Mr. Denby asks with much feeling, "Is it possible that we are degenerate?" He says at another place:—

"In other lands and in other wars the condition of the conquered people has been hard and deplorable. In our case we march bearing gifts, the choicest gifts—liberty and hope and happiness. We carry with us all that gives to the flower of life its perfume. The dusty East rises at our coming; and the Filipino springs to his feet and becomes a free man. This is not poetry, but reality wrought out by a people to whom freedom is as the breath of life, and who would scorn to enslave a country or a race."

And again:

"There is great talk of justice and peace, as if we were going to oppress anybody—which we could not do if we wanted to."

"Can we not be trusted?" The answer to that question rests with those who ask it. Doubtless they can be trusted to some extent with some things if they prove worthy of such trust. Trust is not one-sided, developing spontaneously at the will of the person exercising it. Its existence is not determined altogether by the person exercising it; its existence is largely dependent upon those who are trusted. Trust must be inspired; there must be a ground of confidence, something upon which it may be based. The way to make sure of future trust is to be true to the trusts of the present. It is too much to expect of ordinary people that they can feel secure in their constitutional rights, either now or for the future, when they are told to-day that the principles of the Constitution "are indeed great, but that they are incapable of literal application." When the people are told to-day that the trial by jury and the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus may be refused without infraction of the Constitution, they do not know how these rights are to be secured to them in the future. There can be no faith here that "the powers of government will never be unrighteously exercised," because there is nothing upon which such faith can be based.

There are many men who can be trusted with a few things; there are a few men who can be trusted with many things; and there are some men who can be trusted with nothing; but there are no men who can be trusted with arbitrary power. The men have never lived and never will live who can be trusted with unlimited power over any of their fellowmen.

It will aid materially in understanding why any man, and even a senator, may "strive" to "hamper" and "circumscribe" the power of government, when it is known why the government is invested with any strength whatever. The government is invested with power that it may uphold the rights of every citizen. Its sovereignty is the expression of the sovereignty of the people; the sovereignty of human rights; the sovereignty of the rule of right. It has "full power to do all acts and things which independent states may of right do." It is therefore not entirely unbecoming for any man, and even a senator, to wish to circumscribe and hamper those operations of power that are an expression of the subjection of the people; which are a denial and prohibition of human rights; which are an assertion of the sovereignty of the rule of might; which are accompanied with the declaration that "we have a right to govern the territory of the United States as we please."* Such investments of strength are not occasions for rejoicing. "Our legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their power, that their true office is to declare and enforce only our natural rights and duties, and to take none of them from us."† It is, therefore, a waste of breath on the part of an American statesman to talk of sovereign powers which conflict with human rights. He simply proclaims that he is ignorant of, or that he despises, the fundamental principles of American government.

"Is it possible that we are degenerate?" This question is easily answered. It is most certainly possible. But that is not the question, and it is a question upon which imperialists, if they are wise, will delay discussion as long as possible. We will say, however, in passing, that upright men are not in the habit of demanding unlimited powers over their fellowmen. They know that it is impossible to hold such power for the good of anybody—that it will be a curse to both governors and governed. They have no aspirations in behalf of humanity and civilization that are incompatible with justice and equity. They know that in order to be humane they must be just; they know that in order to be beneficent they must not deny to others the rights which they claim for themselves. But let the question of degeneracy be decided as it may. In neither case are those who ask this question entitled to the powers which it is unlawful for any man or set of men to hold, whether they be degenerate or not. The first man who arrogated to himself such powers has come down to posterity branded in the language of inspiration with a name that is equivalent to "the extremely impious rebel," and which signifies "rebellion" and "supercilious contempt." And those who follow in his steps cannot hope to escape the brand of Nimrod, let the question of their degeneracy be decided as it may.

Mr. Denby does not say why "we" cannot oppress anybody—"which we could not do if we wanted to," and we shall not ask why. It becomes persons of ordinary clay to hold their tongues in the presence of men who are so spotless and immaculate that they just can't oppress anybody, even under an "expansive" and "elastic" constitution interpreted by themselves. No words of doubt should mar such sublime perfection. But the injunction is, "Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise; why shouldest thou destroy thyself?" Those men who are just so good that they cannot be beneficent without trampling upon justice and equity; who are so righteous that just and constitutional restraints and principles must expand and contract to fit their actions, are so unregenerately bad that of all men on the face of the earth, they are the last who should be trusted with irresponsible power, and never for a single moment should they know what it is to be without the most strict and binding limitations and restraints.

We shall have more to say of these "good" men next week. And in what we have said, and shall say, we are not aiming at the men, but at this "goodness" with which they identify themselves.
