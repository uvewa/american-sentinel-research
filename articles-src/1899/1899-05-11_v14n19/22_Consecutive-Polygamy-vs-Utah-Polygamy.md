We are as far as any from defending polygamy; but it might well be inquired how much better such "consecutive polygamy" as is tolerated without much disapproval in "high society," is than the polygamy of congressman-elect Roberts, of Utah, against which society has so loudly raised its voice in virtuous indignation. Where consistency is wanting, there is something wrong.
