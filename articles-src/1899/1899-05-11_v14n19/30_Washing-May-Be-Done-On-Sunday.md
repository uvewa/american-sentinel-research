## Washing May Be Done On Sunday.

Recently a lady in Baltimore, Md., on a Sunday morning washed out a change of table linen and placed the articles on a line in her back yard. At six o'clock the following Monday morning a policeman called and informed her that she was wanted at the police court at 10 o'clock the same morning to answer a charge preferred against her for breaking the Sabbath. When she came before the court she was asked to hold up her hand and swear that she had been washing on the Sabbath day. Upon refusing to condemn herself, and explaining just what she had done, the judge told her that she was "not guilty," and after volunteering his belief that Saturday was the true Sabbath according to the Scriptures, and strongly intimating that the complainant in the case was a minister living next door, to whose church the defendant had previously belonged, he pointed out the difficulties that would confront all who attempted to keep Saturday, and then sent his prisoner home with the advice that she obey the laws of the land rather than attempt, against all odds, to follow Scripture teaching in the observance of the Sabbath.

It is generally conceded by those who have taken the trouble to investigate the case that the minister having failed to convince his former parishioner of the sacredness and obligation of Sunday by the application of the moral law, appealed unto the courts for the enforcement of the civil law in behalf of Sunday observance.

Is it a strange thing that there is a marked decline in religion when we consider that the ministers no longer preach the Bible? Will this condition improve if our ministers add to their political and sensational sermons, prosecutions for nonconformity?
