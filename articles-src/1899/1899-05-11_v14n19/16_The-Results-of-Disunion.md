## The Results of Disunion.

BY C. H. KESLAKE.

"Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation: and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand."

In the preaching of the gospel the importance of maintaining unity is set forth. The Apostle Paul writes: "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you: but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."

Just how this is to be accomplished the Apostle tells us in the following language: "I therefore the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering: forbearing one another in love: endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."

This is God's way. This is teaching us to do as God did. It is God likeness. It tends always to salvation.

But Satan's way is directly opposite. As pointed out in a former article, the great enemy of righteousness recognizes the necessity of unity; but the only way in which he can even appear to accomplish this is to use force, even to the extent of putting the one at variance with his idea, to death.

When there is a division among men there must be error; some one is in the wrong. And that wrong must be corrected even though it be necessary to punish the one who cherishes it.

At a very early date in the history of the world this spirit made itself manifest. Very soon after the fall of our first parents there was an exhibition of the lack of unity and its results. Abel was a devout worshiper of the Lord. The Bible tells us that, "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts." Heb. 11:5.

As this same scripture shows, Cain also was a worshiper of the Lord. But it is evident that the worship he brought to God was of such a nature that God could not accept it; and that being so, it was worse than if no worship had been professed on Cain's part. And when God witnessed to Abel's offering that he (Abel) was righteous, by that same token God witnessed that Cain was unrighteous.

It does not matter here as to what difference there was in the worship that they offered. There was a difference, and reference is made to the occurrence because it presents an illustration of that which has been enacted over and over again throughout the history of our world. There may have been differences in matters of detail, but always the same spirit has been manifested and the same principle involved.

Between these brethren there was a lack of unity; they were divided. The cause of this was a lack of unity on the part of one of them between himself and his God. Had both alike been one with their Creator there could have been no division between themselves; they must have lived in perfect harmony.

Bad as the situation was, the remedy was both easy and simple. When Cain discovered that the Lord did not respect him or his offering, he was very wroth, and his countenance fell. "And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door." Gen. 4:6, 7.

It is clear that had Cain made a similar offering to that of Abel's, and had done it in faith as Abel did, he would have done well, and he would have been accepted. And the words of the Lord by which it was sought to encourage him shows that it was still possible for Cain to offer an acceptable offering. But Cain was not willing to accept the Lord's way of remedying the difficulty.

There was a division. One of them was in error; and it was not hard for Cain, in his condition of unbelief, to see (?) clearly that his brother was in the wrong. It was only a question of time when one of them must give up, or else be put out of the way. Not merely a separation was demanded, for this world is too small to hold even two people when they do not agree.

"Can two walk together except they be agreed?" This is impossible. Both Cain and Abel realized this, and both sought to secure it, but each in a different way. Abel could not give way; Cain would not. Cain's way of securing unity must be, if necessary, at the expense or cost of his brother's life. And this was done. But there was no more unity in Cain's case after Abel's death, than there was before. The trouble was not in Abel, it was with Cain himself.

The first movement in which religion was joined with force—the first that ever was on earth—was apparently a success. Truth (?) had been vindicated—so the "reformer" thought. Yet the voice of his brother's blood cried unto God from the ground, and throughout his whole life Cain lived with the awful consciousness that he had not bettered the situation a particle.

Such is the spirit of intolerance. Such is the spirit that cannot bear to see others differ from themselves, and such must always be the case where the restraining influence of God's Holy Spirit is not cherished.
