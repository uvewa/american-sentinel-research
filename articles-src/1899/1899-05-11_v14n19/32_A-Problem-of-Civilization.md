## A Problem of Civilization.

News sent from Manila by soldiers in letters to relatives in this country, is frequently of a kind not transmitted through the regular newspaper channels. For example, in a letter to a friend in Sacramento, Cal., one soldier says:—

"I must say that our generals do not want any prisoners, and when they capture any they take their guns away and tell them to go back to Aguinaldo and get more guns. Furthermore, if we catch any of their men wounded, to rid them of their misery we simply put a bullet through their brains and send them to their happy hunting grounds."

Another, in a letter to his father, living in the same city, says this:—

"Every soldier in Manila was 'just dying' for a chance to get at the black devils. We struck Santa Ana, the insurgent headquarters first, and after an hour's hot work we had the town in flames and what was left of the Filipinos running like frightened sheep. When we stopped shelling Santa Ana the First California regiment entered, and what we had not burned they finished with a vengeance. Their motto, as well as that of the other regiments, is, 'The only good Filipino is a dead one; take no prisoners, as lead is cheaper than rice.'"

A sergeant-major, in a letter denouncing the savagery of the Filipinos, writes:—

"I will venture the prediction that if we ever make an advance through the country that advance will go down in history as one of the most pitilessly cruel of modern times. Can you blame us if we should thus war on a people who come up to you with a white flag in one hand and a knife in the other, and where the men disguise themselves as women to accomplish their design?"

From these and other letters the evidence is clear that the "benevolent assimilation" of the Filipinos is not being conducted even according to the demands of "civilized warfare." And this is being done by the representatives of the Government which went to the Philippines to rescue the inhabitants from barbarism and Spanish cruelty, and to confer on them the blessings of American civilization!

We have nothing to say in defense of the barbarity of the natives. They have acted like savages, no doubt; though it is to be noted that they hold a number of American prisoners whom they have treated well, and evidently do not consider that the only good American is a dead one. Nothing else than barbarism is to be expected of savages, and it was to uplift them from such degradation, we are told, that American civilization was sent to the islands. But how long will it take to civilize the people of those islands when their would-be civilizers act like savages themselves?

The truth is that war is a savage business at the best, and is best conducted by those who have most of the savage in their makeup. It is not the promoter, but the destroyer of civilization.
