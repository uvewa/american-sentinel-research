### Looking After Trouble.

*New York "World."*

Within a week after the reception of the complacent declaration of Admiral Kautz that he was "boss" in Apia we are told that the Samoan troubles are thickening, that the cessation of hostilities has been misunderstood, that the Samoans are full of fight, that Apia is menaced, and that it will be absolutely necessary to slaughter a few thousand more of these poor savages in the assertion of the supremacy of that faraway protectorate of which our admiral is "the boss."

With the Samoans in their war canoes moving up to be mowed down by our rapid-fire guns it would be idle to talk of our withdrawing. The fight is on and it must be fought out. But it may not be idle to point out that our share in the Samoan trouble is wholly of our own seeking, and that if we had let the Samoans alone and had refused to have anything to do with their quarrels—which were none of our concern—they would never have troubled us.

And it is worth while further to point out that if we keep out of the Chinese complications the Chinese will let us alone. But if we once take a hand in the Chinese question, which is merely the Samoan question on a tremendously larger scale, we shall pull down on ourselves an avalanche of trouble compared with which the Samoan difficulty will be not worth considering.

Why should we go far abroad for troubles and problems and "white men's burdens?" Haven't we enough at home?
