An exchange says: "The Sunday opening of the British Museum shows that the London public has taken the fullest advantage of it. Statistics prove that the number of visitors has been greater per hour on Sunday than on week days. On Sunday the museum is open for three and one-half hours. On week days for eight hours. Relative to the Sunday opening of libraries, the late Vincent Stuckey Lean, who bequeathed £50,000 to the trustees of the British Museum and the same amount to the corporation of Leeds for the expansion of their libraries and reading rooms, advised that the libraries be kept open a part of Sunday. But he did not insist that it was a condition attached to his bequests."
