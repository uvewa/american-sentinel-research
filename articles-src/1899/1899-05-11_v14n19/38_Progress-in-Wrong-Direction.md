PROGRESS is a good thing when it is in the right direction. But such progress as is shown by the marriage and divorce statistics, and by the evolution of sentiment in "society" touching the sanctity of marriage, is progress backwards. On the whole, has the "progress" of the nineteenth century been in a forward direction, or the reverse? This is a serious question, and there is abundant ground for asking it.
