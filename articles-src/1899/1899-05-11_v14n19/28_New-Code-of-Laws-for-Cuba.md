A NEW code of laws is being prepared for Cuba, which will eliminate the old Inquisitorial rule of compelling a prisoner by torture to incriminate himself. This rule has been in force in the island up to the present time. It is to be observed, by the way, that confession by torture is a method resorted to recently by mobs in the United States.
