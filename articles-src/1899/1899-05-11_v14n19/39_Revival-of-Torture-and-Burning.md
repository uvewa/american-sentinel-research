The revival of punishment by torture and burning at the stake in this highly-civilized country, is a fact as significant as it is dreadful. When once public sentiment has become so "educated" as to sanction such methods, they may be employed for the punishment of religious offenses as well as for other crimes, and some of the lurid pictures of the Dark Ages may be repainted in the light of the twentieth century. It should be remembered that nothing is more potent to rouse the savage instincts in human nature than the animosity engendered over religion.
