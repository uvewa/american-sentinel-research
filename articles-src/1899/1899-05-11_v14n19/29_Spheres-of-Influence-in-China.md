It is reported that England and Russia have come to an understanding on the Chinese question, the agreement being that Russia's "sphere of influence" in China is to be the provinces of Manchuria and Chili, and England's "sphere" is to be the province of the Yang-tse Kiang. Germany is expected to extend a like "sphere" over the province of the Hoang-ho. At the same time it is agreed that both England and Russia shall "uphold the integrity and independence of the Chinese Empire."

But how can a nation be independent which must have some other nation or nations maintain its independence? How would England and Russia view the establishment of a foreign "sphere of influence" on their own soil, as touching their own independence?

The prospect is that the Chinese empire, under the pressure of these "spheres of influence," will rapidly disintegrate, and the control of trade interests in the various "spheres" will pass into the hands of the respective powers; and this is a matter that touches the commercial interests of the United States.

There is a steady progress in the evolution of circumstances which are drawing the United States into the vortex of European politics.
