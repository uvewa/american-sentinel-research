### Right by Virtue of Might.

The American forces are driving all before them in the Philippines, and are daily demonstrating the immense superiority of the force employed by the Government in the islands, to the force which the natives are able to employ against it.

Suppose, however, that the situation were reversed; that the native forces were driving the Americans before them, and that every prospect pointed to the speedy establishment of their complete supremacy in the islands. Under such circumstances, would it be regarded as the duty of this Government to take and hold the islands? Would it be said that this was our "manifest destiny"? Would it be even said that the Filipinos were not right in wishing to be independent and in refusing all government that was not by their own consent?

Is it the manifest destiny and high duty of this nation to deliver people who are under the oppression of a great power, the same as (we are told) it is to deliver the people of the Philippines from the comparatively weak despotisms which would flourish there if the American forces were withdrawn?

Consider, for example, the oppressed people of Russia—the Stundists and others who are banished to the Siberian mines and in many ways subjected to the most inhuman treatment. These poor people—and there are many thousand of them too—would be far better off in the Philippines than they are in Russia; they would be much more free to enjoy "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" under the rule of Aguinaldo and his chiefs than they are under the crushing church-and-state despotism that rules in the name of the czar. But would the United States consider for a moment that it had the right to overthrow the Russian government and bring to its millions of down-trodden subjects the blessings of liberty, etc., which it is now bringing, as it says, to the Filipinos?

Certainly this nation would not think of claiming any such right, although "duty to humanity" confers the right as much in the one case as in the other. This right of relieving oppressed humanity is claimed only where the power of giving such "relief" is vastly greater than the power that can be summoned to oppose it. The right is claimed only where there is the might and because of the might. And this being so, upon what other basis does the proceeding rest than that "Might makes right"?

But however easily one nation may subdue another—however much a weak people may excite the contempt and derision of a stronger power because of their military incapacity, it remains true that might does not make right, and that the side of right is the only strong side in the end.

No nation, the United States not excepted, can depart from the side of right without fatally weakening itself.
