IF there is one thing that more than another is calculated to weaken the moral influence of this nation among other nations of the world, it is the assumption of moral superiority contained in the talk about the rapacity of the nations of Europe, which would be ready to fall like greedy dogs upon the defenseless Philippines if the United States should withdraw. The Chicago Times-Herald, of May 2, speaking on this point, makes use of the phrase, "the territorial greed of less conscientious nations," and this is only a sample of what is found everywhere in the public utterances of the expansionist party.
