## "Civilized" Savagery at Samoa.

The widow of the late well-known novelist, Robert Louis Stevenson, who is buried in Samoa, has written a letter to the Westminster Gazette, touching the bombardment of Samoa villages by British and American warships. It is a very caustic comment on the "benevolent assimilation" which "civilized" and "Christian" nations practice, in the name of "humanity," upon people too weak to offer serious resistance; and what is more, Mrs. Stevenson undoubtedly knows and tells the exact truth of the matter. The letter says:—

"President McKinley allowed no firing on Cuban towns unless they gave active cause of offense, and Commodore Watson was ordered not to attack undefended Spanish cities. Does the President keep his humanity for civilized countries alone?"

She declares that the Samoan villages are inhabited in time of war by non-combatants, who have to choose between the shells of the warships and "taking to the bush." Under such conditions, she says, delicate women can hardly exist, while children die like flies.

The letter concludes with this paragraph:—

"Chief Justice Chambers has been represented as saying in a letter to his brother: 'I never was happier.' He must be a person singularly devoid of imagination if he never pictured to himself the scenes being enacted in those bombarded villages; the exodus of panic-stricken people rushing hither and thither, shells bursting everywhere, the cries of the bed-ridden and the helpless, wounded people, burning alive in their blazing houses, women in the pangs of childbirth, mangled children crawling on the sands, the sea before them and the bush behind them. And we read that the woods also were shelled. Who is to be held accountable for these deeds that disgrace both England and America?"
