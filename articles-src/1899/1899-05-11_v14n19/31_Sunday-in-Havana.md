## Sunday in Havana.

There is Sunday closing in the city of Havana. This is by order of General Ludlow. "Every business house in Havana except the drug stores and cafes," says the press dispatch, "were closed at 10 o'clock this [Sunday] morning." It adds that the thousand or more clerks who petitioned the military governor to issue the order are much pleased; but "not so, however, the storekeepers and the general public."

This is a Sunday law with no "dead letter" about it; for there is no dead letter about military orders. People in Havana must "keep the Sabbath" or feel the rigorous hand of military discipline. Whoever fails to honor Sunday as prescribed may count himself fortunate if he escapes being shot.

This is the first time Havana was ever subjected to a Sunday law. Under a Protestant government an institution which stands as the distinctive mark of papal power and authority, is enforced as it never was under the papal rule of Spain.

Havana is now the most orthodox city under American rule.

When the Declaration of Independence is thrown aside for the sake of conquest abroad, it is gone as a bulwark of defense for American rights at home.
