# NEWS NOTES AND COMMENT

"The race question" is appearing again as an issue in American politics. In the municipal campaign just concluded in Baltimore this was the leading issue. "A white man's city" was the campaign cry of the democrats. Beside this issue, it is said all national and state issues shrank into insignificance. Just what issues were settled by the civil war is, after all, a matter of much uncertainty.
