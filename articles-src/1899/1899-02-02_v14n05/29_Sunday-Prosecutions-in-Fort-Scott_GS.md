The following are the leading features of the case of the prosecution against barber J. A. Tite, for shaving on Sunday. The complainants in the case are two professional barbers who have run their shops on Sundays for a long time. A short time ago one of these barbers employed the Ft. Scott planing mill to remove and set up the fixtures of his shop on Sunday, the work amounting to about six dollars; and since swearing to the complaint against J. A. Tite, this barber has shaved two of his customers on Sunday.

In the trial it was in evidence that the complaining witnesses had on Sunday, the 18th of December, walked six blocks through mud and rain to spy out Mr. Tite, to get a prosecution against him. They saw him shave two men. These two men were subpoenaed as witnesses for the State. They both claimed that they had called on barber Tite to shave them on Sunday; that they wished to go to church and that they would feel very uncomfortable to go to church unshaved; that it was a matter of necessity for their comfort.

Mr. Tite, the defendant, was then called to the witness stand. He admitted shaving the two men on Sunday as a work of necessity. In answer to the question whether he had shaved any one else on Sunday he replied that he had shaved a dead man on Sunday. The prosecuting attorney admitted that shaving a dead man on Sunday was a work of necessity to make a respectable appearance; while the defense claimed that shaving a living man was doubly a work of necessity as both respectable appearance and comfortable feeling were involved. The prosecuting attorney stated that he had no further remarks to make.

The attorney for the defense argued at some length on the plea of necessity, stating that to make a respectable appearance at church or among his friends and to feel comfortable, it was an absolute necessity for a man to put on a clean shirt, have a fresh shave, a fresh-washed face, and have his hair newly combed, on Sunday; that one of these was just as much a work of necessity as the other.

The two complaining witnesses testified that they saw Mr. Tite shave two men on Sunday but did not testify that it was not a work of necessity. The other two witnesses for the State both testified that it was a work of necessity.

Had the jury made up their minds in the case from the testimony, it would not have taken them five minutes to agree on a verdict of acquittal; but as it is, it seems that six of them made up their minds from their religious views instead of the testimony offered, as after twenty-four hours of deliberation they stood six for acquittal and six for conviction.

Two of the leading barber shops in Ft. Scott have been open every Sunday and will continue so, and probably in a short time the complaining witnesses will also open their shops again on Sunday.
