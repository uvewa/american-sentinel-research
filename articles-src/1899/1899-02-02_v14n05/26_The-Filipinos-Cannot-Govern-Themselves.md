"THE Filipinos cannot govern themselves," say the imperialists. Perhaps they cannot, but they have the right to try it, and they might come as near it as is done by some nations calling themselves civilized. It would be interesting to know how the criminal statistics in the Philippines compare with those in the country that wants to govern them. How many murders occur in the islands in a year? In the United States the yearly average is about 10,000. How many of the Filipinos commit suicide in a year? There were 6,600 suicides in the United States in 1897. How many persons were lynched in the Philippines last year? In this country the number was 122. In 1897 the sum of $11,248,084 was lost in the United States by embezzlement, forgery, and defalcation; the Filipinos, it is safe to say, know little about such species of industry. Probably they are not as much addicted to the use of intoxicants as are the people in many sections of this country. And while these figures apply to the United States as a whole, there are sections of it where the showing would be very much worse; yet it is never suggested of the people in any part of this country that they are not able to govern themselves.
