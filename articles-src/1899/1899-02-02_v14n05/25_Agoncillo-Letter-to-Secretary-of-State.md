THE representative of the Philippine government in this country, Agoncillo, has addressed a letter to the Secretary of State calling attention to existing conditions which indicate hostility on the part of the United States towards his government, and asking for explanations and an assurance that the United States does not contemplate an attack upon it. The letter closes with the words: "I consider it my imperative duty to call your attention to these disturbing conditions [at Manila], to the end that I may receive such assurances as will satisfy my government that it is not the intention of America to make war upon the new republic of Asia, and which will explain to it the reason why large armies and navies should be dispatched to the Philippine Islands and which will relieve my countrymen of the fear that now possesses them that their liberties are in danger at the hands of the republic whose name we have always associated with freedom, and to which we first come for recognition."
