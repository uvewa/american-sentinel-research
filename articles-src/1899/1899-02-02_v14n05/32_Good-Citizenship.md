"Watchword and Truth," Boston.

The movement to make the world better by educating men so as to have them discharge their duties to civil government with greater intelligence and with more conscience, has so much that is commendable that we have hitherto said nothing about it. There are, however, so many dangers lurking beneath it that not to warn Christians to beware would be wrong.

A great leader in this movement recently said, "God's ministers are appointed to administer in civil as well as religious things." Now that is unscriptural, and only a repetition of the sin of Rome in a Protestant form. That is what the Jesuits teach, and they are moving heaven and earth to bring it about. But they are "God's ministers," who are divinely appointed to "administer" in civil and religious affairs. Against this, our "good citizenship" people rebel with indignant defiance. They will never submit to the rule of Romish priests, and why? Because they wish to rule themselves. Aye, "there's the rub." The truth is, Christ is now rejected in the world. Christians cannot go into that place of rejection without being disloyal to their Lord. The church must not seek to reign where Christ is cast out.

Good citizenship on earth is a beggarly substitute for a nobler citizenship which is in heaven—the reform of the kingdoms of man is but a deception when compared with the introduction of the kingdom of God, which never needs reforming. "Let the potsherds strive with the potsherds," but let ministers give themselves "continually to the prayers and to the ministry of the word." "Let Jack stick to his last."
