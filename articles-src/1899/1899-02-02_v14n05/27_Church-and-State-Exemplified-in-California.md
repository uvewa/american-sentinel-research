Speaking of political occurrences in connection with the opening of the legislative term, the Sacramento correspondent of the San Francisco Star makes the following reference to the contest for the office of the State chaplaincy:—

"Religion has also been seriously prostituted during the week. Ministers of the gospel have frequented the barrooms and lobbies of the hotels, begging of drunken politicians the small boon of a four-dollar-a-day job as prayer-maker in Senate or Assembly. It has been a sad sight. The writer was present when one of the ministerial job hunters was whining for a job from a group of half-drunken members of the San Francisco 'push,' whom he evidently mistook for assemblymen. He had asked for their votes, and the following conversation ensued:—

"'See here,' said one of the fellows, 'the legislature of California costs the people of this State fifteen hundred dollars a day. We are in for economy. You ministers take up five minutes a day praying, at a cost of seventy-five dollars' worth of the legislature's time. We pay you five dollars for it, which—'

"'We only get four dollars,' whined the preacher.

"'Well, four dollars, then,' continued the speaker, 'which makes seventy-nine dollars a day, or over $5,000 for the session for—fool prayers. It's an outrage.'

"That minister did not take offense. He was too good a politician for that. Besides, he had been getting similar treatment all the evening. Instead of turning away in disgust, he only smiled at the 'jest,' and attempted to explain.

"'Say,' broke in another of the group, 'what do you consider God's time to be worth?'

"Everybody laughed, even the minister. The writer had not the patience to listen further to the conversation.

"The reverend gentlemen who are praying at the rate of four dollars a prayer before Senate and Assembly must be extremely good politicians, and have a very long pull, for they had many opponents in the field, who had themselves long pulls."

The comment of the editor of the Star was: "Read what our correspondent says, and become convinced, as we have long been, that this 'chaplain' business is a desecration, blasphemy, and abomination."
