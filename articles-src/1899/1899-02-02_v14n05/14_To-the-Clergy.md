The following editorial from the Outlook, addressed "To the Clergy," is worthy of the widest circulation possible. It is wise and true in itself, and from that source it is especially interesting. It is most devoutly to be wished that "the clergy" would conform strictly to the principle here laid down. This is the principle for which the AMERICAN SENTINEL exists:—

"The public are apparently most interested in public questions; but far more important than any public questions are those which are purely personal. The minister shares the universal interest in such problems as, What shall be done with the Philippines? Who shall be the next governor? By what legislative method shall the State deal with the liquor problem? He has before him on Sunday morning a congregation interested in these and kindred problems. If he speaks upon them and has anything to say, his sermon will make good copy for the daily press, and will be reported, or misreported. The temptation is strong to fall into the current, to turn his pulpit into a platform, and his sermon into a political or a sociological address.

"The temptation is the more seductive because moral principles are involved in these questions, and it is not always easy to distinguish between the moral principle which it is his duty to inculcate and the political method which it is not his function to urge; between the virtue of temperance and the legislative method of prohibition; the virtue of honesty and the triumph of his own party; the virtue of patriotism and the policy of expansion or its reverse.

"Nevertheless the community as well as the church is a loser when the preacher yields to this temptation, and ceases to be a preacher of righteousness and becomes an instructor in politics or sociology. For the latter function he has no special equipment. His library is not rich in political and sociological departments. He has no expert knowledge and no special information. He is as dependent as his congregation for his knowledge of the facts on the daily papers, and generally also for his understanding of principles. He is either much more or much less than the average man if he is not subject to partisan prejudices, is not a Republican, a Democrat, a Populist, or a Prohibitionist. It is not safe for him to assume that he is superior to those prejudices which are common to humanity; and if he is unprejudiced because he is indifferent, he is unfit to be a teacher. The fact that the press will report his political sermon and no other, is rather a reason against preaching it than the reverse. For the kingdom of God cometh not with observation; and he who preaches for the newspapers rarely preaches with real effectiveness to his own congregation.

"On the other hand, if he turns aside from his specific function of illuminating and inspiring the individual life, there is no one else in the community to take up his work. And his work is by far more important than that which beckons him away from it. It is far more important that the individuals in the community should be inspired by habits of self-control than that the State should have any particular form of legislation on its statute-books; that the citizens of all parties should be educated to abhor that which is evil than that political power should be transferred from one party to another; that Americans should govern themselves with honor in their individual lives than that they should assume the government of a new and distant people. For the solution of all political and sociological problems depends on this spiritual illumination and inspiration of the individual. Without it there will be the grossest licentiousness and self-indulgence in spite of laws on the statute-book; political reforms will only transfer the State from one set of robbers to another, and the expansion of America will be the expansion of selfish and corrupt misrule.

"What more natural than that the minister should make his pulpit instructions bear directly upon these public themes? But we are convinced, and we should like to convince our clerical readers, that they should do so very rarely, if at all. This is not at all because the congregations are divided in sentiment on these questions, nor chiefly because they are wearied with the overdiscussion of them in the press, nor altogether because the minister is not generally better informed upon them than most of his people; it is because the people have come to church under the pressure of a different need. Some of them are consciously perplexed by problems of personal duty on which they desire light; all of them unconsciously suffer from some unrecognized atrophy and need life.

"The minister who fails to understand this need and to find in the Gospel of his God a means of ministering to it, whether he turns his pulpit into a lecture platform in order to attract the crowd, or neglects his pulpit altogether and endeavors by social calling to build up a congregation, or suffers his church work to fall into a second place and gives himself to civic reform, law enforcement, sociological discussion, and educational progress, misses the opportunity which the peculiar privilege of the pulpit gives to the preacher. This is an opportunity to add to the sum of life rather than to direct life into any particular channel.

"To interpret to men their own restlessness, their half-conscious sense of need; to pierce the armor of their self-conceit and awaken in them a divine discontent where it does not already exist; to set before them in the life of Jesus Christ a type of human excellence and so inspire in them an ambition to be better than they are; to arouse in them a spirit of loyalty to him, obedience to which is the sum of human duty; to recover them from that dull despair whose end is death, by showing them in the free gift of God a power to do all and be all that the highest aspiration sets before them; to put into their exhausted lives a new heart of hope and love—this is the function of the ministry."
