# Uncertainties — v14n05, February 2, 1899

## General Notes

This issue was processed from Mistral OCR output. The source OCR file was largely clean with good legibility.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 4, Article "They Are Very Likely to 'Fall Out'"
- The OCR renders the speaker's name as "Carl Shurz" in the introductory text but "Mr. Schurz" in the body of the article. The correct spelling is Carl Schurz. Transcribed as "Carl Shurz" in the introductory sentence where the OCR so renders it, and "Mr. Schurz" in the body paragraph, preserving the OCR output exactly as it appears in each location.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — "Schurz" is correct historically; the introductory "Shurz" is likely an OCR variant but has been preserved verbatim.

### Page 4, Article "They Are Very Likely to 'Fall Out'"
- Lord Salisbury's name is hyphenated in the OCR as "Lord Sali-sbury," apparently a line-break artifact. Transcribed as "Lord Sali-sbury" to match OCR source exactly.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — this is clearly a line-break hyphenation artifact in the OCR.

### Author "F. E. B." (The War of Principle, No. 15)
- The initials "F. E. B." appear at the end of the article. These initials are not in the known authors list. Transcribed as given; flagged for identification.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the initials as transcribed; identity unknown.

### Author "S. B. Horton" (The Bible, Protestantism, and Papacy)
- Author listed as "S. B. Horton" with "BY S. B. HORTON" as a byline. Not in the known authors list. Transcribed as given.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

### Author "C. H. Keslake" (The Holy Spirit and Sunday, No. 21)
- Author listed as "C. H. Keslake" with "BY C. H. KESLAKE" as a byline. Not in the known authors list. Transcribed as given.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

### Author "John D. Bradley" (Is This Saying Worthy of any Acceptation?)
- Author listed as "BY JOHN D. BRADLEY." Not in the known authors list. Transcribed as given.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

### Author "G. Stockmyer" (Sunday Prosecutions in Fort Scott)
- Author listed as "G. STOCKMYER" at end of article. Not in the known authors list. Transcribed as given.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

### Page 9, Between Articles
- The czar's peace congress propositions appear between the California chaplaincy article and the Fort Scott article. This appears to be a standalone editorial note rather than part of either surrounding article. Treated as its own item (file 28).

### "Watchword and Truth" Attribution
- The "Good Citizenship" article is headed with "Watchword and Truth," Boston. This is a reprint with original_publication set to "Watchword and Truth." The original author of the piece is not named.
