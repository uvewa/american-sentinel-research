The Christian Herald, of this city, sounds a note of alarm over the increasing desecration of Sunday. It repeats the familiar assertion that if Sunday desecration continues the Republic will go down, and points to France and Spain as warning examples. We quote the Herald's words for the sake of calling attention to the truth of the matter, which the Herald in its devotion to Sunday overlooks:

"Effort on all sides is being made to banish the Lord's day, or turn it into a scene of pleasure. When the Sabbath goes down, the Republic goes down. Men who are not willing to obey God's law in regard to Sabbath observance, are not fit to govern themselves. Sabbath-breaking means dissoluteness, and dissoluteness is incompatible with self-government. What is the matter with republicanism in Italy and Spain? No Sabbath. For ages they wanted a republic in France. After a while they got a republic; but one day Napoleon III. with his cavalry rode through the streets, and down went the republic under the clattering hoofs. They have a republic there again; but who would be so bold as to prophesy its continuance for twenty years. France never will have a permanent republic until she quits her roystering Sabbaths, and devotes one day in every week to the recognition of God and sacred institutions. Abolish the Sabbath, and you abolish your religious privileges. Let the bad work go on, and you have 'the commune,' and you have 'the revolution,' and you have the sun of national prosperity going down in darkness and blood. From that reign of terror may the God of Lexington and Gettysburg deliver us!"

"What was the matter with republicanism in Italy and Spain?" "No Sabbath," says the Herald; and that is true, but not as the Herald means it. Italy and Spain were and are to-day countries dominated by the papacy; and the papacy is that power which, in the belief and practice of men, changed the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day of the week. That meant "no Sabbath" to the countries which she ruled, for the first day of the week is no Sabbath in any real sense whatever.

That also was the trouble with France. For centuries what religion France has had has been the papal religion; and the papal religion is contrary to republicanism in every principle. It is no wonder that republicanism cannot flourish where that religion prevails. It would be an unaccountable thing if it could.

Where Protestantism has prevailed, there has been no trouble about the establishment of republican government; for Protestantism and civil freedom are in perfect harmony with each other. But as Protestant countries lose their Protestantism—which they are now doing, the United States not excepted, by legislating in support of religion, and that too in behalf of the very sign of the papacy, Sunday—they lose their capacity for republican government; and the republic will go down as surely as the movement for such legislation attains success.

DR. CHAS. H. PARKHURST, of this city, has addressed to the President the following protest against the forcible subjection of the Filipinos now apparently determined upon by this Government:

"As an American citizen I respectfully protest against any slaughter of the Filipinos as false to the spirit of our religion, false to the American doctrine of liberty, false to the spirit of the pledge given by Congress on April 19 and false to the assurance stated in your own words when you said: 'I speak not of forcible annexation, because that is not to be thought of, and under our code of morality that would be criminal aggression.'"
