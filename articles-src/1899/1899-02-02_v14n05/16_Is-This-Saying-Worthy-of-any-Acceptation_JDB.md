"If we can govern ourselves, by that token we can govern others."

WITH this sentence, which was evidently regarded as a very wise saying, the attorney-general of the United States recently closed an argument on the capability and aptitude of Americans for the government of dependencies. The occasion was the annual banquet of the New York Chamber of Commerce, and the attorney general "spoke for the administration on the subject of expansion." It is said that these banquets of the Chamber of Commerce, like the lord mayor's dinner in London, "afford occasion for public men to speak in an unofficial way upon the great questions of the day and to indicate the policies of parties or of administrations."

There have been two important epochs in American history in which the question of the government of one people by another has been thoroughly canvassed and discussed, and at the end of each, conclusions were reached on the question and were imbedded in the fundamental law of the Republic. It was the adoption of these conclusions that made the American Government a Republic. In each instance there was a conflict, a great struggle, between the principles of liberty and the principles of despotism. Let us briefly glance at these two epochs that we may see upon which side of the conflict in each instance was found the principle contained in this utterance by the attorney-general.

The first of these epochs produced the Declaration of Independence, delivered the American colonies from the oppression of Great Britain, and established the Republic itself under a Constitution that meant "a new order of things." In this first conflict who put forth in substance the proposition that "if we can govern ourselves by that token we can govern others?" Surely not the founders of the Republic, for it was not that they might govern others, but that they might govern themselves, for which they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. Their purpose was not the establishment of their rule over others, but the disestablishment of others' rule over them. Their declaration was one of equality, not of superiority; of independence, not of domination. So far were they from holding to the above proposition that they left on record certain self-evident truths that are in eternal antagonism with the doctrine that one people should be governed by another people. It is unnecessary to quote their language. It is firmly fixed in the minds and hearts of those who value liberty, and those who do not, who are ready to turn back into the "hateful paths of despotism," are finding in that language, even as Lincoln declared, a "stumbling block" and "a hard nut to crack."

As everybody knows, it was George III. and his ministers who, at that time, claimed the right to govern others. They reasoned that if they could tax and govern England, by that token they could tax and govern the American colonies. And certainly, if they could rule and rob India, they could, by the same token, rule and rob America. And it will not be irrelevant in this connection to refer to the case of India; for the attorney-general in the course of his speech declared that "we have sprung from a race that has governed India."

At the very time when the fathers found that they could no longer endure alien Anglo-Saxon rule, or remain a dependency of an Anglo-Saxon power, that same rule and authority which they overthrew in America was being firmly fixed and established over the populous countries of India. This case is correctly quoted as an illustration of Anglo-Saxon rule in the interests of humanity, civilization and trade. It is in fact the greatest example of such rule. Here were millions and millions of people who, according to their Anglo-Saxon benefactors(?) were unfit to govern themselves. Those who have become entranced with the hallucination that the rule of Anglo-Saxons in such cases is the embodiment and perfection of enlightenment, liberty and justice; that the virtues and blessings of Anglo-Saxons and their civilization are so great that the acceptance by them of the "responsibility" of governing such people without their consent, and even against their will, is on their part an act of such benignity and humanity that it should awaken the unbounded gratitude of the people thus favored and place them under everlasting obligations to their Anglo Saxon benefactors,—we say that those who have become enraptured with these sentiments or their equivalents should study the example to which the attorney-general has referred them. They should allow an Anglo Saxon, and one who knew whereof he affirmed, to break the spell for them.

The benefits(?) and blessings(?) which the introduction of Anglo-Saxons and their civilization brought into India were amply portrayed by Edmund Burke in the following speeches: "On the East India bill of Mr. Fox," in the House of Commons, Dec. 1, 1783; "On the Nabob of Arcot's Debts," in the House of Commons, Feb. 23, 1785; and his speech before the lords, Feb. 15, 16, 17, and 19, 1788. These speeches cover the ground quite thoroughly up to the time of their deliverance, and those who wish to know in advance just what Anglo-Saxons can do in such cases, will find them full of meaning. Precious little will be found in the condition of things there portrayed that will make it worth one's while to talk of having "sprung from a race that has governed India."

Have we reached a time when American statesmen find the principles of George III. and of Warren Hastings better suited to their purposes than those of the Declaration of Independence? Evidently that time has arrived.
