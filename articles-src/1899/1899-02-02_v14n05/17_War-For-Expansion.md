The United States began the war with Spain for purposes which had, professedly at least, no connection with "expansion." Now, this nation seems about to undertake another war for the express purpose of "expansion," and that alone.

The scene of the difficulty is the Philippine islands. The Filipinos want to be free—free to govern themselves in their own way. The United States wants them to be free, with "freedom" imported from a foreign shore and administered under the authority of a foreign power. The Filipinos see no difference between this theoretical freedom and actual subjection to this foreign power; and are determined, it is reported, to resist American domination if need be by force of arms.

Advocates of "expansion" have been loudly shouting that any failure to ratify the treaty with Spain, in which Spain "cedes" the Philippines to the United States, will throw the country back into war with Spain. Anything more absurd than this assertion could hardly be imagined. Anybody with the least intelligence ought to know that Spain has neither the disposition nor the power to renew the war, and there would be no war unless it were renewed by the United States. The real truth is that there is every prospect that war will result directly from the ratification of the treaty, in attempting to establish the authority which is "ceded" by it to the United States.

The Filipinos want to set up a republic; the United States is now ready to strike this infant republic a death blow. The Filipinos looked first to this nation for recognition and sympathy. From it first they receive opposition and scorn. Has the United States become the enemy of republican government, after having so long posed as the champion of every people struggling for liberty?
