PRESS dispatches from London state that a ritualistic dissension has arisen in the Church of England, and that the controversy, which relates to confessionals and "high ceremonies," has become very bitter. The Queen, who is greatly disturbed over the matter, has directed Lord Salisbury to effect a thorough understanding between the government and the bishops before attempting any legislation affecting the church. The crusade against "high church" practices, it is added, is assuming a decidedly political aspect.
