This is what that well-known London journal, the Saturday Review, says of the meaning of American imperialism, as exemplified in the annexation of the Philippine Islands:—

"The American commissioners in Paris are making their bargain—whether they realize it or not—under the protecting naval strength of England. And we shall expect, to be quite frank, a material quid pro quo for this assistance. We shall expect the States to deal generously with Canada in the matter of tariffs; we shall expect to be remembered when she comes into her kingdom in the Philippines; above all, we shall expect her assistance on the day, quickly approaching, when the future of China shall come up for settlement. For the young imperialist has entered upon a path where she will require a stout friend, and lasting friendship between nations is to be secured, not by the frothy sentimentality of public platforms, but by reciprocal advantages in their solid material interests."

It is one thing to shout "Hurrah for American expansion!" and quite another thing to sit soberly down and count the cost. Few Americans seem now to be doing the latter.
