ENGLAND is anxious to secure an Anglo-Saxon alliance; in the interests, professedly, of peace.

England is anxious that the United States should firmly establish its power in the Philippines, in order that English interests in the Orient may be safeguarded by the proximity of a formidable Anglo-Saxon ally.

If this situation should come about, however, would it contribute to the establishment of peace? This is an important question just now, and its importance is clearly defined in the answer given to it by Carl Shurz, the eminent authority on American political institutions from whom we quoted last week. In his speech before the convocation of the University of Chicago, Mr. Schurz said on this subject:

"A singular delusion has taken hold of the minds of otherwise clear headed men. It is that our new friendship with England will serve firmly to secure the world's peace. Nobody can hail that friendly feeling between the two nations more warmly than I do, and I fervidly hope it will last. But I am profoundly convinced that if this friendship results in the two countries setting out to grasp 'for the Anglo-Saxon,' as the phrase is, whatever of the earth may be attainable—if they hunt in couple, they will surely soon fall out about the game, and the first serious quarrel, or at least one of the first, we shall have will be with Great Britain. And as family feuds are the bitterest, that feud will be apt to become one of the most deplorable in its consequences.

"No nation is, or ought to be, unselfish. England in her friendly feeling toward us is not inspired by mere sentimental benevolence. The anxious wish of many Englishmen that we should take the Philippines is not free from the consideration that, if we do so, we shall for a long time depend on British friendship to maintain our position on that field of rivalry, and that Britain will derive ample profit from our dependence on her.

"British friendship is a good thing to have, but, perhaps, not so good a thing to need. If we are wise we shall not put ourselves in a situation in which we shall need it. British statesmanship has sometimes shown great skill in making other nations fight its battles. This is very admirable from its point of view, but it is not so pleasant for the nations so used. I should loath to see this Republic associated with Great Britain in apparently joint concerns as a junior partner with a minority interest, or the American navy in the situation of a mere squadron of the British fleet.

"This would surely lead to trouble in the settling of accounts. Lord Sali-sbury was decidedly right when, at the last lord mayor's banquet, he said that the appearance of the United States as a factor in Asiatic affairs was likely to conduce to the interests of Great Britain, but might 'not conduce to the interest of peace.' Whether he had eventual quarrels with this Republic in mind I do not know. But it is certain that the expression of British sentiment I have just quoted shows us a Pandora box of such quarrels.

"Ardently desiring the maintenance of the friendship between England and this Republic, I cannot but express the profound belief that this friendship will remain most secure if the two nations do not attempt to accomplish the same ends in the same way, but continue to follow the separate courses prescribed by their peculiar conditions and their history."
