The czar's plan for initiating his universal peace movement at the coming peace congress, as outlined in a circular addressed to the Powers by the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, provides for the discussion at the congress of the following propositions:—

1. "To agree not to increase naval or military forces and the corresponding budgets for a fixed period.
2. "To endeavor to find means of reducing the forces and budgets in the future.
3. "To interdict the use of any new weapon or explosive of a power fuller than now made.
4. "To restrict the use of the most terrible of existing explosives, and to forbid the throwing of any explosives from balloons or similarly.
5. "To forbid the employment of submarine torpedoes and similar contrivances.
6. "To undertake not to construct vessels with rams.
7. "To apply the Geneva convention to naval warfare.
8. "To neutralize vessels saving those wrecked in naval battles.
9. "To revise the declaration concerning the laws and customs of war elaborated at Brussels in 1874.
10. "To accept the principle of mediation and arbitration in such cases as lend themselves thereto."

The circular reaffirms that nothing touching existing political relations shall be discussed. It suggests that the ultimate conference be held at the capital of a secondary power, probably Brussels or Copenhagen.
