RECENTLY a Chicago clergyman wrote one thousand letters to as many representative men in various quarters, asking why so many men are absent from church. Samples of the replies received are: "I can worship alone." "Can be better entertained elsewhere." "No confidence in the churches." "I do not need the church, and I guess it does not need me." "The church is a hospital, and I am not sick." "Indifference." "Lack of religious feeling."

THESE can be all summed up in two reasons: first, the churches are preaching politics and giving lectures instead of preaching the gospel; and second, "The carnal heart is enmity against God," so that men naturally prefer some place of amusement or of the pursuit of wealth, to the house of God. The church lacks power, as she is confessing by seeking for power through an alliance with the state. Men are always attracted by exhibitions of power, and if the church of to-day had the power that was with the early church after Pentecost, there would be no trouble about getting congregations. And that power was a power which drove out hypocrites so that of these the record is that "no man durst join himself to them;" but "believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women." Acts 5:13, 14. There is no mystery about the modern phenomenon of empty churches. The church has only to turn to the inspired Word to learn perfectly the cause of the difficulty, and the remedy as well.
