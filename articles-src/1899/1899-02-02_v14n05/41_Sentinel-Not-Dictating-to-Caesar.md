Ever and anon we get a criticism from some good friend whose zeal is just a little in advance of his knowledge, to the effect that the SENTINEL is doing itself just what it preaches that Christian people should not do. For example, a critic writes: "On the first page of to-day's paper you declare, 'Jesus Christ never attempted to dictate to Caesar,' etc. Now this paper is almost full of anti-expansion, or in other words, dictation to Caesar."

We are sorry there are any readers of the SENTINEL who do not see that liberty—the liberty of inalienable human rights—is as the SENTINEL asserts, both Christian and Constitutional. We think they will see this if they will investigate the subject a little further.

It is not true that the SENTINEL has ever attempted to "dictate to Caesar." If those in this country who want to reform the public morals by civil law will never try to dictate to Caesar, save in the way the SENTINEL has done, we shall have no fears of an American union of church and state.

The SENTINEL contends for American principles of government because they are Christian as well as Constitutional. It therefore opposes "expansion" and imperialism; because the principles of these are opposed to the principles of human freedom and those unalienable rights which are the gift of the Creator. It is an eternal principle of God that all men—the Filipinos and all others—are by divine right free men; and when civil government denies the rights of any man, the act has a religious as well as a political significance.

That the American Government should now deny these sacred rights and before all the world reject the divine principle of government by the consent of the governed, is an act of the utmost significance, and one which this paper cannot fail to challenge, if it would be an AMERICAN SENTINEL in truth.
