Some imperialists in this country are so fatuous as to think this nation can carry out an imperial policy with an army of less than 100,000 men; and they are as loud in decrying the proposition for such an increase in the army, as they are in demanding that the nation retain the "spoils" of war. But General Brooke calls for 50,000 men in Cuba, and 30,000 are called for in the Philippines, with Porto Rico and Hawaii yet to be heard from, to say nothing of the men that will be needed in arms at home. Evidently, it would be a great blessing to the people of this country just now if they could be given a good object lesson that would impress upon them some idea of what imperialism will cost.
