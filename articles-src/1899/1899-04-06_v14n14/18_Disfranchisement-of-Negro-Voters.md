It is stated on good authority that by laws recently passed in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana, "of seven hundred and fifty thousand voters the suffrage now extends to only about one hundred and seventy-five thousand. If their representatives in Congress were reduced accordingly, South Carolina would have two, or at most three, instead of seven, Mississippi would fall from seven to two or three, and Louisiana to two." In Alabama and North Carolina similar restrictions have been passed and will soon be in operation. The object of these measures, of course, is the disfranchisement of negro voters.
