## Specific Uncertainties

### Article: "Superfluous Vigilance" (file 15)
- The article spans pages 2-3 in the original, with an interruption by the sidebar "Administering Civil Government Upon the Basis of the Bible" on page 3. The continuation of "Superfluous Vigilance" resumes after the sidebar (the sentence beginning "on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed" and the closing paragraphs). The OCR reflects this with the relevant text split across pages 2 and 3. The article has been reconstructed as a continuous piece.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — context and content make the joining unambiguous.

### Article: "Union of Church and State Condemned by the Old Testament" (file 20)
- The article is attributed "BY B. W. NOEL, M.A." with a footnote "*Ex-clergyman of the Church of England." This footnote appears at the bottom of page 6 (mid-article). It has been moved to the end of the article for clarity.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — footnote placement is a layout artifact only.

### Page 16 editorial items
- Page 16 contains a series of editorial paragraphs under no heading, running from the top of the page through to the end of the issue. These have been split into individual articles based on subject matter, following the pattern of distinct topics being addressed. The transitions are not always marked by horizontal rules in the OCR.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — subject matter shifts are clear.

### Author "T. R. Williamson" (file 19)
- The byline reads "By T. R. Williamson" with the dateline "*Healdsburg, Cal.*" These initials (TRW) do not appear in the known authors list. Flagged as a new contributor.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### Author "B. W. Noel, M.A." (file 20)
- Identified as "Ex-clergyman of the Church of England." This is a historical figure (Baptist minister/author, 1798-1873). The article appears to be a reprint of an older work without explicit source attribution in the OCR, but the footnote clarification and the editorial note in brackets confirm it is a reprint. Attribution set to "explicit" because the author is named by byline in the article itself. No original publication source was identified in the OCR text.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — no explicit source publication given; treated as explicit attribution.

### Author "Stemple White" (file 21)
- The byline reads "BY STEMPLE WHITE." This name does not appear in the known authors list. Flagged as a new contributor.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### OCR word: "indelatigable" in "Sunday Laws" article
- The OCR reads "indelatigable" in the Jefferson/Madison quote. This appears to be an OCR error for "indefatigable," but since we are transcribing what appears in the original, and the original may itself have printed "indelatigable" (a period variant spelling or printer's error), the text has been preserved as transcribed.
- **Second pass completed:** N/A — transcribed as found; flagged for reference.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — may be original printer's error or OCR artifact.

### "Woman's Noblest Vocation" (page 13)
- This item quotes from the April Ladies' Home Journal and is promotional in nature. It was treated as an advertisement and not transcribed as a substantive article.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — clearly promotional/advertising content.

### Pages 13-15: Book advertisements and subscription information
- All items on pages 13-15 (Two Republics ad, Books We Can Recommend section, "Almost a Woman," "Almost a Man," "Child-Confidence Rewarded," "Every-Day Dishes," tract listings) were identified as advertisements and subscription/publishing information. These have been skipped per project guidelines.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.
