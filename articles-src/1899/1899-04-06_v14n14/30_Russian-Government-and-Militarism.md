THE Russian government is blamed for its indifference in relieving the situation after the famine seven years ago. At that time $60,000,000 was voted for relief, but in four years only $22,500,000 was spent on agriculture, while in a single year $260,000,000 was spent on the army and navy. Militarism makes a government indifferent to death among its own subjects as well as among its enemies.
