## Christian Citizenship "Justified."

THE organ of the Christian Citizenship League says of that society, "We justify our existence as an organization on the ground that there is an appalling state of apathy and indifference in political and civic affairs among the people who call themselves Christians."

If this is so, and if this is a neglect of Christian duty, then it is plain that the trouble lies in the religious condition of these people; they are not real Christians. For among such, there could not be "an appalling state of apathy and indifference" toward Christian duty.

Is the League then going to make "people who call themselves Christians," but are not really such, over into real Christians? No; that is not its object; and if it were, the League would be powerless to accomplish it; for people are made Christians only by faith and the power of God. The object of the League is "To make Christian principles operative in public affairs, and to reveal Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the State and nation as well as of the individual."

There is "an appalling apathy and indifference" to Christian duty on the part of professed Christians. The Christian Citizenship League has undertaken to remedy this state of things, but without making people Christians at heart. If there is really an "appalling apathy" to Christian duty on the part of the people, how can it be remedied without a conversion of the people to Christianity? And if the "apathy" complained of is not a neglect of Christian duty, it does not need to excite any attention outside the sphere of politics. Whichever way it is viewed, therefore, it does not justify the existence of this religio-political league.
