The war in the Philippines continues, and American sons and husbands and fathers are daily giving up their lives upon that far-off soil, not to mention the greater slaughter of the natives. Almost as many Americans have been killed or wounded since the fighting began as were reported during the campaign for the capture of Santiago, in Cuba.

The American soldiers are fighting with their accustomed spirit and bravery; but for what? For America?—no foe threatens American soil; for American principles?—What principle demands the subjugation of people in Asia? for liberty?—When was liberty ever conferred from the muzzles of guns?

What is to be bought by the payment of this terrible price of blood and sorrow and ruin? What is there in all the Philippines that is worth laying one American citizen in a foreign grave, making one American woman a widow, one American child an orphan, to obtain?

Bitter enough are the first fruits of imperialism.
