NEW YORK CITY is again to be subjected to the investigations of a "Lexow" committee. So it is declared by a resolution passed in the state assembly at Albany. The committee is to probe into the raising and expenditure of a corruption fund by "Tammany Hall," and into every department of the city government.

IT is admitted that the city is in a worse state today than it was prior to the great "reform" effort of some years ago. But notwithstanding the failure of that crusade to secure permanent results, the same method is to be employed again to bring purity out of still worse corruption.

Dr. Parkhurst, who won fame in connection with the former crusade, says the investigation will do no good, and he doesn't want to see anything done now, because the city brought this evil upon itself, and ought to suffer the consequences for a year or two as a just punishment. The Republican boss and the Tammany boss worked together at the last election, and a corrupt party was put into power instead of the good party which was ready to take control and administer the affairs of the city righteously.

But what else had any person a right to expect? Is not this a Government of the people, by the people, for the people? Does not the result of a political election represent the will of the people? Can a "boss" wield political power except the people allow it?

If there is corruption in politics, must it not be the reflection of corruption in the hearts of the people? In a popular government, this must be so.

The "reform" which failed a few years ago, and the similar one now proposed, represent the old problem of trying to get pure politics out of a corrupt people—of getting a clean thing out of an unclean. Who can do this? is the query of inspiration. Surely "not one."

The leopard of city government, here or elsewhere, cannot change its spots by its own power. The stream cannot be purified below the impure fountain head. Good fruit cannot grow on a corrupt tree. The foe cannot be overcome while he finds a safe refuge in the hearts of the people.
