## The Holding of the Winds. (Rev. 7:1.)

### RELIGION, POLITICS, TRADE, PASSION.

By T. R. Williamson.

Four potencies, in might, rule all our race,
And furnish motives for each act and thought;
While Heaven restrains they move in measured pace,
And for man's service good by them is brought.
They're servitors to grace.

But when no more God's grace shall bind them fast,
When holy Angels interpose no more
To stay their raging, when love's day is past
For all rebellion, then on every shore
They'll rush in ruin, vast.

Religion is God's service if 'tis pure;
Its influence, mild, breathes o'er Earth's busy marts,
Where Fame's loud trump and Fashion's gems allure,
Or where, in gloom and squalor, burdened hearts
Wish for a sunlit shore.

It gives its benison of hope and cheer
To criminals and lepers, all who cower
'Neath Satan's loathsome scepter. Visions clear
Of manhood, social brotherhood, and power.
Enrapture eye and ear.

But if faith's just a name, its influence then,
Like lying teaching, like a toxic drink,
Unsettles more the inquiring minds of men,
And leads them, stumbling, to the fateful brink
Of error's quicksand fen.

Then not God's love but power of Satan's will,
That quarreling, scheming, smirking, lying force
That is named politics, Earth's maze of ill,
Twines with Religion, and in downward course
Each leads the other still.

With these two winds of strength that whirl and blow
O'er hosts of battle, throngs at peaceful toil,
There joins another gale, and all below
Bend to its sweep, on sea or fertile soil.
The clouds its fire-hues show.

Trade is it named; age long its hammers ring;
Its printed scrolls fly thick as Autumn leaves;
Its babel tongues, world-wide, are jargoning;
From king to clown it claims mankind as slaves.
All waves its tributes bring.

There's yet one more that with the three conjoins,
That upward sometimes, sometimes downward strives;
That roars in fury, coos in Love's soft lines;
That rends or weaves, or strikes or soothes all lives;
That sunders all or binds.

And this is Passion. All the fervent fire
Of human souls, since human-kind began;
It wields in lordliness, o'er son and sire,
O'er babe and mother, o'er the mass or man,
And to all hights aspires.

These potents four are dominant and dire,
And Satan uses them in projects dark,
With zeal, and force, and speed, that never tire,
Nor limit checks, save when a hindering mark
God sets 'gainst Satan's ire.

And back of these to push, and lash, and drive,
Linked close with Satan in his work of ill,
Are bands of demons that by ruin thrive,
Who yearn to curse, and devastate, and kill,
Who vex all souls that live.

These are the forces that await the day
When angel hands that hold, shall be withdrawn;
When Hatred's hosts shall hasten to the fray,
And Earth's illusions, like a dream, be gone.
These, each 'gainst each, shall sway.

But o'er their swirl and trouble shall resound
A victor pæan, resonant and strong.
A choral harmony from the heavens around,
As o'er the bursted graves a happy throng
Spring from Earth's trembling ground.

The King of kings, the Lord of earth and heaven
Shall then begin His ever glorious reign.
From His dear children ne'er shall joy be riven;
No foe, no terror, shall affright again.
Far off all blight is driven.

*Healdsburg, Cal.*
