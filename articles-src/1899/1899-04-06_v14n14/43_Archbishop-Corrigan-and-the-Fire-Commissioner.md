The attention of the fire commissioner of this city has been called by Archbishop Corrigan to the brave and heroic conduct of two of the city firemen at the burning of the Windsor Hotel. The archbishop does this, as he states, by request of a woman whose life was saved by these men.

But why does the fire commissioner need to have his attention called to heroic conduct on the part of the firemen? Who ought to know about such conduct better than the fire commissioner himself? The rescue was an act of such daring that it was commented on by all the papers, and even illustrated by some, and nobody who knew anything about the fire could help knowing about this incident. And even if by some chance this had missed the notice of the fire commissioner, why should the work of calling his attention to it devolve upon an official of the church? Is not the city government competent to take care of such matters as the promotion of its officers without assistance from some ecclesiastic? From the archbishop's letter we would infer that it is not.

It is, of course, good Roman Catholic doctrine that no city is competent to manage its own affairs without the advice and supervision of the church. But that doctrine is wholly out of place in American politics.
