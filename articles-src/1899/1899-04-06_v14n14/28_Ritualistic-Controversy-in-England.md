THE merits of the ritualistic controversy in England are to be brought out in an argument before the archbishops, May 8. Whatever decision is given by the archbishops respecting the questions in dispute, will, it has been agreed, be accepted by both sides in the controversy. But how can any question of right and duty toward God be submitted to the decision of a human being? This itself is the essential feature of popery; and the settlement of the controversy on this basis marks a triumph for the Romish party.
