The Russian government has made an amendment to the fifth commandment of the Decalogue, making it require the honor due to father and mother to be paid also to the officials of the government. This is the way it will hereafter be taught to the children.

Civil governments and other organizations of men, secular and ecclesiastical, have on various occasions undertaken to amend the law of God so as to supply omissions and oversights on the part of its Author, as they appear to the minds of the human critics. Such an act, of course, means an assumption of equality with God.

But is it any worse for the Russian government to presume to change the fifth commandment, than for the papacy to presume to change the fourth so as to make it require the observance of the first day of the week, or for Protestants to acquiesce in this arrangement?
