## The Japanese State Religion.

A DETROIT (Mich.) journal gives the following particulars of the report, mentioned recently in our columns, that Japan was considering the advisability of adopting Christianity as the State religion. The dispatch is dated "New York, March 11," and says:—

"Dispatches from Tokio received in this city to day bring the startling intelligence that the Japanese government is discussing a plan to make Christianity the religion of the empire.

"The news from Tokio foreshadows an attempt to make 43,000,000 people Christians by imperial proclamation.

"Persons interested in foreign missions will be anxious to learn whether the government of the land of the crysanthemum, if it decides in favor of a Christian country, will adopt the dogmas of any particular Christian sect, or whether it will permit the people to construct their own State religion from the teachings of the Bible.

"It is explained in the dispatches from Tokio that the wise men of Japan, the statesmen, have come to the conclusion that Christianity makes for progress. They have got trolley cars, silk hats, corsets, and gas stoves, and they have defeated the Chinese in battle; but the mikado's advisers believe that without the Christian religion Japan will never earn a place in the sisterhood of civilized nations."

It seems a pity, if this report be true, that Christian missionaries to Japan should not have so represented Christianity to the people of that country that the Japanese authorities would understand that Christians cannot be created by "imperial proclamation," and that there is no truly Christian nation on the earth to-day. Of course, in the event of a decision by the Japanese government in favor of Christianity, there will be a contest between Catholics and Protestants, and between the Protestant sects, to have the respective doctrines held by them incorporated into the "Christianity" of the nation,—a contest which must lower Christianity in the eyes of the Japanese and greatly retard true missionary work.

The idea of national Christianity is one that never bears good fruit. It misrepresents Christianity to the heathen world.
