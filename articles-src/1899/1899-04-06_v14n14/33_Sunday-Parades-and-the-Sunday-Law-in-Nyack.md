## Sunday Parades and the Sunday Law in Nyack, N. Y.

New York "World."

ABRAHAM MYERS, the newly elected president of the village of Nyack, and Rev. W. J. Leggett, pastor of the Nyack Dutch Reformed Church, have suddenly incurred the displeasure of the citizens of the place.

Nyack sent twenty-seven young men to the war, all in the Twelfth New York Regiment. Ten of the soldiers arrived home on Sunday night. They were welcomed at the depot by hundreds of citizens, who fired cannon and small arms. A drum corps headed an impromptu procession up the main street, preceding the soldiers, who were followed by citizens.

The Rev. Mr. Leggett was preaching in his church, his congregation not being as large as usual.

Mr. Leggett heard the sound of the drums and the cheers of the people. He stopped his sermon, and addressing President Myers, who occupied a front pew, said:

"Mr. President, Is this to be allowed on the Sabbath?"

President Myers replied: "It is the soldiers coming back."

"I don't care who it is," said the minister. "It must be stopped, and you must stop it."

President Myers half ran out of the church, shouting, "Stop! Stop!" Some of the congregation laughed and the majority were indignant. A few left the church.

President Myers ordered the men to stop making so much noise. There were hisses and jeers and angry words. Then the president called upon Chief of Police Curran to disperse the parade and to stop the drum corps. This was done.

Members of Mr. Leggett's congregation do not uphold him, and it may cause trouble in the church. A public reception is to be held to the returned soldiers in a few days, and neither President Myers nor Mr. Leggett will be invited to be present.
