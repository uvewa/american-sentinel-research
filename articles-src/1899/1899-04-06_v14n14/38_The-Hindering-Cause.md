## The Hindering Cause.

"Signs of the Times."

THE Chicago New World (Catholic), in speaking of the matter of Protestant evangelistic work in Porto Rico, says, "The days when Protestantism was able to make numerous converts from Catholicism have long since passed away." There is some ground for this statement; and it speaks volumes of warning to the various Protestant denominations, a warning to get back—or rather go forward again—to the basic principles of Protestantism, of true Christianity. There was a vast gulf between Protestantism and Catholicism when the Reformation was in its youth, and, notwithstanding that gulf, converts to Protestantism,—to Christianity from Catholicism,—were many. Why have they not continued? The reason is obvious. The gulf has been narrowing, and certain influential denominations have been stretching their hands across to Rome. What use is there in becoming a Protestant if one must reach back to Rome for succor?

Let the Protestant denominations of the world unite in this one thing, a determination to cease meddling in the politics of the world, and stand squarely for a separation of religion from the civil affairs of their countries. Then will they be on the road again to true, vivified Protestantism. Let them, like a growing tree, snap the cords of man-made creeds that human hands have bound about them to stifle their progress in things divine, and give themselves the chance to grow that God always designed they should have, turning again to "the Bible and the Bible only" for their rules of faith and practice; then look to God, and not to any human government, for the help and strength necessary to carry on their work. Then will they have success; then will they have the blessing of God; then will they win converts not only from Catholicism but from every form of error, and from every benighted region in the world; then will they be Protestants indeed, working God's will in the earth. And may God grant that many of them will do this right speedily.
