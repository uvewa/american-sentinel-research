## Christian Endeavorers in Politics.

[The following, dated "Cleveland, March 30," appears in the New York Press, of the 31st:—]

The Christian Endeavor Society, the largest, perhaps, of Protestant Church organizations, has deliberately gone into politics here. The Cleveland societies have formed a Christian Citizenship Committee, of which E. J. Hart is chairman, and this committee is out in the open for John Farley, Democrat, for mayor, and against Mayor McKisson, who is running for re-election on the Republican ticket. The election will take place on Monday.

The committee is sending broadcast the following letter:—

"Dear Endeavorers: We are in the midst of the most important civic campaign known in this city for years; consequently this is the crisis hour for Christian citizenship work. The first great commandment in this work is, Thou shalt be a well-informed citizen. Every Endeavorer must know the truth, and the truth will make him free to think; then we are confident he will be free to act when he votes.

"It is a well-known fact that we have a wide-open town for saloons, gambling houses and brothels. The 2,100 saloon-keepers in Cleveland are a privileged class of law-breakers, and our Sunday liquor laws are a nullity. Gambling dens boast of police protection. Hardly a brick is laid or an improvement made without charges of corruption. These are things worthy of our consideration. It is said to be a safe rule 'to overthrow evil in power.'

"Your Central Christian Citizenship Committee has taken considerable pains to investigate the fitness of the candidates who are asking for our suffrage, and will most cheerfully supply full information. If you do not know the attitude of the candidates for council in your district write us for data.

"As we enter upon this new year of work let us make it count for civic righteousness and Christian citizenship. Be able to say, 'Thy kingdom come' as you vote."

McKisson is said to be close to Senator Foraker and an enemy of President McKinley and Senator Hanna. The Y. M. C. A. is not so daring in its politics as the Endeavorers, but it has permitted a political meeting to be held in the Y. M. C. A. building.

The action taken by the Christian Endeavor Society of Cleveland may fairly be taken as a sample of what will be done sooner or later by this society, and by similar religious organizations, the country over; and it may be safely said that these powerful organizations will be able to exercise a controlling influence upon state and national politics. That is their aim, and in it they have the sympathy and will have the aid of the church in general. Even the Catholic Church will join in the movement, because the principle of church control in civil affairs is one the papacy has cherished for a thousand years.

And then we shall have practical "Christian citizenship"—citizenship enforcing religion, politics ruled by the church; in short, a practical theocracy. With the Christian Endeavorers and kindred religious societies, and with the church, religion is the primary consideration; and in politics, religion will be with them the primary object still.
