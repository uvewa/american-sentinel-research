## Union of Church and State Condemned by the Old Testament.

BY B. W. NOEL, M.A.*

[THE following, while it was written with particular reference to the Anglican union of church and state, applies with equal force to the union sought to be established in the United States, since the two cannot but be similar in all essential features.]

### THE UNION CONDEMNED BY THE MOSAIC LAW.

Advocates of the union between church and state often appeal on its behalf to the law and practice of the Old Testament. By an express provision of the Mosaic code a tithe of the land's produce was set apart for the maintenance of the priests and Levites. From which they argue thus:—If the payment of tithes was then made obligatory by law, it may be made obligatory by law still; what was then morally right can not now be morally wrong; and therefore a national provision for the ministers of religion has the direct sanction of God. . . . This alleged Jewish precedent, instead of justifying the English union between the church and state, most unequivocably condemns it.

As the Mosaic law is expressly abrogated, its institutions were clearly judged by their divine author to be unfitted for the more spiritual and more universal religion of Christ. And to imprison Christian doctrine within Jewish ordinances, would be to put new wine into old bottles, which was what our Lord declared he did not intend to do. If, therefore, there had been a union between the church and the state enacted by the Mosaic law, I should see in it no proof that such union was allowed by the law of Christ. But there was, in fact, no such union between the priesthood and the government; and, on the contrary, the enactments of the Jewish law were such as distinctly to condemn the union which now exists in this country.

1. In England, the ministers of the Establishment are maintained by taxes, imposed by the state, in the form of rent-charges; and ecclesiastical buildings are maintained by another tax, under the form of church-rates, these taxes being imposed not by the authority of God, but by the authority of the state. In Israel tithes were imposed, not by the authority of the state, but by the command of God, there being no royal tax whatever for the support of religion; and the temple and all the synagogues in the land were built and repaired by voluntary contributions.

2. In England the state, in consequence of its maintenance of the ministers and the buildings of the Establishment, assumes a control over it, allows or forbids its synods, ratifies or rejects its canons, and passes what ecclesiastical laws it pleases for the regulation of the churches. In Israel the state could issue no ecclesiastical enactment whatever. The prince was governed by the following law: "It shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests and the Levites; and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them." One of these statutes, to which he was bound to pay obedience, was as follows: "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God as I command you." So that he was expressly forbidden to introduce the slightest change, or to make the least addition to the precepts of the divine law. There is accordingly no trace of any ecclesiastical statute passed by any one of the Jewish kings. The chief magistrate did not possess the right of exercising the least control over the creed, worship, or church discipline of the nation. He might make what civil and fiscal regulations he pleased, but must not in any respect interfere with the worship of God. In religion they were to obey God alone. The only apparent exception to this general fact, in reality, confirms it. For David, indeed, determined the form of the temple which was to be built at Sion; but this he did as a prophet, not as a king, under the influence of divine inspiration, not by royal prerogative. No human authority had any right to interfere with the creed, worship, or discipline of the Jewish congregation; but in England the state has formed a large body of ecclesiastical laws, by which the churches are governed. Each session adds some new enactment to the portentous mass; and to a great extent church duties are regulated by the statute-book.

3. During the Mosaic economy God himself appointed the high priest, the priests, and the inferior ministers of religion. And the priests being thus made wholly independent of the king and the government, no change in the government made any change of the priesthood. Thus, when Rehoboam succeeded Solomon, he could not raise one favorite to the priesthood, nor displace one of the priests appointed by God; the succession of the ministers, as well as their duties, was appointed by God, and the sovereign could not interfere; but in England the state has the nomination of the prelates, these have the right of ordaining the clergy, and from among these, lay patrons, determined by a money qualification alone, are empowered by the state to select the pastors of the churches; so that the pastors of the churches are mainly determined by the state.

In Israel the incomes of the priests were settled without the authority of the state; in England their incomes are furnished by the authority of the state alone.

In Israel the priests were determined by God; in England the prelates are nominated by the state.

In Israel kings and nobles could raise no unfit person to ministry; in England patrons can practically secure their livings to any of their nominees who have fair capacity and good morals.

In Israel no congregation had a pastor imposed on them by the state; in England nearly all the churches have pastors so imposed upon them.

Since, therefore, during the Mosaic economy, God so guarded the priesthood that no one could enter it except by his express appointment, and the state had no power whatever in the matter, he has thereby condemned the union through which the state, without his authority, assumes the appointment of the ministers of a much more spiritual religion.

4. By the Mosaic law all the Jewish citizens were religiously equal. The state created no rivalry by exalting one sect above another, so that when the great festivals gathered together the devout worshipers of God from every place, they met as a holy brotherhood, without any of the sources of jealousy arising from civil distinctions established by law. But in the English union, one among several sects, equally evangelical, is placed by the state above all the rest, whereby jealousy and division are excited in the Christian family. The Mosaic system treated all the worshipers of God as on perfect equality: the Anglican system unjustly exalts one sect, and depresses all the rest. In Scotland the Presbyterian is exalted, the Episcopalian is depressed; in England the Episcopalian is exalted, the Presbyterian depressed. In both parts of the kingdom, therefore, the system is so opposite to the Mosaic, that if the latter was agreeable to his will, the former must be opposed to it.

5. The Mosaic law allowed of no compulsory payments for the support of religion. As God commanded his people to love him with all their heart, so he commanded them to pay a tithe of the land to the Levites. But as the magistrate could not compel the Israelite to obey the first of these commands, so he could not compel obedience to the second. In both cases the conscience of the worshiper was the only allowed compulsion; no legal process was appointed for the recovery of the tithes by the priests; no magistrate was empowered to collect them; and as the Almighty forbade that any additions should be made to the Mosaic law, no law to enforce their payment could be passed afterward. Accordingly their payment throughout the Jewish history was voluntary. . . . The support of religion would be degraded if it ceased to be spontaneous: spontaneous zeal paid tithe; spontaneous contributions first built and then repaired both the tabernacle and the temple; and if the sovereigns of Judea contributed to these works, it was from their private property, and not from any public fund raised by the taxation of their subjects. By thus securing in the Mosaic economy that all such payments should be free, not even allowing the priests to obtain their tithes by any legal process, God has condemned all compulsory payments for the support of religion. But with us the state, having granted to the clergy their rent-charges and their church-rates, enforces the payment of them; and if any reluctant non-conformist refuses payment, it is extorted by distraint. Our system, therefore, rests upon the compulsory payments which God has by the Mosaic law condemned.

6. In all their great features, the Mosaic and the Anglican systems for the maintenance of religion are directly opposed; and as the one has the sanction of the Almighty, the other must be contrary to his will. The Mosaic separation of the church and state condemns our union of the two, whatever the character of the state may be. Our system would remain unscriptural and mischievous if administered by kings like David and by statesmen like Daniel; but it becomes more glaringly opposed to the practice of the Old Testament when we consider that it is administered by a state which is irreligious. What part did ungodily kings take, by divine appointment, in the religious affairs of the Jews? In what degree were Saul and Manasseh commissioned to superintend the creed, the worship, or the discipline of the church of God in their kingdom? They had nothing to do with it. Had there been a union like ours, it would have subsisted through each successive reign, whatever might be the character of the sovereign: the church would have been as much united to Saul as to David, to Rehoboam as to Solomon, to Manasseh as to Hezekiah; but it was not in the least united to either of these three ungodly princes. They had no episcopate to discharge, no right to interfere; the system was complete without their aid, and went on as if they had not been in existence.

According, therefore, to the precedents of the Old Testament, whatever influence might be allowed to a pious state, an irreligious state ought to have none; but our state in its most powerful member representing an irreligious majority, must generally be irreligious: and as the Mosaic system excluded the irreligious king from all control over the priesthood, so the English system ought to exclude an irreligious House of Commons from all control over the ministers of the churches. If, when the people were ignorant and barbarous, God would not permit irreligious kings to exercise any control over the religion of the country, much less does he permit an irreligious state to control the churches of instructed and enlightened Christians. If in the mere carnal dispensation he appointed a system where every detail was regulated by himself, and the expenditure was sustained spontaneously by the people, much more in this dispensation of the Spirit must he require that the churches follow exclusively the directions of his word, and spontaneously provide for the maintenance of his worship.
