A few years ago a great stir was made about official corruption in this city, and a crusade, led by the famous Lexow Committee and Dr. Parkhurst, was inaugurated to remedy the evil. The city was put under new political control, and stringent regulations were passed for the suppression of rampant evils. For a time a great triumph seemed to have been won, and Dr. Parkhurst became the most famous clergyman in the country. The outflowing evil was checked; but the stream was only dammed up.

What was the result? The impure source kept on giving out its corruption, the stream began to overflow, and finally burst the barrier and swept everything before it. Dr. Parkhurst himself now admits that the city is more corrupt than it ever was before; and the State Assembly at Albany has decided that another investigation must be had similar to that conducted by the Lexow Committee. But Dr. Parkhurst says it will do no good. And in this he is right.

It will do no good to dam up the stream; it is the cleansing of the stream alone that can make things permanently better. And as long as clergymen stick to their proper business of preaching to the people the gospel of salvation from sin, they will be doing infinitely more to promote the cause of good government than they possibly can do as lobbyists in the legislatures and allies of the politicians.
