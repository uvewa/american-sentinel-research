## Administering Civil Government Upon the Basis of the Bible.

The demand of the religio-political "reform" movement sweeping over the land is that "the revealed will of God" be made the "highest authority in civil affairs." Let us imagine a scene in court when the Government shall have been put upon this basis.

A prisoner is brought before the magistrate for the customary hearing. Policeman having the prisoner in custody states the crime for which he is under arrest.

Magistrate (to prisoner): Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

Prisoner: Guilty, your honor; but I am very sorry, your honor, and ask to be forgiven.

Magistrate: The Scriptures being now our authority in civil procedure, I will ask my friend the Rev. Mr. A, who is familiar with the sacred volume, to read from it the regulations which apply in the case.

Clergyman (reading): "If thy brother trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him." Luke 17:3, 4.

Magistrate (to prisoner): You say that you repent of your trespass, do you?

Prisoner: I do, your honor.

Magistrate: Then the State forgives you; you are discharged.

Very efficient such a regime would be in repressing crime, would it not!
