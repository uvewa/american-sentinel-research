NEWS has come to the world of a terrible famine in Russia, having up to the present time been suppressed by strict censorship of the Russian press. The calamity extends over the whole of four great provinces to the east of the Volga, and millions of the peasant population are its victims. The cause is a failure of crops, said to be more complete than that of the great famine year 1891-2. The Russian Red Cross society reports that 23 per cent of the people must die unless supported by private charity.
