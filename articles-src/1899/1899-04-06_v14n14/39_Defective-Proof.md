**Defective "Proof."**

As proof that "this is a Christian nation," it is often cited that this country was discovered by a Roman Catholic, that it was first colonized by the "Pilgrim Fathers," that Roger Williams and William Penn were founders of two of the early colonies, that other settlements were made by religious men, that George Washington prayed at Valley Forge, that the Presidents in their official utterances have often referred to religion, that all the States have had Sunday laws, etc. Admitting for the sake of argument that all these things constituted evidences of Christianity, they still come very far short of warranting the conclusion named. Suppose we inquire how many things there are in the history of this nation which indicate the opposite of Christianity. Can anyone doubt but that as many or even more acts and utterances might be cited of an opposite character to those relied on for proof of the nation's Christianity?

Columbus, for example, enslaved the helpless natives of the West Indies, pursued them with bloodhounds and put hundreds of them to a cruel death. Plainly, therefore, Columbus was not a Christian, and this country was not discovered by a Christian.

The Puritans settled New England; but with their pious customs may also be cited their cruel persecution of Baptists and Quakers. Is the proof to be drawn from them for, or against, Christianity?

George Washington prayed at Valley Forge, it is said. But if this be proof of the nation's Christianity, what is proved by the fact that the same person was known to utter profane oaths?

If religious forms, religious laws, and official religious proclamations are evidence of national Christianity, what is evidenced by the practice of the great majority of the people in disregarding such laws and proclamations?

What is evidenced by the fact that not only in society generally, but even in the orthodox Church, there is habitual disregard of the day believed to be the Christian Sabbath, to an extent which elicits loud complaints from Christian ministers?

In short, if the professions of the people are generally favorable to Christianity, for how much does this count against practices which must be called unchristian, in establishing the claim of Christian character for the nation?

To have a measure of respect for Christianity, to conform more or less to Christian observances and customs, or even to profess Christianity, does not make this a Christian nation. It is the life that testifies of Christianity, or of the lack of it. Christianity is nothing less than the life of Christ—Christ dwelling in human flesh on the earth, as he did long ago in Judea. Is the nation, then, judged by the lives of its people,—not only by their words, but by their actions which speak louder, and by their evil deeds as well as their good ones—a Christian nation? From no other standpoint of judgment can this question be fairly or truly determined.
