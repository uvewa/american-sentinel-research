FOR creating a disturbance in a church of Barnegat, N. J., two young boys were recently brought before a magistrate and sentenced to ten days in jail. The offense was doubtless deserving of punishment; but it is just as certain that nothing was gained for the church or for religion by an appeal to the courts. A lawyer who met the boys on their way to jail said of the case: "The sentence was an outrage. It cannot help the cause of religion. Both boys said that they'd never go to church again, and I think that the forty or fifty boys who went to the railroad station with them will keep out of that particular church in future."
