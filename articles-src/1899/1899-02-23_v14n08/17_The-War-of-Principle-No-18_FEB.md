## The War of Principle.—No. 18.

"I AM all ready now for your revelation," said Cecil. "I had no idea the church was seeking for civil power, and do not see how it could get civil power any way, inasmuch as it would be unconstitutional. How is it, Aleck?"

"Surely, Cecil, you cannot be ignorant of the protracted efforts that have been manifested for years by the pastors of Christian churches! Have you not heard them preaching on the need of putting Christian men in office, and of enforcing religious observances—especially Sunday-keeping?"

"Now, you speak of it, of course I have; but I never paid any particular attention to that. I supposed they had always preached like that, because they were expected to rant against corrupt rulers and non-religion. But what of it, Aleck? It surely doesn't mean anything serious."

"Indeed it does. Your indifference, or lack of appreciation of the matter, is one of the most serious dangers, because you stand for a large class who are in the same condition. Meanwhile, the movement for the union of church and state is sweeping on like a torrent."

"What church, Aleck? Is it the old mother persecutor?"

"Whatever church or churches are in it, the movement carries with it the old spirit and danger. I tell you, Cecil, it is high time you and all others were wakening out of sleep if you love liberty and want to preserve what the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution has so far guaranteed."

"You don't say. Come, tell me who is in this. Are there any organizations to see the scheme carried through?"

"Yes, a very large number. The National Reform party, the Christian Citizenship League, the Christian Endeavor societies, the W. C. T. U., the Y. M. C. A., the Sabbath Observance Society, and no end of others."

"But, Aleck, are you sure it is for this end they are organized? Do they see what there is in their movement? Where will it hit if it does succeed?"

"Some of them see clearly where the movement tends. Many do not. Where will it hit? It will hit the living truth. It will hit every man's right to worship God according to the dictates of his conscience."

"But, Aleck, how can such a scheme succeed in America?"

"How? Why, by educating public sentiment. This is being done vigorously. Public sentiment with sufficient money rules the polls."

"Oh, I can see the manner in which it is to be done; but through what issue?"

"The Sunday-law issue, Cecil."

"But, Aleck, what harm can come of that? Religious people, of course, want to keep Sunday. Workingmen ought to be assured of one day of rest, and the lawless hordes would be made to be more civilized if they had to keep Sunday. That issue does not hit very hard."

"Cecil, I'm disappointed. After all our talks, you are still as blind as a bat."

"Well, help me to see."

"Whose day is the Sabbath day?"

"The Lord's."

"Very well. To whom then shall we render it?"

"To the Lord, of course."

"Then shall we appeal to force to see it observed? Can we not depend on God to take care of his own—his own day and his own children?"

"We ought to, surely. Of course law cannot make Sabbath-keeping anything to God, but it can make it the means of something to Caesar."

"But it is nothing to Caesar. It belongs wholly to God, and will be kept in spite of Caesar by those who love God. As for making others keep it, you certainly use force for the making of hypocrites, and if that will do Caesar any good I'd like to know how. Honesty is the best policy for Caesar, and for Caesar's subjects."

"How does it hit the truth?" asked Cecil, thought fully. "You said awhile back, that there was always a rallying of the foe against truth. How does this rally against truth in any other way than against the general principle of man's right to be left free to worship or not worship as he pleases."

"The principle in this principle is the target of this movement, and the movement is rallying its forces to overthrow the principle of equality before the law of the State; for this Sunday law will discriminate unjustly between classes."

"Yes, I should say! The Jews, for instance—and Seventh-day Baptists."

"Not only these religious dissenters, but those who do not believe in Sunday, and would just as soon work or go fishing on Sunday as Monday."

"If they put in a toleration plank it would have to be so wide that the law would be crowded to the wall; for everybody that slights Sunday would go over on the toleration basis. Aleck, these people are on the wrong side. I can see it."

"I am glad you see it. But Cecil, you are not yet on the right side. You have told me several times that if I could prove to you that you needed divine aid, you would come to God, renouncing yourself."

"Yes," said Cecil, in a low tone. "Indeed, Aleck, I have renounced self as far as I know how."

"Then here is your test. Sunday is not the Sabbath day. God's law says, 'The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.' In view of your need of divine aid, when the world is rallying against this living truth, what are you going to do?"
