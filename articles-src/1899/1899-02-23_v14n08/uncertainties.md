# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, February 23, 1899 (v14n08)

## OCR Transcription Issues

### Page 5, Poem "The Power of Love vs. the Love of Power"
- **Uncertainty:** Line 9 reads "He henled the sick" — likely an OCR error for "He healed the sick"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "He henled the sick" (preserving OCR text exactly as it appears; cannot verify against original scan)
- **Confidence:** LOW — "henled" is almost certainly a scan/OCR artifact for "healed"
- **Reason:** The context (raising the dead, healing the sick) and rhythm of the poem strongly suggest "healed." However, since this is from OCR and the original cannot be directly checked here, the text is preserved as rendered by OCR.

### Page 10–11, Extended Editorial (filed as "All Men Are Created Free")
- **Uncertainty:** This section has no title in the original. It appears as a series of paragraphs separated by `* * *` dividers, functioning as a unified editorial essay.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Grouped into a single file with the descriptive title "All Men Are Created Free" (drawn from the opening sentence)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the editorial intent seems unified, but it is possible these were separate individual items.

### Page 6, "Separation of Religion from the State Taught by Christ"
- **Uncertainty:** Attribution. The byline reads "By B. W. Noel, M. A., Clergyman of the Church of England." No source publication is given in the OCR. This is clearly an external author (B. W. Noel, 19th-century English Baptist minister), so it is a reprint, but the original work is not named.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** `attribution: "reprint"` with no `original_publication` field (source publication not identified in OCR)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — clearly a reprint of an external work, but source title is unknown from OCR alone.

### Page 13, "The War of Principle.—No. 18"
- **Uncertainty:** Author initials "F. E. B." at end of article are not in the known authors list.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** `author_short: "FEB"` — not a known Sentinel staff member; possibly a contributing writer using initials.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the initials themselves; LOW for full name identification.

### Page 14, "CHURCH AND STATE IN FILI." (OCR page header)
- **Uncertainty:** The OCR page header reads "CHURCH AND STATE IN FILI." which appears truncated — the full article title is "CHURCH AND STATE IN FIJI." confirmed by the article content (location: Suva, Fiji).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "CHURCH AND STATE IN FIJI." — the running header was cut off by OCR at "FILI."
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### General Note: Author "A. Smith"
- **Uncertainty:** "A. Smith" appears as author of both "The Way of Cain" and "Will It Pay?" in this issue. This may be the same contributor or two different persons with the same name/initials.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — both articles bear "A. SMITH" as explicit attribution.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for attribution; MEDIUM for identity (could be same person or coincidence).
