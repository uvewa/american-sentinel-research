## Cuba for the Cubans.

Chicago "Times-Herald."

IF Archbishop Ireland, as the representative of the pope, is working for the annexation of Cuba to the United States, his labors are already defeated by an anticipatory veto of the Congress and of the President. The question is settled definitely for the present according to the demands of honor and justice, and the only value of further discussion is in making the terms of the settlement so clear that we may escape the annoyance of the agitation for annexation in so far as it proceeds from this country.

The resolutions adopted by Congress recognized the independence of the people of Cuba as a fact and as a right. They then provided for the interposition of the United States to force the recognition upon Spain, and closed with a disclaimer on the part of this Government of "any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except for the pacification thereof," and the assertion of a determination when that was accomplished "to leave the government and control of the island to its people."

In his message the President refers to these resolutions and gives evidence of his earnest resolve to construe them strictly and to hold the country to its well-defined obligations. He says that after the pacification we should aid the Cubans to form a government with the greatest possible dispatch. "Spanish rule," he declares, "must be replaced by a just, benevolent, and humane government, created by the people of Cuba." We are merely to help in "realizing the best aspirations of the Cuban people."

Nothing is said here about those "Cubans of prosperity" or those Spaniards of landed and commercial interests, for whom, we are informed, the archbishop speaks. Most of them opposed the resolution, and in any case the President uses consistently that broad term "the people." Himself a man of the people and the chief executive of the most powerful popular government in the world, he does not propose to be led into arguments which would distort the term out of its true meaning. His position is that we gave a solemn pledge and that we gave it to all Cubans. They are now to be the arbiters of their own destiny.

There is no other honorable position for the people of the United States to assume. They should not permit themselves to be confused by analogies drawn from the history of South American republics. They should not stultify themselves by proclaiming that the people whose independence they have acknowledged and secured are not fit for independence. They should not aid in bringing about the failure of the Cuban republic by predicting and anticipating it.

Finally, if they entertain the proposition for annexation at all, it should be upon the indisputable initiative of the Cubans themselves unless a frightful chaos shall again make interposition necessary. These are problems of the future to be solved in the future. Having freed them from the barren tyranny of Spain, the United States will employ the best offices of friendship to assist the emancipated Cubans in their experiment in civil liberty and self-government.
