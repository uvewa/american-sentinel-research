## Will It Pay?

PERHAPS no question in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Philippines will more naturally arise in the American mind than the financial one, "Will it pay?"

When we place in the great balance sheet of American commerce with the Philippines under self-government, or even under German or English domination, our credit in trade; and then institute a comparison of profits under American occupancy, charging up the immense cost of maintaining an army and navy in the islands, will it prove to have been a paying investment?

It is probable that England and Germany would offer no serious objections to the scheme, for it would be much cheaper for them to pay for an occasional ride upon the back of the Philippine elephant than to pay his purchase price, and then be at the cost of taming and feeding him.

Will it pay to maintain in an enervating tropical climate a standing army and navy composed of the highest physical type of American manhood to whom the endearments of home and the peaceful pursuits of industry in domestic life are just as dear as they are to those who control the mechanism of diplomacy and of war? The dreadful home-sickness, made doubly drear by the thought that wide intervening leagues of sea would forbid otherwise possible kindred ministrations in the dying hour, and then to be laid in a foreign grave unmoistened by the tears of mother, is grief almost beyond endurance.

It is said that home-sickness in the army kills more men than do the bullets of the enemy. Will it pay?

Will it pay for the American ship of State to throw overboard her charter of liberty under which she has sailed with majesty for more than a hundred years, and enter upon a piratical career of conquest among the weaker peoples of the earth? If, for policy's sake, we sacrifice a single fundamental principle of our Government, it will not be long before every such principle that has made us the greatest nation in the world will be repudiated, and we will sink to the low level of destiny that a violated faith will surely entail. Will it pay?

The Government of the United States having stricken the Spanish shackles from the hands of the Filipinos, has thereby placed that people under obligation, which they would no doubt acknowledge, to respect the kindly offices of their deliverer in assisting them to form a free republican government that would command the respect of the nations of the world. The policy would be a worthy one, and would revert in blessing upon this nation. It would pay.
