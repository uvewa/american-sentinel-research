## "The Way of Cain."

BY A. SMITH.

WHEN the two representative sons of Adam brought an offering to the Lord, God had respect to Abel's offering, because it was according to his own divine arrangement in the plan of salvation. The lamb he offered foreshadowed the Lamb of God, the Saviour of the world.

Cain brought of the fruits of the ground an offering, no doubt just as costly, and just as free from natural blemishes as was the offering of Abel; but it was not according to God's order, and it was therefore rejected. Cain became angry with his brother, because he persisted in worshiping God contrary to his own idea of service, and "slew him."

There is a small class of Christians at the present day who bring an offering of spiritual service to God on a day divinely appointed to be kept holy, the seventh day, according to the fourth commandment. There is still another, larger, class, who bring a like offering to God, but on another day that the Lord has never appointed as holy time, while they ignore the day he has declared to be his, and to be holy unto the Lord. A class of those who observe the first day as the Sabbath hate those who observe the seventh day, and take the club of civil law of their own framing, and with it attempt to beat their seventh-day brethren into adopting their own ideas of worshiping God. In this thing they have "gone in the way of Cain" (Jude 11), who stood in his day for a union of church and state.

Paul says of Christians, "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal." 2 Cor. 10:4. Those professed Christians, therefore, who use the carnal weapon of civil law to coerce their brethren, or anybody, proclaim thereby, as did Cain, on which side of the controversy they stand.
