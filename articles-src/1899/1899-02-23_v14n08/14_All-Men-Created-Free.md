ALL men are created free. This proposition follows necessarily from the familiar and well established proposition that all men are created equal. Equals do not rule over one another. When they attempt to do so—when some deny that others are entitled to freedom equally with themselves—they first deny the proposition that all men are created equal. This proposition is denied in the United States to-day, and for this reason.

EVEN the lower orders of animals are created free. None of them rule over the others. Nature makes no provision for slavery. Only man provides for such a thing and affirms its necessity. All animals are happiest in the enjoyment of freedom, and this is true without reference to the degree of intelligence by which the exercise of that freedom may be directed. Freedom is just as essential to the welfare of the lower orders of animals as to the higher orders, including man himself. The instinctive love of freedom is universal, and attests that freedom is everywhere the law of nature and the will of Him who speaks through nature.

REVELATION testifies the same thing, and is equally explicit. "One is your Master," said Jesus Christ, "and all ye are brethren." He said this to his disciples; and he wills that every person on earth shall be his disciple. In this saying he expressed his will for all. He would have all men recognize each other as brethren. That, if it were so, would effectually prevent the domination of a part over the rest; for nobody wants to rule or govern one whom he recognizes as a brother.

AND this truth, that freedom is the will of the Creator for all men, and that in denying freedom to any people men are going contrary to the Creator and Ruler of all things, and must therefore at some time in their course inevitably meet disaster, was never more pertinent in human affairs than just now, and in this very land whose long-standing guaranties of freedom are being subjected to interpretations which completely alter their old-time meaning. It is asserted now that nothing in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, or any other document or principle of American government, forbids or conflicts with the idea that the American people must hold some other people in subjection: and that the relation of master and subject must be set up between the American people and an inferior race living on certain islands of the sea, for the good of both rulers and subjects, and especially the subjects.

THIS sentiment was strongly advocated in a recent speech by Governor Roosevelt, in which he presented the subject of "expansion" in its most favorable light. We must make the Filipinos feel, he said "that we are their masters." Not to do so would be an unpardonable mistake on the part of this Government. That would be for their own good, and for the good of all parties. In that way only could the United States fulfill its mission in the Philippines, and the people of those islands receive the blessings of liberty and peace. This policy the Government is now actually pursuing, and to this it will no doubt adhere until the Filipinos do feel and acknowledge that they are not their own masters, but the subjects of masters living in a distant land across the sea.

HOW THESE people, or any people, are ever to learn to be their own masters, by being forced into the position of subjects, is not clear; and no advocate of this policy ever tries to explain it. He would be hopelessly at a loss for any source from which to draw a sound argument; for neither history, reason, nor revelation furnish anything in its support. The individual must be emancipated, not enslaved, in order to learn self government. This proposition lies at the very foundation of the gospel, and is true unless the gospel is false. The gospel emancipates men. It makes every man master of himself. And wherever men yield to the gospel, wherever gospel influences prevail, there is no obstacle in the way of self-government, whether in the continent of North America, or the islands of the sea.

IT is argued, however, that the Filipinos cannot be assimilated to the American Government, and that since they cannot become participants in it, they must be made subjects of it. And it is true enough that they cannot be assimilated to such a government as that of the United States. Of course they cannot! and why should any such thing be attempted? But that is no reason for making them subjects of the United States; that is no reason for making them feel that somebody else is their master; that is no reason for concluding that they cannot have a republican government of their own. Freedom is not incompatible with simplicity, but quite the reverse. Let them govern themselves in their own simple way, with such friendly assistance as the great American republic can give them; and let the missionaries from more Christian lands go among them, not in the name and under the guns of their respective governments, but in the name and in the power of the Prince of Peace, teaching the golden rule and the gospel precept of respect for the unalienable rights which are the gift of the Creator. Let not men deny to their fellowmen made in God's image, that which God does not deny to the lowest beasts of the field.
