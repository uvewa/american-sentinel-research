## CHURCH AND STATE IN FIJI.

BY J. E. FULTON.

AFTER having applied in regular order to the Fiji government for a piece of native land to be used for mission purposes, we received notice to appear before the native commissioner. He said he wished to inform us that there were already two denominations in Fiji, viz., Wesleyans and Catholics; that there had been considerable friction between them; and disputes which had arisen thereby have had to be settled on several occasions by the government authorities. It was further stated that it was not a desirable thing that any other denomination should take up work among the natives if there was a likelihood of more trouble to the government.

On one occasion, I am informed, some native students in one of the mission schools had complained of overwork, and because an awning which covered the missionary who sat in the stern of the boat was not extended so as to shade them who did the rowing in the forward part of the boat. The governor was called in at last to decide upon the matter.

A difficulty lies in the fact that the Fijians are not regarded as men, but as children. Though intelligent and showing a lower percentage of illiteracy than many long-civilized countries, they may be compared to a family of 120,000 children of whom the officers of the government are the guardians. If a full-grown native wishes to visit the neighboring town, he must obtain the privilege from an officer. It is related that the king of Fiji, after presenting Great Britain with his kingdom, was afterward refused the privilege of visiting outside of it.

The government has passed a law to the effect that young men desiring to enter a mission school of any denomination must obtain permission from a chief who is a government official. If this chief is favorable to the religious body who has the mission school, his permission is easy to obtain.

Suva, Fiji.
