## The Power of Love vs. the Love of Power.

Two mighty kings of great renown
Once came to rule a certain town;
The one was gentle, kind, and good—
A blessing to the neighborhood;
The other one, as all allowed,
Was stern and cold and harsh and proud.
The one came from the realms above,—
This was his name: "The Power of Love."
And, strange, indeed, the other's name
Sounded, I'm thinking, much the same.
I heard him lauded every hour,
And people call him: "Love of Power."

Now, "Love of Power" grew rich and great,
He dwelt in ease, he dined in state,
While men of high and low degree,
In hateful bondage bent the knee.
This mighty ruler ever trod
With shameless face, the house of God.
And though the church in days gone by
Had counsel from her Lord Most High,
To swear allegiance and to own
The blessed "Power of Love" alone,
She 'gan to thirst, in evil hour,
For man's worst foe, "The Love of Power."
Then Persecution ruled the land,
And murder raised her bloody hand;
While Inquisition's tortures then,
And rack, and stake, and gloomy pen,
Cut short the lives of holy men.

The church and world walked side by side,
In greed, extravagance, and pride;
And e'en the church outvied the world,
Whose godless banners were unfurled,
In catering to the "Love of Power,"
Who day by day and hour by hour
Grew stronger still as if to prove
The weakness of the "Power of Love."
One day a Man of humble mien
Upon these busy streets was seen;
His look was calm, his form was grace,
A god like peace shone in his face.
I asked his name, with bated breath,
They answered, "Christ of Nazareth!"
He henled the sick, he raised the dead,
At his approach diseases fled;
The sick and suffering, poor and lame,
Not vainly to the Healer came.

At once the "Love of Power" did plan
The downfall of the sinless Man.
And next I saw him hanging high—
A spectacle 'tween earth and sky—
And heard ten thousand voices ring:—
"O Church of God, behold thy King!
Thy 'Love of Power' hath caused his death—
Hath slain the Man of Nazareth!"
