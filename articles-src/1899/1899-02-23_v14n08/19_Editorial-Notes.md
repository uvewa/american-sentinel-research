CORRECTION.—The name of the young man arrested in Georgia for Sunday work, is Waters, not Walters, as we printed it last week.

The Spanish title to sovereignty in the Philippines, tested by all principles of justice, is the most fragile thing ever entrusted to the American Government.

In these days, the principle of government by the consent of the governed appears to be construed as meaning that governments derive their just powers from "the sensible consent of the whipped."

If this country is under obligation to the Filipinos, as frequently stated, how is that obligation to be met by a proceeding which would naturally suggest only a discharge of obligation owed by them to this country?

In a speech in Boston, recently, President McKinley said that destiny had brought America to the Philippines, and strongly intimated that it was the duty of this country to retain the islands for all time.

We are now having "higher criticism" of the American Constitution and the Declaration of Independence; and like the "higher criticism" of Scripture its effect is to take away the real meaning and life of the language to which it is applied.

The military commission appointed to investigate the charge against the commissary general of having given the United States troops "embalmed beef" for food, has reported that no evidence exists that the beef served to the troops was "embalmed." General Miles, on the other hand, affirms that he has an abundance of affidavits in his possession from officers and men competent to speak on the subject, which fully sustain the charge. There is something badly tainted about this, of a certainty; and the public are not inclined to favor the view which exonerates the beef trust which supplied the army with meat.

THERE is a chance now for some up-to-date legislator to distinguish himself by presenting a bill making it a crime for any person to present a native of the Philippines or of Porto Rico with a copy of the American Constitution or the Declaration of Independence, on the ground that the perusal of the same would be calculated to stir up revolt.

In a speech to the Y. M. C. A. State gathering at Albany, Governor Roosevelt, in alluding to American manhood in its attitude to war, said: "I want to preach the sword of the Lord and of Gideon."

That would be a good thing to preach these days, and it is a pity it is not preached more. But men who are preaching it do not win popularity for themselves by it. No one will object to fighting, even by Christians, in the way that Gideon and his army fought. And how strange it is, by the way, that people who cite these Old Testament instances in favor of war, forget all about the way in which the battles were fought. Gideon and his men did not kill anybody; they had no weapons for killing. They were "armed" in a way that expressed their faith in God, and their utter want of trust in man or any earthly power. "The sword of the Lord" was first; would that men would put that sword first now. Battleships and machine guns come first in modern "Christian" warfare, and while the aid of the Deity is invoked, all dependence is put upon the weapons made by man. The sword of man is put first, and the Deity is expected to back this up with the power of omnipotence.

Yet to-day, as in Gideon's time, the sword of the Lord is the mightiest of all weapons; and the greatest victories will be gained by it now as of old. And that sword is the "sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God."

THE Chicago Times-Herald, an ardent advocate of "expansion," says that "we are in the Philippines like a pig in a poke, which, having got its head through a hole in a gate, can only get free by carrying off gate, gate posts, and several sections of fence."

This pretty well illustrates the situation. The "pig" should have kept away from the hole in the gate, remembering that it is easier to get into trouble than to get out of it. But having gotten his head in, he prefers to go forward rather than backward; and the further he goes, the further will he get from the possibility of withdrawal.

EMBALMED liberty is about as valuable for the soul as embalmed beef is for the body.

WHATEVER else you skip, read the article in this issue on "Human Rights." If you want to know why Christians cannot go into the business of superintending other people, and why no person ought to do so, you will find the reasons clearly stated.

Have you ordered any extra copies of last week's Sentinel? It is a splendid paper for missionary purposes, and it should be in the hands of thinking men and women everywhere. The illustration, "The New Temptation on the Mount," is a very striking one, and speaks volumes.
