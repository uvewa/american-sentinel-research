## Separation of Religion from the State Taught by Christ.

By B. W. Noel, M. A., Clergyman of the Church of England.

An important passage in which the complete separation of the spiritual administration of the churches from the secular administration of the government is enjoined by our Lord is the following: "Then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man, for thou regardest not the persons of men. Tell us, therefore, what thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not? But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he saith unto them, Render, therefore, unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Matt. 22:15–21.

Pompey having about 120 years before this time subjugated Judea to the Romans, it became a Roman province. In these circumstances, the Pharisees maintained that it was unlawful to pay tribute to the emperor because God had declared that they must not choose a foreigner to be their king; they were the special people of God, and he alone was their king. When formerly the king of Syria had brought them under this yoke, their fathers had, with the blessing of God, thrown the yoke off. Frequently, too, under judges raised up and inspired by God, they had vindicated their liberties against the tyranny of the surrounding nations: God had enabled them to burst from their servitude in Egypt; and Hezekiah, with his almighty aid, had successfully rebelled against the king of Assyria. Under instructions like these the people became very impatient of the tribute imposed upon them, and nearly the whole nation was ready to revolt.

The Herodians, that is, the adherents of Herod, maintained on the contrary, that it was lawful to pay tribute, their patron being supported by the Romans. These two parties were much opposed to one another; but a common hatred having now united them against Jesus, some of each party came together to him pretending to be religious persons (Luke 20:20), who had the highest respect for his wisdom and probity, to ask him to determine for them this much agitated question, whether they ought to pay or not (v. 22, and Mark 12:14, 15) the tribute or poll-tax, which was payable by every person whose name was taken in the census. If he declared the payment to be lawful, they would make him odious to the people, who detested it; if he declared it to be unlawful, they would charge him with sedition—as they afterward did. And this was their chief design.

Jesus asked to see the coin in which the poll-tax was paid; upon which they brought to him the Roman penny, which bore upon it the head of the emperor with this inscription, "Cæsar Augustus [such a year] after the taking of Judea." The current coin of the country being thus Roman, proved that they were under subjection to the Roman emperor, Tiberius. And having obliged them to notice this fact, our Lord replied to their question, "Render, therefore, unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's; and unto God the things that are God's."

Civil government, which was necessary to prevent universal anarchy and crime, must be upheld by taxation. It was equitable that in return for its advantages they should pay for its support. To be loyal subjects to a prince who had conquered them was a very different thing from choosing a foreigner for their king. God had commanded their fathers to serve their conqueror, the king of Babylon (Jer. 27:12–17), and they were ordered to seek the peace of his kingdom. To pay tribute and to render obedience in all secular matters to Cæsar was only to render to the sovereign his due, and instead of interfering with their duty to God, was part of that duty.

Nor were they responsible for the use which Cæsar might make of that tribute. Order must be maintained by law; law must be administered by civil officers, and supported, if necessary, by the military force, for which a revenue was requisite. And if the emperor were to employ any surplus in the erection of heathen temples, in contributing to licentious theaters, or in enriching worthless favorites, they were not implicated in this irreligious or profligate expenditure. But the claims of the emperor must not interfere with superior claims. If they were to render to Cæsar the things of Cæsar, they must also render to God the things of God. The things of Cæsar were tribute and obedience to the law; the things of God were faith, worship, and obedience. When Cæsar claimed the payment of the tribute, he claimed what was his due; but should he claim dominion over conscience, affect to control their creed, or interfere to regulate their worship, then he usurped the rights of God, and must be resisted.

When Antiochus Epiphanes ordered their fathers to discontinue their sacrifices, to profane their Sabbaths, to deliver up their Bibles, and to set up idols in their country, their fathers justly refused obedience. In the same spirit the three Hebrew youths, though faithful subjects to Nebuchadnezzar, refused to bow down to his golden image; and Daniel, though blameless in his office as the prime minister of Darius, openly defied the decree which forbade the subjects of that prince for thirty days to pray to God. In paying tribute they would render to Cæsar the things of Cæsar, and in an unreserved obedience to the laws of God, both moral and ceremonial, they would render to God the things of God.

Our Lord thus established a plain rule of action. In all secular things which do not interfere with the law of God the sovereign is, to be obeyed; but if the sovereign assumes the rights which belong exclusively to God, he must be therein disobeyed and resisted.

By this answer our Lord baffled his enemies. They could not accuse him to the people because he maintained that the whole law of God must be obeyed against all contrary commands; and they could not denounce him to the Romans, because he taught that all the rights of Cæsar were to be conscientiously upheld. By this answer he condemned the Pharisees, who refused to Cæsar the things of Cæsar; and the Herodians, who neglected to pay to God the things of God. When the Pharisees claimed entire obedience to the law of God, he assented to their doctrine, but condemned them for being seditious; when the Herodians claimed submission to the sovereign, he likewise assented to that opinion, but condemned them for allowing violation of the commands of God. All that was right in each opinion he established; all that was wrong he repudiated. In these few words he escaped their snare, condemned their errors, and established a maxim of universal application.
