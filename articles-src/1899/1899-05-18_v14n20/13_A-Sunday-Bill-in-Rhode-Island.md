A BILL is now before the legislature of Rhode Island which is entitled "An Act to regulate the observance of the Lord's day." Its aim is to greatly increase the penalty for performing secular business on Sunday. The present law of the State provides a maximum penalty of $10 for every such offense; but under this proposed law a person working on Sunday will be liable to a fine of $500. A hearing on this bill is to be given Tuesday, the 16th inst.

Section 1 of this Act relates to games and sports, and provides a fine not to exceed $5 for indulgence in such "on the Lord's day."

Section 2 of the Act provides as follows:—

"Whoever on the Lord's day keeps open his shop, warehouse or workhouse, or does any manner of labor, business or work, except works of necessity and charity, or takes part in any sport, game or play, or public diversion, except a concert of sacred music, or an entertainment given by a religious or charitable society, the proceeds of which, if any, are to be devoted exclusively to a charitable or religious purpose, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty dollars for each offense, and the proprietor, manager or person in charge of such game, sport, play or public diversion, other than such concert of sacred music, or an entertainment given by a religious or charitable society, the proceeds of which, if any, are to be devoted exclusively to a charitable or religious purpose, shall be punished by fine not less than fifty and not exceeding five hundred dollars for each offense; but nothing in this section shall be held to prohibit the manufacture and distribution of steam, gas or electricity for illuminating purposes, heat or motive power, nor the distribution of water for fire or domestic purposes, nor the use of the telegraph or the telephone, nor the retail sale of drugs and medicines, nor articles ordered by the prescription of a physician, nor mechanical appliances used by physicians or surgeons, nor the letting of horses and carriages, nor the letting of yachts and boats, nor the running of steam ferry boats on established routes, or of street railway cars, nor the preparation, printing and publishing of newspapers, nor the sale and delivery of newspapers, nor the wholesale or retail sale and delivery of milk, nor the transportation of milk, nor the making of butter and cheese, nor the keeping open of public bath houses, nor the making or selling by bakers or their employés of bread or other food usually dealt in by them, before ten o'clock in the morning and between the hours of four o'clock and half past six o'clock in the evening. Whoever conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath, and actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, shall not be liable to the penalties of this section for performing secular business and labor on the Lord's day, if he disturbs no other person."

The important features of this bill are, its title, its heavy fine for Sunday work, its numerous exceptions, and its exemption clause for observers of the seventh day.

The title is very suggestive—"An Act to regulate the observance of the Lord's day." It suggests the query, Why must man take it upon himself to regulate something that he confesses belongs to the Lord? Suppose, for a parallel, the leading men in a village should meet and pass an act "To regulate the use of John Smith's boat." What would John Smith say to that? He would say, "That boat is mine, and the use of it is none of their business. I will regulate that myself as I see fit." And the person using his boat would very properly say, "I will answer to John Smith for the use I make of his boat, and to no one else." Every candid person must admit that for one person to assume to dictate what use another person shall make of his own property, is an act of gross impertinence; and this would be equally true where more than one person were concerned in the dictation.

This is what would be in a case between human beings. But what must be said when the party against whom such impertinence is directed is none other than the infinite God? In that case must it not be regarded as something far worse than impertinence?

The Lord has himself regulated the observance of his day, and that too for the very people for whom the Rhode Island Legislature is now asked to regulate it. God's regulations for the day are contained in the fourth precept of the decalogue. Now the legislature of Rhode Island is asked to substitute some different regulations. And this petition is made by clergymen—people who profess to love and reverence the Author of the fourth commandment. The Lord's regulations for the Lord's day are in force, and these new regulations are to be in force, and these differing regulations are to be in force at the same time on the same people! And as it is manifestly true that no person can observe differing regulations for the same thing at one time, and as it is manifestly intended every person in Rhode Island shall be bound by these new regulations, it must be intended that no person in the State shall be bound by the Lord's regulations, and that these regulations are to be set aside, repealed by the higher law(!) of man. And since when one power assumes to set aside the law of another power, there is a plain assumption of superiority by that power, it is plain that by this petition the legislature of Rhode Island is asked to set itself above God. Will these legislators do this thing that is asked of them? Surely they will not if they understand the nature of the request.

The bill contains many exceptions to its prohibition of business throughout the day. Numerous lines of business, most of which could be excused only on the ground of convenience, are allowed to go on as usual before 10 o'clock, A. M. and after 4 o'clock P. M. This part of the bill presents it in strong contrast with the law of the "Lord of the Sabbath," which prohibits all secular business during the day throughout its entire length. We are to choose between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of man.

It is true the Sabbath law of God and this proposed law of man refer to different days—one to the seventh day, the other to the first day; but both cover the ground of Sabbath observance; both refer to the observance of the Lord's day. One says, "the Sabbath of the Lord," the other says, "the Lord's day;" and as "the Sabbath of the Lord" must be the Lord's, and there is but one "Lord's day," it is clear that the principles involved in Sunday legislation are not affected by this difference in days; only in commanding a different day from that sanctified by the Lord the principle of usurpation of God's prerogatives is carried to its farthest limit.

The last feature of the bill—the exemption clause—is an evidence of the good will of its framers toward observers of the seventh day, but does not help the bill any from the standpoint of reason and consistency. It is provided that those people shall be exempted from its requirements who conscientiously believe in the seventh day as the Sabbath, and do observe it as such. These must therefore conscientiously observe the seventh day as the Sabbath, or be fined if they work on Sunday. The bill therefore, to them, simply amounts to a requirement that they observe the seventh day of the week. It is meant to require the observance of the first day, and it actually, to many, requires the observance of the seventh. It is meant to regulate the observance of the Lord's day, and it requires the observance of two different days! It is meant to exempt seventh day observers, and it actually requires more of them than of any others, since it requires them to observe the seventh day "conscientiously." People may be conscientious or not, as they choose, in their observance of Sunday; but people who observe the seventh day must do it conscientiously. In addition, they must not "disturb" anybody on Sunday; and it requires very little indeed to "disturb" some people on that day.

In view of all this, is it not plain that no such bill as this ought to pass the legislature of Rhode Island, or of any other State? No legislature ought to be asked to usurp the prerogatives of God, or to pass a bill that is unjust, illogical, and unreasonable. We do not believe the Rhode Island legislature wants to pass such a bill, and we hope this body will make this clearly known to all promoters of such legislation when its fate is determined by their vote.
