COMMENTING on the recent decision made by a Milwaukee (Wis.) court, that "a note given on Sunday for a church donation is valid, although a note given on that holy day for any other purpose would be void," the Chicago Israelite says:—

"Supposing, for instance, that a Jew should make a note on Sunday for the benefit of a synagogue, how, then, would the Milwaukee court rule? Or if a Christian should make a note on Sunday for the benefit of a Jewish congregation? Or if a Freethinker should do the same thing with an association of agnostics as the beneficiary, how, then, would the Milwaukee dictum work? It fairly makes us dizzy to contemplate the possibilities which hinge upon this decision should it be accepted as a fundamental principle of law."
