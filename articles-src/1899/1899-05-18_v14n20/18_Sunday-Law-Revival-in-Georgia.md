There is a revival of Sunday-law enforcement in Georgia, and bills for a similar purpose are before the legislatures of Rhode Island and Michigan. This does not mean that the spirit of religious intolerance is dying out.

In Rhode Island the promoters of Sunday observance by law purpose to make any person who works on Sunday contrary to the manner which they prescribe, liable to a fine of $50, and some liable to a fine of $500. See article on page 312.
