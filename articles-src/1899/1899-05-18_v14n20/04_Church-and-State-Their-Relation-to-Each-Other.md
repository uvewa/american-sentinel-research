### BY JOHN MCCARTHY.

When we oppose the union of church and state, many good intentioned people ask us what is the office of the state, and if it is not to occupy the paternal position to its children or subjects? We answer, that it is not within the sphere of government to fill the "parental position" in matters relating to conscience; that while it is justified in correcting wrong-doers, guarding the rights of its citizens, and withholding the molesting hand of the turbulently-inclined; yet when it crosses the line of demarcation which severs the civil domain from the religious; immediately it invade a territory which lies beyond the realm of its authority; and not only that, but such a government would consciously or unwittingly usurp the prerogative of the Creator.

Now if we consent to governmental piloting of our spiritual as well as our civil barque, what security have we for the continuance of what is now denominated the "orthodox faith?" We have to confess there is none at all. Suppose to-day we have a Roman Catholic majority in the country, the consequence will be the introduction of the Catholic religion as the *orthodox faith* of the nation. And that which but yesterday was deemed strictly *orthodox*, is to-morrow condemned as heterodox and heretical. But as governments change with the wane of popular sentiment, let us suppose that a Methodist majority should gain the legislative reins; they would immediately—impelled by their Methodist constituents—undo all the work of their Catholic predecessors, and establish another theological menu, decree all people opposed to their "*orthodox faith*" to be schismatics, and take measures to unify all beneath their authority to accept their religio-politico creed.

The French, German, Dutch, and English histories are full of such cases. The Catholic nation of to-day will he nominally Protestant to-morrow; and the day after to-morrow it will have transformed itself into a cruel, atheistic, tyrannical power.

Now if we admit that the state should be our parent in matters of conscience, we in so doing commit spiritual suicide, cutting away the platform upon which we are standing, by consenting to have no religious convictions of our own, but are willing to be led captive by whatever teachings the legislative powers may choose to decree.

There is, however, no excuse for our remaining in ignorance upon this subject. God's Holy Book authoritatively states the divine will upon this point. Rom. 13: 3, 4, reads: "Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of same, for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil." Thus we see the civil powers are not commissioned to make an incursion into the sacred precincts of conscience to there set up a tribunal and determine moral points. It should be a terror to evil-doers, etc., but a rewarder of those who are subject to its decrees.

To make this point clear, we shall make several quotations from the writings of eminent authorities upon this subject, to prove what is the real object of the civil power:

"Civil government is not spiritual. No one can gain say this proposition. Inasmuch as civil government cannot enforce spirituality, and cannot make men spiritually-minded, it has no right to require spirituality. 'God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.' A spiritual head justly requires spiritual obedience. He can punish for violations of a spiritual law. Therefore the proposition is proved that civil government has nothing whatever to do with the spiritual law. The law is spiritual, and that which is not spiritual is not to the slightest degree obedient to it."—*Civil Government and the Decalogue*, pp. 6, 7.

Thomas Jefferson, the renowned statesman and philosopher, wrote thus in a letter to Francis W. Gilmer, June 7, 1816:

"Our legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their power; that their true office is to declare and enforce *only* our natural rights and duties, and to take *none* of them from us. No man has the natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another; and this is all from which the laws ought to restrain him. Every man is under the natural duty of contributing to the necessities of society, and this is all the laws should enforce upon him; and no man having a natural right to be the judge between himself and another, it is his natural duty to submit to the umpirage of an impartial third. When the laws have decreed and enforced all this, they have fulfilled their functions; and the idea is quite unfounded, that on entering into society we give up any natural right."

Again let us quote:

"It is not the legitimate province of the legislature to determine what religion is true and what is false. Whatever may be the religious sentiments of citizens, and however variant, they are alike entitled to protection from the government, so long as they do not invade the rights of others."—*Report of United States Senate, 1829.*

"The only proper objects of civil government are the happiness and protection of men in their present state of existence, the security of life, liberty, and property of the citizen, and to restrain and encourage the virtuous by wholesome laws, equally extended to every individual."—*Presbytery of Hanover.*

We might continue at length quoting other celebrated authors upon this theme, but we imagine these—with two or three others we shall now cite—are sufficient to convince any honest-minded individual that the functions of the state are absolutely distinct from those of the church, and should in no way be mixed. The good Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, benighted as he was, and ignorant of all the intricacies of theology, boldly maintained the division of church and state. He said:

"To pretend to a dominion over the conscience is to usurp the prerogative of God. By the nature of things the power of sovereigns is confined to political government. They have no right of punishment but over those who disturb the public peace. The most dangerous heresy is that of a sovereign who separates himself from part of his subjects, because they believe not according to his belief."—*Theodoric; Draper's "Intellectual Development of Europe," Vol. I.*, p. 354.*

True Protestantism opposes energetically any approximation to a union of church and state. Hear those noble-hearted princes, as they fearlessly stand in the presence of powerful kings and dignitaries of the papal church and read aloud that charter of liberty—*The Augsburg Confession*,—thus:

"**ARTICLE XXVIII.**—The civil administration is occupied about other matters than is the gospel. The magistracy does not defend the souls, but the body, and bodily things, against manifest injuries, and coerces men by the sword and corporal punishment, that it may uphold civil justice and peace. Wherefore the ecclesiastical and the civil power are not to be confounded."

Thus they laid down the principle that church and state should forever remain separate, and all true Protestants will do even as they have done.

One more quotation will be in place:

"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and never of right exercise any power not delegated by the governed. Now religion, pertaining solely to man's relationship to God, the duty which man owes to his Creator, and the manner of discharging it, in the nature of things, can never be delegated to another. It is utterly impossible for any person ever, in any degree, to transfer to another any of his relationship to God, or any duty which he owes to his Creator, or the manner of discharging that duty. Man's relationship to God originates not with himself, but with the Lord; it springs not from himself, but from the Lord. The duty which man owes to his Creator, and the manner of discharging it, spring not from himself, but from the Lord. These are not dictated nor defined by himself, but wholly by God. Here man is subject, not sovereign. None of these things springing from himself, but all from the Lord, none of them could be delegated if he would. Even to attempt it would be only to deny God and renounce religion, and even then the thing would not be done—his relationship to God, the duty which he owes to his Creator, and the manner of discharging it, would remain as firmly fixed and as binding upon himself as ever."—Union of Church and State, p. 6.

It is thus clear that religion is a matter of conscience, and no man in his right senses should presume to judge the motives of another, since all acknowledge that motives can be judged by God alone. Hence religion being a part and parcel of conscience, when any earthly legislature dares to legislate upon matters of religion, must it not be guilty of stealing the prerogative of God, by seating itself in the divine tribunal, to judge that which lies beyond its power, and to legislate upon that which is far above its authority? We know God cannot brook such an insult to his dignity, and when the final tribunal shall be summoned, then those who have here injured in the least the weakest of God's children, by trampling under foot the rights bestowed upon them by a benignant Father, shall hear an awful voice proceed from the judicial bench, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these little ones, ye have done it unto me."
