# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, May 18, 1899 (v14n20)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. Overall quality is good. The following uncertainties were noted.

---

## Article 03: The Constitution of American Imperialism.—No. 5

- **Location:** Byline attribution
- **Issue:** The article is bylined "BY JOHN D. BRADLEY." This name does not appear in the known authors list. It is treated as a named external contributor (not an editorial initials attribution), so the file is filed as `editorial` attribution with the byline preserved in the body. John D. Bradley may be a series contributor.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the byline is explicit

---

## Article 04: Church and State—Their Relation to Each Other

- **Location:** Byline and dateline
- **Issue:** The article is bylined "BY JOHN MCCARTHY." followed at the end by "Argentine Republic." — indicating the author's location. "Argentine Republic" is a dateline/location, not a separate article or editorial item. Treated as part of the article's closing.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

---

## Article 05: The Gospel Never Brings Bondage

- **Location:** Between article 04 and article 06 (Town of Bondage)
- **Issue:** A short paragraph beginning "THE gospel never brings an individual..." appears between the end of the McCarthy article and the start of "The Town of Bondage." It is not titled and functions as a transitional editorial note. Given it has distinct content and its own standalone argument, it is filed as its own article.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — could be interpreted as closing note of McCarthy article, but the subject matter and style differ

---

## Article 08: Victory of a Bad Principle

- **Location:** Page 9, between poem and editorial notes
- **Issue:** A single-sentence item: "THE victory of a bad principle in national policy is a calamity which all the nation's victories in arms cannot offset." This appears as a standalone item between the poem and the starred editorial notes. Filed as its own article.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

---

## Page 16 Editorial Notes

- **Location:** Page 16
- **Issue:** The page 16 material contains multiple short editorial items separated by topic but without titles or section headers. These were split into individual files (articles 18–27) based on topic shifts. The OCR text shows one item about Rhode Island fines being described as "$50" and "$500" — in the main article 13, the text describes the fines as "not exceeding fifty dollars" and "not less than fifty and not exceeding five hundred dollars." The page 16 summary says "$50" and "$500" which is consistent.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

---

## OCR Artifact

- **Location:** Page 16, Georgia item
- **Transcribed as:** "the spirit of religious intolerance is dying out" — the OCR source reads "dy-in out" (hyphenated across a line break). Corrected to "dying out."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — clear line-break artifact
