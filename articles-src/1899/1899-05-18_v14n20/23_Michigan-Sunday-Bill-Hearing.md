A friend of religious freedom who was present at a hearing given recently on the Sunday bill pending in the Michigan legislature, speaks of it as follows:—

"If you could have been with me last Tuesday evening at the 'hearing' in the House of Representatives on the Sunday-closing bill, and have seen how the truth of God, his law, and the principles of freedom, justice and liberty were trampled under foot; and have noted the spirit of some of those who urged the passage of the bill, I believe you would have realized that it is time to pray: 'It is time for thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void thy law.'

"It was stated by a presiding elder of the Methodist Church that every member of his church would favor the passage of that bill, unless he was utterly false to the vows he had taken. That means that unless a Methodist favors religious legislation he will be regarded as fallen from grace. The same minister stated that the most of the Romanists were in favor of the bill. Thus Protestants are reaching hands across the gulf.

"One Detroit minister urged that the representatives should not question as to whether the law would be constitutional or not. The bill will no doubt be brought before the House."
