### BY FRANCES E. BOLTON.

*(Concluded.)*

"Now will you be one with us?" said my guide. "You see what feasts we have. Such fare as this should suit an epicure. Will you come in and feast?"

"Never, by heaven's love. I will go hence, aye, and take captives with me."

"Not so," said he, beckoning the crowd around me. I straightway drew my sword of Liberty, my bright credential, and my safeguard hence, and sprang away. I ran through Bondage Town, singing of liberty. So strange the sound was, that the captives came breathless, and crowded round, they looked from prison windows, and from tombs and bonds. I tore the chain away that bound the Book, I read, "GOD IS LOVE," and the echoes rose and rose from startled voices. I felt the angel guards on every hand. I read—

"Is this the fast that I have chosen?
"A day for a man to afflict his soul?
"Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush,
"And to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?
"Wilt thou call this a fast,
"And an acceptable day to the Lord?

"Is not this the fast that I have chosen?
"To loose the bands of wickedness,
"To undo the heavy burdens?
"And to let the oppressed go free?
"And that ye break every yoke?

"Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer;
"Thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.
"If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke,
"The putting forth of the finger, and the speaking vanity;
"And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,
"And satisfy the afflicted soul;
"Then shall thy darkness be as the noonday."

"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
"Because he hath anointed me
"To preach good tidings unto the meek;
"He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted,
"To proclaim liberty to the captives,
"And the opening of the prison to them that are bound.

"To comfort all that mourn;
"To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
"To give them beauty for ashes,
"The oil of joy for mourning,
"The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness."

The poor captives gathered thickly as they heard these gracious words, and I heard celestial voices saying, "Loose them, and let them go," and chains fell off, and fetters broke, and the binding grave-clothes rent and men went free. I saw a gracious Presence in our midst.

The blind groped toward him, and he opened their eyes. The deaf ones heard his voice. The poor old pilgrims came and found a refuge. What shouts of joy went up! And as men praised the prison walls fell down, the temple tottered, and there came forth souls who'd suffered in the torture rooms below. The school-house opened, and the pupils came asking to be renewed in love's sweet image, and an army rallied to the side of Love.

There was great madness in the town of Bondage, for those who heeded not the voice of Love, chose chains and demons, officers and priests. They loved their chains, and would not be set free, and hated those who walked at liberty. ("I will walk at liberty, for I love thy precepts.")

There shone a lightning glory round a cross whereon was seen the LAMB of SACRIFICE,—the sacrifice of love, not force, that made men free in giving unto God. Love's toil, Love's pain, Love's sacrifice, was sweet. Love used the gifts Love gave, and ever brightened in the human soul the individual trait to shine for God with God.

There came command to leave the town of Bondage, and he who led captivity captive, led his host away. They rose above the walls, a fair white throng, changed into heavenly glory. But as they rose, the cloud above the city grew more black, and flashed with sword-like flames. Peals of loud thunder shook the very earth. The river Death-Doom foamed, winds shrieked, the rocks and mountains crashed. We paused to watch. The hand let all its shafts loose, and o'er the roar and flame we heard the cries of demons and men. Blood rained from heaven, the blood that men had shed within the town of Bondage, and it reached the horses' bridles. A mighty dust and smoke arose, and then a flame as bright as Sodom's and the city of the nations fell to rise no more. The town of Bondage lay in heaps, strewn with the dead, and covered o'er with night. Fowls feasted, and the earth was white with bones.

But lo, the King of glory rose, and with him went the hosts of liberty. Mid throngs of angels we moored near to heaven. The angels sang, "Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in." From far-off gates the answering angels sang, "Who is the King of Glory?" And sweet and musical the song of joy arose, "The Lord of hosts, he is the King. He who death overcame, of angels and of powers, the King of glory, is the King of the saints."

We entered in in ranks like snow, crowned by the hand of Love, and o'er the gate was traced in words of gold, "The City of Liberty."

One day amid a field of flowers I came upon a maiden fair and tall; her hands were filled with lillies, and she sang. Her hands were shining, and upon her breast there bloomed one sweet, red rose—the wound transformed; for it was she of bleeding fingers and of broken heart.

There came sweet music with the sound of harps. It was the hearts that sang that once were torn and riven in the world. I found them all,—the poor, despairing eyed, the hungry mothers, and the slaves new made, but all were glad and satisfied with God. O what a melody went up from untold hosts, as sound of many waters,—"Glory, dominion, praise, and power and love be unto him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb forever." And I awoke. Alas! I tread the streets of Bondage City still; but I will cry as I cried in my dream, proclaiming liberty, and God will see that all the dream's fulfilled, for 'tis not all a dream.
