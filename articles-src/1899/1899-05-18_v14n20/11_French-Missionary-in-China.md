RECENTLY a French missionary in China, a priest, was imprisoned by turbulent Chinese; and now the French government demands satisfaction. The demand made upon China is the surrender of mining privileges to the value of 1,200,000 taels in the province of Sze-Chuan, one of the largest in China and traversed by the Yangtse-Kiang river. The Chinese are bold enough to say that they consider the demand exhorbitant.

The "Christian" nations have a great regard for missionaries and their work when it offers them an opportunity to gain money and territory from a weaker power. The demands they make upon the heathen nations in satisfaction for injuries done to missionaries, are of course directly against the interests of missionary work. The natives sense the injustice and hypocrisy of the proceeding, and identifying Christianity with the acts and pretensions of these armed powers, they are brought to hate the religion which before they regarded only with indifference. It would seem that the truly Christian missionary, placing the salvation of the heathen above all else, would take pains to guard against such a possible disaster to his work, by disclaiming identity with any government or power except those of heaven. When Christian missionary work is established upon this basis it will be successful as never before.
