The Arkansas legislature has performed a commendable act in passing a law which imposes a fine of from $25 to $50 upon any person who is found guilty of killing birds for use in millinery and like purposes, or who shall wear the feathers of birds so killed, or shall expose such feathers or skins of birds for sale.
