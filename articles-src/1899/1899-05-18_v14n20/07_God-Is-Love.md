*N. P. Neilsen, in "The Wisconsin Reporter."*

OUR God is love. He is the source
Of love divine. Survey Love's course
And trace it to its fountain head
And you reach God. For John has said
That he is love. His love sublime

Doth reach to the remotest clime.
To worlds on high, to earth's low sod,
Through all the universe of God
This love doth flow. Its thrill is felt
On every shore, in every belt.
The power that moves the heavenly host
Upon the bright celestial coast
To sing the sweet melodious song—
Ten thousand times ten thousand strong;
The power that moves them to obey
Their Maker's will from day to day
Is nothing but this holy love
That rules the mighty worlds above.
This same pure love ruled in the hearts
Of martyrs who would not depart
From God's plain truth. They calmly bore
Reproach, rebuff, and trials sore.
They did not fear the rack nor stake
When asked by demons to forsake
The God of Love. Ah, no! the tie
Uniting them with God on high
Was stronger than the prison cells,
Yea, stronger than the cords of hell.
This tie—the golden chain of love—
Connected them with heaven above.
Firm for God's truth and right they stood
And sealed Love's message with their blood.
O wondrous love! 'Tis power divine!
May it but rule your heart and mine!
O brother, dear, then in God's name
By love the wandering ones reclaim;
Yes, point their sin-sick souls above,
And tell them of the home of Love.
