### BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

As stated last week the men have never lived and never will live who can lawfully hold the powers that are claimed by American imperialists. To assert arbitrary power over a people is to declare war upon them. Such an assumption is a crime against human rights and is a setting aside of the principles of justice which are the foundation of all government. What is the reason, and the only reason, that is given for this high-handed proceeding?—The great wisdom and beneficence of the men who propose to exercise this power! They are "men supremely great" to whom "freedom is the breath of life, and who would scorn to enslave a country or a race;" they carry with them "all that gives to the flower of life its perfume;" they "cannot be accused of not loving liberty and justice and equality and the rights of men;" they must not be "hampered" in their "mission to relieve the oppressed, to right every wrong, and to extend the institutions of free government;" they cannot understand "why any man, and especially any senator, should wish to detract from, to diminish or belittle, the powers that they assume;" they "can be trusted to do right, and to guarantee to all men who shall come under the government's beneficent sway the largest measure of liberty consistent with good order and their general well being;" they are utterly at a loss to account for "the great talk of justice and peace, as if we were going to oppress anybody—which we could not do if we wanted to!"

Shortly and plainly stated the matter is thus: "We commit crime, we have the right to commit crime, it is perfectly safe for us to commit crime; because we are too good to commit crime!" This is certainly a marvelous piece of logic, but it is the logic and the only logic, that is presented for the transformation of the Constitution of American Republicanism into the constitution of American imperialism. If this method of defense becomes popular in the courts of the country the time and cost of public prosecutions will be materially reduced. It will be unnecessary to summon witnesses; it will be unnecessary to present arguments; it will be unnecessary to listen to the complete statement of the accused. The first part of the defense being a bold assertion of guilt will render unnecessary the claim that the accused is too good to be guilty.

The goodness that is here contended for is the goodness that is responsible for the discord of the universe. It is the goodness that made war in heaven itself. It is the goodness that has filled the earth with rebellion and iniquity. It is the goodness of which the devil is the most complete representative and because of which he was cast "as lightning from heaven."

Notwithstanding this goodness it is still true, as stated by Congressman Champ Clark, of Missouri, during the last session of Congress, that "unless we desire to become slaves we would do well to refuse to place the means of our enslavement in the hands of any man."

The following language, written by Macaulay in 1825, with reference to similar assumptions on the part of the British West Indian slave owners, is to the point:—

"A vast authority is intrusted to the master—the law imposes scarcely any restraints upon him—and we are required to believe that the place of all other checks will be fully supplied by the general sense of those who participate in his power and his temptations. This may be reason at Kingston, but will it pass at Westminster? We are not inveighing against the white inhabitants of the West Indies. We do not say that they are naturally more cruel or more sensual than ourselves. But we say that they are men, and they desire to be considered as angels!—we say as angels, for to no human being, however generous and beneficent, to no philanthropist, to no fathers of the church, could powers like theirs be safely intrusted. Such authority a parent ought not to have over his children. They ask very complacently, 'Are we men of a different species from yourselves? We come among you;—we mingle with you in all your kinds of business and pleasure;—we buy and sell with you on 'change in the morning;—we dance with your daughters in the evening. Are not our manners civil? Are not our dinners good? Are we not kind friends, fair dealers, generous benefactors? Are not our names in the subscription lists of all your charities? And can you believe that we are such monsters as the saints represent us to be? Can you imagine that, by merely crossing the Atlantic, we acquire a new nature?' We reply, You are not men of a different species from ourselves, and, therefore, we will not give you powers with which we would not dare to trust ourselves. We know that your passions are like ours. We know that your restraints are fewer, and, therefore we know that your crimes must be greater. Are despotic sovereigns men of harder hearts by nature than their subjects? Are they born with a hereditary thirst for blood—with a natural incapacity for friendship? Surely not. Yet what is their general character? False—cruel—licentious—ungrateful. Many of them have performed single acts of splendid generosity and heroism; a few may be named whose general administration has been salutary; but scarcely one has passed through life without committing at least some one atrocious act, from the guilt and infamy of which restricting laws would have saved him and his victims. If Henry VIII. had been a private man, he might have torn his wife's ruff and kicked her lap-dog. He was a king, and he cut off her head—not that his passions were more brutal than those of any other men, but that they were less restrained. How many of the West Indian overseers can boast of the piety and magnanimity of Theodosius? Yet, in a single moment of anger, that amiable prince destroyed more innocent people than all the ruffians in Europe stab in fifty years.

"There is only one way in which the West Indians will ever convince the people of England that their practice is merciful, and that is by making their laws merciful. We cannot understand why men should fight so tenaciously for powers which they do not mean to exercise. [Italics supplied.]

And such a thing is no more easily understood now. There is only one way in which imperialists can ever establish their wisdom and beneficence, and that is by adhering to the laws which are wise and beneficent. Why is it that those who "would scorn to enslave a country or a race" have only scorn for those instruments which declare that no country or race should be enslaved? Why is it that those who "cannot be accused of not loving liberty and justice and equality and the rights of men," do not love the instruments which are the expressions of liberty, justice, equality, and the rights of men?

When on a world-wide "mission to relieve the oppressed, to right every wrong" and "to guarantee to all men . . . the largest measure of liberty," why does it become necessary to declare that the instrument which asserts the inalienable right of every human being to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness "was made to suit a particular existing condition of things" and "meant simply that the colonies had become tired of the British domination?" Why then be so astonished at "the notion" that the Declaration "embodied a law of application to all inhabitants alike?"

When extending "the institutions of free government" throughout the world, why does it become necessary to throw aside as "nursery rhymes" the instruments which have made the freest government that the world has ever seen?

When "promoting enlightened and humane government and . . . protecting innocent people from barbarous and inhuman treatment," why declare that "the Constitution must bend," that "we have outgrown the Constitution," that "it is not worth while to discuss it," and that its principles "are not capable of literal application?" Why is it necessary just then to "resist the crazy extension of the doctrine that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed?"

For years we have been told that the Constitution was a "godless" and "atheistical" document. Are the Declaration and the Constitution also "barbarous" and "inhuman" documents? Are they the enemies of "enlightened and humane government" as well as of God and religion? What acts of barbarism and inhumanity do they require of public servants? Is it not possible to be humane while adhering to them? Does faithful observance of the oath to support the Constitution stamp a man as a savage and a barbarian, as utterly devoid of the instincts of humanity? What kind of beneficence is that which demands as a pre-requisite the powers of a Nero or a Caligula? which removes the idea of security and protection, and which declares that it is everything and that the people are nothing?

If the American people value the principles which have made their country free, glorious, and prosperous, they will demand answers to these questions at the hands of the men who are talking so much of "honor," "duty," "loyalty," "humanity," "civilization," "human progress," "liberalizing influences," and "the high sanctions of national and moral obligation and responsibility." They will see that satisfactory answers to these questions will be home missionary work of such supreme importance, that, if necessary, all foreign missionary operations should cease until this work is attended to. They will demand that the work of establishing "stable" government abroad give way to the work of maintaining constitutional government at home.

This is not partisan language. We have nothing to do with the policy of the government as such, and we do not seek to dictate in regard to the campaign in the Philippines, or with anything else connected with that policy. We are simply dealing with the Christian principles of liberty which were espoused by this nation at its foundation. When we see those principles repudiated and know what that repudiation means, it is our duty, and therefore our right, as men and as Christians by every manly and Christian means, to oppose and to point out that repudiation and to make known its inevitable consequences, in order that all who wish may cling to the principles and escape those consequences.
