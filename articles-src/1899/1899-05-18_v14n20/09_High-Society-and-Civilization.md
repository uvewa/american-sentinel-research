THE Atlanta Constitution notes that "recent social events in New York are of such a character as to challenge fears for the future of the country;" and speaking more particularly of one such recent social event, says:—

"When a multi-millionaire can present a new wife to the world each day, and when later they can reach the point of swapping wives, without shame and without loss of caste, it is certain that we had better employ some of our foreign missionaries at home."

Yes; some things are evidently "certain" in the light of such events, and one of them is that when high society in the leading city of the North lightly sets aside the claims of social morality, and when the "best citizens" in the leading States of the South uphold the burning of negroes at the stake, and when these features of American civilization are rapidly growing, this civilization needs to be radically reformed before it is imposed on the Philippines or any other country. This is certain, and it ought to be plain to any observing person.
