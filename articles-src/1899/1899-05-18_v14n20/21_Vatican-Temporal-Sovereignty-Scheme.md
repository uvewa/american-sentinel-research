There is a scheme on foot in Italy which may result in the realization, on a small scale, of the papal dream of a restoration of the "temporal supremacy." The Vatican, as is well known, is the enemy of the Italian government, because the latter stands directly in the way of the pope's temporal sovereignty. Its opposition to the Italian government is determined and active. It is now reported that the Vatican would cease this opposition if it could secure a small strip of territory on the north bank of the Tiber, and extending to the sea at Civita Vecchia, as an independent state. This would of course include the Vatican. It would be a small kingdom, truly; but abundantly large enough to secure the recognition of the pope as a temporal sovereign, and thus of a principle which to the papacy is of vital importance. A big principle may be obtained in a very small thing.
