THE position of negro churches of the North regarding the lynchings in the South, is indicated by the following resolution passed at meetings of African churches in Chicago, April 30:—

"We plead for equal and exact justice. We condone no crime, nor do we wish to shield criminals from the penalties they deserve. All we ask is the rigid enforcement of law. We contend that no man or woman should be put to death except by due process of law. We want every protection possible to be thrown around the home and the highest penalty visited upon the violator of its sanctity. At the same time we hold to the doctrine that ours is a land of liberty and law, and that every person charged with a crime should have a fair trial."
