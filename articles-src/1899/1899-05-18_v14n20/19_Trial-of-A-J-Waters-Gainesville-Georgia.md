Before the next issue of this paper reaches its readers, we shall probably know the result in the case of the trial of Mr. A. J. Waters for Sunday work, at Gainesville, Ga., which is set for the 15th inst. The Georgia Sunday law has a very severe penalty, and the developments in the case are likely to be interesting. An official of the Religious Liberty Association will be in attendance.
