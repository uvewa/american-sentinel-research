A press dispatch states that "according to current report in Roman Catholic circles another important decision is expected soon from Rome," which will speak in condemnation of the doctrine of evolution. This doctrine has been working its way into Catholic teaching in some quarters, and the question has been under consideration for some time by a commission of cardinals, who will, it is said, report adversely upon it. They might also point to this, as to the practice of Sunday observance, as evidence that Protestants do not stand upon their professed ground of "the Bible and the Bible only."
