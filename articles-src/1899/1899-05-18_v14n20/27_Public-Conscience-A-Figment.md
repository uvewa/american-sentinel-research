A Catholic exchange says that "Public conscience, so much prated, is a figment of the imagination. It is a pretty sentiment swallowed by the unthinking many." The papacy has existed for centuries and is thoroughly acquainted with the nature and value of public sentiment; and when a papal organ speaks thus of the "public conscience," there is every reason for believing that it tells the truth.

Every individual must rely on his own conscience, guided by the higher light of inspiration. He must say, as did Luther before the emperor and cardinals, "It is neither safe nor right to do anything contrary to conscience"—not the conscience of other people, but his own.
