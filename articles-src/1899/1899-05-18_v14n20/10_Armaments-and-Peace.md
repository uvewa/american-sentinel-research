A CABLEGRAM dated at Berlin, May 7, states that Professor Delbrueck, the eminent German historian, has created some stir by a remarkable article in the Prussian Year Book on the subject of "War and Peace of the Future," in which he says that the czar's peace congress will not lead towards peace, but is bound to lead to war. In his view the best assurance of peace is to be had in strong military armaments.

No individual's opinion on this question would be worth very much, but the testimony of history, upon which we may safely rely, is that under certain conditions people are always ready to fight whether they are armed or not, and we may safely conclude that disarmament, were it to be realized, would not give the nations any greater love for peace.

On the other hand, the view that strong armaments constitute a guarantee of peace is without historical support and is contrary to principles which have always governed the conduct of men and of nations. Anciently nations went to war when the sacrifice of men was certain to be much greater than any modern war has involved; for it is a fact that when armies fought hand-to-hand, the slaughter was vastly greater than is occasioned by the use of the "improved" weapons of to day. War was always a most desolating scourge, but no nation was ever deterred from going to war by the knowledge of this fact.

Just now the powerful nations are busy dividing up the territory of weaker kingdoms; but when Africa and China no longer furnish them spoils, they will be ready to fight among themselves for the spoils they have taken. Spoliation is the spirit of the age, and everything is sacrificed to the instinct of gain.

The best and the only guarantee of peace is the love of peace that comes from the principle of unselfishness. This never failed to keep peace between individuals, and if individuals would refuse to fight, there could be no wars between nations.

It is worth while to note in connection with this subject, that a peace congress has been called by the "Prince of Peace," and that He purposes to secure peace by "disarmament." There is something said on this point in the forty-sixth psalm. It would not be time lost to look up what the Prince of Peace has said on this subject; for there is no uncertainty about the execution of His purposes.
