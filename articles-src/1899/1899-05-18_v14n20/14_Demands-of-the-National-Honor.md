Prof. William Benjamin Smith, of the Tulane University, of Louisiana, expresses some pertinent truths regarding the Philippine question in the following recent letter to the New Orleans Picayune:—

"Under pretense of rights acquired first by war, then by treaty, in the sacred name of humanity, but really in the lust of gold and thirst for commerce, we have invaded and are trying to subjugate by the combined devices of civilized and savage warfare a foreign and unoffending people, who not only have never in any wise wronged us, but who are geographically and otherwise incapable of wronging us so long as we behave ourselves and merely forbear to wrong them. This unprovoked invasion and attempted conquest these brave people are resisting to the best of their poor ability. We admit our deep-dyed guiltiness and yet we persist. We know the right and we approve it, too; we know the wrong and still the wrong pursue. That is indeed a very old story, but it is new, alarmingly new, to hear that the national honor demands it.

"We are burning, looting, ravaging, maiming, slaughtering—not only armed soldiers, but unarmed and defenseless prisoners as well; we are drenching an alien soil with the blood of its own inhabitants—its only rightful possessors; we are spreading want and woe, ruin and wretchedness over a populous region; we are making a solitude—that we may call it peace—of the towns and villages of a people whose only crime is patriotism and love of liberty. All this, we admit, is wrong—terribly, cruelly wrong—but we proclaim to the world that we will never cease from wrong-doing, though it take a hundred years to effect the impious conquest; nay, though we have to exterminate the patriots we cannot subdue, and all because forsooth 'the national honor demands' it! Will you tell us, Mr. Editor, what is this modern moloch, the national honor, that demands in sacrifice not only thousands of American lives, the peace and happiness of myriad American homes, but a whole race of brave, if only semi civilized, of patriotic and of inoffensive islanders, almost as unrelated to us as the inhabitants of the moon? Is it anything else than headstrong conceit, overweening pride, and inordinate vanity? Is it aught else better than an itching palm, the unholy coveting of fertile plains and metalliferous mountains?

"If not, and if such be the base idol we are worshiping, the sooner broken the better. We are waging one of the most cruel and iniquitous wars that ever disgraced the annals of history; we are committing a national crime of appalling proportions and of unsurpassed atrocity; is it possible that the national honor demands that we dishonor the nation? That we defame the human race? That we outrage human nature? Never! On the contrary, it is the imperative demand, not only of the national honor, but of our common humanity; of every principle of our polity; of every interest of our civilization; of every precept of our religion—that this unnatural and infamous massacre cease instantly and finally—no matter how much it may humiliate the administration that begun and continues it. The American people have no quarrel with the Filipinos; let the President and his cabinet and his commission go to Manila and fight it out.

"It is useless to say that the islanders began the war. We were there in armed force; we had taken partial possession; we had no thought of yielding an inch; we (at least the administration) had proclaimed to the world our fixed determination to stay and keep the islands as our own. Under such circumstances it was perhaps unwise in the islanders to attack us, but the provocation was extreme and we were the real aggressors. If a bully invades your premises, and refuses to leave, and declares he will henceforth manage your property for you as your highly-paid agent, and develop your resources to his own advantage, and will exterminate you if you don't keep quiet, it may be imprudent for you to strike him; but it is not wrong, and neither human law nor divine justice will condemn you or admit his paltry and hypocritical plea of self-defense.

"It is idle to say the islands are ours, because we half-conquered, half-bought them from Spain. They were not Spain's either to give or to sell. The robber has no right to his booty—either to retain or to transfer. At the best, our title was merely that of a receiver of stolen goods. This flimsy pretension, even if it availed in law, would be worthless in morals, but that it has no validity even in law was months ago expressly admitted by that blind but honest leader of the blind, the Rev. Lyman Abbott.

"Pitiable, too, is the pretext that we intend to give the natives good government! It is in truth easy enough to govern corpses, and we are rapidly swelling our list of such obedient subjects, but there is no reason to suppose that we could, even if we would, govern well the living population. Our government of ourselves in the commercial focus of our own country is an intolerable stench in the nostrils of civilization; our hundred-year guardianship of our Indian wards has been a 'century of dishonor.' Even the humanest rule of the inferior by the superior is always in the interest—the commercial interest—of the ruler, and is always oppression to which no self-respecting people will submit, except at the persuasion of necessity. But even if it were otherwise; even if we could always supply them with model governors; with pure self-sacrificing philanthropists, . . . yet it is the ground principle of our political theory that even such paragons of virtue are not quite virtuous enough to govern any people, even their own people, much less an alien people, without the latter's consent. To abandon, to repudiate, to spurn with contempt this axiom of democracy is certainly not to protect, but to profane the national honor; to annul the faith of the fathers, and to make the name of the Republic a byword and a hissing.

"No! There is one, and only one course for the sinner who sees his sin, and that is to repent and turn; to cease to do evil and learn to do well, and that without any delay; not to put it off and wait till a convenient season, when reformation will be cheap and pleasant and profitable, but to reform now and here, even though reformation be hard and painful and humiliating. If we have sinned before heaven and in the sight of men, as beyond question we have, then it is natural and it is right for us to suffer, and the sooner we do penance the better. It is vain and foolish to try to evade the consequences of error by continuing to err; we laugh at the silly liar, who must tell two lies to hide one. Nemesis will surely overtake us, if not in this generation, then still more terribly in the next. Justice may follow with a leaden foot, but she smites with an iron hand."
