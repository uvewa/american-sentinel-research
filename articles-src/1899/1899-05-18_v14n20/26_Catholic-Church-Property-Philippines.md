Roman Catholic journals report that the pope has authorized the archbishop of New York to open negotiations with the Government for the disposition of Catholic Church property in the islands taken from Spain; that the well-known politician, Bourke Cochran, will be attorney for the church in the negotiations, and that he has gone to Rome to consult with the papal authorities.
