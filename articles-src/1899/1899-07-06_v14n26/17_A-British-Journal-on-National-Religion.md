## A British Journal on National Religion.

*Bible Echo,* Melbourne, Aus.

A Queensland correspondent sends a clipping from the Brisbane Courier, giving an account of a deputation from the council of the churches which waited on the home secretary to protest against closing public schools on race days, and the running of trains and steamboats on Sunday. One speaker claimed that "we were a part of the British nation, and the British constitution was based upon the laws of the Sacred Book." If this is so, how is it that the British law requires men to observe the first day of the week, while the law of the Sacred Book demands that the seventh day be observed? The simple truth is that the fourth commandment bears no relation whatever to the British law. One is of God, and the other is of men. Another speaker said:—

"We are a Christian country. The basis of our statutory law is the Word of God, and it is obviously wrong that the law which guards our Sabbath should be infringed."

But God does not recognize Christian nations. Christianity is a personal thing. God calls individuals only. The message is, "He that believeth." Now the law that would attempt to make a man offer service to God when he does not believe, is a wicked thing, "for whatsoever is not of faith is sin." It seems strange to hear religious people talking about our Sabbath. The only Sabbath that God knows about is "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and that is the seventh day of the week. He alone has a right to claim its observance from man. This he does from the individual and not from the nation. The laws that men are so anxious to have passed or put into operation for defense of Sunday observance cannot in any way meet the mind of God. First, Sunday is not the Sabbath at all. Second, compelling a man to observe the Sabbath is only compelling him to sin before God, for "whatsoever is not of faith is sin." And to compel a man to offer an act of worship to God is simply making him act the hypocrite, both in the sight of God and humanity.
