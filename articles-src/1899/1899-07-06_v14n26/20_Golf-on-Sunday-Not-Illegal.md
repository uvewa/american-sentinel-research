A judicial decision comes from Bridgeport, Conn., to the effect that golf playing on Sunday is not a violation of law in that State. The following statement of facts in the case is given by a New York paper:—

"Three members of the Wee Burn Golf Club were playing the game not long ago on Sunday. . . .

"To them appeared a rural constable from Darien, who arrested them in spite of their declaration that they were merely out for a stroll, knocking a little ball ahead of them, as any person had a right to do. The constable, being a descendant of that Connecticut tithing man who tried to arrest stout old Israel Putnam for galloping past a meeting house when the soldiers of George III. were about, would listen to no such quibbles. The law, as he had always construed it, forbade all amusements on the Lord's day, and wasn't golf an 'amusement?'

"This view was taken by the local justice of the peace, and the golfers were fined $50 each. The New York colony along that part of the Sound backed the culprits in an appeal to test the law.

"Prosecuting Attorney Light, upon whom it devolved to try the case, searched the law in vain for a peg to hang it on. He recommended that the charge be dismissed. The judge looked through the statutes and came to the same conclusion. He declared that golf, whether on a week day or on Sunday, was 'a healthful and vigorous exercise,' and in no way a misdemeanor."
