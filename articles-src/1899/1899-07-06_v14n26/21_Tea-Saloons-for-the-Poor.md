The death of a "tea-drunkard," from excessive indulgence in his favorite beverage, was chronicled recently by the press of this city. It is stated that the victim "often drank thirty cups of tea a day." In view of this and other similar cases the doubt is expressed whether the "United States Church Army" is doing wisely in opening tea saloons for the poor. Unquestionably this is a very poor sort of aid for the poor.
