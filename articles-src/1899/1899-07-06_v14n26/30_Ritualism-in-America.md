## Ritualism in America.

*The Interior.*

The process of Romanizing the Episcopal Church in America goes on *pari passu* with that in Great Britain, with the difference that it is a question to be settled by the people, not by the state. An example is Christ Church, Jersey City. Up till five years ago that congregation was classed in the Low Church or evangelical wing. A new rector, one Dr. Elmendorf, then came in, and was successful in transforming it. The name was changed from Christ Church to the Church of the Holy Cross, and the High Church ritual was introduced. Last week the rector issued circulars to a select number, announcing the institution of the confessional, and giving instructions in preparation for and performance of the new "duty."

The evangelicals are, some resisting, some withdrawing, but Dr. Elmendorf, at the end of five years of preparation, feels confident of his ability to hold the fort. We do not think much about the Roman Catholic confessional, as it is an old tradition with them; but for a "Protestant" rector to invite the women (for that is what it will amount to) to whisper their tattle into his ears and to grant them absolution, has a sinister and unmanly aspect. What business has a man to try to induce another man's wife to make more of a confident of him than she does of her husband?
