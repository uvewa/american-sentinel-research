Under pressure from countries where religious liberty is respected, Peru has consented to a modification of her church-and-state marriage laws, and has published a decree permitting marriages which are not sanctioned by the Catholic Church. Persons not members of that church are required, before marriage, to announce their religion and declare under oath, in the presence of two witnesses, that they have never been baptized as Catholics. Parties to a civil marriage that is made necessary because of a refusal of the Catholic Church to grant a dispensation in a case of differing religions held by the contracting persons, must present proof of the church's refusal.
