## The French National Crisis.

With the return of the exiled Dreyfus to France and his retrial by court martial, a crisis will be reached not only in the case which the court martial will consider, but in the experience of the French republic. That this is so is appreciated by those who have noted the extent and intensity of the anti-Dreyfus feeling in the high military circles of the French army, and the significant language in which certain military authorities have referred to the coming trial. The San, of this city, questions whether a military "coup d'état" will not be attempted, and says:—

"That was an ominous speech which was made on Sunday in Paris by General Mercier, who, as having been minister of war at the time, is chiefly responsible for the wrongful sentence of which Dreyfus was the victim. He could not predict, he said, whether a government willing to overawe the new court-martial, which would try Dreyfus, would be formed, but he knew that no court martial would accept a judgment dictated by any government. To himself he referred as a 'soldier who did his duty in 1894, and who was firmly resolved to do his duty in 1899.' These declarations, uttered as they were during a grave ministerial crisis, can have had no other purposes but, first, to impugn the motives of the Cabinet which the friends of President Loubet were trying to form, and secondly, to threaten it with a military coup d'état, should it strive to perform its duty by securing an impartial tribunal for the second trial of Dreyfus, and thus give rightful effect to the judgment of the Court of Cassation.

"The crisis, we repeat, is serious in an exceptional degree, because the generals who have been concerned in the Dreyfus affair have to choose between disgrace and treason, and because a majority of the present Chamber of Deputies is still at heart against Dreyfus, notwithstanding the decision of the Court of Cassation. The Chamber might, therefore, protest with vehemence against a dissolution of Parliament, stigmatizing the act as an attempt to stifle the authentic voice of the republic, and thus give the conspirators precisely what they need, a specious pretext for a military coup d'état.

"Unless the friends of the general staff were determined to dominate the second court martial of Dreyfus, or, failing that, to attempt a coup d'état, General Mercier would never have ventured to utter the defiant words which he pronounced on Sunday."

But more interesting than the fact of the crisis itself, is the question of the cause which has given rise to this remarkable case; for the cause represents the root of the whole matter, and there is abundant proof that something far more than the alleged traitorous conduct of a French army officer—Dreyfus—has been back of the proceedings and demonstrations which have marked the history of the case. And now, an answer comes to the question of the identity of this cause, from a professor in the University of Turin, Mr. Cesare Lombroso. It is published in the New York Independent, under the heading, "The Secret Spring in the Dreyfus Case." After setting forth the necessity for the conclusion that there is a "secret spring" in the case, this authority proceeds to identify this ulterior cause and says:—

"If we recall the proverb: 'Is fecit cui prodest' (he is the doer of the deed to whom the deed will be of profit) we conclude that no one could have been the moving spirit in all this except the person who had the largest interest at stake, and who had a great object in view. Now, clearly, there remains only the clerical party, or rather, the Jesuit party, which can have any great interest involved. . . .

"Now, in the Dreyfus intrigue, which the Jesuits did not create, but which, once created, they proceeded to put in fermentation, they espied the means of making a bloodless St. Bartholomew's Eve, by managing, with as little violence but as great efficiency as possible, to detroy all esteem for Hebrews in public opinion by depicting them as enemies of the country, with the object of thus paving the way for the same sort of operation with the Protestants; and thus they meant to end by having France united in the Roman Catholic faith, and, what was of the greatest importance to them, in blind, supine subjection to the church; and they knew that a ferment more acute than in other lands over their dogmas is innate among the French people, and, more than that, a ferment which goes back to the days of the Druids and the Franks, and reunites and fuses the patriotic idea into one with that religious Gesta Dei per Francos. So they set about bringing it to an acute state and raising it to a red heat.

"We do not possess, it is true, documentary proofs of these Jesuit plots, but as we know the good fathers' nature and method of working in underhand ways, and the ease with which they cover up their traces, this becomes only one sign the more; however, there are other indications, including the squandering of money on an immense scale, by Esterhazy, upon the journalists. Now, as long as the general staff was triumphant it is easy to understand that they made use of the state funds; but afterward, who could have furnished it, except the priests? Who could have made Esterhazy hold his tongue as to his authorship of the bordereau in April, 1899, when the general staff had no more money?

"Another proof is the compact of the generals with Father Dulac, at Versailles and at Brussels; the action of Father Dulac upon Madame Pays, and that of the confessors upon Madame Faure.

"There are other positive proofs in plain light of day in the sermons of Father Didon, who declared that the soldiers with their sabers had saved society, which ought to sacrifice everything for them; in conclusion, the almost universal movement of the young men in the schools, which are, in great part, directed and inspired by the clericals, can proceed from nothing else than the instigation of these clericals, since the temper of the young man is always in favor of the oppressed, not of the oppressors, while in the Zola case, for example, we beheld a single man overwhelmed by the whole of France, and above all, by the young men.

"From this it is evident how acutely Gambetta foresaw the great danger which France might run from the cunning plots of clericalism, when he made his prediction: 'Clericalism—that is the enemy!'

"And, in fact, the lowering of the moral sense and the decline of all liberalism which has come to France through the Dreyfus affair has done more damage than Sédan and Waterloo put together to a country which has wished to remain the center of European thought.

"And if France does not take care to escape from the slavery which the Jesuits and, perhaps, the other religious bodies exercise over the women and the young people; if she does not free herself from the press, as she has liberated herself from the nobles, she may call herself, in words, a republic, but she will remain a republic dependent on the Druids, which is worse than being the slave of the Germans and of the English, because enslaved bodies can win their liberty, but souls, no!

"Will she have the strength and the resolution to do it? We hope so!"

No Dreyfus case with its attendant national crisis would be possible in a country without a union of church and state.
