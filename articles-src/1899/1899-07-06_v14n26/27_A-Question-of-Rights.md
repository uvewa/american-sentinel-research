## A Question of "Rights."

New York "World."

Governor Roosevelt strenuously insists on the duty of all citizens to uphold the President in "enforcing our rights in the Philippines."

But what are our "rights" there?

It is said that we succeeded to the sovereignty of Spain and to all the rights appertaining thereto. But did not the United States deny the right of Spain to govern people against their will and to kill them if they resisted? Was it not in protest against this alleged right that Congress notified Spain to get out of Cuba, and proceeded to force her out when she refused to quit peaceably?

If Spain had not the right to tax, to oppress, to shoot and to starve the Cubans, no more had she the right to do the same things to the Filipinos. Judged by our own standard of right as applied to Spain in Cuba, Spain had no rights in the Philippines which justify us in assuming her rôle as the subjugator and arbitrary ruler of the people of those islands.

Certainly our own Constitution confers no right upon the President to demand the "unconditional submission to our sovereignty" of 9,000,000 people in the Philippines. There is no warrant of Constitution, of law or of precedent for the conquest of these islands, or for imposing upon the inhabitants, without their consent, our authority and our institutions.

Spain could not convey to us any rights which she did not possess, and Mr. McKinley cannot justly claim any right not expressly conferred upon him by the Constitution or laws of his country.

"Our rights in the Philippines" would therefore seem to be limited to the right of self-defense—to repel attacks upon our forces—and to the right of maintaining order and security in the city of Manila, which we conquered from Spain. If Mr. McKinley had not claimed and sought to enforce rights far exceeding these there would have been no war there.
