## The Blindest Blind.

By E. S. Brookes.

The blindest blind are those who will not see,
Who shun the light and into darkness flee.
And oh! how deaf are those who will not hear,
Who error love, but truth both hate and fear.

The light of truth on many sheds no ray,
Who in the shadows of their idols stay;
Who blindly walk the road the pagans trod,
And love and worship church instead of God.

Though much may hydra-headed Error rage
At Truth's plain words upon the sacred page,
Each futile effort only serves to show
That man cannot the truth of God o'erthrow.

Deceptions many 'gainst the truth are brought,
But failing, new deceptions then are sought;
But strange the foes of truth should fail to see
How much among themselves they disagree.

The Bible truth is much like Gideon's light;
It shines, and then its foes each other fight.
How strange they do not pause to count the cost
And know that they'll be loser all that's lost.

Dear friend, throw off tradition's blinding sway,
And "seek" and "find" truth's plain and heaven-ward way;
Be ever by God's Holy Word constrained,
Assured that you'll be gainer all that's gained.
