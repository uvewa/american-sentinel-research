## Sunday Baseball.

On June 24, nine men sat in the court room in Rome, N.Y., charged with the crime of playing baseball on Sunday. Considerable time was occupied in impaneling a jury, as the most of those examined did not see any harm in the game. Various witnesses were examined with reference to the amount of noise made, the most of whom testified that the greatest noise made was by clapping of hands. Rev. M. More Hughes testified that he was acting as chaplain at the county house during the game, and that the clapping of hands and cheering diverted the attention of some of his congregation. The result of the trial, however, was an acquittal from the jury.

The Rome Sentinel of June 24, in giving an account of the trial, makes this significant statement:—

"The council took their places before the recorder's desk. Rev. S. J. Greenfield, Rev. M. More Hughes and Geo. W. Davis sat by the attorneys for the prosecution."

But why should the clergy be such close associates of the prosecuting attorney? I do not read that the Master who worked as a carpenter on Sunday ever "prosecuted" any one if they did not do as he thought they should. And why this for playing ball on Sunday?

Did any body ever read where the clergy were sitting at the elbow of a prosecuting barrister, seeking to convict for playing ball on Wednesday or Thursday, or any day but Sunday?

Baseball is played every day in the week. Is it right six days in the week, and wrong on Sunday? If so, why so? If it is uncivil on Sunday, is it not equally uncivil the other six days? Any why do preachers make such a hue and cry about Sunday ball and say nothing against it the other six days? Why let a thing they deem wrong run unmolested for six days in the week, and suddenly make an ado on Sunday, and spend time during the week sitting at the elbow of some lawyer seeking to convict a fellow-citizen for doing on one day what they themselves favor the other six?

It is quite evident that the opposition is not to baseball, but to the time when it is played; so the effort is to secure religious legislation in favor of Sunday. During the fourth century the clergy made a fuss about various amusements being held on Sunday, assigning as a reason that the people congregated more to the places of entertainment than to church. They, therefore, requested that the amusements be transferred to some other day. It is the same now. The exaltation of Sunday is the thing sought, and this is the state enforcing a religious institution—a union of church and state.
