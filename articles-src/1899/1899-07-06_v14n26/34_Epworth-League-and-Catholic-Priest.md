A ROMAN CATHOLIC priest, of Chicago, Father Heldmann, is a candidate for election to Congress, and has received a letter from the head official of the Epworth League, Rev. Edwin Schell, promising him the support of his vote and his voice in his campaign. The Epworth League is a Methodist religious organization, having a membership of over a million and a half; and of this organization Mr. Schell is the general secretary.

Mr. Schell has discovered that the present representative of his congressional district, Mr. Lorimer, "is unfitted by education, native ability, or patriotic instincts to represent the intelligent and uncompromisingly patriotic Americans of the congressional district in which you and I have the pleasure to reside." "There are times," he writes to the priest, "when our religious and political duties are absolutely identical. We have happened upon such a time just now."

Mr. Lorimer is a man of intelligence and good character, but is not "patriotic" enough to suit the mind of this Protestant Church official. Such patriotism as is needed now is that possessed by this Catholic priest, and "just now" is a time when his "religious and political duties are absolutely identical." In Congress, therefore, his duties as a patriotic representative of his congressional district will be just what his religious "duties" were before; which were, in general, to further the interests of the papacy in the United States. What less, indeed, could be expected of a priest in Congress?

If the Epworth League indorses this position taken by its general secretary, there can be no question on which side of the line it stands. For between John Wesley and the papacy the line of separation was sharply drawn.

"Straws show which way the wind blows," and things much larger than straws are showing the direction of the wind to-day.
