## Pointed Words on Imperialism.

The clergy of the United States have in many cases become prominent champions of imperialism, but not all have taken this stand. Some have taken their stand emphatically against such a departure from American principles, and have had the courage to court the charge of treason which is being made against those who do not side with the majority in upholding a policy of foreign conquest. One of these is the Rev. C. R. Brown, pastor of the First Congregationalist church of Oakland, Cal. In a recent discourse Mr. Brown read to his congregation an extract from a letter to a resident of Oakland by a lieutenant in the Philippines, and followed it with some very pertinent remarks concerning the nature of the policy being pursued in that far-off land under the stars and stripes. His language is sufficiently pertinent and instructive to bear repetition.

To his friend in Oakland the lieutenant in the Philippines wrote:—

"I have seen a real war with all its horrors. I have seen two hundred acres of houses burned. I have put the match myself to houses while old women knelt at my feet sobbing and begging me to spare their shack of palm leaves. I have ordered the destruction of acres of vegetables and fruit trees, which meant months of labor and the only means of living to the poor fellow who was on his knees to me."

The following are extracts from Dr. Brown's discourse:—

"We read, also, that this people, who, in their desperation have fought for liberty for a hundred years against Spanish domination, are still struggling for the privileges of self government in a way that touches our American hearts. The very women among the Filipinos have been enlisting; and when their troops were driven back from the trenches, among the bodies of the dead our men found the bodies of women clothed in men's garments and with hair cropped close. They, too, had shouldered their muskets that they might stand beside their husbands and brothers in their pathetic contest for the privilege of governing the soil where they lived. It may be that these ignorant people are misguided and that their estimate of our final purpose is not correct, but the desperation of their struggle against the idea of taxation without representation must touch the hearts of all those who have not forgotten our own war of revolution. Do we want to compel this unwilling people to accept our rule? Do we want to kill, burn, and devastate in order to defeat them in their desperate attempt to gain their freedom from any foreign domination?"

"We are told that Spain oppressed these people; but even cruel, ignorant, incompetent Spain has never burned a mile square of their homes in a single day. The death of thirty thousand of our men, on the principle that one American soldier is equal to five savage Filipinos, would mean the death of one hundred and fifty thousand of these uncivilized natives. If we should write that bloody record within the next two years it would eclipse the annals of any cruelty that can be charged for a similar period against Spain!

Further on, this brave preacher says:—

"It is no excuse for our slaughter of the Filipinos for us to plead their alleged incompetency to manage their own affairs. In 1861 a certain great nation had a deadly dispute with itself. The North and the South were arguing out with the awful weapons of war that political principle which we call 'States' rights.' The lives of almost a million men were sacrificed and thirty-seven hundred millions of dollars were expended in determining which view of that principle should obtain. We would not have thanked any nation on earth to have said to us in those days: 'Those American people are not capable of self-government. They are killing each other; their country is torn by rebellion; therefore, we must come in by our superior force, set up our government, and manage their affairs for them.' Let the Filipinos learn to govern themselves precisely as we learned to govern ourselves, and let us not soil our hands by killing them because they claim in desperation this solemn privilege. I remember it is urged that their leader, Aguinaldo, has once been bribed. Perhaps he was, and, if so, it was a grievous fault and grievously has Aguinaldo answered it. But here, at home, we do not kill men nor burn their towns because they have been bribed. If such were our settled policy, what awful configurations and what dreadful slaughter might have marked some of our State capitals.

"We announced at the beginning that this was a war for humanity and not for conquest; it was to deliver men from oppression but not to shoot them down or to compel them against their wills to submit to our rule. To me there is something more splendid than any conquest that we might win, and that is for a nation to keep its word."
