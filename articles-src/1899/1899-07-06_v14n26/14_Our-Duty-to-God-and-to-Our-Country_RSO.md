## Our Duty to God and to Our Country.

BY R. S. OWEN.

[THE following address on this subject was delivered by Elder R. S. Owen, Seventh-day Adventist clergyman, to his congregation at Hatley, Miss., among whom was an officer holding a warrant for Mr. Owen's arrest, for having done secular work on Sunday. Mr. Owen delivered his discourse with the officer sitting before him, and at its conclusion was taken by him to Amory, where on the 19th inst. he is to stand trial. Mr. Owen's offense consisted in hoeing weeds out of a flower bed in his yard:—]

You are all acquainted with the circumstances of my arrest this morning. I am to be taken from my home at the close of this meeting, and when I shall be with you again I do not know. I am glad of the privilege of speaking to you once more, and it occurs to me that an appropriate theme for our study this morning will be the relation we sustain to God and to our civil government. I will read as our text Matt. 22:21: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's."

In these words of our Saviour we see recognized a clear distinction between the authority of God and that of Caesar, and between the duties we owe to each. Civil government is ordained of God, and in those things which come under their jurisdiction the civil rulers are to be respected and obeyed. This duty is enjoined in plain and unmistakable language in the thirteenth chapter of Romans: "Let every soul be subject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation." The apostle goes on to teach that we are to make this a matter of conscience, and that if we do not obey our rulers we may expect to suffer the penalty. But it should be borne in mind that the apostle is here speaking of those things which pertain to the civil rulers. He enumerates many of the duties which grow out of man's relation to his fellowmen, and sums them all up in one saying, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." He does not mention one duty that we are to render to God as worshipers before his throne. Our duty to love God, to accept the gospel, to be baptized, to partake of the Christian ordinances or to keep the Sabbath day, is not once referred to as being part of our obligation to civil rulers. These are the things that we are to render to God and with them the civil ruler has no right to interfere.

This is clearly shown in the next chapter, Romans 14, where the apostle takes up the matter of faith, the observance of days, and those things which pertain to the worship of God. To those who would rule in such matters he says, "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth; yea, he shall be holden up, for God is able to make him stand. One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." This personal liberty in matters of religion is not because they are of no importance; but because "every man must give account of himself to God." "He that regardeth the day regardeth it to the Lord, and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it."

The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. Ex. 20:10. The Sabbath is a sign between God and his people. Ex. 31:17. It is a sign, that they might know the Lord. Eze. 20:12, 20. It is the Lord's day. Rev. 1:20. The Sabbath being the Lord's, we are to render it to him and not to Cæsar. When civil rulers go beyond the bounds of their proper sphere and legislate upon religion, making laws which conflict with the laws of God, then God requires his servants to obey him in preference to man. And this is what the true people of God have done in all ages, and they have laid down their lives rather than yield to the laws of the civil rulers.

The Lord has shown his approval of this principle by giving to his servants miraculous deliverance on several notable occasions. The Hebrew people under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon present a striking instance of this. God had commanded them to submit to this king, saying, "The nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the Lord." Jer. 27:8. Many of the Jewish people were carried away captives to Babylon and among them the king found his most faithful servants. They were so loyal to him in the discharge of their civil duties that he conferred upon them his highest positions of trust. While true to the king in the affairs of men they acknowledged their allegiance to the authority of a still higher power whose commands they would not disobey. And when the king went beyond the range of his authority and dictated to men in reference to their worship, commanding them to bow before the god he had set up, these faithful servants refused to obey the king, answering frankly to his command: "Be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up." For this act of disobedience to the king's command they were cast alive into the burning fiery furnace. But the One whose watchful eye is ever looking upon his faithful children saw their loyalty to Him in preference to the unrighteous decree of an earthly king, and honored the stand they took by sending His own Son to accompany them in the fire, and to protect them from the devouring element. When they came forth from the furnace there was not the smell of fire upon their garments.

At a later time, when the kingdom of Babylon had passed into the hands of the Medes and Persians, and Darius the Median was reigning in Babylon, God's servants were still found faithful to their rulers in all the affairs of men. "Daniel was preferred above all the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error nor fault in him. Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God." The king was then influenced by these jealous-minded counselors to step out of his proper sphere into the realm of religion; and he issued a law which forbade the worship of God. "Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did aforetime." The law was plain and explicit. Daniel knew what would be the consequences of his disobedience; and yet he deliberately chose to obey God rather than man. For this he was cast into the den of lions; but the angel of God was sent for his protection. He rested safely that night with the hungry lions, and when taken from the den no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.

The Roman law in the days of our Saviour, forbade the introduction of a new religion into Roman territory on pain of banishment or death; and yet in the face of this law Christ told his disciples, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." He knew what they would have to encounter. "Behold I send you," said he, "as sheep in the midst of wolves; and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them." They were to render unto Cæsar the things which were Cæsar's; but when Cæsar usurped the authority of God they were to obey God rather than Cæsar. This they did, and as a result many of them laid down their lives for a testimony against such usurpation. The apostle who as we have seen, enjoined strict obedience to civil rulers in civil affairs, was frequently brought before their tribunals for disregarding their laws in religious things. He was charged with teaching "customs which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans." Acts 16:21. When cast into prison for this charge at Philippi he sang praises to God till the prison doors were opened by the power of God, and there in that Roman jail contrary to Roman law he preached Christ to the Roman jailer until he was converted.

When commanded to teach no more in the name of Christ, the apostles said in reply, "We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:28, 29. The martyrs for Christ throughout the Dark Ages of papal supremacy, whose number is estimated at not less than fifty millions, testify to the injustice of religious legislation, and their testimony has been sealed with their blood. When our forefathers who founded this Government saw the religious persecution of the Old World and the train of evils attending the enforcement of religious laws, they sought to guard against the repetition of such acts of injustice in the Republic of America. They placed in our national and State constitutions strong guarantees of religious liberty to all. In the Constitution of the United States we have the following: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." In harmony with the sentiment of these words, George Washington wrote: "Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience." Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote: "Almighty God hath created the mind free; all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens or by civil incapacitations tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion." James Madison, who wrote the Constitution, also expressed the following: "Religion is not in the purview of human government. Religion is essentially distinct from government, and exempt from its cognizance. A connection between them is injurious to both."

Such are the words of the men who were foremost in the forming of our Federal Government. The United States Senate committee, also, in response to petitions for Sunday observance, said: "It is not in the legitimate province of the legislature to determine what religion is true or false. Our Government is a civil and not a religious institution. Our Constitution recognizes in every person the right to choose his own religion, and to enjoy it freely without molestation. The proper object of government is to protect all persons in the enjoyment of their civil as well as their religious rights, and not to determine for any whether they shall esteem one day above another, or esteem all days alike holy. What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights. They are not exercised by virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights of which government cannot deprive any portion of citizens, however small. Despotic power may invade those rights, but justice still confirms them."

Coming nearer home to the constitution of our own State we find the following: "No preference shall ever be given by law to any religious sect or mode of worship; but the free enjoyment of all religious sentiments and the different modes of worship shall ever be held sacred."

In harmony with these principles and with the rights secured by these constitutions, we chose to obey God in keeping the seventh day of the week as commanded in his unchangeable law, in preference to the "first day of the week commonly called Sunday," as commanded by a man made statute.
