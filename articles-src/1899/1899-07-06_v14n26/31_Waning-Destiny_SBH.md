## "Waning Destiny."

Rev. B. M. Palmer, of New Orleans, La., a Presbyterian, and one of the leading clergymen of the South, gave utterance to the following impression at a recent unveiling of a monument:—

"The old republic is gone; the empire has come. I bow to that will, infinitely wise and superior, which has ordained it, whilst others, with prophetic eye, seek to interpret the symbols which are turned upon the yet unwritten pages of the chapters of the book. As I seek to read and interpret these, I stand appalled before the opening history upon which our sons and our descendants must enter. But whilst living to see the old record closed, and to open my eyes upon the first pages of the new American history, yet to be written, I confess to a supreme faith in the infinite wisdom and power of Him who sits in universal supremacy over the destinies of nations and men, and with a sort of clinging confidence in the versatility and genius of that wonderful American statesmanship that may yet lead the empire on through her waning destiny, restraining it from those errors which have blasted other empires of the past, so that ours shall not be numbered among those which lie stranded forever upon the shores of time."

This minister evidently sees the irreparable outcome of American imperialism.
