## "The Righteous Nation."

*Baltimore Sun.*

As an illustration of the perversion of what the world has been accustomed to consider the spirit of Christianity it may be worth while to call attention to the religious services at Adams, Mass., on Sunday in which President McKinley and his party participated. The pastor preached on the theme "War for Righteousness and Peace," while for the Sunday-school exercises there was a special programme, entitled, "The Righteous Nation," containing a number of "patriotic songs" in which Mr. McKinley, we are told, joined heartily. "War for Peace and Righteousness" was the doctrine of Mahomet, and with this motto the blood-stained crescent of the Mussulman swept over many lands. The cross of Christ went forth in the earlier ages conquering and to conquer in the power of love, not of the sword. If Christianity now rests simply on the principle of the "unspeakable Turk," and depends upon its propagation on physical force, the sooner the New Testament and the teachings of Christ are amended to conform with that idea the better.

Logic and consistency are both outraged by the conflict between the new gospel and the old. The Sunday-school programme of "The Righteous Nation," prepared for the special delectation of the President, while not suggesting Christian humility, does recall a familiar figure in New Testament history—that of our old friend the Pharisee, who, when he went up to the temple to pray, thanked God that he was not as other men.
