## Sunday Enforcement in Australia.

[The following, taken from the Bible Echo, a religious journal of Melbourne, Australia, will give the reader an idea of Sunday enforcement as it is practised in that country. Notice that the prosecution for Sunday labor is there brought under the ancient statute of Charles II., which commands that on Sundays all people must attend church and be pious both in public and private. A more flagrant denial of religious freedom was never embodied in a statute; yet the persons who want Sunday enforced do not hesitate to drag out this mediaeval church-and-state "law" and appeal to it as being still in force! By which they proclaim that they are friendly to such legislation, when it is a question of enforcing Sunday. That is the spirit of Sunday enforcement, and it is the same spirit the world over:—]

At the Ballarat Police Court, on May 1, a carter of that city was charged, under the act of Charles II., with exercising his worldly calling on the Lord's day. The alleged offense consisted in carting some scenery from the railway station to the theater on Sunday morning. The defending counsel contended:—

"That if the act under which the prosecution was laid was enforced in its entirety, hardly a person in the community would escape. Among other things, the act provided that 'all and every person and persons whatsoever shall, on the Lord's day, apply themselves to the observation of the same by exercising themselves thereon in the duties of piety and true religion, publicly and privately.' The act further demanded—'That repairing to church on the Lord's day should be carefully put into execution.' Continuing, Mr. Ham asked why the railway commissioner was not also prosecuted for carrying the same scenery by train on Sunday."

This is certainly a logical conclusion. If the act of Charles II. is right and is to be enforced, every part of it should be so regarded. But one feature of the case, as reported in the Ballarat Courier, of May 2, seems to be especially significant. After considering some law points raised, the bench consulted, and before the defendant had been called upon to give evidence, the chairman said:—

"They were quite agreed that the Sabbath (Sunday) must be preserved at any cost, and there was no doubt defendant had been guilty."

To this the counsel objected, stating that the decision was being given without hearing his client. The carter was then called to give evidence; this he did stating that he regarded the work as a matter of necessity. To this the chairman replied, "We are of the same opinion still. What you have said hasn't altered our minds. You will be fined five shillings." If religious institutions cannot exist without deeming a man guilty before he has given his defense, they certainly cannot be of any value to humanity. When will the State learn that the logic of making or enforcing religious laws is either to make its citizens outlaws or hypocrites? Suppose this act of Charles II. was enforced, hundreds would, no doubt, go to church just to save prosecution, but they would only go as hypocrites. And those who would not go from principle would become outlaws. So to require a man to take up the religious act of observing Sunday when he does not so desire, can only mean enforced idleness and religious hypocrisy. The spirit of religious intolerance will deepen as our age advances, but it will not work out human good or God's glory. Sunday is a human institution. The Sabbath (the seventh day) belongs to Jehovah, but he has reserved to himself the right of requiring its observance.
