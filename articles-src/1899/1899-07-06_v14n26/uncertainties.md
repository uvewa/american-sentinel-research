## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 15 — "The French National Crisis"
- **Location:** Body text, Lombroso quotation
- **Issue:** The word "detroy" appears in the OCR text: "to detroy all esteem for Hebrews in public opinion." This is almost certainly a typo for "destroy" — either an OCR error or a period typo in the original.
- **Transcribed as:** "detroy" — preserved as it appeared in the OCR source, which may reflect the original print. Given the ACCURACY IS HIGHEST PRIORITY rule, the original spelling is preserved.
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error for "destroy," but cannot verify against original scan.

### Author "G. B. Thompson" (article 24, "Sunday Baseball")
- **Issue:** G. B. Thompson is not among the known author initials in the project's author list. The full name "G. B. THOMPSON" appears at end of article.
- **Transcribed as:** author "G. B. Thompson", author_short "GBT"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — full name is explicit in text.

### Author "E. S. Brookes" (article 26, "The Blindest Blind")
- **Issue:** E. S. Brookes is not among the known author initials. The byline "By E. S. Brookes" appears.
- **Transcribed as:** author "E. S. Brookes", author_short "ESB"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### Author "S. B. Horton" (article 31, "Waning Destiny")
- **Issue:** S. B. Horton is not among the known author initials. The name "S. B. Horton." appears at the end of the article.
- **Transcribed as:** author "S. B. Horton", author_short "SBH"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — name is explicit in text.

### Author "R. S. Owen" (article 14, "Our Duty to God and to Our Country")
- **Issue:** R. S. Owen is identified in the editorial introduction as "Elder R. S. Owen, Seventh-day Adventist clergyman." The byline reads "BY R. S. OWEN."
- **Transcribed as:** author "R. S. Owen", author_short "RSO"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### Page 16 — Two Adjacent Editorial Items
- **Issue:** On page 16, two separate editorial items follow one after another without explicit section breaks beyond the paragraph separation. The first begins "A READER of the SENTINEL asks..." and the second begins "A ROMAN CATHOLIC priest..." and the third is a closing aphorism "The kingdom of God is within you..."
- **Decision:** Treated as three separate articles (files 33, 34, 35) based on distinct subjects and paragraph-level separation in the OCR source.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the division is editorially reasonable but the original layout cannot be confirmed from OCR alone.

### Page 8 — NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT Section
- **Issue:** The "NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT" section contains multiple items running together. Items were separated by paragraph breaks and subject changes in the OCR. Each was treated as a separate article.
- **Decision:** Split into individual files (19–23) based on subject changes and the `* * *` separator markers visible in the OCR.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the major splits; MEDIUM for the tea saloon and church unity notes which lack explicit separators beyond topic change.

### Page 1 — Short Editorial Aphorisms
- **Issue:** The front page contains 11 short standalone aphorisms/editorial notes, each separated by `---` in the OCR. Each was treated as its own article per project guidelines.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — explicit separators present.
