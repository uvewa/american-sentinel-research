An exchange says: "The danger to civil peace of mingling religious controversies with purely civil affairs is illustrated by the agitation in Canada against the denunciation of Roman Catholicism in the Coronation Oath. The Roman Catholics of Quebec hold the balance of power in Canadian politics, and a Catholic journal hints that 'bloody revolutions have arisen out of religious outrages such as this.' It would be an evil day for Canada if all political lines should be sharply drawn between Protestantism and Catholicism."
