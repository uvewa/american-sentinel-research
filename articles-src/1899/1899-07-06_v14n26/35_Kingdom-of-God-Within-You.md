"The kingdom of God is within you," said Jesus Christ; and hence his kingdom is "not of this world." Christ's kingdom is advanced only by means which operate in the heart; the kingdoms of the world only by means which cannot reach the heart. The one is by faith; the other by force. This is a distinction always overlooked by those who think to establish the kingdom of God on earth by legislation and politics; but it is a vital distinction, and cannot be overlooked by him who sees the truth.
