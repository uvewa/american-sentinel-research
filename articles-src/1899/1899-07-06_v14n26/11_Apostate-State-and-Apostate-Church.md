**AN** apostate State—one which has forsaken the true principles of government—is always found united with an apostate church. The United States is the only nation founded on the true principles of government, and the only one in which church and state are not united. This was not an accident, but a necessary consequence of the national recognition of the true principles of government, as set forth in the Declaration of Independence. Union of church and state is wholly incompatible with government by the consent of the governed. But now that the principle of government by consent of the governed has been repudiated, and the nation has become committed to the policy of government by consent of some of the governed,—which principle it is putting in practise in the conquest of the Philippines—its union with an apostate church will be sure and speedy. That is the product of a law as certain as the law of gravitation.
