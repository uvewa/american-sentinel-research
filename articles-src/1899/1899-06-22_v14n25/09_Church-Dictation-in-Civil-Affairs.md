The church forces of Columbus, Ohio, are at war upon the city official who holds the office of director of public safety, because he is connected with a theater in the city which is run on Sundays. They have decided that this city official must either recognize Sunday as a sacred day, as they do, or give up his civil office.

The pastors' union met and passed a resolution addressed to the mayor requesting him to discharge the irreligious official from his cabinet unless he severed his connection with the theater. Following this, the Epworth League met and adopted resolutions in which the action of the director of public safety in running the Sunday theater was denominated "a disgrace to Mayor Swartz's administration, a flagrant violation of law, and an insult to all law-abiding citizens."

The Presbyterian Union also met and drew up an address to the mayor, reminding him that "the powers that be are ordained of God," and affirming that he represented God in the administration of municipal affairs. The union called upon him "as God's servant, in whom the hopes of the good people of the city centered" when he was elected to office, to "rise up in your moral manhood and free your administration from the Godless men who would make merchandise out of the moral interests of the community."

The pastors' union, Presbyterian union, and Epworth League of Columbus are not opposed to the running of this theater on other days of the week. They are not opposed to the theater in itself, as a thing of evil character. If they are, why do they not say so and ask that it be closed on all days alike? No; they are apposed to it on Sunday; and as it is the same on other days of the week as it is on Sunday, the offense plainly does not arise from the nature of the exhibition given but from the peculiar character of Sunday, as a religious day. This also is plainly testified by the fact that only religious people are engaged in this movement to oust the director of public safety from his civil office.

The offense arises from the religious character of the day specified in the complaint made by the church people. The offense depends upon the character of the day, and the character of the day depends upon the religious question whether it is or is not the Sabbath. The answer to this question, as given by the church people concerned in this matter, rests upon assumption. Its support is purely traditional. Assumption being thus the basis of the whole, the offense rests upon assumption, and is only an assumed offense, even from a religious point of view.

The mayor of Columbus is asked to dismiss from his cabinet a prominent official because of the offense of not showing the deference to Sunday which the church people demand. This is a plain effort to obliterate the distinction maintained in American principles of government between church and state.

In this matter the church people have assumed the right to dictate how the mayor shall manage the affairs of his civil office. The mayor must remove an official from his cabinet unless he will do as they say. If they have the right to dictate in one matter they have the right to dictate in all, and so to run the city government to suit themselves. And that would be the state controlled by the church, which is church and state union in a malignant form.

The pastors' unions, the Epworth League, and similar organizations are supposed to exist for the purpose of extending the kingdom of God; and they may well devote all their time and energies to this great work. There is no lack of such work for them to do. The spiritual fields are white for the harvest, and the great call from the Master is for laborers to do the work of reaping. But here are those who profess to be laborers, who are giving their time to another work,—one which does not relate to the kingdom of God, but to politics. The kingdom of God cannot be advanced by the civil power. The mayor of a city, or the director of public safety, as such, can do nothing to promote it. Why? Because "the kingdom of God is within you"—in the heart and the conscience, which the civil power cannot reach. The kingdom of God can be extended only by changing the desires of the heart, in the unconverted. It can be extended only as men are led to exercise faith in Jesus Christ as a Saviour from sin.

The demand of these church people in this matter is both unamerican and anti-Christian; and as such, the mayor of Columbus is bound to give it an emphatic negative.
