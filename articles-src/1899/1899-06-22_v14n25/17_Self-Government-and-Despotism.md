LINCOLN in one of his celebrated speeches voiced a positive truism when he said: "When the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself and also another man, that is more than self-government—that is despotism." It was such despotism from which our forefathers desired to be released when they penned that Declaration which pronounced that "all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights," the American principle,—the Christian principle, which inspired Lincoln's utterance, and which has challenged the admiration of the world. How would Mr. Lincoln be received to-day by the "imperialists" were he alive? He would doubtless be considered an out-of-date "old fogy" or a traitor.
