Our purpose is to draw a parallel between the presence of God in the slugger's victory, as his father saw it, and the presence of God in the alleged putting of the Philippines into our hands, as some people believe. With all due regard to the people who believe in the overruling presence of God in the affairs of nations, but who do not see him in a slugging match, we affirm that the size of the event does not alter the principle. It is quite as possible that our nation is sinning against God in using force upon the Filipinos as the slugger was in a brutal and degrading business when he knocked his opponent senseless. The fact of victory no more proves the approval of God in one case than it does in another. Had we first used brotherly love, had we first tried to strengthen such self-government as the Filipinos had where the treaty was drawn, had we been willing to spend as many lives and as many millions in defending them as we have spent in destroying them and in reducing their pleasant homes to ashes, then we might have believed that we were acting on divine lines. But, on the face of it, there is no more divine love in our acts than in the blows whereby the champion pugilist knocked his opponent senseless. Belief in special favors is too often a mere superstition and is evidently so in this particular case.—Fitchburg Sentinel (Maine).
