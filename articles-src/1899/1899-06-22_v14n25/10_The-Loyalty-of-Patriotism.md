PATRIOTISM and Loyalty are inseparable terms. They are bound to Truth with chains of love that earthly power or dogma cannot break.

Every precious truth that serves to gladden the life of the Christian has been perverted and made to serve some hellish purpose of Satan. And for this reason the things which appear are not the things that really are.

The action and not the speech is the mighty factor that tells the most for patriotism and loyalty. Civil organization can offer but one explanation for its existence. Selfishness, the basis upon which all sin rests, demands civil organization, that a name might be attached to the works of men. The very first effort in this one was thwarted by the Lord, and Babylon was the result. Gen. 11:1-9. Therefore when we solve the mystery of selfishness, which is the mystery of iniquity, we have solved the problem of civil government, and can clearly see that everlasting separation must be maintained between such and the representatives of the kingdom of heaven.

Civil government exists because wrong exists; it is bad because the people are bad—the basest men often predominating in its management. Their conception of justice never rises higher than their idea of self-government, and as the trend of human nature is downward, it is easy to understand the constant degeneracy of civil government. As nations depart from the principles of true patriotism and loyalty, their conception of truth grows less distinct, until the necessity of right doing fades from their minds altogether, and they fall beneath the weight of their own iniquity.

In the days of our Saviour, Rome had so far departed from all principle of right-doing that the governor of Judea asked the Lord the question, "What is Truth?" and yet in the face of this there was no desire on his part to persecute the Saviour, other than to please the ones who were demanding his life.

In this the natural weakness of civil power is plainly manifested; and awful will be the condemnation of a stronger power that dares extend the perverted conditions with which the weaker power contends.

When Jesus was brought before Pilate the last time his desire was to release Him, and he questioned Him closely,—"Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?" To which question Christ made this significant reply: "Thou couldst have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above; therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin."

The Bible student can clearly see the contrast between the two forces arrayed against the Lord in this trial. The State made no demand for the life of the Lord; but it did reluctantly concede the demands of an apostate church. Liberated from the demands of a corrupt and apostatizing church, the State has seldom been found interfering with the Christian liberty God has given to all. But when the virgin of Christ prostitutes herself at the gateway of nations, and through fraud and deceit entraps unwary and weaker victims she throws about them the arms of her insatiable power; and then the loyal feel the pointed thrusts of her bigoted intolerance and cruel hate. Well may nations beware.

"A foolish woman (church) is clamorous; she is simple, and knoweth nothing. For she sittith at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city. To call passengers who go right on their ways: whoso is simple let him turn in hither; and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. But he knoweth not that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell." "Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of harlots and abominations of the earth" "is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her."

The aged prophet had sufficient cause to marvel, as he beheld fallen churches, in the spotless name of Christ, playing the harlot with the kings of nations. What greater and more heaven-daring blasphemy could conscienceless churches commit than to turn their back upon their risen Lord, and offer for sale their virtue in the courts of Christless kings? What presumption, what spirit-barren chaff, what an account to be settled in the day of the Lord! Is it not time for a loud cry to be sounded in their synagogues and there proclaim the call, "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and receive not of her plagues, for her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquity."

"Lift up thy voice with strength. Be not afraid, and say unto the cities of Judah, BEROLD THY GOD."

*Altman, Col.*
