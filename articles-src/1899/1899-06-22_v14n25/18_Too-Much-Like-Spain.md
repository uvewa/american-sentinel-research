Ever since the early part of last February, the American forces in the Philippines have been fighting the natives almost daily and routing them always with great slaughter; yet after each defeat the Filipinos have been on hand several thousand strong for the next battle; and a late-published report from Manila tells of the fiercest battle of the campaign being fought with "the largest and best organized body of men which has met our troops."

This is curiously like the news that came from Cuba via Havana for a year or more prior to American intervention. In every engagement the Spanish troops routed the insurgents with heavy loss; yet the insurgents always turned up again ready for fight in apparently undiminished force.

It is declared that there is no war in the Philippines—only an insurrection raised by a small party of the natives. So says the New York Sun, of June 13. Spain likewise declared there was no war in Cuba; she was only combatting an insurrection which was in the last stages of failure.

After a hundred and thirty days of reported defeat and slaughter of the Filipinos, with one or two announcements by the imperialist press that the war was ended, the hardest and least successful battle of the campaign is fought near the sea between Manila and Cavite, on ground occupied when the troops first landed; and other news comes which is not made public, but it is so serious as to call for a midnight council of war at Washington, and orders for the immediate dispatch of reinforcements.

There is too much similarity between this and recent Spanish history to reflect credit on the United States. Spain is an imperialist nation; and United States history would never be similar to that of Spain except under an imperialist regime.
