The Union Gospel News states that the Spanish Minister of Justice has passed a decree to the effect that all pensions to nuns in 1837 shall now cease, except where the person interested can be proved to be alive. In 1837 it was provided that every nun then living should have a pension for life. Since then not a single death has been notified by the Roman Catholic authorities to the government! As the oldest nun registered in 1837 was seventy years of age, the Spanish Minister has grown skeptical of her existence.
