# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, June 22, 1899 (v14n25)

## Article 10: "The Loyalty of Patriotism" — Author B. W. Marsh

- **Location:** Page 7, byline "BY B. W. MARSH" and dateline "*Altman, Col.*"
- **Issue:** "B. W. Marsh" is not in the known authors list. The initials BWM have been assigned here.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for attribution (byline is explicit); LOW for identity (unknown author).
- **Note:** "Altman, Col." is a dateline (Altman, Colorado), not part of the author name. The article ends with this dateline after the final paragraph.

## Article 10: "BEROLD THY GOD"

- **Location:** Page 7, final quoted passage: "Lift up thy voice with strength. Be not afraid, and say unto the cities of Judah, BEROLD THY GOD."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "BEROLD THY GOD"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "BEROLD" is almost certainly an OCR error or typo for "BEHOLD THY GOD" (a common biblical phrase). However, the OCR file reads "BEROLD," and without access to the original scan, this has been preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR. This should be verified against the original scan.
- **Reason:** Per transcription rules, the original text is authoritative. If the original printed page actually reads "BEHOLD," this is an OCR error to be corrected upon review.

## Article 17: "Self-Government and Despotism" — Author S. B. Horton

- **Location:** Page 10, signed "S. B. HORTON."
- **Issue:** "S. B. Horton" is not in the known authors list. The initials SBH have been assigned here.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for attribution (signature is explicit); LOW for identity (unknown author).

## Article 21: "A Religious Test Called For" — Attribution to C. T. Shaffer

- **Location:** Page 12, signed "C. T. SHAFFER." at bottom, with dateline "Butte, Mont., May 29, 1899."
- **Issue:** "C. T. Shaffer" is not in the known authors list. The initials CTS have been assigned here. This author also wrote article 11 in this same issue.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for attribution (signature explicit).

## Article 12: "A Confession of Weakness" — Reprint attribution

- **Location:** Page 8, introduced by "E. J. Dryer, in 'Signs of the Times.'"
- **Issue:** This article appears to be written by E. J. Dryer and published in the Signs of the Times, then reprinted and commented on in the Sentinel. The article contains both direct quotes from the Westminster and Hamilton Herald and editorial commentary by the Sentinel. The attribution has been set as "editorial" because the Sentinel author's voice predominates throughout and substantially extends the quoted material with their own commentary.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the article's framing suggests E. J. Dryer's piece in Signs of the Times was the source, but the Sentinel editorial commentary is woven throughout. Attribution as "editorial" is the safest choice.

## General: "News, Notes, and Comment" section structure

- **Location:** Pages 9–10
- **Issue:** The "News, Notes, and Comment" section contains a mix of items separated by asterisks (***). Some items are thematically grouped, others stand alone. For this transcription, closely related items (particularly those on Cuba's press censorship and the Sunday grocery decisions) have been grouped into single article files, while clearly distinct topics have been separated. This grouping judgment may need review.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM.

## Page 14: Advertisements

- **Skipped:** The "ONLY ONE WEEK MORE" dictionary subscription offer, the Signs of the Times advertisement, the MUNN & Co. patents advertisement, the Simplicity Vaporizer advertisement (by Alfred Mallett), and the Map of Palestine advertisement were all skipped as advertising content per project guidelines.
- **Note:** "Alfred Mallett" appears at the bottom of the vaporizer ad at "39 Bond Street, New York" — this may be the same person as "Alfred Mallet" or "A. Mallett" referenced in the project memory as an uncertain name.

## Page 15: Book advertisements

- **Skipped:** The "Books We Can Recommend" page (Savonarola, John of Wycliffe, Martin Luther, Political Speeches and Debates, Pilgrim's Progress, Left with a Trust, Jack the Conqueror, Golden Grains, Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, Making Home Happy, Native Life in India, Among the Northern Icebergs, Life on the Kongo, Two Cannibal Archipelagoes, Story of Redemption) were all skipped as book advertisement/catalog content per project guidelines.
