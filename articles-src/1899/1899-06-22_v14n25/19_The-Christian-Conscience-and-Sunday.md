It is customary for religious people to object to Sunday labor because it offends what they call the "Christian conscience." It would be well to remember that the only Christian conscience that God knows anything about is a *personal one*. Individuals stand before him, each responsible, in all matters of religion, only for his own course of action. If a man feels inclined to work on the day that you regard as sacred, his action cannot affect your standing before God. If Sunday were the Sabbath—which it is not—he would still have the same right to work so far as man is concerned. "To his own master he standeth or falleth." The spirit that gets mad because somebody else goes to work on the day that we esteem to be sacred, is not of God. It may be called a "Christian conscience," but it breathes of the Inquisition, and must finally lead back to the chamber of horrors.—*Bible Echo*.
