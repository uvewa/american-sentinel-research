An exchange published in Kansas City, Mo., prints this item:—

"At the National Reform Presbyterian Synod, Monday, June 5th, certain causes for fasting were specified. Among them are the following: The continued failure of our beloved land to make the needed constitutional acknowledgments of God, his Christ and his law. That the President of the United States, though a member of the Christian Church, made no reference to Christ in the Thanksgiving proclamation."
