In a sermon delivered by J. L. Albritton, D. D., of the M. E. Church, in the Auditorium in Butte, Montana, Sunday evening, May 28, to a large and appreciating audience, the speaker made the following significant utterances in defiance of the spirit and letter of the Constitution of the United States. The utterance was concerning emigration to the United States and the qualifications for citizenship. You will see how a religious test is imposed in the reference made to "our churches and our Sunday schools," "our Sabbath services," etc.

As reported in the Butte Miner, May 29, 1899, he said:—

"We will observe this day as Memorial Day by pledging our eternal fealty to the principles they died for. The war of the great rebellion is over and there is little danger of there ever being another like that one, but there are other dangers ahead. We have vast territory, with soil to produce all we need. The earth is full of ore and fuel and precious metal. The atmosphere is charged with electricity. We have scholars and students, colleges and educators, capitalists and laborers, churches and preachers. The ocean is decked with sails, and vessels are sailing toward us. They are coming loaded with thousands and hundreds of thousands. What shall we do? Shall we let them come? Yes, if they seek a home but meet them where they land to take them to Bunker Hill, to Washington's monument and to Gettysburg. Tell them of Shiloh and Stone River and of the Wilderness. Tell them of Lincoln. Take them to where Grant sleeps. Tell them of our memorial services. Then show them our churches and our Sunday schools. Show them our Sabbath services. Show them our public school system. All these are blood-bought and precious. If they will accept these we will welcome them. If not, in the name of all our soldiers, living and dead, we will command them to go back. We will close Castle Garden and the Golden Gate. We can do it."

Butte, Mont., May 29, 1899.
