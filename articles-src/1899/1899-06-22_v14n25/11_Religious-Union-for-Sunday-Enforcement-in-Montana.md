The Sunday forces in Butte, Mont., have united in one organization for the purpose set forth in the following resolutions:—

"WHEREAS, This union of Young People's Christian societies of Butte, Mont., has been organized for aggressive work in furthering all agencies which tend to advance the cause of Christ, and

"WHEREAS, We believe that the desecration of Sunday as a rest day is antagonistic to this cause, and is becoming more general, therefore, be it

"Resolved, First, That we are opposed to all Sunday work on public contracts, and that we respectfully request that all officials in authority who, as representatives of the people, have been allowing such Sunday work to be done, cause the same to be stopped; and that, in order to secure the cooperation in this matter of Christians throughout the country, we suggest to each society in this union that it indorse these resolutions and secure their publication in the representative papers of its denomination;

"And further, that we urge all Young People's societies, to whose attention this matter shall be brought, to draft petitions in support of these resolutions and present same to the representatives of their respective sections of the country; and

"WHEREAS, We believe that the gathering of laundry, the calling for mail at the post office, the distributing of merchants' handbills and unnecessary work in stores on Sunday are examples of Sabbath-breaking in our own city; therefore, be it

"Further Resolved, That we are opposed to such work on the Sabbath, and that we urge all Christians, who have, perhaps, thoughtlessly been countenancing it to resolve with us to stop such work in our own cases, and to use our influence to have it stopped in that of others, especially by doing all our shopping between the hours of S. A. M. and 6 P. M. on week days, so as not to oblige employés in stores to work Sundays on account of late evening shopping; and that we earnestly beg of the members of the Butte Ministers' Association that they all unite on some Sunday evening in the near future, preferably on Independence Sunday, July 2, in considering with their respective congregations the subject of Sabbath observance and desecration."

The organization is composed of the young peoples' societies of the different denominations in Butte. Those represented are the Methodist Episcopal, Protestant Episcopal, Presbyterian, Christian, and Baptist. In reply to the question of who were accepted as "young people," Elder Tonge, of the Presbyterian Church, said, "all over seven and under seventy."

The discussion on the resolutions was very animated and breathed a spirit of intense fervor and devotion. All the speakers in favor of the resolutions were loudly applauded. The pastor of the First Baptist Church said in his speech that he was opposed to Sunday laws closing the mines and places of business until they had a law closing saloons on Sunday; "for, said he, it is well known that holidays and rest days are harvest days for the saloons and brothels."

Elder Tonge, of the South Butte Presbyterian Church, wanted Sunday laws for all the reasons that the others gave, and in addition the following: "I want a law that will stop Sunday street cars. Christian people in South Butte will come to the corner where my church stands and stand there to take a car to some other church up town. If there were no Sunday cars they would attend church nearer home."

Sunday mails, open shops, newspapers, boys distributing hand bills, clerks, builders, laundries, and all industries in general, were attacked with the declaration that they would "pass from the book of resolutions to the book of acts." The weapon to be employed, should legislative enactment fail, is the boycott. This suggestion was greeted with tremendous applause.

One young lady, a teacher in the public school here, had the nobility and courage to rise and rebuke the resolutions in a few well-chosen remarks. A man attempted to parry the force of her words by saying in defense of the resolution that it was not intended to dictate how one should "amuse himself on Sunday." Another man arose and told the people that he certainly was opposed to the desecration of the Lord's day but desired them "all to remember that the word Sabbath occurred in the Old Testament scriptures over seventy times, and in the New Testament scriptures over sixty times, and not in a single instance did the Lord apply the name to the first day of the week." The silence which followed his remarks was painful; no one challenged his statement. One gentleman remarked that the influence of the Saturday keepers killed the proposed Sunday law in the last legislature.

All over the State this spirit of religious legislation is earnestly and tirelessly at work. All sin and calamity is laid at the door of Sunday work and non-attendance at church. Surely the word of God has not spoken in vain. It is a fearful thing for men to band themselves together against the Lord and against his Anointed. All the while he loves them and would save them, but there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby they may be saved but the name of Jesus. The name of "good citizenship" or any other kind of human citizenship, will not do. It is "not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord God of hosts."

The gospel of Christ is the power of God. Take it, read it, believe it, obey it, and as a laborer together with God, in his good and revealed time a reign of righteousness will destroy sin and fill the whole earth.

Butte, Mont., June 3, 1899.
