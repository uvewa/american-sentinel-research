The American government of Cuba has decreed a censorship of the Cuban press, as a means of promoting the restoration of peace on the island. The announcement of this step was the signal for an outburst of violent opposition from the Cuban papers. *The Independencia* speaks of it as a "horrid crime against a free people;" and *The Porvenir* says: "Cuba has fallen from her position of a dignified Spanish colony and become an abject slave of the intervener."

A censorship of the press in time of peace is contrary to the Constitution of the United States, which declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, . . . or abridging freedom of speech or of the press." An attempted censorship of the press in this country would be resisted and denounced as governmental tyranny and despotism. What fault then can be found with the Cubans for viewing the censorship as they do? The Spanish government censored the news in time of war; but now the American Government censors it in time of peace.

On the whole, the "pacification of Cuba" seems to be proceeding along lines discouragingly similar to those followed by other nations in the "pacification" of the inhabitants of a desirable territory. It is not surprising that the question of annexation is coming more and more to the front in the discussion of Cuban prospects.
