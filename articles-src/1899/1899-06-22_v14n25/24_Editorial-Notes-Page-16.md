NUMBER 25 of the SENTINEL completing half the volume, the regular issue following will be omitted, and the next number will be dated July 6.

To quote the Declaration of Independence to an expansionist, is now in effect very much like flaunting a red rag in the face of a bull.

The process of liberating Cuba has now progressed to the point where a press censorship is deemed necessary in Santiago, although it is not a time of war, but of peace. The Cubans there think the liberating process is progressing the wrong way; and that has a decided appearance of being the truth.

DOLEFUL echoes come from the Peace Congress at The Hague. A deadlock has been reached, and the delegates are awaiting instructions from their respective governments. Each of the powers participating has the right of giving a decisive veto to any measure proposed, and no measure of importance yet proposed has succeeded in evading this veto. A German paper semi-officially announces that the congress is a flat failure, and about all that seems to be hoped for by the well-informed is that it will break up peacefully.

The gospel of God speaks Peace. But outside of this, it is only, "Peace, peace, when there is no peace." "There is no peace, saith my God, unto the wicked." It will be proved that the Word of God is true.

The Declaration of Independence was the basis not of a struggle for freedom from bad men, but from bad principles. The men who were oppressing the colonies would soon have passed away, but so long as these were bound by the principle of taxation without representation,—by the principle, to use a more modern phrase, that government derives its just powers from "the consent of some of the governed"—they would have known no real freedom. "Some of the governed," as applied by the king and parliament, did not include the American colonies; and the colonies fought through seven long years to throw off that principle. Later, their descendants fought each other for five terrible years to throw out of American government what was left of that principle. And now, lo! it is established again as firmly as ever, by the new policy of imperialism. The poison is back again in the system, and must either be thrown off by another convulsion or prove fatal.

BISHOP W. A. CANDLER, of the Methodist Church, has been making an investigation of religious conditions existing to-day in Cuba. After several weeks' work in this line he reports that there is not one Protestant church building, so far as he knows, in all Cuba, while the papacy is intrenched in splendid church edifices, which have been built with money from the treasury of the State. He has issued a call for subscriptions to erect "the first Protestant church in Cuba."

The Filipinos are, we are told, to be taught self-government. To be taught anything successfully the pupil must have confidence in the teacher. The prospective teachers of the Filipinos are now slaughtering them and destroying their property to the utmost of their power. The query arises, therefore, how much further this slaughter and destruction will have to be carried before the Filipinos will comprehend the benevolent purpose of the Americans to teach them self-government and be brought into a frame of mind to desire instruction from America.

A CHRISTIAN Endeavor monthly, The Inland, published in St. Louis, Mo., refers to those Americans who have raised their voice against the shooting down of people in the Philippines, and the general ruin of war, as "traitors" who in any other country than America "would be summarily and speedily suppressed by the strong hand of the law." We hope the Christian Endeavor Society is not ready to indorse this as in harmony with its conception of Christianity.

WHILE legislatures and governments are setting aside the principles of religious freedom, it becomes all the more the duty of the individual to preserve these principles for and in himself. Whatever is done by the powers that be, no one need lose these principles out of his own heart and life; and that is where they will do most good to the individual.

It is announced that the world is about to have, on the authority of some eminent professors in Columbia, Harvard, and other well-known universities, scientific proof of the immortality of the soul,—of the survival of individual consciousness after death.

This "scientific" demonstration of immortality is to be had through experiments conducted with Spiritualist "mediums." It is to be "demonstrated" that the "spirits" of dead people exist and communicate with the living on the earth. The "seances" are held at the home of a prominent "medium" near Boston, Mass.

Whatever these eminent professors may prove, it is plain that the doctrine of soul immortality is contrary to Scriptures; and the "demonstration" they are to give will therefore be a manifestation of "science falsely so called." But coming from such a source, a "demonstration" of consciousness after death will have great weight with very many, and do much to swell the tide of human belief that flows into Spiritualism.
