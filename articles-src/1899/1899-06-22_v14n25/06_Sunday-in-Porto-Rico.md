**Sunday in Porto Rico.**—One who has made a special study of present conditions of life in Porto Rico, as affected by the long rule of Spain and the Catholic Church, writes us as follows touching the bearing of his observations on the alleged necessity of Sunday observance: "Four hundred years of labor in Porto Rico with no day of rest, has not resulted in any physical harm to the people. There is no weakness among them that cannot be directly traced to other causes; and no one has ever pretended to mention the failure to keep Sunday as a cause for any of the physical defects found among the people of the island.

"Phallic worship, by the progenitors of the Indies, or native Borinquin, laid the foundation for a slight-built race, and the indiscretions which have followed account for all the rest, coupled with unsanitary conditions and improper food."
