One of the revenges of history is now taking place in Bohemia. In the seventeenth century the Protestants of this country were virtually exterminated at the instigation of Rome. So horrible was the persecution and slaughter that the population was reduced from 3,000,000 to 780,000 in twenty years. Now there is a great revulsion from Romanism. The history of the past is rising up in judgment. In two cities over 2,000 Catholics have united with the Protestant churches, and the movement is going on under energetic leaders. It is true there is a political impulse to the movement, but it is gathering power and may issue in something better.—Canadian Baptist.

It has been decided by the peace conference that no more dum-dum bullets shall be used in warfare. Now that it has gone thus far, why can't the peace conference go a little further and decide that no bullets of any kind shall be used hereafter?—Chicago Times-Herald.

As a result of the despatch of the new international commission to Samoa, King Mataafa has advised his followers to surrender their arms, and this advice has been immediately acted upon. Were the European military powers so ready to show their sincerity in the cause of peace as this half-civilized potentate, the end of the barbarism of war must soon appear in sight.—Catholic Standard and Times.

The czar insists that seizing Chinese territory to build railways is strictly in line with his disarmament policy. He disarmed the Chinese.—Kansas City Times.

For every missionary landed in Africa there is landed 70,000 casks of rum, 10,000 casks of gin and fifteen tons of gunpowder to help "civilize" and "Christianize" the dark continent.—Chicago Times-Herald.

John Bull has one of those periodical fits of virtue whose transparent hypocrisy arouses the irony of the gods. Its present symptom is a rejection of the Sunday newspaper. What splendid Sabbatarian reverence! It is considered desecration of the Sunday to have newspapers vended on the streets and introduced into the home, but no one objects to have the type for the Monday morning paper set on Sunday, as it always is. We remember an extremely saintly and aristocratic newspaper proprietor now gathered to his fathers who felt this anomaly touch his conscience, and to prevent scandal always had the blinds pulled down and the shutters closed in the printing office on Sunday nights.—Catholic Standard and Times.

A STRONG clerical agitation has been started in this city [Rome] and throughout Italy, having for its object the creation of the pope as president of the international arbitration tribunal which it is expected will be established by the powers following the peace conference at The Hague. Before the conference both Russia and France tried hard to have a representative of the Vatican invited to The Hague, but Italy's opposition was so persistent that they had to give in. Now it is believed that all, or nearly all, the great powers would support the pope for president of the international tribunal and that in such circumstances Italy would not oppose his election.—Press cablegram from Rome.

BISHOP McCABE, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, is not content with our shot-gun and Bible policy in the Philippines. He now desires to carry the war into Europe and make the Sultan crawl. "I long to see the day," he says, "when Dewey will be before Constantinople demanding religious liberty for the Turks, with the bombardment of the Turkish capital as the alternative." If the United States is to continue its policy of intermeddling in the affairs of other nations the Sultan is a proper subject for attack. To be sure, the fighting Turks are a proposition totally different from the Spaniards, and the European powers might resent American interference in European affairs. But that would be quite immaterial. Have we not just thrashed Spain and made effete old Europe shake in her shoes? Let our fighting parsons have their way and Uncle Sam will soon be tackling all creation. Meantime, before Bishop McCabe begins a crusade for religious freedom in the Levant, Europe, it might be well for him to turn his attention to the question of religious freedom in Levant, Maine [where a preacher who had committed no crime was recently tarred and feathered by a mob].—Eastern Argus (Portland, Maine).
