Of the experiments of Professor Atwater, in the study of the drink problem, under the auspices of the Government, resulting in the announcement that two ounces of alcohol a day did no harm to the consumer, the New York Press says: "We await with something of apprehension the arrival of the entire community at the knowledge that it has a Government guarantee of immunity for this amount of what the English think the Americans call 'liquoring up.' The internal revenue will doubtless rise; but there will be grave doubts in many a feminine breast of the wisdom of a paternal government."
