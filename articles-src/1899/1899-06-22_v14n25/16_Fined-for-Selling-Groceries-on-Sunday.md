POLICE JUDGE EARNHART, of Columbus, Ohio, from whom the SENTINEL has quoted before in reference to Sunday enforcement, has given a decision sustaining the action of the Grocers' Association of Columbus for closing all grocery stores on Sundays. The case was that of grocer William Heinmiller, who was convicted of keeping open his grocery on Sunday, June 4, and fined $20 and costs.

In his decision the judge said, speaking of the wisdom of a weekly rest at regular recurring intervals:

"It is within the power of the general assembly to require this cessation of labor and to name the day of rest.

"Following this feeling the Christian Sabbath has been selected as the day of rest, and by section of 1033 of the R. S. it is unlawful to keep open the store upon the Sabbath for the transaction of business, works of necessity and charity excepted. By this definition all moral and religious consideration are excluded, and the legality of the acts rests upon the exercise of the police power."

But whether "all moral and religious consideration are excluded" or not in enforcing Sunday observance, is a question to be settled not by "this definition," but by the facts of the case. And those facts unite in testifying that "moral and religious consideration" are inseparable from the observance of a weekly day of rest.

The Creator said, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work." The Creator therefore divided the week into six working days, and the seventh day, the Sabbath; and to maintain that division in one's practice in life is certainly a "moral and religious" act, for it is obedience to the law of God. Not to obey God is immoral and irreligious. And this disposes of the idea that it is within the power of a general assembly to require a weekly cessation from rest and to name the day of rest. When a general assembly or a legislature can improve on the arrangement established by the Creator, when such a body demonstrates its possession of wisdom superior to God's, and of authority and power to set aside his arrangement and in its place put one of their own,—it will be time to proceed with the arrangement called for by the Sunday laws. But until then, God's arrangement must stand, in wisdom, in justice, and in the practice of all those who would show themselves loyal to him.
