JUDGE EARNHARDT, of Columbus, Ohio, has just given a decision declaring that Sunday selling of groceries is not a work of necessity, and does not therefore come under the exemption clause of the Sunday law. In most other places Sunday selling of groceries within specified hours is reckoned as a work of necessity and allowed. In New York City the other day a case against a delicatessen dealer was dismissed by the magistrate because he construed the law as allowing such stores to remain open. There is a conflict of opinion in the interpretation of Sunday laws, as well as a conflict in the demands of the laws in the different States. All of which exposes the fatal weakness of the cause which such laws are meant to uphold.

The Retail Grocers' Association of Reading, Pa., has petitioned the mayor to issue an order for general Sunday observance in that city. The reason given by the *Reading Herald*, is that a number of grocers there keep open on Sundays, and the other grocers want them to be forced to close. Then grocers who want to keep Sunday can do so without being tormented by the thought that while their stores are closed and themselves resting, some other grocers are taking in money. For who can enjoy Sabbath-keeping if it is to be at the expense of loss in trade? Who can enjoy a religion he doesn't get for nothing?

The mayor of Reading has notified proprietors of pool rooms and resorts where gambling machines are operated that such things must not be run on Sundays. This was done upon complaint made by certain ones who are concerned for the "preservation of the Sabbath" and the "recognition of moral principle." What do such people say by this action but that pool rooms and gambling machines violate moral principle only on Sundays, and that the preservation of the Sabbath does not call for people to be good on any day but Sunday?

There is a revival of Sunday enforcement at Macomb, Ill. The mayor has ordered all saloons to be closed, and has prohibited the selling of Sunday newspapers.

The biennial convention of the Lutheran Church held recently at York, Pa., passed this resolution on the Sunday question: "Resolved, That we greatly deplore the growing spirit of Sunday desecration, and that we urge all our pastors to protest against it in their public and private ministrations."
