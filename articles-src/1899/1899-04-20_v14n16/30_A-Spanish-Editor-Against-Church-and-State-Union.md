## A Spanish Editor Against Church and State Union.

A Spanish paper published in Madrid—*Las Dominicas del Libre Pensamiento* (The Dominicals of Free-thought)—in a recent issue boldly attacks Spain's union of church and State as being the real cause of Spain's downfall. Under the heading, "The True Enemy," the editor refers to "clericalism" as being contrary both to Christianity and to sound national policy, and points to absolute separation of the state from the church as the only remedy for the evil into which Spain has fallen. An English exchange gives the following extracts:—

"Everywhere, in every language, and in every tone, the press is repeating that Spain's ruination is due to clericalism; it is due to the friars, the Jesuits, and their motley horde of hypocrites, ignoramuses, and fanatics, hysterical women, self-seeking men, and beggars; and now what do we find? Programs of regeneration by the hundreds, but in not one of them is any allusion made to the unanimous opinion of the civilized world, which says to us this: 'If you want to reform you must spend your money in useful things of this world instead of spending it in religious mummery, bishops, canons, friars, monks, Jesuits, and other people, who are worthless for the realities of life. If you want to be free and independent, you must be educated, and thus escape hypocrisy and fanaticism; you must learn political economy; you must govern yourselves morally; you must take liberty, justice, and science for your idols. If you will not do this we will divide up your territory among ourselves, for in this world those who are not free, just, and educated cannot be independent.'

"The Spanish press is continually citing the opinions of European politicians. Here is what an eminent writer of Bolivia says in an article that has been widely copied by the American newspapers:—

"No, it is not the brutal cannon of the Yankee that is to kill Spain—it is the friar, it is that sword whose hilt is in Rome and whose point is everywhere; and the one to give the friar his coup de grace is the spirit of the New Age, the sword of democracy. The refulgent ray of liberty is now passing over Spain. Rise to the emergency, ye American nations who are fettered to clericalism!"

"Why are England, Germany, and the United States strong? Why is Russia progressing and enlarging its domains at a fabulous rate? Because they are nations emancipated from clericalism. Why is France rolling and pitching in the tempestuous sea of politics? Because she carries clerical ballast.

"And clericalism need not be confounded with religion. That is the trick of the clergy, and the unthinking Catholic herd are easily duped by it. Germany, Russia, and England are religious nations, but what has religion to do with clericalism?

"Religion, so far as it represents ideas, traditions, beliefs, philosophy, sentiment, is respectable and attractive. When it is converted into power and theocracy—into an absorbent and despotic power which seeks to govern, guide, and exploit a man's whole life in public and private, in little things and great, which throttles thought in an iron band and presumptuously arrogates the civil power to itself, under the pretense of having authority thereto from God—then this so-called religion is a hateful and devilish thing; it brutalizes communities, degrades men, and drags nations down to poverty, ruin and disgrace.

"Here is what the Founder of the Christian religion himself said, and heretics indeed must those people be who oppose his words while claiming to be religious: 'Render unto Caesar what is of Caesar and unto God what is of God.' It is no business of God to dominate and subjugate; it is no business of God to use powder and lead against any one; nor is it a God-like business to take possession of the riches of the earth, to wear purple, gold, and precious stones, to keep the people in ignorance, to make a system of double-dealing, to set up hierarchies with despotism on top and craven servility underneath. For all this simply corresponds to the legendary spirit of evil, personified in the devil.

"Will our nation open its eyes to reason and common sense?

"Let it not be said that Spain is poor, and for that reason a rapid regeneration is out of the question.

Spain is rich, but it uses its riches to be on good terms with God while it is on very bad terms with itself and with the other nations of the earth. It is like the fanatic hidalgo who gives his gold to the priest to save his soul and meanwhile starves himself bodily and mentally and lives without the comforts and sanitary surroundings that befit his rank. Hopelessly crack-brained, the poor fellow does not see that while he is sacrificing himself to be all right with God, the man who claims to represent God on this earth is waxing fat amid unwonted luxury, enjoying the pleasures of the flesh to satiety, and laying up treasures for his own. The spiritual part of the mass satisfies the hidalgo; the material part fattens the priest.

"The regeneration of Spain must rest on these immovable bases: the absolute independence of the state; the limitation of the church to its Christian mission; the appropriation for governmental purposes of those immense resources on which the clergy, the monastic orders, and the Jesuits now depend; absolute liberty of conscience.

"Without applying these principles, all the rest would be simply taking the body of a miserable consumptive and covering it with bright-colored ribbons and fancy trappings so it would look fair to the eye.

"The plague-spot is inside. The microbe is well known. All the doctors in the world are pointing it out to us, and they agree unanimously."
