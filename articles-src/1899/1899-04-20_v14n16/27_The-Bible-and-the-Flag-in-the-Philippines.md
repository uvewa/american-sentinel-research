"One of the most important results of Dewey's victory," says a New York paper, "will be a Bible printed in Tagalog," for distribution among the Filipinos by the missionaries who will follow the American flag in the islands. Perhaps if the Bible had gone before the flag instead of behind it, there would have been a great many more converts and a great many less dead people in the islands now.
