The more children there are raised according to the principles advocated by president Hall, the more will the world be filled with restless and discontented people. The more the fighting and hating instincts, and the selfish propensities in general, are trained in the children, the more people will there be who are ready to oppress their fellowmen, and the more readily will the oppressed resist their oppressors in the same selfish spirit. The discontent which is viewed as a hopeful sign, will not, when "it has sway," result in a "reconstructed and liberated world;" for it is but the discontent of one class in society against another, and represents but a contest for supremacy between them; and there is nothing gained for peace and prosperity by a change in the ascendency from one class to the other. It is selfishness that leads men to oppress their fellows; it is selfishness that prompts the formation of the Trusts and other combines by which capital is bringing distress upon the ranks of labor; and in the methods employed by the latter to combat their oppressors, selfishness is no less a controlling motive. There is the same tyranny on both sides, the same hatred, the same selfish passions, because the representatives of both sides are essentially the same in character. The difference between them is only a difference of circumstances. But there must be a difference in character, not in circumstances merely, before peace and prosperity can spring up from scenes of discontent and strife. Revolutions in society do not always bring the results anticipated. The French Revolution ended the tyranny of the ruling class, only to let loose the worse tyranny of the mob and the commune.

No one class in society ought to oppress or seek to dominate over another class; and it is the dream of visionary reformers that by legislation or by the ballot or by revolution society can be so reconstructed that oppression will disappear and the long sought reign of righteousness be ushered in. This can never be so long as selfishness is harbored in human minds; for so long as it is there, men will seek their own advancement at the expense of others, or at least regardless of others' welfare, and will never stop short of the same oppressive conditions which exist to-day. Selfishness, indeed, never knows when to stop, but is continually urging men on to greater lengths of departure from the path of peace and safety.
