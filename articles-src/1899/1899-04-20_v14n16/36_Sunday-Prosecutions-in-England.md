An exchange reports the following:

"There has been a disgraceful increase of prosecutions for Sabbath-breaking in England and Wales during the past twenty years. In 1878, under the law of Charles II., which dates back about two hundred and fifty years, the total number of prosecutions for Sunday trading was 597. In 1888 it was 2,549, and in 1897 it was 3,729. In the twenty years these prosecutions aggregated 45,587. The Reformer, which gives the number of prosecutions each year, does not say how many convictions have been found, nor the amount of punishment in fines or imprisonment. No doubt the time spent in jail by Sabbath-breakers would amount to a period much longer than the added terms of persons sentenced for leze-majesty in Germany, to the great horror of pious Britons, who vow that they will never be slaves."
