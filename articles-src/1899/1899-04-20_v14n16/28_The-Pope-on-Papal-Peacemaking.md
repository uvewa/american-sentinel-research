While the subject of the czar's peace conference is before the public, the pope deems it an opportune time to call attention to the great things accomplished by the papacy in past times in preserving the peace. "Every time the church has intervened directly in the serious affairs of the world," he says, "it has assured public welfare; and the popes have often stopped oppression and secured truces and peace treaties. Civilization would have perished without papal authority to vindicate the supremacy of right over might."

But somehow, upon all this history is strangely silent.
