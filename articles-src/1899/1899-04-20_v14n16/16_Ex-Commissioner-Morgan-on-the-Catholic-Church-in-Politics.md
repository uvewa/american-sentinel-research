## Ex-Commissioner Morgan on the Catholic Church in Politics.

HON. THOMAS J. MORGAN, Commissioner of Indian Affairs under President Harrison, gives in a San Francisco journal, by request, a "brief statement of the recent attitude of the Roman Catholic Church regarding the education of the Indians, especially with a view of recording its position in reference to the appropriation of public money for sectarian uses." Being in a position to know fully the facts relating to this subject, Mr. Morgan's statements are entitled to full credence, and should be of interest to every American citizen. They show that the AMERICAN SENTINEL and all those engaged in calling public attention to ecclesiastical encroachments upon the domain of the civil government, are not raising a false alarm or fighting a man of straw; but that the enemy alleged to be combatting the principles of free government in these United States is very tangible, and the danger which threatens is very real.

The ex commissioner speaks of the establishment in Washington of a "Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions," which "stood as the representative of the Roman Catholic Church in American politics." In connection with this statement let it be remembered that this is not the only ecclesiastical bureau established at the seat of the national Government to influence legislation; that there is a Protestant "Reform Bureau" there under the management of Rev. W. F. Crafts, which is doing even more to undermine American principles separating church and tate than is the Catholic bureau, and has the support of the largest religious organizations in the land. What Mr. Morgan says with reference to the Catholic establishment applies equally in principle to this establishment run by Mr. Crafts and the religious combines calling themselves Protestant.

We have space only for the most pithy of the statements of Ex Commissioner Morgan upon the subject in question. These are as follows:—

"There had long been established in the City of Washington an institution known as the 'Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions,' having a president, director, secretary, and other officers and clerks, which had for its specific work the supervision of the education of Indian children in Roman Catholic institutions; for a broader mission the securing of appointments of the largest possible number of Roman Catholics in the Government Indian Schools, for a still larger mission the securing of the appointment of agents, clerks, and other appointees in any branch of the Indian service; and for a still wider object the securing of such legislation as would be helpful to the Roman Catholic Church, and the preventing of any legislative or administrative action that could in anywise interfere with its widest possible sphere of activity among the Indians. This bureau, as organized, stood as the representative of the Roman Catholic Church in American politics. It had apparently the confidence and the support of the Roman hierarchy; was in touch with the representative men of the church everywhere; had its agents and representatives on the Indian reservations; was ceaseless in its vigilance and activity in the lobby and the committee rooms of Congress, and did not hesitate to urge its claims for sympathy, support and advancement not only upon cabinet officers but even upon the President of the United States. It was a compact, well-constructed, aggressive, efficient machine, organized for the promotion of the political interests of Roman Catholicism, and ready to use any and all means essential for the accomplishment of its purposes. It seemed utterly unscrupulous.

"The chief of the Educational Division in the Indian Office, who had the practical oversight of the entire system of education, whose duty it was to recommend to the commissioner the appointments and removals of teachers and other subordinate officers, was a Roman Catholic. He had few, if any, qualifications for the position he occupied, but was a zealous churchman and used his power to the utmost for the promotion of the interests of his church. Several government schools were placed entirely in the control of the Roman Catholics; a cross was erected over one of the buildings; another government building, costing $40,000, was turned over to a bevy of nuns imported from Canada; a Roman Catholic Church was built in its immediate vicinity, and the whole establishment, church and school, was as much a convent as though it stood on the banks of the Tiber. The Roman Catholic catechism was introduced as a part of the daily curriculum in government schools, and the pupils were zealously taught to believe that the Roman Catholic Church was the only true church. Wherever it could be done Roman Catholics were appointed either as superintendents, matrons, principals and teachers, or, if these places were not available, then to such subordinate positions as were within reach. Every effort apparently was made to monopolize the Indian service and to make it tributary to the papacy.

"The director of the Catholic Bureau, or his representative, was in almost daily communication with the chief of the Educational Division of the Indian Office and practically directed his action in everything pertaining to the Roman Catholic interests. It is not too much to say that the Bureau of Catholic Missions had usurped to a large extent the functions of the Government Bureau of Indian Affairs.

"The existence at the capital of the nation of an organized lobby, established in the interest of the Roman Catholic Church and prosecuting its work zealously and tirelessly, was at once an impertinence and a menace to Republican institutions. It sought covertly to secure, so far as its influence went, all the practical results that would have flowed from the recognition of the Roman Catholic Church as the established national church. The Protestants had no such central organization and made no concerted effort either to secure ecclesiastical advantages for themselves or to in anywise prevent the unconstitutional aggressions of the Romanist hierarchy.

"In 1877 the United States Government entered upon the work of providing for the Indian youth a system of public education, supported by appropriations out of the public treasury. It had for many years made special appropriations for Indian education and in fulfillment of treaty obligations or in return for land or other concessions made by the Indians, had provided schools and teachers for them; but in 1877 it appropriated the sum of $20,000 out of the public treasury, money which did not belong to the Indians, but which was in all respects public funds. This appropriation increased from year to year until in 1886 it reached the sum of $600,000; when I entered upon my duties as commissioner, in 1889, it had swollen to $1,300,000 and four years later, when I left the office, the total appropriations of public money, exclusive of amounts paid out of Indian funds, was a little more than $2,300,000.

"When the Roman Catholics saw the growth of these appropriations for Indian education, they eagerly seized upon the opportunity thus presented to profit to the utmost possible extent by securing as large a share of this money as could be obtained.

"Some other denominations who were carrying on work among the Indians had also been receiving Government assistance, and the schools thus maintained by the churches, partly at their own expense, but largely at the expense of the Government, were practically mission schools.

"The Roman Catholics baptized into their fellowship not only the children, but as many as possible of the adults, asserted their right to claim them as communicants in their church, resented as an affront to them every effort on the part of other churches, and even on the part of the Government itself, to secure for their schools any children who at any time had been enrolled in any Roman Catholic institution.

"The Roman Catholic schools are mission schools, parochial schools, church schools, whose chief and almost only aim is to make converts to Catholicism, and to train their pupils to be good Catholics. The basis of all their work is the Roman Catholic Catechism. Many of the teachers know little of American life, and apparently care less, speaking very imperfect English. Many others are inexperienced nuns, and few, if any of them, are trained teachers. Catholic education of Indians has never been successful, and they can point to no leading Indians as a result of their efforts. An eminent Roman Catholic said to me that there never had been an Indian Roman Catholic priest. The subtle influence of their schools has been to awaken in the Indians suspicion and distrust, and they have bred disloyalty and incited resistance to the Government. . . .

"Soon after I had entered upon my duties, July 1, 1889, I was waited upon by Archbishop Ireland, representing the hierarchy, and Father Willard, an officer of the Catholic Bureau, and was asked by them if I would renew the contracts for the Catholic schools for the year to come. I answered that I would.

"They stated that they wished a contract for some new schools, and that they would like a much larger appropriation for their work among the Indians than they had ever received before, and intimated that when other buildings which they had in contemplation had been erected they should ask for still larger sums.

"I replied that I did not believe in the policy of appropriating public money for sectarian uses; that I believed in the separation of church and state, and that if churches did missionary work they should do so at their own expense. It was the duty of the Government to provide for the education of the Indians and it should do this in a system of schools, similar to the public schools of the country, which should be neither partisan nor sectarian. I said distinctly, however, that I did not propose, inasmuch as the contract system had been long in existence, to introduce any radical, abrupt change in the policy of the Government; that I would not interfere with any vested rights that they might have, or do anything that could be justly regarded as unfair or unjust; that I would treat the Roman Catholics precisely as I treated any other church or body of Christian people. I said that I would renew their contracts, for the year to come, for the schools already in existence which belonged to them, but that I would not extend the contract system; would enter into no contracts for new schools; that I proposed to take charge of the buildings which had been erected by the Government and to maintain in them Government schools, and that I should make it a part of my business to improve and extend the system of public education for the Indians. . . .

"Soon after this I had occasion to dismiss from the Indian Office, for incompetency, insubordination, and other sufficient reasons, the chief of the Educational Division, already alluded to, thus committing a third offense against the Roman Catholic Church: Roman Catholics had been dismissed from the public service; the demands of the church for an indefinite extension of the policy of subsidizing its mission schools at Government expense had been denied, and a trusted tool of the Catholic Bureau, who had prostituted his position to ecclesiastical ends, had been dismissed from the public service. . . .

"This was the beginning of a contest which is without a parallel in our political annals. A strong delegation of representative men was appointed by the Catholic Congress at Baltimore to wait upon President Harrison and state their grievances, requesting the removal of the commissioner from office. The President received the delegation respectfully, listened attentively to their charge, satisfied himself by personal inquiry that the accusations of unfairness and discrimination against the Catholics were false and unfounded, and politely but firmly declined to remove the commissioner.

"An attempt was then made to influence public sentiment. Long inflammatory articles, full of misstatements and libelous in their character, were printed in obscure Washington newspapers, boldly charging upon the Superintendent of Indian Schools and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs a definite purpose to make a clean sweep of all Catholics from the service, to destroy, if possible, the Roman Catholic Indian schools, to uproot Catholicism, if it might be, among the Indians, and in short to conduct the Indian Bureau as an anti-Catholic machine. A more gross, false, malicious, utterly unjustifiable charge, was never made against any public official, and the authors of the falsehoods well knew it. These accusations, however, were caught up and reproduced in a large number of Roman Catholic newspapers, creating a very widespread conviction in the Roman Catholic mind that the Indian Office was a nest of bigotry, and that its policy of intolerance was upheld by President Harrison.

"A very persistent, carefully-planned effort was made to defeat the confirmation by the Senate of both the commissioner and the superintendent of schools; the falsehoods and calumnies just referred to were printed in two formidable pamphlets and presented, together with a formal protest by the Roman Catholic Bureau, asking the Senate to reject the nominations of the officers named, alleging that they were unfit persons to fill the positions to which they had been appointed. Apparently the entire hierarchy, from the cardinal down, including I should say, without exception, all the most prominent and representative prelates, joined in this extraordinary effort of one church seeking solidly to prevent the confirmation by the United States Senate of the appointment of officers of high rank in the public service, simply because they were not acceptable to that church. It is needless to go into a detailed account of the methods adopted to accomplish their end. Let it suffice to say that the Jesuit priest, who planned the campaign and wrote a history of it afterwards, said in substance that nearly up to the day of the vote in the Senate it seemed almost certain that his plan would succeed, and he was very greatly chagrined and mortified when it failed. . . .

"Prominent Roman Catholic prelates attempted to defeat the renomination of President Harrison because of his attitude on the question of Indian education [charging him with being a bigot]. . . . He was in no sense a 'bigot,' and the charge preferred against him by the Romanists was not only false, but it was intolerant and introduced a religious test of the worst kind into our politics. . . .

"It never will be known how large a factor in the contest was this effort of the Roman Catholic Church to overturn an administration and bring about an economic revolution, with all the attendant evils that have followed. A great variety of causes combined to effect the result, and one of them was undoubtedly the attitude of the Romanist hierarchy. Indeed, prominent Roman Catholic journals boast that this was the determining factor, and that it was the Roman Catholic vote that defeated President Harrison.

"However this may be, the fact is patent and it is that for which this article has been written, and which I wish to make most emphatic, namely, that the Roman Catholic Church in America, numbering from 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 of adherents, with a voting population of possibly a million and a half, constituting thus a tremendous factor which in almost any political contest holds 'the balance of power,' stands ready to use this vast power for the promotion of its own ecclesiastical interests at whatever expense to the general public. It thus ceases to be merely a church, a body of individual Christians seeking to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and becomes a vast political machine, dominated by men who are not in sympathy with American institutions, who have been trained in the political philosophy and methods of the Old World, who believe sincerely that the pope is God's vice-gerent on earth, that he is the head of a sovereign state, justly entitled to rule absolutely; that the state ought to be subordinate to the church, and that the Roman Catholic Church should at all times and under all circumstances seek to gain for itself every possible advantage in American politics.

"The Roman Catholics have assumed an attitude on the Indian School question that is un-American, unpatriotic, and a menace to our liberties. I challenge the course they are pursuing, as that of a corrupt ecclesiastico-political machine masquerading as a church, a course that has been without precedent, and without justification. Its spirit has been that of the Inquisition, its methods those of the disreputable politician, and its agencies, intrigue, secrecy, conspiracy, falsehood, and slander. These are very grave charges, but they are justified by the facts.

"The apologists for the Roman Catholic Church, who insist that in America it is becoming liberalized, will find food for reflection in the significant fact that one of the most aggressive and influential leaders of this Roman Catholic attack upon the Governmental Indian policy, was the archbishop who now poses as the representative of the so-called liberal, or American party of that church."
