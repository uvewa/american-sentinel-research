## Infallibility and the Philippine Question.

Edward Everett Hale, in "Christian Register."

ATTENTION has once or twice been called to the curious tenure by which Spain held the Philippines, and to the fact that, in the view of history, she had no more right to dispose of them than the king of Ashantee.

But attention, though called, has never responded. Nobody in authority, whether at Madrid or at Lisbon or Rome, has chosen to give any definition as to the Spanish or the Portuguese title.

Spain has held the islands under the treaty of Tordesilla, in which the rival kings of Spain and Portugal agreed to be bound by the papal bull of 1493.

That bull established a meridian of longitude one hundred leagues west of the Canary Islands, as the boundary between the newly-discovered countries visited by Spain and Portugal. Spain was to have all west of this meridian, and Portugal all east of it.

When, not long after, Brazil was discovered, it proved that Brazil ran out into the Atlantic so far as to cut this meridian, and Portugal held all east of the line even to this day.

When, a few years after, Magellan, sailing under the Spanish flag, crossed the Pacific, sailing northward, he stumbled on the Philippines. He thought, or said he thought, that they were within the Spanish half of the world, counting from the original meridian established as the line of the division by a pope whom he and the king of Spain and the king of Portugal all called "Infallible."

But the sun and the stars and astronomy and the truth were against Magellan's calculations. His longitudes were wrong. Anson proved them to be wrong in the middle of the last century.

Since that time it has been known that, under the pope's grant, Spain never owned the Philippines an hour.

Under that grant they belong to Portugal, and have belonged to Portugal since Magellan discovered them.

Suppose that the king of Portugal had sent an embassy to the treaty commissioners at Paris last summer, who had said: "Gentlemen, you need not trouble yourselves about what should be paid for the Philippines to Spain. My august master owns them. If anybody wants them, he must come to us." What would have happened? This will never be known. The king did not send the envoy, and this curious question was never asked.

But one is tempted to ask why the court of Rome does not ask a question of the courts of Spain and Portugal. All three of these courts hold steadily to the doctrine that the pope is infallible. This means that no appeal can be made from his decision. He decided in 1493 that the Philippines, when discovered, should belong to Portugal. By the merest blunder in calculation, Spain held them for two hundred and fifty years, supposing all the time that she was complying with his decree, Portugal supposing the same, and the popes acquiescing.

But, in truth, since Anson's voyage, on the theory of both Spain and Portugal, the islands have belonged to Portugal. To this theory an infallible court must assent. The pope did not make the mistake in longitude. Indeed it may be doubted whether there ever was a pope who could calculate the longitude at all, let alone calculate it correctly.

If Portugal should to day put in a claim to the revenues of the Philippines for four centuries, and for the $20,000,000 now paid for them by the United States, what possible reply could be made, either in international law or in the law of the Catholic Church?

We shall be seriously indebted to any of our contemporaries of the Catholic journals who will reply seriously to this question.

It is not the old question whether Galileo was right or not.

It is the question why—if Spain held for the centuries between Magellan and Anson to a grant made in 1493—she should not hold to it in the centuries between Anson and Cervera.

The answer to this question should be easier to persons who believe that the pope's decision reflects for this world the Divine Omniscience. Such persons do not say that the pope cannot make a mistake. But they do say that no appeal lies from a decision made by the pope in council, like the bull of 1493.
