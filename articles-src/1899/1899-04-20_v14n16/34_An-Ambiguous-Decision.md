## An Ambiguous Decision.

*New York "Christian Advocate."*

The Supreme Court of Michigan has decided that reading without comment in the public schools from a book entitled, "Readings from the Bible," which is made up entirely of selections from the Bible, is clearly constitutional, especially where the pupils are not required to listen.

Such is a dispatch sent out from Lansing, the capital of Michigan, on the date on which the opinion was filed.

If the "especially" is a part of the language of the decision, it is a Bunsby-like utterance. Summaries of decisions are frequently very delusive. No child is required to listen to anything in a school. He is required to act as if he were listening, as a part of order, and may be punished for not learning what he is expected to recite. And no small child can listen unless what is said commands his attention. Comparatively few adults are disciplined to a point where they can listen to a wholly uninteresting reading from a person that they care nothing about.

It can hardly be expected that the Supreme Court will allow the children to make visible efforts not to listen. We await the full text of that decision, and it may prove that they meant that the children need not come to the school until after the reading.
