**Impropriety of Sunday Laws.**

*"Lutheran Witness."*

We cannot help seeing, in the first place, that all Sunday laws are prompted by the notion that Sunday is to be hallowed for the Lord's sake. Religious reasons have animated by far the greater number in advocating such laws; religious reasons also prompt the plaintiffs, and in many judicial decisions spiritual and worldly matters are sadly commingled.

The common designation of the day, as it may be heard also in court, the "Christian Sabbath," is an abomination according to Scripture. Christ is Lord also of the Sabbath, and we will let no man judge us in respect of an holy day, or of the Sabbath days, just as little as in meat, or in drink. We are safe, according to Scripture in esteeming every day alike. Matt. 12:8; Col. 2:16, 17; Rom. 14:5, 6.

But even though all the citizens of a State were to regard Sunday as a divine institution, in other words, if all were first-day Sabbatarians, the State would still have no right to concern itself with the matter. For how can the State demand the performance of religious duties?

As far as the Sabbath as a civil institution is concerned, much might also be said and has, indeed, been said by two judges of the Supreme Court of California in a noteworthy decision. It was pointed out that the State has no right to concern itself unnecessarily with the affairs of individuals, and that where the protection of common interests comes into consideration, the rights of individuals might be restricted to acquisition and possessions. Experience teaches that a community is endangered not so much by excessive labor on the part of the citizens, as rather by laziness. Then again one man requires more rest than another. If the legislature fixes a day of rest, it may also fix two, then it may also determine how much each citizen must work.
