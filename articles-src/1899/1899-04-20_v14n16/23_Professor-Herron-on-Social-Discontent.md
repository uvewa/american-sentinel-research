Another college authority, Professor Herron, of Iowa, in a recent lecture in Chicago, under the auspices of the Christian Citizenship League, said, speaking of the growing discontent in society:—

"This discontent, which grows more universal in its demand; this discontent, which cannot be hushed; . . . this discontent, which God grant may increase until it has sway in a reconstructed and liberated world; this discontent is what the ages have waited for; it is what the great heart of the Father has waited for; it is the direct outcome of the ideals planted in the world by Jesus, by Plato, by Buddha, by the Hebrew prophets, by all the men who have come into this world with ideas for liberation of the human soul."
