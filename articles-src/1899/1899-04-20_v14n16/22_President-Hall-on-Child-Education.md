For example, consider the following which is put forth in the name of education, by the president of a college of national reputation. According to the Chicago Times-Herald, of April 4, a "school of psychology," is being conducted in that city as part of the Chicago Kindergarten College course, at the opening of which an address was delivered by president Hall, of Clark University, Worcester, Mass. In the Times-Herald's report appears the following:—

"Dr. Hall said any child that did not suffer pain became sour and selfish. He thought blood-curdling stories were good for children. He told of a little girl who thought the story of 'Jack the Giant Killer' wading in blood was 'the beautifullest story' she had ever heard. He thought it was a good thing for boys to fight, as it developed their physical and moral courage. Punishment, he thought, was necessary, and a good scolding vocabulary was desirable. Teasing and bullying were commendable, but should be moderated by parents. It was a great mistake for a child to grow up too tender-hearted. Some children were so negative and inanimate that the badness in them needed to be stimulated."
