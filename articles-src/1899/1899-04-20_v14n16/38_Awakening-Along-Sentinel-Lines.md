WE have just received several very good orders for clubs and single copies of the SENTINEL from our good patrons, which lead us to believe that there is an awakening along SENTINEL lines. We are very much pleased to note this; and if there are any of our readers who think the time has not yet come to "awake out of sleep" and get before the people, through the SENTINEL, the principles for which it stands, we would earnestly request them to give the article, "The Issue in Pennsylvania," on the front page of this paper, a careful reading.
