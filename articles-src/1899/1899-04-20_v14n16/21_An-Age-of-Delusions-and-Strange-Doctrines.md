This is an age of delusions and strange doctrines, and fortunate is the individual who does not fall in some way under the influence of these things. No person need consider himself safe in this respect. They fasten alike upon the individual in public life, and upon the humblest dweller in obscurity. From the evil passions of men have developed abnormal conditions in society, and out of these have grown perplexing problems, social and political, in the attempted solution of which men's minds have been forced out of the channels of sober, sensible thought. Remedies are proposed which can only intensify the evils sought to be cured, and the very evils themselves are mistaken for omens of good. The light that is in men is being turned to darkness, and the world is filled with theorists and speculators who are ever wandering further from the truth.
