## Something to Talk About.

*"New York Journal."*

It is estimated that in 1890 there were 12,500,000 families in the United States, owning, in all, property worth $65,000,000,000. Of these, 125,000 families, or just 1 per cent. of the whole, owned $33,000,000,000, or more than all the rest of the people combined. Of the remaining $32,000,000,000, $23,000,000,000, or more than two thirds, were held by 1,375,000 families. That left 11,000,000 families, of whom half owned $8,200,000,000 and the other half only $800,000,000.

The 125,000 families at the top of the scale owned over forty one times as much property as the 5,500,000 families at the bottom, and nearly four times as much as 11,000,000 families, constituting seven-eighths of the population of the nation.

That was nine years ago. The concentration of wealth has gone on at an enormously accelerated rate since then, and it is going on now faster than ever before.
