A cable dispatch from Rome to the Chicago Record, under date of April 4, gives what purports to be the reason why the pope was not asked to be represented at the czar's peace congress. The Russian minister to the Vatican, it states, "to day expressed to Cardinal Secretary Rampolla the czar's regret that he found himself unable to invite the pope to be represented in the peace conference at the Hague, in consequence of his holiness not possessing an army." As a matter of fact the pope does possess an army, though it is so small as to be no factor in the problem of European disarmament. But that is no fault of the pope; he would like to have an army equal to the best in Europe.
