A SUNDAY-CLOSING campaign is being conducted in the upper portion of this city, says a New York paper, by the pastor of St. Mary's Protestant Episcopal Church. His plan of campaign, it is stated, is to "go about quietly appealing to the people who purchase goods on Sunday, and talk with the shopkeepers." He will make a "house to house canvass, appealing to each person." He is confident that he will in time secure complete Sunday-closing.

All this is proper enough, and so long as he confines his crusade to such methods we shall have not the slightest objection against it. We wish other Sunday crusaders could be induced to follow suit.
