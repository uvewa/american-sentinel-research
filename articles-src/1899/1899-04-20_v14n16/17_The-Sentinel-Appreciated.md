## The Sentinel Appreciated.

The president of a bank in a western city writes us the following:—

"Some unknown friend to me has kindly caused a Sentinel to be sent to me for some time back, and I find so many good things in the paper that I want to become a regular subscriber, and to that end enclose New York draft for $1.

"I feel under obligations to the friend who caused the paper to be sent to me, and if I knew who he was would willingly imburs him and tender him my thanks for the kindness."
