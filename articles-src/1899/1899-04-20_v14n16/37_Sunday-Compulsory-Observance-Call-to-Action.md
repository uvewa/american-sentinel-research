Do you know what is going on today in this country to secure the compulsory observance of Sunday as the Sabbath—to take away every citizen's liberty of choice in this matter, yours among the rest? If not, do you care to know? And how much do you care?

HEAR this that was said the other day in Pennsylvania, by a speaker representing a great combine of church organizations and labor unions: "We are going to have one vast confederacy and federation, but woe to him who stands up against it! Woe to him who desecrates the Sabbath!"

Does this mean anything to you? And do you feel like doing anything about it?
