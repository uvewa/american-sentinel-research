## General Notes

OCR source: Mistral OCR of PDF scan. Overall quality is good. The following uncertainties were noted:

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 2, Article "The Issue in Pennsylvania"
- **Issue:** The OCR renders some bold text sections as separate paragraphs divided by `---` horizontal rules (an OCR artifact from the original page layout). These have been joined as continuous paragraphs.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the text is clear; the `---` dividers are OCR formatting artifacts not content dividers.

### Page 5, Article "Ex-Commissioner Morgan on the Catholic Church in Politics"
- **Issue:** The word "tate" appears in the phrase "separating church and tate" — this appears to be an OCR error for "state."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "separating church and tate" — preserved exactly as OCR produced it, which likely reflects the original printed text minus one letter 's' (possibly a printing defect or OCR drop). The original almost certainly reads "church and state."
- **Confidence:** LOW for this specific word — transcribed as OCR rendered it; original likely reads "state."
- **Reason:** Preserving OCR output faithfully; flagging for review against original scan.

### Page 1, Epigrams Section
- **Issue:** The epigrams on page 1 are separated by `---` horizontal rules in the OCR. Each epigram has been treated as an individual short article per project guidelines (every item gets its own file).
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 16, Last Line
- **Issue:** The OCR ends with "CHOUTS AND FOODS JONS truth with error" — this appears to be garbled OCR of an advertisement or cut-off text at the bottom of the final page. It has been omitted as it is not intelligible content.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Omitted
- **Confidence:** N/A — garbled text, likely an advertisement or OCR artifact from page border

### Article 14, "The Constitution of American Imperialism.—No. 1" by John D. Bradley
- **Issue:** The footnotes use symbols (*, †, ‡, §, ||, **) which repeat within the same article in two different sets. The OCR renders all footnotes at the end of the article rather than at their page-bottom positions. They have been preserved at the end of the article as printed.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — footnote attribution to specific quotations may be slightly uncertain due to the symbol repetition across two pages.

### Attribution of "The Constitution of American Imperialism.—No. 1"
- **Issue:** The article is signed "BY JOHN D. BRADLEY." — this author does not appear in the known authors list. Initials "JDB" assigned.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit in the text.
