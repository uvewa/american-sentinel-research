## The Constitution of American Imperialism.—No. 1.

### BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

IMPERIALISM is the reign of arbitrary power. American imperialism is the same thing. Arbitrary power is lawless power—power acknowledging no limitation or restraint. It is a substitution of will in the place of law*—the will of the individual or individuals exercising the power. An eminent statesman and philosopher has well declared that "law and arbitrary power are in eternal enmity." In the very nature of things arbitrary power cannot conform to principles or remain within constitutional restraints. These things can have no part nor parcel with it, because it defies them.

American imperialists know this. They know it, not because they have stopped to reason it out, but because at almost every step they take they find the plain and unmistakable language of the fundamental law of their country ordering them to halt. Some of them have halted long enough to declare that this is not now a government of law, but a government of will; that constitutional government has been succeeded by arbitrary power. A great many have said this. Here are the words some have used in saying it:

"A Constitution and national policy adopted by thirteen half consolidated, weak, rescued colonies, glad to be able to call their life their own, cannot be expected to hamper the greatest nation in the world."* "This nation has become a giant who is no longer content with the nursery rhymes which were sung around his cradle."† "In the right to acquire territory is found the right to govern, and as the right to acquire is sovereign and unlimited, the right to govern is a sovereign right, and I maintain is not limited in the Constitution. I think it must be admitted that the right to govern is sovereign and unlimited. . . . Governments derive their just powers from the consent of some of the governed."‡

"To that great trust [the Philippines, Cuba, and Porto Rico], under the providence of God and in the name of human progress and civilization, we are committed. . . . Did we need their consent to perform a great act of humanity? . . . We did not ask; we were obeying a higher moral obligation which rested on us and which did not require anybody's consent. We were doing our duty by them with the consent of our own consciences and with the approval of civilization. . . . While the war was in progress we could not ask their views. Nor can we now ask their consent. . . . No one can tell to-day what is best for them or for us. I know no one at this hour who is wise enough or sufficiently informed to determine what form of government will best subserve their interests and our interests, theirs and our well-being."§

"The Declaration of Independence was made to suit a particular existing condition of things. . . . The Declaration meant simply that the colonies had become tired of the British domination, deeming it oppressive, and intended to set up a government of their own by the right of revolution. They were not laying down a principle for anybody except themselves, and they had no conception of the 'consent of the governed' as it is proclaimed by Mr. Bryan and the generally hypocritical gang who are sympathizing with him in the hope of cheating us out of our rightful conquests."||

"It is a favorite notion now to quote the words, 'Governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,' as if these embodied a law of application to all inhabitants alike. . . . It was never the intention [of the signers of the Declaration] to assert that the negroes or the savage race must give consent before just government should be established over them. . . . The Declaration of Independence was a formal notice that inhabitants of the colonies consented no longer to British rule."**

"We would inform Senator Vest that the idea that all men are created equal is not the fundamental law of this country. The fathers had better sense than to put that phrase in the Constitution. They wrote it in the Declaration which was simply their manifesto to European powers, and is not law."*

"We shall adhere to the provisions of the Constitution and the instincts of the future."†

"Resist the crazy extension of the doctrine that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed."‡

"The Constitution must bend."§

"We have outgrown the Constitution. It is not worth while to discuss it."||

What then has been done with the Constitution of American Republicanism? Has it been thrown into the streets, or has it been burned up lest a fragment of it be read?—No, neither of these things has been done. It remains in its accustomed place and speaks with its accustomed language, but it remains without limitation or restraint upon the men whom it was made to bind. But this is not all. It remains to "consecrate" and to "stamp legality" upon every act of unlimited and unrestrained power. As it thus remains it is the Constitution of American imperialism. We apologize for the abuse of the word "constitution." When the imperialists have revised the dictionaries, this impropriety of diction will doubtless disappear. But remember that when we speak of an instrument of unrestrained and unlimited powers as a constitution we are speaking of the constitution of imperialism.

But how is it possible for the Constitution of American republicanism to become the constitution of American imperialism? How is it possible for an instrument of delegated and limited powers to become the instrument of sovereign and unlimited powers? How is it possible that the same words and sentences that have constituted a republican and representative government can become the mainstays of an imperial and arbitrary system? Let Mr. Charles Denby, late United States minister to China and at present a member of the Philippine Commission, answer. We quote from the leading article of the February Forum at the point where Mr. Denby is showing how thoroughly constitutional is imperialism:—

"It will not do to say as a congressman said, 'What is the Constitution between friends?' but it may be said that it is the wisest and the most expansive document ever written by the hand of man. It is like the tent that Saladin gave to Richard. When it was folded it rested in a nutshell: when it was expanded whole armies could recline under its shade. The dear, glorious old document, it is always on the side of common sense, always on the side of progress, always ready to strengthen the glowing periods of the judiciary devoted to our country's honor, and to stamp legality on the great statutes of freedom. Expansive? Why, it is expansive enough to cover the world, if necessary; and it can contract when the time and the occasion demand contraction.

"The Constitution declared that no man shall be tried except by a jury of his peers. A jury is supposed to be twelve men. Bless you! We try Americans every day in China by a consul and two assessors; we try men accused of murder by a consul and four assessors; but the Minister must approve the death sentence. . . .

"The Supreme Court has passed on all these questions.* When a man was confined for life in a penitentiary in New York for a murder committed off Japan in a ship that flew the American flag, a writ of habeas corpus was refused to him by the Supreme Court. It held that his conviction was legal, although he was not tried by a jury. The Constitution had contracted to suit the case! . . .

"The Constitution is a great document. Interpreted by men supremely great, as it has been and is, it will consecrate just and wise laws made by Congress to take from the army the burden of maintaining law and order; and again, as often before in our history, cedant arma togae. . . .

"Elastic as the Constitution has been shown to be, it will stand forever as the bible of freedom."

Take with the above the following statement made by Senator Platt of Connecticut, in the United States Senate, Dec. 19, 1898:—

"These are indeed great principles [the principles of the Declaration and the Constitution]; they underlie our free institutions, but they are not capable of literal application."

In these quotations two of the most prominent and outspoken imperialists lay before us coolly and in very plain English the constitution of American imperialism, which they declare is the constitution under which the American Government is now being administered. These declarations should set every American to thinking seriously, for they are declarations which the American people cannot afford to look upon with indifference. We shall have more to say with reference to them next week.

* When we say law we mean law. A statute may or may not be law. It may receive all the sanction of government, and yet be only the lawless declaration of arbitrary power. It is law that "all men are created equal." and that "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." Many statutes have affirmed the contrary. They were not law but were rebellion against law.

§ President McKinley at Boston. Some one has said: "If it be true that the Philippines were entrusted to our hands by the providence of God—it ends the discussion. However, it is yet novel doctrine that public servants may substitute what they guess to be the will of God for the constitution and laws of the land. In this entire matter there has been too much certainty as to the Divine will, and too little attention to constitutional requirements and difficulties."
