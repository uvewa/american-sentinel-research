## A Proclamation of Conquest.

*"Chicago Record."*

The proclamation of President McKinley's commission to the subjugated inhabitants of the Philippines is a proclamation of conquest. As such it must grate upon the sensitive ears of those American citizens who still regard as eternal and of universal application the foundation principles upon which their own institutions are based. The document professes kind intentions, to be sure, and contains promises of liberal treatment to such as recognize and bow to the supreme and sovereign authority of the American republic: But the spirit of kindness which the proclamation breathes is the kindness which the conqueror has ever promised to his not too willing subjects. The proclamation recognizes no rights of the Filipinos, nor does it deem the consent of the governed a matter of any importance. The conquered are simply promised kind treatment and beneficent government as a condition of submission to an outside authority. What conqueror ever promised less? And where is it written in American institutions that the rule of a conqueror contrary to the willing consent of the ruled is not tyranny simply because beneficent?

Consider these two "regulative principles" for the guidance of the United States in its relations with the Philippines, laid down by the commission as principles of "cardinal importance":

1. The supremacy of the United States must and will be enforced throughout every part of the archipelago, and those who resist it can accomplish no end other than their own ruin.
2. To the Philippine people will be granted the most ample liberty and self-government reconcilable with the maintenance of a wise, just, stable, effective, and economical administration of public affairs and compatible with the sovereign and international rights and the obligations of the United States."

If the Filipinos submit to American rule and recognize our sovereign rights they will be well treated. If not, they but accomplish their "own ruin." Truly a sentiment worthy of a Napoleon!

The assumption underlying the proclamation of the President's commission—that the Philippine islands are permanently ours by right of purchase, or conquest, or both—ought not to be satisfactory to the American people. . . . The recognition of our authority may have been necessary to any proper solution of the Philippine problem; but, having done so much and having established our authority, it is now incumbent upon the United States to recognize to the full the right of the inhabitants of those islands to a voice in their ultimate disposition. If the Filipinos wish independence, like the Cubans, it is the duty of the United States, according to the principles upon which our own Government is founded, to recognize that wish and to prepare for its execution so soon as conditions make that course safe for all interests dependent upon us for protection.
