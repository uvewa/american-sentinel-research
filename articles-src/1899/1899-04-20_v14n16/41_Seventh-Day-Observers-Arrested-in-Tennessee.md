LAST January two citizens of Sanford, Tenn.,—seventh-day observers—were arrested for not keeping Sunday, and put under bonds for trial. The trials have just been held, and one of the defendants writes us of the result. He says:—

"The Lord gave us the victory. Judge Young, from Sweetwater, Tenn., sat on the bench, and treated us very fairly and kindly, as did also the sheriff and all attorneys present, including the prosecuting attorney, General Fletcher. The latter told us he prosecuted our Graysville brethren a few years since, greatly against his own wishes. He says our people are among the best citizens in that part of Tennessee."

Surely no State ought to maintain a law under which its judges and prosecuting attorney feel bound, much against their wishes, to prosecute its best citizens. Such prosecutions are not sustained by the best public sentiment and never accomplish anything beyond causing an expense to the State and gratifying the religious prejudices of a few people—always the instigators—who are not willing to tolerate any Sabbath observance out of harmony with their own practice.
