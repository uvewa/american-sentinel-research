The Apostle Paul represented a class of men who had learned to be contented and happy in this life without any revolution in society; and what he says on the subject is entitled to as much weight as are any utterances that come from platform and press to-day. The apostle had learned to be content with such food, raiment, and other temporal comforts as he had in this life; but his contentment was not that of indolence, for he was one of the most active, energetic characters known to history,—a man who most powerfully influenced human thought and life in his own day, and through all the centuries following. He had experienced a revolution, but it was in his own person and not in society. And here is the vital point of difference between the Apostle Paul as a reformer and the reformers of to-day. The man who has had a revolution in his own heart, his own personal life, by the power of God, is not discontented with his lot and does not want to see a revolution anywhere else; but the man who needs a revolution in his own heart, to drive out of it the discontent and the various elements of selfishness that are making him unhappy, wants to have a revolution in society. But if he could have such a revolution, he would not be any nearer to happiness than he was before.
