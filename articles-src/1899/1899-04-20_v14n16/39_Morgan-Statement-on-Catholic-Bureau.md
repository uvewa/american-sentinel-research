READ the statement given in this issue by Hon. T. J. Morgan, Indian Commissioner under President Harrison, with reference to the work of the Catholic Church in politics, as represented by the Catholic Bureau of Indian Missions established at Washington. It is somewhat long, but every paragraph is to the point. And remember as you read that this Catholic political bureau is still there, and has not in the least abandoned its determination of securing governmental recognition and support for the Catholic Church. And remember also, that a Protestant "reform bureau" is also in full operation at the same place, under the management of Rev. W. F. Crafts, which aims to force national legislation into religious channels and even to exclude from Congress such candidates as will not be controlled by it in the national legislature. And then ask yourself if there is any need in this country of such a paper as the AMERICAN SENTINEL, and if it ought not to have the earnest support of a large number of people, yourself among the rest.
