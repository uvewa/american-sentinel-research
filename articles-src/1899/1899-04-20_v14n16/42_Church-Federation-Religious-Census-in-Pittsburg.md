THE Church Federation in Pittsburg, Pa., has appointed 6,000 census takers to take a religious census of the city. Every family will be visited, and the religious standing of every resident will be ascertained and put on file for the use of the Federation. The Roman Catholics are in the project equally with the Protestants. It is claimed indeed that there are only 36,000 Protestant Church members in the city, out of a total population of over 400,000.
