In New Rochelle, Conn., Catholics and Protestants are arrayed in controversy over the question whether the Bible shall be read in the public schools.

The charter of the newly-made city contains a provision for such use of the Bible in the schools, and recently the Board of Education passed a resolution calling for its enforcement; whereupon many Catholic parents petitioned that their children be excused from the opening exercises. The Board at a special meeting decided to accede to these requests, and now it is provided that such children shall retire to a room set apart for them while the Bible is being read, after which they will go back to their various rooms to participate in singing and other exercises.

The necessity of such an arrangement to carry out the plan of Bible reading in the schools, demonstrates in itself the impolitic and impracticable nature of the undertaking.
