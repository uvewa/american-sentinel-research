A victory for Sunday opening has been won in this city by certain delicatessen shops whose proprietors were recently indicted by the West Side Sunday-Closing Association. A press item says:—

"The Grand Jury this afternoon [March 23] threw out the cases brought against Frederick Blaser, of No. 733 Amsterdam Avenue, and Abraham P. Krakauer, of No. 590 Columbus Avenue, the delicatessen dealers, charged with selling their wares on Sunday.

"Their cases were taken to the Special Sessions, and then taken to the Grand Jury as a test matter by the law firm of Black, Olcott, and Gruber.

"The Delicatessen Men's Association will hereafter keep their stores open on Sunday."
