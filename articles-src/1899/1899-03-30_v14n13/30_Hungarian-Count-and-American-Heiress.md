The papers announce the breaking off of an engagement to marry between a "charming young woman" of wealth living in Missouri and a Hungarian count, because the latter had agents in this country looking up the financial prospects of his fiancé. We hope this example will be followed by American ladies generally, notwithstanding it is a violation of all precedent in such matters.
