An exchange in this city prints the following in its issue of March 25:—

"The injustice inseparable from an alliance of church and state received a fresh illustration from an occurrence at the Essex Market, New York, police court, a few days ago. About twenty-five Hebrew boys, arrested for some such mischief as throwing stones or playing craps, were arraigned before the magistrate and fined. Their parents, who were in court, were in most cases too poor to pay, and the boys were committed to the Roman Catholic Protectory to serve a day for each dollar of their fines. It was in vain that the parents protested against having their children sent to an institution where another religion than that in which they were reared would be forced upon them. The objections were answered by the clubs of the court squad of policemen; the agent of the Catholic Protectory took charge of the boys, and in due time the city will get a bill for their maintenance. There is no excuse for such things occurring in a free country, and little reason for calling a country free where such things occur."
