"WHATSOEVER ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,"—sublime words from the lips of the noblest person who ever trod this terrestrial orbe. If we go to China, Japan, Corea, we find this grand principle theoretically defended by the priests of Buddha, Confucius, and Shintoism. Come further west to the vastly populated Hindoostan, Thibet, Beluchistan, and Burmah, and even there the propagandists of the Brahminical teachings, the numerous followers of the fire-worshipping Zoroaster, and the infatuated partisans of the intolerant Mahomet, discourse incessantly on the sublimity and grandeur of this divinely-given "golden rule." The barbarians, Incas, Vandals, and Goths, all admitted the necessity of the application of this glorious principle to every detail of their lives, as do the vast majority of nominal Christians of modern times.

This maxim is the basis of all human felicity, with the law of Jehovah as the prototype. Its rigid and universal observance would soon banish every semblance of inequality, intolerance, and the desire on the part of mankind to subjugate their fellowman to their conception of what is right and wrong. Whereas the absence of conformity to this celestial apothegm demonstrates the lack of true and vital Christianity, and but ensures the continuity of a loathesome and burdensome oppression, and usurpation of humanity's inherent rights.

Jesus Christ says, "If ye believe my words . . . ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." This is the very essence of religious liberty. It is only the truth as it is in Jesus that can liberate and restore us to the Edenic freedom enjoyed by our first fathers. Man by nature is "sold under sin" (Rom. 7:14), and consequently is now bearing the heavy yoke of Satanic servitude, from which he is unable to escape, try as he will, in his own strength. Rom. 7:24. The cause of man's fall was occasioned by his disobedience to God's law; and as a result of his continuing in his perverse course, he now finds himself in open rebellion against his Creator—an enemy of God. Rom. 8:7; James 4:4; Eph. 4:17–19.

Many well-intentioned people have struck upon the plan of petitioning the legislative assemblies to decree such laws as will prove effectual to ameliorate the condition of the people. They behold the entire depravity of the human race, and recognize how barren has been their effort to regenerate the masses; and as they look upon the mountains of vice and immorality that soar up to the firmament before them, they lose heart, and seek the governmental arm to exact statutes of such a character as will compel the inhabitants to live good moral lives.

While we would not accuse this class of persons of willingly harboring a design to curtail the rights and privileges of their dissenting brethren, yet as we shall strive to show, such must inevitably come as the result of religious legislation in any shape or form. Philosophy teaches us to deal with causes and not with effects. A governmental statute which aims to make more moral the citizens of any country, contends with effects only, and since it neither aspires, nor is in the least able, to reach the cause, it is useless.

The state is utterly incapable of subjugating sin, nor can it enforce morality, since man at best is impotent, and incapacitated from subduing iniquity on his own person. Mankind have essayed time and again to break through the servile coils which were woven about them, but their efforts were powerless, and they reluctantly have been compelled to admit of their failure to cope with sin, without the divine assistance. How then can a government, which is composed of frail and fallible men, do for the entire nation what the individuals who compose that identical government, are unable to do for themselves? Is it consistent for a man to attempt to legislate to make others moral, when he is utterly powerless to improve his own moral condition in his own strength?

Attempts were made in every century of this Christian era to effect the regeneration of society by law, but what has been the result? Take a rapid glance down through the ages, and we see that every experiment in this direction has terminated in the augmentation of hypocrisy among the timid, death-fearing element; or the martyrdom of thousands who were too conscientious to sacrifice principle in the least degree. Is the civil power to be trusted with the undertaking of purifying the heart of man from all corruption? Until it is in a position to successfully execute that all-important work, so long will it be disqualified from engaging in the equally significant work of regenerating society at large, by attempting to remove the moral cess-pools of depravity, which pollute and contaminate the whole of God's creation.

The only power that can successfully counteract and overcome the power to do evil, is the power of the gospel; this is the only effectual force which can prove more than sufficient to counterbalance the influence of evil upon the human race. As much washing avails not to obliterate the beautiful colors of the stained glass; so religious legislation is impotent to accomplish the mission upon which it is sent. Our legislators have just as much reason to sanction statutes to keep the angels in their present state of holiness, as to pretend to accept the responsibility of making the inhabitants of our fair universe, docile, good, moral creatures by human enactments.

If religious legislation receives the consent of the governed now, where, may we ask, will it draw the line of demarcation? If it can make us good, moral citizens on Sunday, why should not the same system be applied to improve the moral condition of the people on other and all days of the week?

The rights of one man are as sacred as the rights of a thousand. If a man dissents from the views of the vast majority, that should not in the least curtail his rights. Man has the right to dissent, and because of such dissension, nobody is justified in coercing him, or in intruding upon the sacred precincts of his conscience.

When the religious tenets of the majority are selected by a government, or taken under its special care as the state religion, there is made at once a discrimination in favor of certain of its subjects, to the exclusion and injury of the minority. The next step in logical order, is the taking of stringent measures to bring all dissenters into conformity to this legalized religion; and accordingly laws are decreed to enforce certain religious observances, and to authorize the imposition of civil burdens and incapacities upon all who refuse obedience. Thus it is that the first step in a union of the church with the state begets religious legislation, which in turn begets religious persecution, and a revival of the cruel deeds of the Inquisition.

God has made all men equal. He has bestowed upon every son of Adam the same inalienable rights and privileges; and none but a usurper would wish to trespass upon the sacred premises of his neighbor. God is no respecter of persons. He knows neither rich nor poor, black or white; all are alike to him, and all have the same privileges. The inalienable right of every creature is the right to worship his Creator according to the dictates of his own conscience, without being molested in any degree in the exercise of such religious duties.

Shall we take to heart this beautiful principle, and ever seek to do unto others as we should like them to do unto us? Let us think well upon this.

Argentine Republic.
