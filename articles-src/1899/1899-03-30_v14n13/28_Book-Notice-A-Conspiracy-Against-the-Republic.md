We have received a copy of "A Conspiracy Against the Republic," a pamphlet of one hundred pages, just issued by the author, Charles V. Waite, of Chicago. It relates to the efforts that have been made ever since this republic was established, and especially of late years, to commit the Government to a policy of religious legislation.

Among the subjects considered are, the relation of the church to the Constitution, early demands for religious legislation, Sunday mails, chaplains in Congress, taxation of church property, national support of sectarian schools, the Blair religious amendment to the Constitution, Sunday observance, the United States as a Christian country, and "God in the Constitution." The facts presented, says the author, "have been obtained at considerable expense of time and labor, and are absolutely reliable." It is his wish that these facts "shall serve to open the eyes of the reader, so that he may see more clearly that of which he before had but a faint conception, and thus be stimulated to active efforts to prevent the consummation of a great political crime."
