A copy of the *Amory Argus* (Amory, Miss.) has been sent us, in which appeared the following item in a column devoted to local topics:—

"East Hatley, the Advent town or colony, is still growing, two more buildings going up. They work six days in the week and keep the Saturday Sabbath. These people, we believe, are a good-meaning people, and have a perfect right to their religious belief, but they should not be suffered to trample upon our Sunday laws as they are doing by following their daily avocations on that day. How long, dear citizens and officers, will you suffer these people to go on unmolested? Hasn't the day come when this vile example which they are laying before our children will be forever removed?"

Every religious reform that ever came into the world had to begin by setting a bad example from a religious point of view. But what about the example of observing the seventh day as the Sabbath? Who set the first example in this? The first chapter of Genesis tells us that it was the Creator himself; and "the Advents," in common with all seventh day observers, are following the Creator's example, and doing it because He gave them the example and told them to follow it.

We can assure the writer of the item quoted that the children for whom he fears will not be in the least injured but quite the contrary, in following the example of the Creator.
