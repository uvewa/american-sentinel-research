# Uncertainties — v14n13 (1899-03-30)

## Article 01: "Power for the Church"

- **Issue:** The word "GOSEL" appears repeatedly in the large-display type on page 1. This is almost certainly "GOSPEL" with the "P" missing or damaged in the OCR source.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "GOSEL" — preserved as it appears in the OCR, since this is a display-type front page where damage to a single letter is plausible. However, the text makes clear the word intended is "gospel."
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR/print damage producing "GOSEL" for "GOSPEL"
- **Note:** The same word appears correctly as "gospel" (lowercase) on page 2, where the article continues, confirming the intent. The transcription preserves the OCR reading on page 1 as-is to match the source.

## Article 01: "Power for the Church" — "THEM" anomaly

- **Issue:** The phrase "WE MUST CONCLUDE THEM THAT" and "WHAT THEM IS THE TROUBLE" appear to use "THEM" where the intended word is "THEN."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "THEM" — preserved as it appears in the OCR source, as this may be a print error in the original.
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely "THEN" in original, OCR or print error producing "THEM"

## Article 19: "Sunday-Closing Crusade in Frankfort"

- **Issue:** The city name "Frankfort-on-the-Main" refers to Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The spelling "Frankfort" (without the 'k') was common in 19th-century American publications.
- **Transcribed as:** "Frankfort-on-the-Main" — preserved as printed.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — this is the standard period spelling, not an error.

## Article 08: Author attribution

- **Issue:** The poem "Sons of Old Freedom—Hark!" is attributed "BY FRANCES E. BOLTON." The initials "FEB" are used in the filename. Frances E. Bolton is not in the known authors list.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "Frances E. Bolton", author_short: "FEB"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — attribution is explicit in the text.

## General Note: Masthead aphorism

- **Issue:** The first masthead aphorism reads "THE WEDDOCK OF CHURCH AND STATE MADE NEVER AN UNIFUITFUL UNION." The words "WEDDOCK" and "UNIFUITFUL" appear to be OCR errors for "WEDLOCK" and "UNFRUITFUL."
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved as in OCR source in masthead.
- **Confidence:** LOW — "WEDLOCK" and "UNFRUITFUL" are almost certainly the intended words.
