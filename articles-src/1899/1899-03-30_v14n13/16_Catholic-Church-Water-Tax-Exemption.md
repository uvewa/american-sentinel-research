In an attempt to carry the doctrine of church exemption from taxation to the point of escaping the water tax, the Catholic Church in this city has just met with a defeat. The following press item states the facts in the case:—

"The application for a writ of mandamus made by the Dominican Church of Our Lady of the Rosary directing Water Commissioner William Dalton to relieve that institution from the payment of water tax was denied by Justice Russell in the Supreme Court yesterday.

"The motion for a mandamus was to test the right to exemption from water rent of all the Catholic parochial and educational schools and convents, and the amount at stake was several thousand dollars a year.

"Justice Russell said that the statute exempts from payment only homes for the reformation, protection, and instruction of poor babes and needy children."

If Catholic schools and convents are exempted from paying taxes, the taxes must still be paid; for exemption from taxation does not mean that the taxes are not paid by anyone. If not paid by these institutions, they must be paid by the public. But where is the difference between being taxed to pay the debts of a Catholic school or convent, and being taxed to support such institutions? We do not propose to help maintain what we believe ought never to exist.
