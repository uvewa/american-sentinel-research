Sons of old Freedom can it truly be
Ye hesitate to set another free?
Have ye forgotten so the tyrant's pain
That for a brother you can forge a chain?
Will ye now bind the captive's pleading hands
And set a despot o'er his conquered lands?
You! sons of freedom! in the nations' sight
Will ye repudiate your stand for right?
And set the world agape in scoff and scorn
And miss the destiny for which you're born?
For as ye're made a world-wide light, and so
Weakened the despot, turned the tide of woe,
Yet if ye turn again to hold in thrall
So shall your influence sway the law of all,
And selfish despots from your acts again
Will dare enslave the hands and souls of men.

Sons of old Freedom, are not all men equal
Endowed by their Creator? Mark the sequel
That follows bondage. Will ye dare the wrath
That falls upon the tyrant's blood stained path?
Can ye be reckless still to bear the weight
Of what your action means to all men's fate?
For when the nations groan to God, behold
His ear will hear them as in days of old,
And ye who forged the chain for men, will be
Bound by his law's unalterable decree.
Ye, who've known bonds and freedom, will ye bind
The helpless captive, and still say, "tis kind"?
A watching Heaven weighs your action in
The heavenly balances, and notes your sin.
Fill up the measure, mark the column's sum,
And then the unremitting wrath will come;
For heaven will flash its lightning through your gloom,
And lo, the pit ye digged, will be your doom.

Sons of old Freedom, weigh the words again,
And give the scepter where ye've bound the chain.
So shall all nations in humility
Honor your Christ Lord, and set all men free.
So shall the heavenly world with one vast voice
Strike on their harps of gold, and cry, "Rejoice!"
