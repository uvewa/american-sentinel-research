The Church Union, organ of the Romish party in the Church of England, defines its attitude towards state control by declaring, "We have denied and we deny the right of the Crown of England or the Parliament to determine the doctrine, the discipline and the ceremonial of the Church of England."

To which Sir William Harcourt, speaking for the state, declares:—

"What is the use of 'We' denying anything of the sort? 'We' might as well deny the right of the Crown and Parliament to tax the people. The only reply to this nonsense which it is necessary to give is that the Crown and Parliament when they enacted the Prayer Book in the teeth of the bishops and the clergy did determine all the conditions of the Church of England as established by law, and have continued to do so for more than three centuries. This is the kind of title which the law abiding English people have the habit of respecting, and it is not going to be set aside by a set of mutinous priests who have combined together to restore the mass and the confessional."

The Church of England having acquiesced in state establishment, cannot refuse to acquiesce in the price agreed upon in the bargain with the state for its support and protection, which is stated in Sir William's reply. The "high church" party want the "doctrine, discipline, and ceremonial of the Church of England" to be determined by the pope; all this party wants from the state is its support.

The present controversy without doubt represents the final fruits of Jesuitism, in Protestant guise, in the English church. The Jesuits have taken a large part of the church over to Rome and are now fighting to retain for it the support of the Protestant English state.
