The announcement of the new management that Sunday trains would be instituted on the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railway, has called out a protest from the Ministers' Union of Hoboken; as follows:—

"To the Officials of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company.

"GENTLEMEN: We have learned that you are arranging for a system of Sabbath day passenger trains with deepest regret. We are assured that we represent by far the majority of your patrons in deploring this action. We have regarded your company as deserving of highest praise in your strict observance of the Lord's day as far as practicable, and have seen a close relation between your phenomenal success and the high moral character you have maintained. We look with grave apprehension both for yourselves and others, in what we regard as a desecration of the holy Sabbath. We plead for your employees, who need and desire the day of rest, that they may be fitted to do more and better work and insure greater safety to the traveling public and property interest of the company.

"It is the conviction of your petitioners that no special inconvenience has been occasioned from your former plan. The increased accommodation for Sunday travel will open still wider the flood gates of Sabbath desecration.

"We, therefore, whose names are hereunto affixed, do most earnestly petition your company to reconsider your action, and maintain firmly the high moral position you have taken, and which we believe has secured to you the blessing of God and the commendation of men. We entertain the strong hope that the desire of those who are indifferent to a due observance of law will not prevail, and that you will continue to maintain the stand you have taken, not to run passenger trains on the Lord's day."

In one place at least this petition is very weak: it seeks to forbid labor on the first day of the week, in the face of the fact that the Creator of heaven and earth worked on that day, and has left the record of the fact for mankind. As long as men follow the example of the Creator, they will not go very far wrong. This fact ought certainly to be admitted by a clergymen's union.
