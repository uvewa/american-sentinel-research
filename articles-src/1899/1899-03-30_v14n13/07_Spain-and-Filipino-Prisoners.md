Such is the anxiety of Spain to secure the release of the Spanish prisoners held captives in the Philippines, that notwithstanding the prohibition of the American commander at Manila, General Otis, the Spanish government has offered Aguinaldo, the insurgent leader, 5,000 pesetas for the release of each Spanish officer, and 2,500 pesetas for each Spanish civilian, and 500 pesetas for each Spanish soldier held captive by the forces under his command.
