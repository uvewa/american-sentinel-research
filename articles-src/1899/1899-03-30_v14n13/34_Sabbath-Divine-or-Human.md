"The Sabbath," says a Southern Methodist journal, "on one side, is a religious institution;" and "on the other side, the Sabbath is a civil institution, created and protected by legislative enactment."

Is that so? What then was the Sabbath at the time it was instituted by the Creator, before any "civil enactments" had been thought of? What was the Sabbath "on the other side" then? or had it only one side?

Is the Sabbath divine on one side and human on the other? or is it divine on both sides? Is it the same all the way through that it is on its face, or is it like a poor piece of cloth which has a surface of fine quality, and an inferior woof underneath? From all that God says about the Sabbath, we must conclude that there is no "shoddy" about it; that it is God's own workmanship all the way through and the same on one side as on the other.

The trouble is that men have instituted a different day from God's Sabbath, and this day has to be propped up and "protected by civil enactments." God's Sabbath is the seventh day; and men have made a sabbath out of the first day and tried to join to it that which belongs to the Lord's day. But there is no connection between them. The first day is not "the other side" of the seventh day, but a separate day altogether. It is a human institution entirely, an imitation merely of God's divine institution. And God's divine institution is a free gift to all, so that no human imitation can be of any possible use whatever.
