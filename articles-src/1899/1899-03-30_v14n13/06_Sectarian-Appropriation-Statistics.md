In answer to several requests sent us at different times for facts and figures relative to this subject, we publish the following, which we take from a recently-issued pamphlet entitled, "A Conspiracy Against the Republic" (noticed elsewhere in this issue):—

|   | ROMAN CATHOLICS. | OTHER DENOMINATIONS. | TOTAL.  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  1887 | $194,635 | $168,579 | $363,214.  |
|  1888 | 221,169 | 155,095 | 376,264.  |
|  1889 | 347,672 | 182,233 | 529,905.  |
|  1890 | 356,957 | 205,683 | 562,640.  |
|  1891 | 363,349 | 206,869 | 570,218.  |
|  1892 | 394,756 | 216,814 | 611,570.  |
|  1893 | 375,845 | 157,396 | 533,241.  |
|  1894 | 365,845 | 136,790 | 502,635.  |
|   | $2,620,228 | $1,429,459 | $4,049,687.  |

Notice how, as shown by these figures, the Catholic Church outstripped all the Protestant sects in the race for Government patronage. The Catholic Church has had centuries of experience in this line, and can more than hold its own against all the Protestant bodies together in a contest for political supremacy. This should be a lesson to those Protestant organizations which are working to have the Government recognize religion.

"After 1894, Congress, under the pressure of numerous protests from the people, began to call a halt on these appropriations. The amount was reduced, first to eighty per cent., and then to fifty per cent., of the previous appropriation. At the time of making the last reduction, the policy of the Government was distinctly announced as being against any further appropriations of the kind."

The Catholic Church has not relinquished the struggle, however, as was shown by Cardinal Gibbons' petition to the last Congress to reconsider the whole subject of appropriations for Indian schools.
