"The law of the Sabbath is one thing, and Sabbath laws are another," says the Nashville (Tenn.) Christian Advocate. The ancient Sabbath laws, it says, were mostly "only of local and temporary application." "Nobody, for example, would now think of stoning a man to death for gathering sticks on the Sabbath day."

Well, they have thought, in that very State of Tennessee, of putting men in the chain-gang for doing a little work on Sunday, and have not only thought of it, but have actually done it. And anybody who would want to see men put in the chain-gang for working on the "Sabbath" would want to see them stoned to death if that method of punishing people were now in vogue. Because it is only the spirit of hatred which is behind such work, and the spirit of hatred is the spirit of murder.

If the Advocate had cited these facts, they would have lent emphasis to its statement that "the law of the Sabbath is one thing, and Sabbath laws are another."
