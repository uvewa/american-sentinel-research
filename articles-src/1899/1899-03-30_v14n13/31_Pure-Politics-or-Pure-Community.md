We must have purity in politics to sweep away the corruption that exists in the community, it is said; so the community is called on to go to the primaries and polls and purify politics. But which must we have first—pure politics? or a pure community? If we have the pure community we do not need to have it purified by politics; and if we have a corrupt community, how is such a community going to purify politics?

From the corrupt community comes corruption in politics; and from the corrupt hearts of men comes the corruption that taints the community. The heart is the fountain head of the whole stream; and from God, through repentance and faith, must come the purity that is to cleanse the heart.
