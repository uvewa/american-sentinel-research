The Colorado legislature has of late been having a little experience touching the merits of State chaplaincy. An attempt was made in the Senate to reduce the price of the chaplain's prayers from $3 to $2 each. The senate was studying retrenchment, and this was one way in which it was proposed to cut down expenses. Opposition to the proposed reduction was raised at once, and a spirited discussion began. Some senators wanted the chaplaincy abolished altogether, or made an honorary office merely. Senator Gallagher alluded to the contest that was always made for the office, and said that a salaried chaplaincy created a very undesirable state of affairs. A motion was made to "split the difference" and compromise at $2.50; but in opposition to this it was remarked that the penitentiary chaplain was liberally treated by the State, and that he had no worse cases to pray for than had the chaplain of the senate. Another fact elicited was that the late Rev. Mr. Reed was elected chaplain of the Colorado Senate while he was taking the Keeley cure, this being done on the principle, as one senator stated, that it was proper to help a man who was trying to help himself. The compromise proposition was finally voted down, and the regular rate of $3 daily for the chaplain's services allowed to stand.
