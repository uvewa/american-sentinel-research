This assembly convened in Bromfield M. E. Church, Boston, February 23. The proceedings were quite fully reported in *The Citizen*, of that city. The pith of this report, as regards the spirit of the convention and the aims of the "reform" movement, will appear from the following extracts:

"The affairs of state are not merely of the people, by the people, and for the people."—Rev. A. K. McLennan, *Presbyterian, Boston*.

"I am in favor of a theocracy in state affairs just as much as in the individual life, in our households, and churches."

"I would have the Common Council, the State legislature, Congress, made up of men who fear God, who regard his authority, who pray."

"There are those who seem to think that the Hebrew commonwealth was formed upon a theocratic model impracticable in our times, that the government of Israel was essentially different from anything that is possible now. I do not find it so. . . . I object to the term theocratic as applicable to Israel of old and meaning to us something impossible and absurd. Call the nation in the days of the judges a theocratic judiciary and when the kings reigned a theocratic monarchy and I am agreed. All then that I ask for our land is that it be a theocratic republic."

"We cannot leave the Filipinos to themselves or drop them into the seething hostility of the European nations. They are our wards. Let it be troublesome and expensive, let it be contrary to the spirit of the Constitution; the days of expansion have come, the light of truth must shine into earth's dark places, and the blessings of peace must be shared with the oppressed, for there is a law higher than the Constitution and a ruler above the kings of the earth."—Rev. G. Shaw, Presbyterian, Cambridge, Mass.

"The present convention is called at a very opportune time. Everything seems to be in an unsettled condition. Our country, whether for good or evil, has been launched out as a great world power. Questions of the greatest moment are being discussed and settled, which a year or more ago did not occupy our minds at all. I firmly believe it is for good, if we, as a Christian nation, do our duty. I can see that it will be for our evil and ruin if we do not act as we should act; then will we as a nation come into condemnation."

"I believe we are the most Christian power upon the earth, and God has used this nation to destroy the power of Spain, which has ever stood across the onward march of his kingdom. I believe our nation has been called not only to liberate millions of the inhabitants of the Philippine islands, but also to Christianize these people and carry to them God's blessings."

"Now a nation which undertakes this high duty needs to be firmly fixed on the solid rock foundation. There needs to be no fear at home. We need also to have our Government on the Christian basis. It is the Christian idea which stirs us. It is not the atheistic, it is not the materialistic, it is not the secular thought that has sent us out in this war—it is the Christian idea, and our President has gloriously lifted all to that level. This being true, the Government ought to be Christian. We should as a nation recognize all authorities of Jehovah; we should honor the Son, who has been appointed the mediatorial king, and all our legislation should be based on the Word of God. I believe this must be done at home ere our country will come into the blessings God has for us. I believe this is necessary in order to solve all the questions of capital and labor, and every other question in our land."

"It seems to me also, in order for permanency and stability, and in logical recognition of the blessings we enjoy, we must thus crown Jesus Christ as King. I believe the course of events will compel such a recognition. The nations of the earth will demand that we thus come up on this unmistakable ground that our beloved country will be first to 'Crown Him Lord of all.' God grant that we may act at once ere someone else less favored than we receive this prize."

"The adoption of our Constitution in its present secular and atheistic form was a most unnatural thing and marks a break of fearful moment. If we would to-day recognize God in the Constitution it certainly would bring us into line with our national political existence up until the Revolution."

"If we do not thus honor God and serve him as a nation our doom is fixed."—Rev. S. McNaughter.

"The Supreme Court has decided that this is a Christian nation. The Bible is the text-book of Christianity. The fact of a Christian civilization must rest on the recognition of the Bible. . . . If ours is a Christian nation, then the authoritative code of Christianity, which is the Bible, should be expressed in our constitutional symbols."—Rev. Dr. Hershey, Presbyterian, Boston.

"Because the Sabbath, as a weekly civil rest day, is a national institution, indispensable to the national life, and one to which society has a natural right, government should shield it from harm. You cannot have the Sabbath without Sabbath laws. The right to enjoy a rest day is a very precious right, and demands protection in the law of the land. For without legal protection the greed of corporations will force men reluctantly into continuous toil."

"Furthermore, we cannot have a civil rest day unless we have a Sabbath of religious worship, as under the divine command. That is, to maintain the right of man to a day of rest, it is necessary to show that the Sabbath is a divine institution, ordained by God for man's good.—Rev. A. H. Plumb, Congregationalist, Roxbury, Mass.

"The disease from which the nation is most suffering is 'Fatty Degeneration of the Conscience.' This is caused by—

"(a) Lust of wealth and the enormous power of wealth massed in great corporations. It seems as if nothing could stand before it.

"(b) Lust of position. Men seem ready to sell their souls merely to be in prominent positions.

"(c) Lust of power. Seen in boss-rule in the cities, etc. This is the root of much trouble in which the nation now finds itself.

"'Weakened vitality of the nation and powerlessness to throw off the disease,' the result of three causes.

"(a) Failure to realize the truth that the nation is a moral personality, subject to the same moral laws as individuals. It is treated as if it had no soul, no conscience. 'It will do in mass what individuals would shudder at the very thought of doing.'

"(b) Putting the state in many ways in the place of God, the old Greek theory made sovereign over the conscience. . . .

"(c) Subserviency to party. Party to many becomes the state. Note the cases of Senators Perkins and White.

"What is the remedy? Re-enthronement of conscience in individual and national life."—Rev. Benj. F. Trueblood, Sec. American Peace Society.

"A Christian nation should recognize Christ the King in order to have an undeniably legal basis for its Christian laws, institutions and usages, in the fundamental law of the land. . . . Just as a pagan nation, when enacting a constitution, will adopt a pagan instrument, and as a Mohammedan people will incorporate Mohammedanism in their fundamental law, and as a Roman papal country will embody Romanism in their enacted constitution, so our Protestant Christian nation ought to embody a formal recognition of the authority of Christ the King and the nation's pledge to obey His law in our national Constitution."—Rev. J. M. Foster, Presbyterian, Boston.

Among the resolutions adopted were the following:—

"WHEREAS, It is the bounden duty of states and nations to reverently and obediently acknowledge the author and source of their powers; and—

"WHEREAS, 'There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,' so that 'He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father which has sent Him.' Therefore,—

"Resolved, That it is incumbent upon all civil governments, of whatever form, to acknowledge the supremacy of Almighty God as the basis of all authority, and his will as revealed in the Holy Scriptures as the court of final appeal.

"Resolved, That among all peoples, and especially professedly Christian nations, Jesus Christ demands an official recognition of his supreme headship in the fundamental instrument of their civil compact.

"Resolved, That we deeply deplore the omission of Christ's name and a becoming recognition of his authority, in the Constitution of the United States, and solemnly avow our conviction that very much of the disquietude and peril of our nation is justly attributable to the displeasure of Jehovah for the disrespect shown to his name and authority.

"Resolved, That in our judgment the sincere and devout recognition of Jesus Christ as the One and only supreme head and law-giver of our nation, is the vital point of outset from present embarrassments into greater blessings and higher attainments.

"Resolved Finally, that since in a republic the residue of power is vested in the people, we hold that good citizenship obligates men patriotically, morally, and religiously to employ all proper means to secure the insertion of an unequivocal recognition of Christ and his authority as King and Supreme Lawgiver, in the national constitution, and all co-ordinate state constitutions where it is not already incorporated."
