There is a Sunday-closing crusade in the well known European city of Frankfort-on-the-Main. A "special cable" to the Chicago Record, says:—

"The Sunday-closing crusade in Frankfort has become a political issue, and it is announced to-day that the Democrats will support the evangelical societies of the city in their agitation. The crusade naturally meets with much opposition, for, as a general thing, the opera houses, theaters, circuses and concert halls have their principal entertainment on Sunday, and the shops have the option of keeping open between the hours of 11 a. m. and 1 p. m. The advocates of a more rigid observance of the day have begun with an appeal to the shopkeepers to devote the whole of Sunday to rest for themselves and their employes."
