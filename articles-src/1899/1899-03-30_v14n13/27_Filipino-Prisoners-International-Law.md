The Filipinos under Aguinaldo hold several thousand Spanish prisoners, for whose release there is, of course, a very earnest desire in Spain. Aguinaldo refuses to surrender them without a ransom, and the American commander, General Otis, has forbidden Spain to pay any money to Aguinaldo, since it would strengthen the Filipinos in their contest with the United States. It appears that international law sanctions the right of a nation to treat with "rebels" if the latter have been recognized as "belligerents;" hence it is feared that Spain may recognize the Filipino forces as such, in order to secure the international right to treat with them for the release of the Spanish prisoners.

The cloud of international controversy refuses to lift its shadow from the field of American "expansion" in Asia.
