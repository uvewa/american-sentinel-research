A crusade against Sunday saloons is in progress in Lexington, Ky. Fully a hundred indictments, it is stated, have been framed against saloon keepers there for violation of the Sunday law, and both sides are waiting for the decision on a test case, which will decide whether the saloons must close or not.

To prosecute a saloonist for opening on Sunday implies, of course, that selling liquor is an act more evil on that day than on other days; in fact, that it is not evil except on that day. The prosecution really rests upon the religious character of the act. But the consequences of liquor selling are the same on all days of the week; and by its consequences is its character to be judged. The courts of law have no business with the question whether liquor selling on Sunday is or is not a violation of the Sabbath.
