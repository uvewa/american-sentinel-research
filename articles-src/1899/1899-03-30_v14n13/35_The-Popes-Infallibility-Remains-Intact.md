A press dispatch from Rome states that the pope's mind is failing and that he "occasionally lapses into childish talk"—a condition common to all people at the extreme age the pontiff has now reached. The dispatch adds that it is believed the pope may live in this condition for some time.

His "infallibility," of course, remains intact.
