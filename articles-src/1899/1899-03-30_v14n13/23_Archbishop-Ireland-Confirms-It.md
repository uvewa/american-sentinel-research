The Roman Catholic Church in the United States does not differ in anything, as concerns its character and aims, from the Catholic Church in Spain or Ecuador. So said the pope in his recent letter on Americanism, and in reply Archbishop Ireland takes pains to reaffirm the fact:—

"Most holy father, it is the enemies of the church in America and the faithless interpreters of the faith who 'imagine' that there exists, or who desire to establish, in the United States a church differing in one iota from the holy and universal church which other nations recognize—the only one which Rome itself, infallible guardian of the revelation of Jesus Christ, recognizes or can recognize."

Is it not perfectly fair, then, to judge the Catholic Church in the United States by the church as it is in "other nations"—Spain, Ecuador, Peru, etc.—since the church in this country does not differ "in one iota" from the church elsewhere? We have always said that it was, and now we have the highest Catholic authority to bear out the statement.
