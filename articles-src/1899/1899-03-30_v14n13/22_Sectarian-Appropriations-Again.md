THE Lower House of Congress recently passed the bill making appropriations for the Indian schools, entirely eliminating anything for sectarian schools, that is, the schools taught under the auspices of denominations, but heretofore supported in part by the Government. Later the Senate committee inserted a provision in the bill allowing the Catholic schools the amount they received last year, namely, twenty per cent. of their former allowance.

Early in December Cardinal Gibbons, in behalf of himself and the archbishops of the Catholic Church in America, submitted a petition to Congress asking that the question of the Contract-school system be reopened, and that Congress again go over the subject of Indian education. The petition set forth at length the history of the Indian-school question and the legislation applying to it, up to the recent provisions in appropriation bills looking to the gradual discontinuance of Government aid to sectarian schools. The petition asked that a congressional inquiry be made in place of the departmental inquiries, in order that the merits and defects of contract schools and Government schools may be shown and "not kept as a secret of state concealed in the files of any department or office."

This proposed action has been strongly opposed by the Protestant papers generally and by many of the Protestant missionary societies. The latter signed and presented to Congress a counter petition, in which they said among other things:—

"We respectfully request Congress to adhere to the following announced policy, appearing in two recent appropriation bills, concerning appropriations both for Indian education and for charities in the District of Columbia:

"'And it is hereby declared to be the settled policy of the Government to hereafter make no appropriation whatever for education in any sectarian school.

"'And it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Government of the United States to make no appropriation of money or property for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church or religious denomination, or any institution or society which is under sectarian or ecclesiastical control; and it is hereby enacted that from and after the 30th day of June, 1898, no money appropriated for charitable purposes in the District of Columbia shall be paid to any church or religious denomination, or to an institution or society which is under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.'"
