The Rev. S. P. Cadman, prominent in Methodist circles in this city, says that "the inerrancy and the infallibility of the Bible are no longer possible of belief among reasoning men." The best answer to which is that it is an actual fact that "the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible" are believed by reasoning men, in this country and all others. The statement amounts to saying that "all who do not believe as we do are not reasoning men." This is the egotism of the "higher criticism."
