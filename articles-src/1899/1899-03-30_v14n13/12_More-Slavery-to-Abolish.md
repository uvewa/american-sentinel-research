One burden in the Philippines which we cannot shirk even if we would is the abolition of slavery. That relic of barbarism, despite the constitutional amendment, which distinctly forbids slavery "in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States," prevails to day in Sulu, Mindero, and other islands in the group which once was nominally Spain's.

The slave trade, which the dons winked at, but which America cannot afford to tolerate, centers in Maibun, the ancient capital of Sulu. There it flourishes under the protection of our subject Sultan, Haroun Narrasid, and it is said that girls of fifteen can be bought at the very doors of his palace for five bushels of rice, with slightly higher prices for choice bondmen or bondwomen. It will be necessary for Uncle Sam to intervene, even if the Moros are roused to a "holy war" for the defense of their cherished institution. It is said that so widespread have been the operations of these slave-hunters and their predecessors that among their slaves to day are found Malays captured from Sumatra, Papuans from New Guiana, Siamese, Javanese and natives of the island of Timor—a heterogeneous mixture which is the puzzle of the most profound ethnologists of the time.

It will be difficult to dissociate the idea of liberty to hold the tenets of Mahomet from liberty to practice the slave trade and general piracy and bloodshed, but it is clear that we are bound to essay and accomplish the task. Murder, captive selling into bondage, must go in all our acquisitions, despite the fact that it will cause a good deal of trouble, a good deal of expense and a good deal of time.

We are likely to have an urgent "Philippine question" with us for years, even after Emilio Aguinaldo has been brought to a realizing sense that discretion is the better part of valor.
