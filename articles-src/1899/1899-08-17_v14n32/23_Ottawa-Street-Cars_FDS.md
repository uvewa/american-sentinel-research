## Ottowa Street Cars.

On July 23, the street cars in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, began to run on Sunday, after quite a struggle over the matter. Of course those who consider themselves the guardians of the public morals felt much stirred up, and made earnest efforts to prevent this change taking place; and then after the cars had run two Sundays, an effort was made to get the city council to reconsider the matter. But that body, by a vote of 13 to 11, refused to reconsider the question, and so for several years to come the street car company has the right to run cars on Sunday.

On the first Sunday that the cars ran they were well filled with people going to the parks and other places to enjoy the beauties of nature and get some fresh air and recreation. The pews in the churches were said to be correspondingly less filled. This, of course, was not agreeable to those who wish to see the pews filled even if it be by those who would rather be somewhere else.

One can hear citizens of Ontario conversing thus: "They who have means of traveling about at their leisure, as they please, want to shut up the only opportunity we poorer people have of going out and getting the fresh air and having some recreation, which is the Sunday street car, and compel us to go to church." This they consider to be unfair. And why should they not?

Who has given any body of men the right to compel others to be religious in just their way? If a law were to be enacted compelling every citizen to be immersed, or to take the communion once a week or once a month, would it not be considered unjust? What more justice in compelling men to go to meeting, or to rest on Sunday? The Ottawa movement is certainly in the right direction.

F. D. STARR.
