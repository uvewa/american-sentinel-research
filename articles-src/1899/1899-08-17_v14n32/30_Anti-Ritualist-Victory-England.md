An anti-ritualist victory has been won in England. The chancellor of the diocese of London has issued a decree for the removal of a crucifix displayed in St. Ethelberta's church, and the restoration of the table of the Ten Commandments, which the ritualists had removed. The victory is of course more apparent than real, since this decree from the secular authority converts no one from an erroneous doctrine, and leaves error undisturbed in its citadel, which is the mind. Real victories in religious controversy are won only when truth comes in and displaces error in the mind.
