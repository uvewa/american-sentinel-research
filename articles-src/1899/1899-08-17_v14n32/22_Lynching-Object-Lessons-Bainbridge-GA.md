The excuse always advanced for such torturings of negroes in the South as that at Bainbridge, Ga., is that "a terrible object-lesson is needed to impress the brutish minds of the black masses." But the growing frequency of these scenes that would have disgraced the Dark Ages shows that the excuse is not valid. The "object-lessons" are apparently degrading and making cruel the people who administer them with such elaboration and such delight. But they certainly are not lessening the crimes which it is alleged they are intended to cure.—N. Y. World.
