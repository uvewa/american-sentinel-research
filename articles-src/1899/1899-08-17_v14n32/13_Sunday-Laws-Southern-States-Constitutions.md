## Sunday Laws of Southern States Compared with the National and State Constitutions.

The Constitution of the United States declares that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States," and further, lays upon the national legislature this express prohibition from entrance into the domain of religion:

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

In harmony with the spirit of the national Constitution, the State constitutions contain guaranties of religious freedom for the individual as a citizen of the State. We desire in this article to compare these constitutional guaranties as given in some of the Southern States with certain statutes upon the books of those States, under which the right of religious freedom has been invaded.

Nowhere more strongly than in the Southern States is the sacred right of religious liberty upheld by the provisions of the fundamental law.

The constitution of Georgia provides for individual freedom in religious belief and practise, in these words:

"ART. I, Sec. 6. Perfect freedom of religious sentiment shall be, and the same is hereby, secured, and no inhabitant of this State shall ever be molested in person or property, or prohibited from holding any public office or trust, on account of his religious opinion; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practises inconsistent with the peace or safety of the people."

No statute of the State of Georgia therefore can be constitutional which molests any citizen in person or property on account of his religious belief, unless such belief should lead him to "acts of licentiousness," or to "practises inconsistent with the peace or safety of the people."

The constitution of Mississippi guards the right of religious freedom by this provision:

"ART. I, Sec. 23. No religious test as a qualification for office shall ever be required, and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious sect or mode of worship; but the free enjoyment of all religious sentiments and the different modes of worship shall ever be held sacred: Provided, The rights hereby secured shall not be construed to justify acts of licentiousness injurious to morals or dangerous to the peace and safety of the State."

Any statute of the State of Mississippi by which one sect or mode of worship is placed on an inequality with other sects and modes of worship in that State, is unconstitutional and void.

The constitution of Alabama reiterates the principle of the equality of mankind respecting natural rights, asserted in the Declaration of Independence, and maintains the right of freedom of conscience for its citizens by this ample provision:—

"ART. I, SEC. 4. That no religion shall be established by law; that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect, society, denomination, or mode of worship; that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship, nor to pay any tithe, taxes, or other rate, for building or repairing any place of worship, or for maintaining any minister or ministry; that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this State; and that the civil rights, privileges, and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles."

A broader and more emphatic assurance of religious freedom could scarcely have been given.

The constitution of Tennessee declares:—

"ART. I, SEC. 3. That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no man can, of right, be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minister against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

"SEC. 4. That no political or religious test, other than an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and of this State, shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this State."

"ART. XI, SEC. 15. No person shall in time of peace be required to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religion as a day of rest."

The constitution of Maryland, in its Declaration of Rights, declares:—

"ART. 36. That as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him, all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore, no person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practise, unless, under the color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, peace, or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil, or religious rights; nor ought any person to be compelled to frequent or maintain, or contribute, unless on contract, to maintain any place of worship, or any ministry."

If we should quote from the constitutions of other States in the South upon this point, it would only be to repeat in substance these guaranties of religious freedom.

From all this it is plain that in these States every person has a constitutional right to believe and practise any religion he may choose, within the limits of public peace and safety. It was the express design of the framers of the fundamental law to place all religions upon an equality before the law, and to shut out the possibility of legal sanction for any one above another.

They expressly sought to guard against any use of the law as a weapon in religious controversy, or as a means of inflicting punishment by one religious party upon another.

Yet just this thing has been done in these States. The law has been invoked by one side in a religious controversy against the other, and made the instrument of persecution against dissenters from the popular religion. It has been used by one religious party as a means of coercing another religious party into conformity with a dogma held by the religious majority.

How could this be? How could the plain intent of the fathers of the State governments be set aside, the express statements of the fundamental law disregarded? This could not have been, but for a principle that had its rise not in an effort to safeguard religious freedom, but in a plain purpose to unite church and state. For centuries the idea had prevailed that the civil power ought to take cognizance of and punish "offenses against God and religion;" and so firmly fixed had this principle become in the institutions of society, that when the State governments were formed the people retained it upon the statute books, without pausing to consider how completely at variance it was with their constitutional guaranties of religious freedom.

Among such "offenses" the most prominent was the non-observance of "the Lord's day." To fail to observe the "Lord's day," or the "first day of the week," in the manner prescribed by the legislature, is made a crime in every State of the Union, North and South alike, with but two exceptions!

Upon this point the statutes of Georgia decree:—

"SEC. 4579. Violating Sabbath. Any tradesman, artificer, workman, or laborer, or other person whatever, who shall pursue their business or work of their ordinary callings on the Lord's day (works of necessity or charity only excepted) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction shall be punished as prescribed in Section 4310 of this code."

The penalties mentioned in this section are, a fine of not more than a thousand dollars, imprisonment not more than six months, and work in the chain-gang not longer than one year; any one or all of which may be imposed by the judge pronouncing sentence!

The statutes of Mississippi declare with respect to Sunday:—

"SEC. 2949. Violation of the Sabbath. If any person, on a Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday, shall himself be found laboring at his own or any other trade, calling, or business, or shall employ his apprentice, or servant, in labor or other business, except it be in the ordinary household offices of daily necessity, or other work of necessity or charity, he shall, on conviction, be fined not more than twenty dollars for every offense, deeming every apprentice or servant, so employed, as constituting a distinct offense; Provided, that nothing in this section shall apply to railroads, or steamboat navigation in this State.

"SEC. 2950. No merchant, shopkeeper or other person, except apothecaries and druggists, shall keep open store, or dispose of any wares or merchandise, goods or chattels, on Sunday, or sell or barter the same; and every person so offending shall, on conviction, be fined not more than twenty dollars for every such offense."

Other sections prohibit shows and exhibitions on Sunday, hunting and fishing, and the Sunday sale of liquors.

The code of Maryland decrees (Sec. 247) that "No person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, and no person having children shall command or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's day (works of necessity and charity always excepted), nor shall suffer or permit any children or servants to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fishing, fowling, hunting, or unlawful pastime or recreation; and every person transgressing this section, and being thereof convicted before a justice of the peace, shall forfeit five dollars, to be applied to the use of the county."

Other sections prohibit the Sunday sale of candy, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, soda and mineral waters, and the opening on Sunday of dancing saloons, opera houses, barber shops, and ball alleys.

The State of Tennessee guards the religious dogma of Sunday sacredness by the following:—

"Sec. 2289. If any merchant, artificer, tradesman, farmer, or other person shall be guilty of doing or exercising any of the common avocations of life, or of causing or permitting the same to be done by his children or servants, acts of real necessity or charity excepted, on Sunday, he shall, on due conviction thereof before any justice of the peace of the county, forfeit and pay three dollars, one half to the person who will sue for the same, the other half for the use of the county."

Other sections prohibit playing at any game or sport, hunting and fishing, and drunkenness, on Sunday, any traffic in view of a worshiping assembly on Sunday, and the Sunday sale of intoxicating liquors.

The central idea of all these statutes and of others that might be quoted from other State codes, is that "the Lord's day" must be protected by law as a sacred day. The one chief object in all of them is to prevent that day from being desecrated and profaned. Thus the State attempts, through its statutes, to compel the observance of a religious institution, and at the same time, in its constitution, proclaims that every citizen is free in all matters of religious belief and practise. By its Sunday statutes the State puts severe disabilities upon the religious class who observe the seventh day, and at the same time, in its constitution, proclaims that all religious classes shall be on an equality before the law.

Here is a plain conflict of authorities; and which one should prevail?

The question is not a difficult one to answer. The constitution of the State is the fundamental law of the State, and to that every statute must conform. Any statute which fails to do this is unconstitutional and void.

The disregard of Sunday statutes by observers of the seventh day, is not from any spirit of defiance to the State or its people, but from the love of religious liberty and the desire to enjoy that liberty as the State itself has provided. To worship on the seventh day of the week, to regard that day rather than the first as the "Lord's day," and to disregard the religious belief and practise of the majority, is in perfect harmony with the highest State law; and to deny this privilege to any citizen is contrary to that law. To enforce the Sunday statutes in a State where there are constitutional provisions such as we have quoted, is an unconstitutional proceeding. The Sunday statutes are the real law-breakers. They are the real disturbers of the peace, the real troublers in Israel.

The national and State constitutions alike declare for religious freedom. The assurances of religious liberty which they give sprang from the principle of separation of church and state, which, when the national Government was formed, stood as a beacon principle of Liberty enlightening the world. They sprang from the inauguration of the "new order of things" in state and church, to be exemplified in the Republic of the New World. The Sunday statutes, on the other hand, are relics of the old order of things,—the old institutions of despotic government and church and state union.

Which shall prevail—the fundamental, constitutional law of religious freedom? or the merely statutory law, unconstitutional and mediaeval, commanding a religious observance? Only the former can prevail in a truly republican government. Liberty and republicanism must stand or fall together.
