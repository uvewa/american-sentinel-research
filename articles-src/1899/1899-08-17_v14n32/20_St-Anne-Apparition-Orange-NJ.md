ROMAN CATHOLICS and others in the vicinity of Orange, N. J., have been considerably stirred by the reported appearance of the "figure of St. Anne" on a rock in a quarry of the Orange Mountains. A number of people plainly saw "St. Anne," and some even distinguished the infant form of the Virgin Mary in St. Anne's arms. There seems not to have been a doubt in any mind that the mysterious image was really that of "St. Anne," notwithstanding the total lack of authority on the question of St. Anne's personal characteristics. It is a point generally overlooked in connection with these oft recurring apparitions of the Virgin Mary and the "saints," at Catholic shrines or elsewhere, that neither Roman Catholics nor any others possess the slightest knowledge of the Virgin, or St. Anne, or others whom they worship, by which they could distinguish them personally from Jezebel or the daughter of Herodias. The image of Jupiter in a pagan temple of Rome served very well after the empire became "Christian," for the statue of St. Peter, and had its great toe piously kissed by multitudes of devout worshipers. As a matter of fact, the Virgin Mary and all the other Catholic "saints" that once had an existence, have been resting quietly in their graves since the day of their burial, totally unconscious of the prayers addressed to them by the living, or of a single fact in any realm of knowledge under the sun.
