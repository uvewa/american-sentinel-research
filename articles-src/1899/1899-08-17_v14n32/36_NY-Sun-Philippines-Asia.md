## THE New York Sun says:—

"The Philippines are not to furnish the only outlet for our resources on the opposite shores of the Pacific. We shall take part in the development of the mainland. We have already vastly increased our business relations with Japan, and China will also see an increase. When Colonel Sellers said in the play, 'Now, Asia is my spot,' he always brought a laugh, partly due, no doubt, to the oddity of going to the other side of the globe for a field; but events have moved since his day, and we already have great Asiatic insular possessions under our flag and foresee vast dealings with the main continent." [Italics ours.]
