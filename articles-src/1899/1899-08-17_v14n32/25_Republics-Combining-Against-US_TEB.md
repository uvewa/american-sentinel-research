# Republics Combining Against the United States.

Now that the good old "Monroe doctrine" has become obsolete, and the United States is following on after imperialism, going into the eastern hemisphere to conduct a war of aggression, the republics of South America, who no doubt, entered upon their republican form of government because of its grand principles so well illustrated in the United States, are beginning to fear for their own safety, and plans seem to be under advisement whereby these near neighbors of ours may combine their interests against this Government.

And who can blame them? What guarantee have they that their rights shall be respected if the United States should happen to want some of the territory they now occupy? If she can enter upon a war of conquest 10,000 miles away upon the "bevevolent" task of assimilating territory for the purpose of civilizing and Christianizing the people, what would hold her from entering upon a like campaign nearer home?

The N. Y. World, of August 4, has the following report:

"Montevideo, August 3.—President Roca, of Argentina, accompanied by the Argentine Ministers of Foreign Affairs, War and Marine, and thirty members of Congress, arrived here to-day on the cruiser 'San Martin,' to visit President Cuestas, of Uruguay.

"The Argentine officials are on the way to Brazil to visit President Campos Salles.

"A banquet in honor of President Roca was given to-night.

"ALLIANCE OF FOUR REPUBLICS SAID TO BE CONTEMPLATED.

"London, August 3.—A recent Buenos Ayres dispatch announced that President Roca would leave soon for Uruguay and Brazil to invite the presidents of those republics to meet at Buenos Ayres in the fall and confer with the president of Chili on the question of reducing South American armaments, and to propose an alliance of those four republics.

"A later dispatch from Rome said:

"'According to news received here, the victory over Spain and the growth of imperialism in the United States has led the large South American republics to talk of an alliance against the United States, and it is alleged that the preliminaries of such an alliance have been concluded between Brazil and Argentina.'"

Some day, when perhaps too late, it may be manifest that those who have stood by the principles of the Constitution of the United States, are its best friends, and have been laboring not only for the good of its own people, but also the people of the western hemisphere, and indirectly for the peace of the whole world.
