Miss CLARA BARTON, president of the National Red Cross Society, reports from Cuba that the "reconcentrados" there are in a terrible condition from starvation, and says: "A Cuban war is the outcome of the situation unless the half-starving boys and girls are cared for." Prevented by the police from getting food in the cities, these boys, she says, take to the woods and become bands of "desperate marauders," which in the course of a few years will require a war for their suppression.

Starving "reconcentrados" under American rule and with no war in the island, is an unanticipated phenomenon, and one which will warrant some explanation from advocates of the present Cuban policy.
