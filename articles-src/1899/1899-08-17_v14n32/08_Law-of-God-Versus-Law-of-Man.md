"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts." So says the Lord in Isa. 55:9. The law of the Lord reaches and covers the secret thoughts and motives of the heart; it is infinitely broader and higher than the law of man. It is plain, therefore, that a human law upholding the law of God represents an inverted pyramid, and therefore that the idea which it embodies is altogether wrong.
