# Why the Filipinos are in Revolt.

By Rev. John R. Hykes.

I talked with men of all classes, some of whom had been resident in the Philippines for more than twenty-five years, and I feel safe in saying that sacerdotal despotism and official rapacity are alone responsible for the present rebellion. Not only has the venality of administration been notorious, but the oppression, the cruelty, the injustice of many of the Spanish officials have called to high heaven for vengeance. Men, from the governor-general down, sought government positions in the Philippines in order to make their fortunes, and it was a common saying that a governor who could not in three years retire with a competency was a fool. Every man had his price, and it was almost impossible to get goods through the customs without bribing the officers. A business man in Manila imported some cotton goods. He declared them correctly at the customs, but could not get them passed. After nearly two months of vexatious delays a customs officer said to him, "How would you like to pay $300 or $400 to get your goods through?" This was about as much profit as he expected to make on the entire consignment. He said, "I will not give you a cent." The next day he received a notice from the customs that his goods had been examined and found to be silk, and he was fined $5,000. He had his appeal, of course, but he would have to bribe some one in order to get it presented to the higher authorities, and then there was no hope of his ever getting back a cent. A merchant told me that he had some goods stolen out of the custom house (a not infrequent occurrence), and after exhausting every effort locally to obtain redress he sent his claim to the foreign office in London. They sent it to the Spanish government through the British minister at Madrid, and, finally, five years after the goods had been stolen, he received press copies of instructions from the Spanish government to the Manila customs to pay. He received their decision, which was as follows: "The government ordered A and B to pay conjointly. A is dead and cannot pay; therefore B is not responsible."

The native had to pay tax on everything, the paper on which he wrote a letter, the buffalo that ploughed his fields, his chickens and even upon the eggs they laid. The governors monopolized the trade of their districts. They fixed their own purchasing price, and sold, of course, at current market rates. No conscience was shown by any officer in his rigorous exactions from the natives.

The expenses of legal proceedings were so enormous that many a wealthy man was ruined by a single case of litigation.

The burial fees demanded by the priests during an epidemic of smallpox were something enormous. As many were unable to pay, the dead were lying in the churches and in private houses in such numbers as to be a serious menace to the public health. The thing was so scandalous that the governor-general interfered and issued orders for all the corpses to be buried at once. The priests disregarded it and telegraphed to the government at Madrid, who reversed the order.

I heard such a revolting story about the Paco cemetery (Paco is a suburb of Manila) that I decided to visit the place and ascertain the facts for myself. In the center of a plot of ground containing about two acres, is a mortuary chapel. Around this in concentric circles, and with a space of about twenty feet between, are three or four walls. These walls are from five to seven feet wide, about ten feet high, and contain three tiers of vaults, one above the other, and of sufficient size to admit a coffin. The Filipino in charge told me that there are 1,278 vaults for adults and 504 for children. The fees are collected five-yearly in advance, and are thirty-three dollars for an adult and sixteen dollars for a child. I said to the attendant: "Suppose that at the end of any period of five years the friends of the deceased are unable to pay, what do you do?" "We remove the coffin, take out the remains and throw them on the bone pile." "Will you show me the bone pile." "Certainly." He conducted me to the rear of the cemetery, up a flight of stone steps to the top of the wall. The receptacle for the bones was a space between two parallel walls, about thirty feet long, by four wide, by eight deep, and it was nearly full. Near by were two metallic coffins which had evidently just been opened, and on top of the bone pile were two complete skeletons. A dog was munching the bones. You can imagine how such a system would work with an ignorant, superstitious people like the natives. All of the vaults except three were occupied. The fees amount to more than $50,000 every five years. The fees of a church near to a hotel at which I was stopping amounted to $100,000 per annum.

It is not surprising that the great religious corporations are enormously wealthy, and that they have a power consonant with that wealth. I was shocked at the stories I was told by men whose word I could not doubt, of the flagrant immorality of the Spanish friars. The men who gave me these statements said they were prepared to give names, dates and places.

I am sure that the Roman Catholics of the United States would be as much shocked as anybody at the immorality of these friars. I am aware that this is not Roman Catholicism as it is to be found in England and the United States to-day, and it is necessary that this should be emphasized in order to comprehend the religious condition of the people, and to adequately realize their spiritual needs. They have had more than three centuries of Catholic Christianity; commodious churches are to be found all over the islands, and they are well attended, but practically nothing has been done to educate and enlighten them.—From leaflet issued by the American Bible Society, New York City.
