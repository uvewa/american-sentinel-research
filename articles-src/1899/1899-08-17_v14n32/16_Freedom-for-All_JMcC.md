## Freedom for All.

### BY JOHN MCCARTHY.

The conscience must to God alone respond,
And not to legislation, nor to man.
In Heaven's realm is fullest freedom found,
Since force was never embraced in God's great plan.
Hence 'tis our duty to repudiate
All interdicts on our inherent rights;
Let then our protest loud reverberate,
From flowery dell to yonder snow-clad heights.

Ennobling motto, "Liberty for all;"
Raise it aloft, from Heaven's walls to hang.
Thus shall we break the spell that would enthrall,
And start again the chant that angels sang.
Thus all procrustian methods shall be cast
Into Lethean depths; banished for ever.
Religious tyrants thus shall be outcast,
And Freedom's hand our precious bark will steer.

Supernal legacy which God hath given
To every son of Adam—liberty:
Not limited, but free as the air of Heaven,
Aye, from the swaddling clothes of serfdom free.
No servile chains to impede our onward march;
No base incumbrances to block our way.
For the Creator from the empyrean arch
Irradiates our path with freedom's ray.

May we never seek to treat as helots vile
Our fellowmen, who differ from our views;
But may we hold their rights as sacred, while
We ever refrain their consciences to bruise.
He who condemns his brother, but betrays
The glorious trust committed to his charge,
And thus becomes entangled in the maze
From which he surely never can emerge.

Follow the path of charity through life,
Strive other souls to please, not self alone;
Banish from thee all bitter roots of strife;
Thus shalt thou bigotry and hate dethrone.
Then even the thought will never cross thy mind,
Of seeking legislative power to force
Thy brother to accept thy views defined.
Love to such weapons never can have recourse.

Let each his own opinion hold as right,
Responsible to God, and He alone;
Since all mankind are equal in him sight,
He only can our motives, thoughts, make known.
Soon we must each before the great Judge stand,
Who in His balances divine will weigh
The spring of all our actions on life's strand,
To Him we each must answer in that day.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.
