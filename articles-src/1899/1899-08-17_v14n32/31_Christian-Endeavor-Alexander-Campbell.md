In the Christian Endeavor organization there are over 4,000 local societies representing the Disciple Church. Yet at the late general convention of the society in Detroit, the C. E. officials did their best to prevent the distribution to the Endeavors of a tract giving the views of Alexander Campbell on the enforcement of Sunday observance. We must conclude that if the founder of the Disciple Church were alive today, he would be treated with scant courtesy by this religio-political organization.
