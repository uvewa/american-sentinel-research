NEXT year a great world's fair will be held in Paris, which will attract multitudes from every part of the civilized world; and the pope is arranging for an exhibition of "objects of piety," to be held in Rome. Rome and Paris are to be the two chief centers of attraction in 1900, and the former will from present appearances be no mean rival of the latter. The pope is a master hand at advertising the papal religion.
