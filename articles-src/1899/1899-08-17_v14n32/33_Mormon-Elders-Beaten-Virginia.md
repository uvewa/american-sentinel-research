Two MORMON elders who were preaching at Wise, Va., were last week taken by a company of young mountaineers, tied to a tree, and beaten until one of them was insensible. When released, one of the elders informed the sheriff, who arrested the leaders of the mob. The brutality of the proceeding has of course won sympathy for the Mormons from many who otherwise would not have been reached by their influence. The mob made Mormon martyrs and Mormon converts by their unwise and brutal conduct, and accomplished nothing towards driving Mormonism out of the country. Mob law never cures the evils at which it strikes.
