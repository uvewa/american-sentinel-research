THE editor of the leading atheist organ published in this city, *The Truth Seeker*, contends that there is no proof in nature and no evidence cognizable by the senses, of the cardinal doctrines of the Christian religion, such as redemption, the atonement, the resurrection, etc. He declares that these doctrines rest merely on somebody's word—on tradition—and says that mere assertions in support of a dogma do not prove its truth. Having said this, he proceeds to make emphatic assertions of the absurdity of Christian doctrines, in order to prove their falsity.

IN reply to statements made by the SENTINEL that full proof of the existence of Christ to-day, and of the truth of Christian doctrines, is to be found in the Christian life, and that it does not rest on tradition, the *Truth Seeker* asks, "Where, in nature, is there any God to be found in human flesh? What have we but the word of the 'true' Christian for it? And what proof is his word? Such talk is theomania . . . the worst form of epileptic insanity, in which the lunatic thinks and say that he is God, and then he goes to the insane asylum!"

AS WE said before, the proof of Christianity is not in anybody's word, but in the Christian life. The Christian life is the life of Christ, and the life of Christ testifies that he is not dead. The life of Christ is manifested by the "fruit of the Spirit." There are the fruits of the Spirit, and the fruits of the flesh, and the same life cannot bring forth both, any more than a tree can bear two opposite kinds of fruits. "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." The "works of the flesh," on the other hand, are "adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like." Gal. 5:19–22.

WHEN the individual whose life has manifested the "works of the flesh," who has been quick-tempered, overbearing, selfish, covetous, a liar, or a thief, or an adulterer, or a murderer, a drunkard, or a vicious person, or a reveller, etc., forsakes his evil ways and becomes kind, loving, peaceable, temperate, patient, unselfish, it is evidence that he has a *new* life. And it is complete evidence, too; it is an actual demonstration of the fact, which anyone acquainted with that individual can see for himself, with no other aid than that of his natural senses. This is the witness that God has placed in the world of himself.

AND yet the atheist stands and inquires, "What have we but the word of the 'true' Christian for it? And what proof is his word?" Ignoring the real proof, which he might see if he would, or which if he does see, he is not honest enough to acknowledge, he declares that there are only assertions to support Christianity, and that assertions constitute no proof; and then straightway he attempts to disprove it all by assertions of his own. To make his attack upon Christianity, he runs out on the very bridge he has condemned. And it is all the bridge he has to stand on, too.

IF the assertions of Christians prove nothing, what do the assertions of the atheist prove? We do not claim that the mere assertions of Christians prove anything; Christianity does not depend upon such proof. Atheism, on the other hand, depends upon assertions entirely. There is positive, visible proof of the Christian life, as has been shown; and therefore there can be no proof to the contrary. There can be only assertions for it, made emphatic in order to give them an appearance of force. Atheism undertakes the impossible task of "proving a negative." A single fact may constitute positive proof that God does exist, while to refute a thousand alleged facts would afford no proof at all that God does not exist. The atheist delights to deal with the alleged facts of Christianity which are not facts, the "Christian" doctrines which are no part of Christianity, the counterfeit which is altogether distinct from the genuine; as if to dispose of these were to disprove Christianity itself.

The new life that exemplifies the "fruit of the Spirit," is explained by the Scripture: "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." Gal. 2:20. And here is stated a truth which disposes of another common misconception of Christian doctrine, which the Truth Seeker puts thus: "The doctrine [of redemption] is that because Christ died men will have their crimes forgiven and go to heaven. The absurdity of the doctrine is apparent. 'If I owe Smith ten dollars and God forgives me, that does not pay Smith.'"

* * *

The Christian doctrine is that because Christ died, men may go to heaven if they will. And how?—Simply by the mystery of the new life, the "new creation," which is in Christ. The transgression of the law demanded death, and death there must be; not only the death of Christ, but that of the individual as well. "I am crucified with Christ" means death for the individual as well as it did for Christ. The "old man" with the carnal nature dies, slain by sin and the law, and the individual is raised to life a "new man" in Christ. The death and resurrection of Christ make it possible for the claims of the divine law upon the individual to be satisfied, without involving the individual in eternal death. The old self dies, but there is a new birth, a new life, in Christ. By being crucified with Christ, he is also raised with Christ. But if Christ had not died, there could have been no dying with him and therefore no resurrection at all. The sinner would perish in his sins, and that would be the end. The doctrine of the Atonement, therefore, is not that the transgressor goes scot free of the penalty because another dies. The true doctrine is not that the sinner does not die because of sin, but that he has a resurrection and a new life, because of the Atonement on the cross.
