## Cape to Cairo Railway.

The Cape to Cairo railway will be the longest in the world. It will be run from the capital of Egypt, on the extreme north, to Cape Town on the extreme south, thus spanning the entire length of the Dark Continent, and covering country more diverse than any other line of track. The Canadian Pacific is 2,906 miles long, the Siberian railway will be 4,741 miles long, but the Cape to Cairo will be 5,664 miles long. Of this distance, more than half is already finished, and is now in operation.
