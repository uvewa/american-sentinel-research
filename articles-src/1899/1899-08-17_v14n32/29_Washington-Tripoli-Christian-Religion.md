GEORGE WASHINGTON, in the treaty made with Tripoli, declared that "the Government of the United States is not founded, in any sense, upon the Christian religion." Yet it is common at the present day to hear ministers and others assert that "the perpetuity of American institutions depends upon the maintenance of the American Sabbath." If this be true, Washington's fame as a statesman rests upon a delusion.
