## Genuine Christianity.

CHRISTIANITY is not a voice in the wilderness, but a life in the world. It is not an idea in the air, but feet on the ground going God's way. It is not an exotic to be kept under glass, but a hardy plant to bear twelve manner of fruits in all kinds of weather. Fidelity to duty is its root and branch.

Nothing we can say to the Lord, no calling Him by great or dear names, can take the place of the plain doing of his will. We may cry out about the beauty of eating bread with him in his kingdom, but it is wasted breath and a rootless hope unless we plough and plant in his kingdom here and now. To rightly remember him at his table, and to forget him at ours, is an impossibility. There is no substitute for plain, everyday goodness.—Selected.
