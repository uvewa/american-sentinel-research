# "Destiny," "The Inexorable Logic of Events," Etc.—No. 4.

BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

Another very handy expression that is made the most of by imperialists in proclaiming the doctrine of irresponsibility, and one that is evidently regarded by a great many people as an impregnable defense of violence and brutality, is "the survival of the fittest." A great journal says, "The 'destiny' of the Americans might be briefly described in that somewhat hackneyed but ever pregnant expression, 'the survival of the fittest.'" It is evident that many "men of high standing in the nation, representing the bench, the bar, the press, the pulpit, the universities, and the great business interests," have come to believe that the only law applicable in their treatment of others is the so-called law of the survival of the fittest—that force and force alone is the only standard by which the strong are to measure their treatment of the weak. A prominent American, speaking of "our policy of expansion in the far East," where he has recently been, says that there must be an "application among the nations of the cruel principle of the survival of the fittest" and that "the material interests involved are usually the deciding influence." A high church dignitary declares that America "marches to glorious destiny," and that the church must march with her. He believes in imperialism of both the state and the church. "American imperialism must have its counterpart in Presbyterian imperialism, which will awaken to the significance of itself; which will recognize its own fitness and opportunity." We are told what that opportunity is: "He [Christ] calls us to subjugation. Force is the only argument known to savages from Joshua to William McKinley." The idea held by the great men of this country was literally echoed by a prominent German professor who recently said that fitness consists in the ability to deal the quickest and the hardest blows, and that by dealing the quickest and the hardest blows the fit survive.

But not so. There is a law of the survival of the fittest, but it is not the law of the survival of the fightingest. The true and only law of the survival of the fittest is the death warrant for all iniquity. By that law brute force and criminal aggression are already condemned, and by virtue of it they shall not survive. Though execution be delayed, let oppression, violence, and brutality know that their days are numbered, and that they exist only to demonstrate their absolute unfitness. Their very existence is the guarantee of their destruction. The longer they exist the more certainly do they establish and confirm the fact that everlasting destruction is the one thing for which they are fit. And let all know who ally themselves with these things that though they boast themselves for a little moment; though they "speak wickedly concerning oppression;" though they "speak loftily" of "destiny," "the inexorable logic of events," and "the law of the survival of the fittest," trampling upon human rights and disregarding divine authority,—let them know that they are only hastening the day "that shall burn as an oven," when "all the proud, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble;" the day that shall "burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch." In that day the great originator of irresponsibility and of rule by force,—he whose "constant resort to gain control of those whom he could not otherwise seduce," has been "compulsion by cruelty,"—shall be "as a carcase trodden under foot;" "shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit," and those who see him shall narrowly look upon him and consider him as they speak and say unto him, "Art thou also become weak? Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?" If men will not realize before, they will realize in that day that "the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned," but that "shame and everlasting contempt" is their portion forever.

There is but one law of the survival of the fittest, and it is briefly comprehended in these words: "For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it." Righteousness alone is fit and righteousness alone shall survive.

When men declare that they are without the power of choice, that their wills are powerless in the grasp of outside forces, and that they are irresponsible for their actions, they declare that their manhood is gone. They declare that they have ceased to be men and have become things. Professedly wise men may talk learnedly of the "godhood of man" and of the revelations of psychical research; they may regard themselves as "now in the period between the animal and the angel;" they may think themselves "moving far into the region of the mind, and even beyond it;" statesmen may carry out their every wish under the plea of "destiny" and "the inexorable logic of events;" religious leaders may set aside the plain commands of Jehovah and declare them no longer binding; but of one thing all of them may be sure. They are defrauding man of all his true dignity and are degrading him from the plane upon which the Creator placed him and are bringing him down to where he is scarcely on a level with the brutes. "We may bite our chains if we will, but we shall be made to know ourselves, and be taught that man is born to be governed by law," and that he who robs man of his responsibility is the enemy of both God and man.

The Creator could not make men without placing upon them responsibility by endowing them with the power of choice. Freedom of choice and choice of the right is manhood. Man was made a responsible being, and although he has sought by many inventions to evade that responsibility, not one of them from the first in Eden to the last in America has availed a particle. Man is as responsible as ever. His responsibility is as inherent and as unalienable as are his rights. And He who spake the myriad worlds into existence and who hangs them upon nothing, He who fainteth not, neither is weary, guarantees to day to every human being the power to exercise the will and to stand for or against good or evil. He would send every angel out of heaven before he would allow one individual to be led from the path of rectitude against that individual's will.

And never was it more true than now that to-day is the time to exercise the power of choice. The day is fast approaching when the destiny of every human being will be fixed; when the decree will go forth, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; . . . and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still." If we are unjust to-day we shall be pronounced unjust to-morrow; if we are righteous to-day we shall be pronounced righteous to-morrow. The destiny of yesterday does not determine the actions of to-day, but the actions of to-day determine the destiny of to-morrow. The crises of to-day are "God's stern winnowers;" the choices of to-day are momentous though we may not know it "till the judgment hath passed by." The choices of to-day bind us for to-morrow. Therefore, the great crisis of to-morrow, the greatest in the history of the human race, which fixes every man's destiny, and which rewards every man according to his works, is met by every individual to-day as he chooses between right and wrong.

"The crisis presses on us; face to face with us it stands
With solemn lips of question, like the Sphinx in Egypt's sands!
This day we fashion destiny, our web of fate we spin;
This day for all hereafter, choose we holiness or sin;
Even now from starry Garizim, or Ebal's cloudy crown,
We call the dews of blessing or the bolts of cursing down!"

The inexorable logic of the events of iniquity is surely and swiftly hastening its culminating tragedy when those who have "done violence to the law," who have hidden themselves under falsehood and made lies their refuge, "shall be as though they had not been." In that day the fit will survive and the unfit will perish. In that day the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the chief captains and the mighty men will count for little, for "the mighty man shall cry there bitterly," and the haughtiness of the terrible shall be brought low, and the arrogancy of the proud shall cease.

In that day the assembled intelligencies of the universe will see and will be eternally satisfied that the law of self-asserting and self-exalting force is the law of death for earth and heaven, and they will give their eternal allegiance to the great truth that "the law of self-renouncing love is the law of life for earth and heaven."

"The righteous shall see it and rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth."
