## The Ideal Food.

My simple fare is as consistent with happiness as with health. A table set with fruit, grain and nuts nourishes not only the body but the soul. I eat not merely with the appetite of the flesh, but my soul's hunger for beauty is fed as well. When my table is set it is a fit subject for an artist. But what artist would choose a rib of beef or a mutton chop for a picture? A golden musk melon, fragrant and sweet; a bunch of purple or white grapes; a few peaches and plums; a section of watermelon, with its brilliant black seeds set like gems in the rich red tissue; a plate of ripe, red tomatoes, glowing with color; such food as this would furnish a subject for a picture.

We are told that fruits, grains and nuts will not furnish the body sufficient nutriment, and that meat and coarse vegetables must be added. I cannot decide the question for another, but it seems to me that what is purest and best in me is well nourished by fruits and nuts. If there is a beast in me craving for flesh, I prefer to let him starve. He cannot die too soon for the good of my higher nature. To speak more distinctly, I believe that our diet is chiefly an indication of our constitution, and our habits of thought and life. If I can live purely enough, dwelling in the highest realm of my being, I believe that the daintiest and purest foods will satisfy my needs. But if I live coarsely, I must eat coarsely. The beast in me eats only when he is active. If I can put him to sleep, he will not growl for his meat.

I do not advocate a reform by arbitrary methods. I do not believe that character is determined by diet, but diet by character. I wish to reform the man and then let him reform his diet. When higher ideals have taken possession of the mind, when the soul loves purity so much that impurity and uncleanness in food have become offensive, then a reform is instituted which will be lasting. But to eat from prescription, to weigh and analyze one's food, to feed by rule, I would not sanction.
