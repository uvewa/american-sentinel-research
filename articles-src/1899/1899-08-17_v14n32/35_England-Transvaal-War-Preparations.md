PREPARATIONS for war between England and the Transvaal still continue to go forward. The contest is really one between capital, represented by the mining interests of the Transvaal, and democracy, represented by the simple government of the Boers. The greed for gold brought the English to the Transvaal, and now the Boers are asked to accept the consequence, by allowing the English majority to take the affairs of government out of their hands. The situation is one which illustrates the familiar proverb, "The love of money is the root of all evil."
