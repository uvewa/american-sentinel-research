---

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article: "Ottowa Street Cars" (file 23)
- **Issue:** The article title in the OCR reads "Ottowa" (not "Ottawa"). This appears to be either an OCR error or possibly the original spelling used in the issue header. The city name in the body of the text is spelled "Ottawa" consistently.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — verified that "Ottowa" appears only in the heading, while "Ottawa" is used throughout the article body.
- **Transcribed as:** "Ottowa" in the title (preserving what is in the original heading), "Ottawa" in the body text.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the heading may reflect an original printing typo or an OCR artifact.

### Article: "Republics Combining Against the United States" (file 25)
- **Issue:** The OCR renders "bevevolent" in the phrase "the 'bevevolent' task of assimilating territory." This appears to be either an OCR error for "benevolent" or possibly a printing error in the original.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the word is clearly meant to be "benevolent" in context.
- **Transcribed as:** "bevevolent" — preserving the OCR reading, which likely reflects the original printing.
- **Confidence:** LOW — cannot confirm against the original scan whether this is a typo in the original or an OCR artifact.

### Page 9 Editorial Notes Section
- **Issue:** The editorial note items on pages 9–10 use both "• • •" and "* * *" as separators between paragraphs. These have been preserved as they appear in the OCR output.
- **Transcribed as:** The entire extended discussion (from the St. Anne item through the Atonement discussion) was treated as: (1) one separate file for the St. Anne item, and (2) one file for the Atheism/Christianity exchange, since they are thematically distinct sections of the editorial column.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the St. Anne separation; MEDIUM for grouping the Atheism/Christianity items together (they could be separate short items but are clearly a continuous debate with the Truth Seeker).

### Author: "C. F. Mc Vagh" (file 18)
- **Issue:** The author name is rendered "C. F. MC VAGH" in the OCR. The capitalization appears to be a display style. The name is transcribed as "C. F. Mc Vagh" following standard name conventions.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — this is a stylistic rendering, not an uncertainty about identity.

### Author: "John D. Bradley" (file 12)
- **Issue:** "John D. Bradley" appears as the author of the "Destiny" series article. This name does not appear in the known authors list. It may be a contributor rather than a regular staff member.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the name is clearly stated in the article header.

### Author: "F. D. Starr" (file 23)
- **Issue:** "F. D. STARR" appears at the end of the Ottawa Street Cars article. Not in the known authors list. Likely a field correspondent.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — name is clearly stated.

### Attribution for "Genuine Christianity" (file 14)
- **Issue:** The article ends with "—Selected." indicating it is a reprint or selected excerpt from an unidentified source. No specific publication is named.
- **Transcribed as:** attribution: "reprint" with no original_publication field populated (source unknown).
- **Confidence:** HIGH — "Selected" clearly indicates a reprint; source publication is simply not given.
