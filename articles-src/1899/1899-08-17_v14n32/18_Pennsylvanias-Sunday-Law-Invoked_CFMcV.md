## Pennsylvania's Sunday Law Invoked.

### BY C. F. MC VAGH.

The spirit of persecution manifested in the enforcement of Sunday laws is rife in Wayne County, Pa. As usual, only observers of the seventh day are molested. Up to the present only one case has been called, but unless the Lord overrules in some way others are likely to follow.

One week ago Sylvester B. Field of Hamilton, Pa., a resident of Lake township and a member of the Sabbath-keeping company brought out by the tent effort at Lake Ariel last summer, was summoned to appear before J. Elliott, J. P., of Hollisterville, Pa., to answer to the charge of doing secular labor on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

It was clearly a case of spite and prejudice. Lake Ariel is a popular summer resort and all manner of work is openly performed on Sunday by those who do not observe the Sabbath. The railroad brings hundreds of pleasure seekers every Sunday all summer. The creameries do a thriving business in ice cream, wholesale and retail. Liquor is sold and all kinds of work go on regularly.

The work complained of was that of cutting and binding oats by hand, which was done in a field or lot wholly surrounded by trees and woods, and out of sight of the house of the complainant, David Edwards, and at a considerable distance from any public road. His brother-in-law, a non-professor, was working with him but was not included in the summons.

On being told by the justice that he could neither get a jury trial nor an appeal to court, Mr. Field consulted a lawyer, who advised him not to appear, but let the case go by default. The case was called Monday, July 7, and a fine of $4 and costs was assessed. It now awaits the next county court, giving an opportunity meanwhile to spread literature and educate the people upon the principles involved.

Gospel Tent, Hawley, Pa.
