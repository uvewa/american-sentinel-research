In the New York Sun, of June 5, appears the following notice of what is likely to be a most important convention, as regards the problem of church unity and the attempted settlement of religious and social questions by such means:—

"A State Conference of Religion will be held in New York early in 1900. This conference will be somewhat on the lines of the World's Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in 1893, and will be participated in by Christians and Jews, orthodox Christians and Liberals. Already the project has the endorsement of clergymen and laymen of the Baptist, Congregationalist, Jewish, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Unitarian, Universalist, and Reformed churches, the Friends, the Disciples of Christ, and of the commanders of the Salvation Army and the volunteers of America. The clergy of the Catholic and Lutheran churches have not joined in the movement.

"Ten denominations were represented at a meeting held a few days ago at the United Charities building, in response to a call sent out by Dr. James M. Whiton, of the Outlook, the Rev. Leighton Williams, of Amity Baptist Church, the Rev. Dr. R. Heber Newton, of All Souls' Protestant Episcopal Church, the Rev. Samuel T. Carter, of the Church Union, and the Rev. W. C. Gannet, Unitarian, of Rochester. Professor McGiffert, of Union Theological Seminary, was at the meeting. An executive committee was appointed to arrange for the conference. Its members are the Rev. Dr. H. M. Sanders (Baptist), the Rev. Dr. Josiah Strong (Congregationalist), the Rev. Dr. Henry Mottet (Episcopalian), the Rev. Stephen S. Wise (Hebrew), the Rev. Dr. E. S. Tipple (Methodist), L. A. Maynard (Presbyterian), the Rev. Dr. J. K. Allen (Reformed), the Rev. Thomas R. Slicer (Unitarian), and the Rev. Dr. Charles H. Eaton (Universalist). A general committee of one hundred or more will be formed.

"The purpose of the organizers of the conference was stated in a letter sent out to about 800 clergymen and laymen in different parts of the State.

"'If toleration in religion is the best fruit of the last four centuries,' the letter read, 'should not the beginning of the twentieth century mark an advance to a still nobler position, that of reciprocation in religion and of interreligious cooperation—the attitude of men open-minded, spiritual and loving enough to acknowledge that there is truth to be learned from, as well as truth to be offered to, neighbors, and that a great deal of good, now undone in the world, waits for the hour when the churches shall join hands in a new brotherhood? The immediate organic unity of the churches is impossible, however desirable; but could they not, and, if they can, should they not set the example of union, of good-will and good deed relations, instead of continuing the long-lasting, historic example of indifference and even hostility one to another?'

"Replies were had from nearly half of the persons addressed. The percentages of favorable replies by denominations, were: Unitarians, Universalists and Jews, each 100; Disciples of Christ, 66; Congregationalists, 39; Presbyterians, 37; Methodists, 29; Baptists, 34; Reformed, 21; and Episcopalians, 15. Doctrinal questions will probably not be discussed at the first conference. Political and social questions will be taken up by clergymen and laymen. How catholic the conference will be in admitting members has not been determined. 'The conference will include all who have a belief in and an experience of a genuine spiritual religion,' said one of the organizers."
