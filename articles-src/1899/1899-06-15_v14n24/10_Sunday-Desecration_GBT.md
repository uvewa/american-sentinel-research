June 4, Rev. R. W. Barrows, pastor of the First Presbyterian church in Utica, N. Y., preached on the subject of Sabbath desecration. For the following extract of his discourse, I am indebted to the Utica Daily Press, of June 5. He said:

"Its birthplace was not Sinai but Eden. It was made for man, not for the Jews only. Its requirement is appropriate and beneficial in the Sandwich Islands as in Jericho—in Utica as in Jerusalem. From Sinai God said: 'Remember the Sabbath day' as a duty already well known, and as implying the possibility of their forgetting it. 'Remember' looks both ways. As long as the world exists and men exist in it, the fourth commandment will never become a dead letter. . . . The Sabbath is to the world what the Nile is to Egypt, a broad, beneficial stream whose source is in the exhaustless fountain of God's infinite mercy, that every seventh day since the world began has overflowed the banks of secular activity and enriched with its generous deposit of rest and reflection and worship, man's entire moral nature."

The above is a strong argument for the seventh day Sabbath, as the day made holy at Eden was the seventh day, and the "fourth commandment," which he tells us will "never become a dead letter," says that the "seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20:10. It is interesting to know how he can climb down and assign a scriptural reason for his practice of keeping Sunday. He does not give a biblical reason, but says:—

"The change from the seventh day to the first day was made because the Lord rose the first day of the week. Saturday is Creation's day. Sunday is Redeemer's day."

Of the above change from the seventh day to the first day there is not the slightest evidence to be found anywhere in the Bible. But the Bible does teach that "creation's day"—the seventh day—is the "Redeemer's day," for it was Jesus, the Son of God, who made the Sabbath, (John 1:1-3; Heb. 1:1-3; Col. 1:14-18; Gen. 2:2, 3); and it is his holy day (Neh. 9:11-14).

The remainder of his sermon was devoted largely to disclaiming against Sunday theaters, banquets, excursions, and Sunday trains, selling of ice cream, tobacco, base-ball games, Sunday newspapers, etc. Concerning base-ball, he said:—

"Sunday base ball has become a disorderly nuisance in Utica as well as elsewhere—a disturber of peace and comfort, a defiant trampler upon our Sabbath day rights. It frequently interferes with the quiet burial of the dead in Forest Hill with its boisterousness. It crowds the street cars with those whose language and demeanor are decidedly objectionable. It robs those residing near the ball grounds of their rest. It is an awful object lesson in lawlessness and irreverence."

We are inclined to think with Mr. Barrows, that the "rooters" at Sunday ball games are not among the salt of the earth; but why it is any more objectionable to use bad language on Sunday than on any other day, is not quite clear to the writer. Swearing and billingsgate are equally sinful and objectionable seven days in the week.

It is to be deplored that the quiet interment of the dead is interfered with on Sunday. But what about other days? We have heard no protest against Tuesday ball, and to our certain knowledge a hideous noise is sometimes made at the week-day games. People are buried on these days, too. Why is it worse to interfere with a funeral on Sunday than on other days?

The writer believes that the moral tendency of the theater is not good; yet it is not clear how it can be any worse to go to a theater on Sunday than on any other day. Why single out the Sunday theater, and say nothing concerning the theaters, concerts, etc., during the week. Are we to understand that the Rev. Barrows sanctions them the other six days?

We apprehend that the trouble now is the same as in the fourth century when the clergy petitioned the emperor that the shows might be transferred from Sunday to some other day, assigning as a reason that the people congregate more to the circus than to the church. Then the preachers had lost the power over the masses, and sought for the power of civil law to bring them to church. Will history repeat itself? Doubtless.
