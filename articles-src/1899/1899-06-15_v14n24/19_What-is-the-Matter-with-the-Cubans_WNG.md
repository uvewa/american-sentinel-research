THE people of the United States seem to have changed their minds about the people of Cuba. While Cuba was a Spanish colony, and her people were struggling for independence, the people of the United States deemed them eminently fitted for self-government. They urged this Government to recognize Cuban independence; they lauded the statesmanship of the leaders, and the intelligence and bravery and enterprise of the people. They resolved that the Cubans "are and of right ought to be free," etc., etc. And all sorts of bad things were said by politicians, preachers, and editors against the tyranny of Spain, because she would not at once grant self government to the Cubans. But since Spain has been compelled to loosen her grasp on the island, the Cubans have suddenly degenerated. They are "lazy," and "worthless," and "inclined to brigandage," and altogether "unreliable." They are, and will be for a generation to come, totally unfit for self-government.

What has brought about this great change? Is it contact with the great American Republic? Is it the influence of our boasted "Christian civilization"? Or what is it that, in a few short months after the disappearance of the Spanish flag, has had such a deteriorating effect on the character and capabilities of the Cubans? A year ago they were well qualified to govern themselves, and already they are so far short of the mark that no one can even surmise how far short they really are. Logically it would seem expedient for the United States to restore Cuba to Spain in order to save the Cubans from relapse into utter barbarity.

But is the trouble really with the Cubans? Have they actually become so radically changed in character? Is it not possible that we Americans have become so elated with our easy victory over "poor decrepit old Spain" that our eyes "stand out with fatness" until we cannot see the picture as we formerly did? Is it not because visions of expanded greatness of territory and national prestige have so befogged the atmosphere, that we no longer see human rights from a Republican standpoint, or Christianity from the standpoint of the Golden Rule?

"Thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judged: for wherein thou judges another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judges doest the same things." Rom. 2:1.
