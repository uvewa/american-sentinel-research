If there are any National Reformers in Louisiana they are either in a condition of *innocuous desuetude* or are awaiting the tide of other efforts to come this way and lift them out of their "slough of despond." For, the Sunday (the religious observance of which is in fact the true idea of National Reform) is looked upon as it was by its earliest promoters, to whom it was the "wild solar holiday of all pagan times." Particularly is this true in New Orleans, where during this summer an unusual amount of manifold amusements are being afforded to the public, and enthusiastically embraced by many church members as well as by non-church people. In short, Sunday observance here bears the stamp "continental" or "European," against which the church and state folk are wailing.

*New Orleans, La, May 26, 1899.*
