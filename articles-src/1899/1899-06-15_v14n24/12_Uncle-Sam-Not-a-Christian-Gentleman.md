We clip the following from the Union Signal, which reprints it from The New Voice, under the heading, "Too Much Uncle Sam":—

"Is it treason to confess it? We are growing sick and tired of Uncle Sam. We have seen too much of him in the last year—of his short-legged trousers, his star-spangled coat, his battered hat, and his general appearance of a good man gone wrong. We can't blame the old man for a bedraggled look, for he has been doing duty day and night in the newspaper offices ever since the Maine was blown up; but it is about time to give him a rest.

"He never did represent the better side of American life, anyhow. You can hardly imagine him in a quiet American family circle, doing his duty modestly and unassumingly as father and husband day after day. As pictured, he represents the semi clownish side of American life, the sort of man more at home in the corner tavern, with his feet on an empty beer-keg, squirting tobacco juice at the stove and hee hawing over some questionable stories, than performing the serious duties of life seriously. National aspirations of the right sort are not particularly enhanced by the 'Uncle Sam' our artists have been giving us. If that disreputable old 'gent' is the true embodiment of Americanism, the pope ought to have made his condemnation of 'Americanism' twenty times as sweeping as it was.

"Let the old man have a vacation, and let 'Columbia' and 'Liberty' run the house for a while.—The New Voice.

"And The Union Signal says, Amen."

"Columbia" and "Liberty" are prominent figures in American history, it is true; but beside the figure of "Uncle Sam"—especially of late years—they shrink into insignificance. It is "Uncle Sam" that runs the politics and goes to war. It is "Uncle Sam" that figures on the practical side of things in American government. And, as is confessed, his general conduct and appearance are sadly out of harmony with the Supreme Court dictum, so much cherished by some, that "this is a Christian nation." "Uncle Sam" would evidently be out of place in a Christian church.
