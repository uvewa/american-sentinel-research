RECENTLY there was held in Boston the annual gathering of "Christian Scientists" from this country and Europe. The meeting was held in the church building of the "First Church of Christ," which is the largest and most prominent church of this sect.

Some idea of the following that has been gained by "Christian Science" may be gathered from the following statement, which we take from reports of the meeting given by the New York Sun.

The total membership of the "Christian Scientist" body is 70,000, and nearly 300,000 are counted among the congregations attending their churches.

The "First Church of Christ," Boston, has alone a membership of 15,000, which makes it the largest single church of any denomination in the land. At this meeting, on "Communion Sunday," 2,400 members were added to this Boston church:

"Four communion services were held during the day, and 8,000 persons are said to have attended. Visitors were present from thirty States, and from Canada, the Bahamas, England, Scotland, and Australia. Among them were the Countess of Dumore and family, two daughters of Sir James Ramsay, of Banff, Scotland, and Prof. Hermann S. Hering, Second Reader in the Second Church of Christ, Baltimore, and Associate Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department of the Johns Hopkins University.

"The services consisted of an organ voluntary, the singing of one of 'Mother' Mary Baker Eddy's hymns, reading from the Scriptures, 'the Lord's Prayer with the Christian Science spiritual interpretation of the same,' another hymn, a solo, and the reading of 'Mother' Eddy's 'Message.' 'Mother' Eddy stayed at her home near Concord, N. H., to avoid the enthusiasm of the worshipers."

Evidence was not wanting of the tendency to man-worship which crops out in every false religion. "Many of the non-resident scientists visited the 'Mother Room' in the church, a suite of apartments fitted up for 'Mother' Eddy and having already some of the characteristics of a shrine. The walls and floors of these rooms are entirely covered with mosaics in elaborate designs. A large oil painting of the table and chair used by Mrs. Eddy while writing 'Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures' adorns one side of the room. The windows are all pictured, and the appointments are of the richest and most beautiful character. These rooms were tastefully adorned with cut flowers."

Throughout the civilized world it is to-day very much as it was in Athens in the time of St. Paul—the multitudes are ready to hear and be carried away with some new doctrine. And they prefer a new doctrine that has a Christian name; only it must not contain the old-fashioned Christianity of the Bible.

The Bible is a treatise upon Christian Science of the true kind—the science of salvation from sin. Upon that science no human text-book is needed.
