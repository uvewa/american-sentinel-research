While Congress was discussing the question of the propriety of taking forcible possession of the Philippines, one senator, in reply to a speech by Senator Platt, of Connecticut favoring annexation, declared that "Connecticut liberty" would not suit the people and conditions in the Philippines. That there was much truth in this statement is apparent from the fact that American self-government does not suit the people of Cuba. The liberty which the United States brought to the Cubans appears to be the liberty to govern themselves according to American methods and ideas,—a self-government in which the Cubans see no liberty at all. For, as they doubtless realize, the very essence of liberty to any people is the liberty to govern themselves in their own way; and to be compelled to adopt the methods and ideas of another power, is to be virtually made subject to that power.

This is an injustice to the Cubans, and so plainly seen as such not only in Cuba but in America, that some American journals are protesting against it. The following from a prominent daily in this city, is to the point:—

"There is no doubt that many of the Cubans are beginning to hate us pretty thoroughly, and no wonder. They are Spanish, and we insist on making them into Anglo-Saxons. They are all smokers—men, women, and children—and we prohibit them from smoking in street cars. They, like all Latins, are accustomed to make Sunday a holiday, and we insist that they shall abstain from all amusements on Sunday; we even have prohibited the American game of baseball on that day. Indeed, we go further than anybody dares to go in America: we actually forbid the Cuban to go about in his tropical climate with less than two shirts.

"That is, we not alone make ourselves hateful in the eyes of the Cubans; we make ourselves ridiculous.

"Now comes the information that our Governor-General of Cuba, General Brooke, has issued a new order making 'a civil ceremony' essential to the legality of a Cuban marriage. We do not know exactly what this order means. If it means to make a 'civil marriage' compulsory, in addition to the church marriage, which their religion imposes on the Cubans, it is a thoroughly vicious order, since it in fact makes two payments compulsory, one to the state and one to the church. The result inevitably will be that many couples will not marry at all, but will live together as man and wife, without the sanction of law or church.

"The 'civil ceremony' may possibly mean something else. It may simply mean that the parties before getting married shall procure a marriage license. This of course would be entirely proper.

"But it is time for the systematic exasperation of the people under our protection by the imposition upon them of an alien code of morals and propriety to cease."

This method of conferring liberty on the Cubans is very similar to the method by which the Roman republic conferred liberty upon the weaker nations which accepted her intervention; and in that part of the history of Rome may be read the present history of affairs between Cuba and the United States.
