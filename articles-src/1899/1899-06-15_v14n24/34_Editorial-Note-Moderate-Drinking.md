THE discovery is announced that "moderate drinking" of alcoholic liquors is harmless to the drinker and even helpful, within certain limits. So says Professor Atwater, at the conclusion of some experiments conducted by him under the auspices of the national committee appointed to investigate the drink problem in this country, of which President Low, of Columbia University, is chairman.

By this the professor means that a certain amount of alcohol—two ounces, he says—may be taken into the human body daily, in whisky, wine, beer, or other form, without causing injury to the physical system.

With all due respect to Professor Atwater and his supporters, we must say that we do not believe his conclusions are correct. And we base our belief in the matter on experiments in "moderate drinking" that have been in process very many years, and by hundreds of thousands of people. We do not think Mr. Atwater's experiments can have the practical value of these other experiments which are a part of the actual life experience of thousands—yes, millions—of people.

This experience shows plainly enough that "moderate drinking" is injurious, since it is the beginning of all drunkenness. This "moderate drinking" brings the individual into a condition where he desires to drink immoderately, and desires this so strongly that he has not will power enough to resist it. And this condition betokens a most serious derangement of his physical being; that is certain. The perversion of any one of the physical senses is a physical injury of the most serious kind.

But this conclusion by Professor Atwater is just what is wanted by saloonists and moderate drinkers, and will doubtless contribute to swell the unsteady ranks of the army that goes yearly into the drunkard's grave, and thus furnish its own ghastly refutation.
