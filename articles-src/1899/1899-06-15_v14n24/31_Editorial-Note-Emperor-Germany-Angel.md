BY ORDER OF THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY, a colossal bronze statue of an angel has been cast, which is to be the chief ornament in a memorial park in Lorraine. A press dispatch says of it that "the emperor's angel does not hail from The Hague, and has no sympathy with pleas for peace; for it is clad in full armor and emblematic of war in all its sterner aspects." Emperor William would do much better to try to pattern himself after an angel, than to pattern an angel after himself.
