THE "American Sabbath" is passing away; that is, the religious regard for Sunday is dying out, as is pointed out in the article quoted from the New York Sun, page 373. But the desire to enforce Sunday observance by law is not dying out. A person may desire to enforce Sunday on others who cares nothing for it himself; this has been seen over and over in the cases that have been brought into the courts. The enforcement of religious observances is religious persecution, and religious persecution will never die out as long as the religion of Christ is in the world. Religious persecution is in most cases not prompted by a regard for religion, but by a desire to get rid of the witness which religious truth gives against religious error, which righteousness gives against unrighteousness. It is the repetition of the story of Cain and Abel.
