The time has evidently come when the United States is expected to participate with the powers of Europe in the readjustment of political boundary lines on the continent of Asia. Having taken possession of the Philippine Islands the United States is provided with a convenient base of operations for a further advance westward; and it is only to be expected that, having entered thus far upon a policy of expansion, this Government will advance to the more fruitful fields beyond. The same policy which justifies the steps already taken, calls for and justifies the steps necessary to establish the United States as a power upon the mainland of Eastern Asia.

Accordingly, it was quite fitting that the New York Chamber of Commerce should at a recent meeting listen to a speech by Mr. John Barrett, former United States minister to Siam, in which it was set forth that America is now the arbiter of China's future, and that this Government must now take action with reference to the policies that are being pursued by the European powers in China.

In his speech Mr. Barrett said:—

"The most important statement that I wish to make to-day is this: America is to-day the arbiter of China's future. This is a tremendous responsibility, which has suddenly and unexpectedly come upon us within the last few months, or almost at this hour, and it directly involves the preservation, protection, and development of our present considerable and future vast trade and commerce with this most populous and wide-reaching empire of all Asia.

"The move that England has recently made upon the chessboard of Asiatic politics, by practically agreeing with Russia as to what shall be respectively Russian and English spheres of influence, may be well judged, but it has placed her irrevocably in the category of nations that recognize spheres of influence, or areas of development, which are nothing more than sugar-coated diplomatic phrases and synonyms of areas of actual sovereignty.

"Russia, Germany, France, and even Austria and Italy had long ago indicated their position. Now that England has joined them, America stands alone as the only great power not committed to such a destructive and divisional policy. In other words, if the United States to-morrow, in diplomatic note or agreement, recognize spheres of influence, all hope for the maintenance of the integrity of China is gone—that is, America is at this moment the arbiter of China's future.

"While I would cast no reflections on the honest opinions of men who, in possible patriotic interpretation of sentiment, oppose our policy of expansion in the far East, I would beg to suggest that in this instance expansion is a synonym for commerce—and commerce is the life-blood of nations. . . . For, after all, in the application among nations of the cruel principle of the survival of the fittest, the material interests involved are usually the deciding influence."

"America is at this moment the arbiter of China's future," and is expected to assert her power in this respect. She is to "expand" to the shores of China. "In this instance expansion is a synonym for commerce, and commerce is the life-blood of nations"—particularly so of those nations which "expansion" absorbs. There must be an application of the "cruel principle of the survival of the fittest," and "the material interests involved" are the "deciding influence."

Such is the influence that is pushing the United States into the arena of political strife in Asia. Will the prize that is gained be worth the price that will be paid? No more important question is to-day before the American people.
