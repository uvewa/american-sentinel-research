There is an agitation for more stringent enforcement of the Sunday law in Williamsport, Pa. The facts in reference to the movement are stated by Williamsport journal, as follows:—

"The ministers and church-going people of the city are becoming very much exercised over the rapidly increasing disregard for Sunday that they claim is cropping out of many sides in Williamsport. Tobacco stands, ice cream parlors, candy stores, soda fountains and similar places of business, they say, are wide open on Sunday, and the church people who have the matter in charge, contend that that is an open violation of the Blue Laws of Pennsylvania, which were enforced during Mayor Mansel's administration.

"Each succeeding day the movement against the 'open door' on Sunday is getting more followers, they say, and at a recent meeting of the Methodist ministers the matter was given some consideration.

"Last evening a committee of two ladies, one from an Episcopal church and the other from a Methodist church, held a conference with Chief-of-Police Stryker that continued from shortly before 8 o'clock until about 9 o'clock. The 'open door' was discussed, but nothing definite was done. The two ladies, it is said, were anxious to learn how to proceed in the matter to have the stores closed on Sunday.

"It is understood that the ministers of the city will take some action concerning the opening of stores on the Sabbath."

This movement is made by the church people of Williamsport, and this fact is sufficient evidence that it is based on religious grounds. They oppose Sunday opening because they believe it is irreligious; and they want this irreligious conduct suppressed by force.

But if they should succeed in suppressing all forms of trade on Sunday—all the tobacco shops, ice cream parlors, candy stores, etc.,—would there be any more morality in Williamsport than there was before?

When an individual wants to sell goods on Sunday, but does not because he is forced to discontinue, is he made any more moral than he was before? Can any person be made moral by force? And if not, can the application of force which is sought in Williamsport, to close up all stores on Sunday, make any difference at all in the morality of that city?

Doubtless it can make the city seem more moral; but is there any advantage in mere pretense? Is there any advantage, morally, in seeming to be what you are not? Is there any virtue in hypocrisy? Is it any better to be a Pharisee than a publican and a sinner?

These are questions that should be seriously considered by the church people of Williamsport before going further in this crusade. No doubt they are actuated by a sincere desire to promote the moral welfare of the people; but if this is what they desire, why do they not seek to arouse the consciences of those engaged in Sunday traffic, rather than to suppress them by brute force?

A kind of church work which does not touch the conscience is something not included in the gospel commission given by Jesus Christ. Of course, it would be a difficult task to arouse conscience on the point of Sunday observance, there being no scripture upon which the appeal to conscience could be based. Sunday observance rests upon tradition; and somehow conscience does not respond well to an appeal based upon tradition. Yet there is scripture in plenty supporting Sabbath observance, and to this the consciences of many will respond. And certain it is that the only Sabbath observance which is of benefit to any person is that based upon Scripture and conscience, and not upon the law and the courts.
