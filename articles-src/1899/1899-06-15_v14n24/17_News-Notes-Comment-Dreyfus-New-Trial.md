DREYFUS, the French army officer and victim of a military anti-semitic conspiracy, has been granted a new trial by the French Court of Cassation, and several perpetrators of the plot against him are under arrest. As Dreyfus was practically cleared of the charge of treason made against him before the court decided to grant a new trial, the latter is expected to be only a formality ending in a verdict of not guilty. Thus a plot which had its origin in religious animosity finally, as so many like plots before it have done, reacts to the undoing of its originators.
