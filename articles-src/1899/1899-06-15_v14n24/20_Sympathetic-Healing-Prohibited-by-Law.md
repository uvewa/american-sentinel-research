A SAMPLE case of "sympathetic healing" has recently been brought before a civil court in the Brooklyn borough of this city. The "sympathetic healer" was a woman named Muller, and the patient a young girl who had developed gangrene in her foot. The following facts in the case are given by the New York Sun:

"Mrs. Muller first called to see the child on April 17. No one had sent for her, and she explained that she had learned of Dora's illness through a relative of the family. When the mother told Mrs. Muller that the doctors all said that amputation would be necessary, the woman remarked: 'You don't need any doctors.' Then Mrs. Muller removed the bandages, and, after making motions over the foot, applied a dark-colored salve to the affected part. Next she produced a package containing a substance which she said was tea she had brought with her from Germany, and pouring some boiling water on it, applied a poultice of it to the limb. She also instructed the mother to have the patient drink the tea three times a day. Mrs. Schneider dismissed Dr. Dixon in accordance with instructions from Mrs. Muller, who said:

"'You must not let any doctor in. If any doctor comes I cannot cure the girl.'

"On April 19, the foot meanwhile having become worse, Mrs. Muller made her second visit and again went through the motions over the foot and applied the black salve. This treatment was continued until May 5, when the authorities of the Eastern District Hospital were notified and took charge of the patient. On the following day the foot dropped off, and it was found necessary to amputate the leg just above the knee to save the child's life. Even after the foot had dropped off Mrs. Muller said she could perform an operation herself, but thought it best to call in the hospital authorities. Mrs. Schneider said that she had paid Mrs. Muller $31 at the end of the first week, and $20 more at the close of the second. Mrs. Muller said that under ordinary circumstances her fee would be $5 a visit, but that in this case, so much having been already expended on doctors, she would only charge $1.50."

The court found Mrs. Muller guilty of the crime of practicing medicine without a license, and sentenced her to five months in the penitentiary.

Every child has a natural right to live, and the purpose of civil government being to preserve this and other natural rights, any practice by which the loss of this right is threatened comes naturally within the prohibitory scope of the law. While many intricate questions might arise in the attempt to give this principle the broadest application, it is clear that the same right by which the government is justified in taking measures to prevent people from being swindled out of their money, will justify it in preventing an innocent child from being swindled out of her life.
