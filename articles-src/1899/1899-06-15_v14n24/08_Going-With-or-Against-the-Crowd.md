It is a good thing to go with the multitude when one can do so with a good conscience. It is better to be in harmony with one's fellows than to quarrel with them, if peace and righteousness can be harmonized. And it is a mistake to cultivate differences about small matters, and thus needlessly weaken their respect for our judgment. But, as this world is constituted, it is not always possible to escape the necessity of dissent and resistance to the judgment of the multitude. The only multitude that ever rises to the highest level of truth and righteousness is "the great multitude which no man could number," which John sees before the throne. Earthly crowds commonly rise no higher than the lower average of sentiment and opinion in their own ranks. They are liable to the contagion of fear, hatred, and other passions. Even the good people among them are not always at their best, and have to be on their guard against "following a multitude to do evil."
