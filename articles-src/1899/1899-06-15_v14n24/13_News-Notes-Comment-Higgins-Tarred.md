An evangelist named Higgins was recently tarred and feathered by a mob of citizens at Levant, Me., and carried out of town on a rail. He is a preacher of a sect called the "Disciples of the Holy Ghost," which has a central colony in the State at Durham. The only provocation given by Mr. Higgins appears to have been such as arose from opposition to his religious views. The civil authorities are seeking to discover the perpetrators of the outrage, and a number of arrests have been made, although Mr. Higgins refused to make any complaint.
