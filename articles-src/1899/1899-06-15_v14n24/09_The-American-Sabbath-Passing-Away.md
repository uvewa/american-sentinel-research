The Rev. Dr. Hathaway, representing the "Sabbath Union," preached at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church last Sunday on the decline in church attendance, and as he had only about fifty listeners there was before him ample justification for his lamentation.

Dr. Hathaway's explanation of the increasing disregard of church services was that Sunday excursion trains, bicycling, and the Sunday newspapers distract the people from the house of God. In the instance of the Fifth Avenue Church, however, another potent distraction at this season is the hot weather, which has sent so many of the parishioners to the country, where, if they are so disposed, they can find Presbyterian worship to attend, though it is true that there also wheeling and golfing continue to tempt them to avoid it. But as these Sunday amusements are commended and pursued, even by Christian ministers themselves, the Rev. Dr. Rainsford, for instance, how can laymen be expected to eschew them?

Sunday, accordingly, has become the great day of the week for wheeling and for playing golf, and among those who engage most ardently in the sports are very many people, young and old, upon whom the churches have been accustomed to depend for attendants. The way to the "desecration of the Sabbath," as Dr. Hathaway called it, having thus been opened, all forms of amusement not intrinsically vicious begin to be tolerated. The cloth which formerly covered the billiard table on Sunday is now removed, even in Presbyterian households, gay entertainments occur, and the day once observed with so much religious austerity is now utilized chiefly for pleasure and recreation.

The "American Sabbath" is passing away. Its destruction, however, has not been due to the Sunday newspaper, for the reading of that, when it is worth reading at all, constitutes one of the more serious occupations of a day which is now so largely given up to sport and frivolity. A good Sunday newspaper is rather a conservative than a destructive force, and upon it more than any other agency the churches will have to rely if they shall ever be able to kindle again the faith which alone will fill their pews.

The reason why church attendance is declining, unless among the Roman Catholics, is not the competition of the popular desire for wheeling and for golf, nor the appetite for reading, but the cooling of the religious faith of the people. In place of an eager craving for the teaching of the church there has come in widespread religious indifference. People who once accepted the Bible without question are now asking themselves why they should believe it and why they should read it more than any other book, and the question has been put in their minds even by the theologians and doctors of divinity approved and honored by the church, who have relegated it to a place along with human literature generally.

That is the seat of the trouble. People are indifferent about going to church because they are taught even by the church itself that the supernatural foundation on which alone it can rest is imaginary only. What other result could have been expected from such teaching? The Briggses, the McGifferts, and the rest may fight shy of the logical conclusion of their argument, but they cannot keep other people from going to it.
