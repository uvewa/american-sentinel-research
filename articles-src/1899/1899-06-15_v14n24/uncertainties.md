## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 09 — "The 'American Sabbath' Passing Away" (reprint from New York Sun)

- **Location:** Paragraph mentioning "The Briggses, the McGifferts"
- **OCR text:** "The Briggses, the McGifferts" — OCR rendered as "Briggses" in one location, but also "Briggss" in close reading. Transcribed as "Briggses" (plural of Briggs, referring to Charles Briggs, the theologian).
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the plural form "Briggses" is a standard pluralization and contextually consistent with the reference to McGiffert (plural would be unusual, so the singular surname "Briggs" pluralized to "Briggses" seems correct).

### Article 10 — "Sunday Desecration" (by G. B. Thompson)

- **Location:** Author attribution
- **Note:** "G. B. Thompson" is not in the known authors list. This appears to be a new contributor. Initials used as GBT.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — author name fully spelled out in the OCR: "BY G. B. THOMPSON."

### Article 22 — "Sunday in Louisiana" (by S. B. Horton)

- **Location:** Author attribution
- **Note:** "S. B. Horton" is not in the known authors list. New contributor, initials used as SBH.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — author name clear in OCR.

### Article 26 — "Plain Truths About the Pulpit"

- **Location:** Letter signed "E. N. B."
- **Note:** The article is a letter submitted to the Chicago Times-Herald, which is quoted at length by the Sentinel. The letter writer signs as "E. N. B." — identity unknown. The article itself is editorial in attribution (the Sentinel introduced and quotes the letter approvingly). The closing "E. N. B." has been preserved in the body of the article.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — initials clearly given in OCR.

### Page 1 — Front-page illustration caption

- **Note:** The OCR includes a reference to a photograph of Mr. J. T. Eaton hoeing corn on Sunday. This caption text was not included as article content but is reflected in the Eaton case article (article 02). The caption reads: "This view is taken from a photograph, and shows Mr. J. T. Eaton, of Rome, Ga., exactly as he appeared hoeing in his corn patch on a recent Sunday, for which 'crime' he was tried and convicted under the Sunday law, and but for an appeal to the higher court would have been sentenced to the chain-gang. Mr. Eaton's house is shown in the background. As the illustration shows, Mr. Eaton was a long distance from the road along which the individuals passed who were 'shocked' to see him at work."
- **Decision:** Caption not transcribed as a separate article (it describes a photograph); the substance is conveyed by article 02.

### Page 1 — Aphorisms title

- **Note:** The front-page aphorisms (article 01) have no heading in the original. Titled "Editorial Maxims" for file organization purposes.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — no title exists in the source; editorial title assigned for cataloging only.

### "Going With or Against the Crowd" — attribution format

- **Note:** Source is given in OCR as: heading "Going With or Against the Crowd." followed by '"Sunday School Times."' on its own line. This was treated as a reprint from the Sunday School Times. No author given for the piece in the original.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — attribution format consistent with reprint pattern in the Sentinel.

### "The 'American Sabbath' Passing Away" — source format

- **Note:** Source given as: heading followed immediately by '*New York "Sun."*'. Treated as reprint from New York Sun.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.
