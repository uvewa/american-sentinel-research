A writer in the Chicago Times-Herald of recent date gives an excellent statement of facts touching one of the most serious questions of the day—"The Future of the Pulpit." Evidently, there are some persons who see plainly enough what is the matter with the pulpit, and this writer is one of them. Indeed, in view of the plain truths which apply to this question, it is strange that the remedy is not seen and applied everywhere that a sincere desire exists for the restoration of the pulpit power of former times. The truths here stated need to be set before the minds of both clergy and people, for their guidance in the crisis that has now been reached. If generally comprehended and accepted, the nation would be saved from the fate which awaits every people when the church seeks to an unlawful and mistaken source of power to supply the power she has lost. The writer says:—

"In your issue of the 30th of April, your editorial 'The Future of the Pulpit' attracted my attention, both from the importance of the subject, and also from the failure of that article and its quotations to touch the cause of the loss of authority and power by pulpit and preacher. When Jesus commenced his pulpit ministry in the synagogue of Nazareth, he opened his service with a reading from the prophecy of Isaiah foretelling of himself: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.' That Spirit had anointed him at his baptism, when the voice publicly acknowledged him as 'Beloved Son.' When the 'day of Pentecost was fully come,' the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, according to Christ's promise to them made on the mount of ascension, when he charged them as 'witnesses unto me . . . unto the uttermost part of the earth.' Such men, so endowed, preached with power of God, and thousands on that day testified to its saving power. There was a house in old Damascus on a certain street called 'Straight.' There Ananias met one Saul of Tarsus and said to him: 'The Lord even Jesus hath sent me that thou mightest be filled with the Holy Ghost.' Such a man, so endowed, preached with power of God, to slaves and kings, to Roman and Greek, to Jew and Gentile, and thousands testified to its saving power. And from that early time till now, whenever and wherever any man so endowed and so filled has preached the gospel of Christ, it has been with power. The future of such preachers and such pulpits could be written with certainty, even by a writer for the secular press.

"Too many of the pulpits and church platforms of to-day are only lecture rostrums, where the Almighty, holy and just, is wholly ignored. Where a personal spirit is repudiated and denied, where a sin-bearing Christ is scouted, and in their stead is reared for worship in these buildings a calf of gilt decked with flowers and ribbons, scraps of poetry, quotations from salacious authors bathed in waves of operatic music, uttered by lips all too unholy, this substitution for the worship of God soon grows tame and wearisome, for even an 'institutional church' cannot as yet compete with a first-class play-house.

"No uncertain sound should issue from God's messengers, for they represent what you call the 'pulpit.' There must be no hesitancy or wavering of belief concerning the message they proclaim to a dying world. The true prophet of God must be a soldier, 'captain of the host of the Lord,' sword in hand, and that sword of the Spirit is the Word of God, and must be sharp, not hacked and dulled by president or dean, not a gift weapon, with handle crusted with pearls and blade adorned with inscription and made dull with flowers, but 'sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow.' If he who stands in the 'pulpit' of to-day or the future be a true prophet of God, he was charged by God through his prophet Ezekiel to 'speak with my words unto them,' 'whether they will hear or forbear,' and if this be not done, God declares 'blood will I require at thine hand.' The fruitful pulpits and the successful laborers of the past have been places and men from which came forth no smooth utterances of false hopes for itching ears, but God's truth, slaying but to make alive.

"If you wish to know the secret and cause of the decline of the power of the pulpit and influence of peachers, you have only to look at the advertised service in Saturday evening and Sunday morning papers, and then on Monday morning read the synopsis of the sermons (?) as published, consisting of addresses, lectures, essays, speculations and tirades on all subjects. He is a rare preacher who dares to declare the whole counsel of God to his hearers, as did some of the old-time ministers. A Moody can still fill the largest house, a Spurgeon had no need or use for stereopticons to fill his tabernacle. Such men as these recognize God, and Spirit, and Christ, and depend upon them in their work. They take in hand the Bible as their sword, the old Bible, that for eighteen hundred years has wrought such mighty work in the world, before the men whom God did not consult in its preparation had begun their investigating, and criticising and ruining, and so breaking up the faith of thousands. Such men go from closet to platform with bowed heads and tender hearts, accompanied by the Spirit of the living God, believing they have God's message and that he will speak through them. Ernest, faithful men, who believe their God to be 'the same yesterday, to-day and forever.' Such men will not need to depend on brass band, or pictures, or sensational utterances for congregations, for they depend on God's Spirit, who never fails them who put their trust in him.

"Any man can foretell 'the future of the pulpit,' or of a church, or of a nation, when he knows how God and his commands are viewed by preacher and people."

"Belief in the supernatural is fast being eliminated from too much of the modern teaching. The test of man's fallible reason must be applied to all things religious, although that same reason stands helpless and weak before a thousand secular and material things. There is no other so self-conceited and arrogant spirit known as that of so-called education. The pride of wealth is tame before it.

"Presidents and professors and preachers are 'out-Heroding Herod' in their attempts to outdo each other in their vague and demoralizing speculations. They are specialists gone crazy on their sociological hobbies, substituting their vagaries for God's mind. Then let schools and teachers and preachers back to God's Word as it was and is, back to Christ and his commands, back to the Spirit, their Comforter, and the pulpit is safe.
