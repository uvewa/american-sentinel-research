The following quotations are from a letter received at this office from Mr. J. T. Eaton, now under indictment at Rome, Ga., for hoeing corn on Sunday, as illustrated on the front page of this paper. They throw additional light on the nature of the motive which prompts the prosecution in his case:—

"Some of the people here have the prosecuting witness that made the affidavit against me badly scared. It is alleged that he sold a sack of meal last Sunday, and the Sunday after he had me arrested, it is said, he was seen to hand out a plug of tobacco at a side window in the back end of the store. He runs a small store or stand.

"One other of the prosecuting witnesses is an engineer, who spends two or three hours each Sunday cleaning out the boiler of his engine.

"Now I don't think these men should be put to any trouble over their Sunday work, but it does show their inconsistency.

"Some have wanted me to have them arrested for Sunday work. I tell them, No. Religious liberty is just what I am contending for.

"Many are very friendly and willing to help me. All I ask is that it may all work out to the glory of God."
