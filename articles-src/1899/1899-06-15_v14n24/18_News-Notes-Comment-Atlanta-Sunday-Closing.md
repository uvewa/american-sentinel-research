CLERGYMEN of Atlanta, Ga., are still prosecuting vigorously the campaign for Sunday closing. At last reports they were debating with some of the city councilmen a proposition to allow the Sunday selling of fruit. In their sermons on Sunday desecration the clergy declare that "only works of mercy and necessity" should be allowed on the "Sabbath." It would be interesting to discover how nearly these clergymen are agreed among themselves on the question of just what are "works of mercy and necessity." We are of the opinion that as many differing lists of such works would be enumerated as there might be clergymen who would separately undertake to name them.
