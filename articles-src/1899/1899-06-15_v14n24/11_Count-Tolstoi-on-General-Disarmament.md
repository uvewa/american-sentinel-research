Count Leo Tolstoi, the Russian, is one of the most unique figures of international prominence in the world to-day. The chief basis of this distinction is his opposition to war, which he opposes upon the principle of obedience to the divine command, "Thou shalt not kill." Surrounded by the features of active militarism which the Russian governments presents, his peace-loving personality is all the more striking: In the czar's undertaking for the promotion of peace among the nations, Count Tolstoi naturally takes a deep interest; and in reply to a letter written him from Sweden, signed by a number of prominent men, he has expressed his views on the question of the means by which international disarmament can be realized.

He declares there is only one way in which this is possible, and that is by individual refusal to perform military duty. It must become a matter of conscience, and therefore a matter for individual decision. The language of Count Tolstoi on the subject is a tribute to the value of individualism, and expresses a divine truth to which every lover of personal liberty should adhere. His words may well be given the widest possible circulation, and to this end we quote the following paragraphs:—

"As to the people who, from conscientious motives, refuse to do military service, experience teaches that every government treats them as the Russian government has treated the Doukobors, though perhaps in less cruel fashion. While Russia is announcing to the whole world her alleged message of peace, she is torturing, destroying, and expelling the most peaceful beings of the Muscovite domain, simply because these unsophisticated subjects are religiously convinced that it is wrong to kill their fellow-being who are not criminals, even if ordered to do so by the authorities. We find things not much better in this matter in Austria, Russia, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, and even Holland. Since these governments rule their subjects by force, which is issued mainly by a disciplined army, they cannot consent to a diminution of this force and hearken to the scruples of individuals. If they would consent to this there would be barely enough soldiers to compel people to labor for their living. Nobody likes to kill or be killed.

"The Liberals, Socialists, and other so-called progressionists may imagine that their eloquent speeches in Parliament and assemblies, their unions, their strikes and their brochures, are very important for the progress of mankind, and that the refusal of individuals to render military service is an insignificant social phenomenon, which is not worth heeding; but the governments know better what is important and what is unimportant. They willingly permit thundering speeches in parliaments and socialistic demonstrations, because they know that such movements are quite useful, for thus the attention of the nations is diverted from these means of emancipation which are really dangerous to governmental stability.

"What the governments fear more than anything else is the awakening of individual worth in their subjects, and subsequently their refusal to serve in the army or to pay taxes for the maintenance of the military. They will never openly permit such refusals, and the guilty ones will either be punished in secret or removed from the country.

"So long as the powers will not only seek to acquire new possessions (the Philippines, Port Arthur, etc.), but will insist on retaining such as have been acquired by conquest (Poland, India, Alsace, Algiers, Egypt, etc.), and so long as these powers govern their subjects by force, it is imperious that their armies be constantly increased. Private individuals will never be allowed to shift their military duties; such movements will be secretly suppressed.

"Armies will not be diminished or abolished until men will seek to make themselves willing and unrighteous slaves of others by subjecting themselves to an animal training called discipline. Not until human dignity is awakened in the individual will men throw off this galling yoke; and not until the true enlightenment is spread among men will human dignity inspire them.

"I mean by the true enlightenment, not that which permits the privileged ones, who have mastered the sciences and have at their command the uses of modern inventions, to suppress their less favored fellowmen. I mean by the term enlightenment that which enables the individual to refuse to give his liberty, which is the foundation of true human dignity, into the hands of others and to be himself responsible for his own actions. Only when this true enlightenment has thoroughly permeated mankind can the armies be gradually diminished and finally abolished. But this change of conditions will not be introduced with the will, but against the will of the powers.

"It was recently reported that an American regiment refused to go to Iloilo. This report was received by the world with gaping surprise. It is more astonishing, however, that all the regiments of Russia, Germany, France, Italy and America, who have fought in recent times, did not do the same thing, instead of submitting themselves to the moods of others, who sent them to kill men who were total strangers to them. For when men nowadays go to war or enter the military to be enslaved by superiors whom they cannot respect it is only because they are still enthralled by the most abominable moral barbarism.

"In order, therefore, to diminish or abolish armies and to ameliorate the evils they cause, it is not necessary to call together prodigious international conferences. All that is needed, I reiterate, is a true enlightenment of the citizens, who are constantly deceived by their rulers, even through such a conference as was called together by Russia.

"In order to diminish or abolish armies, it is necessary to so educate men that the reports of this conference are not received by them with enthusiastic approval, as is now the case, but with scorn and disdain, or, rather, with fear.

"On the other hand, the suppressed and unknown refusals of individuals to render military service should be proclaimed to all the world as examples of heroism of men suffering for freedom and progress.

"The armies will only, then, be abolished when public opinion will recognize the worth of these heroes and the evil they seek to overcome. Then a new era will dawn for humanity.

"I am therefore convinced that the refusals of individuals to enter the army are of extraordinary importance. That they will free the world from militarism is true; but your idea that the conference will contribute toward this is erroneous. The conference can only throw sand into the eyes of the world and hide the only means of rescue."
