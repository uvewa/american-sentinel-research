A correspondent in Akron, Ohio, informs us that the Ministerial Association of that place has prevailed on the authorities to enforce strict Sunday closing, and Akron people who do not feel like going to church on Sunday can stay at home and pass the time the best way they can. They are denied recreation—the pleasure resorts are all closed. They must get their Sunday enjoyment out of religion, or not at all.

Do the church people of Akron imagine that this spirit of "enjoy yourself in my way or not at all," is the spirit of Christianity? Have only church going people the right to enjoy themselves on Sunday? Must a person be denied enjoyment on that day because he is not religious?

If an individual does not choose to be religious—if he rejects Christianity and the joy of the life to come—if he cuts himself off from eternal pleasures in the kingdom of God, must he therefore be deprived of even the poor pleasures of this world? Ought not Christians to pity such unfortunate ones in view of their loss of eternal joys, and not strive to curtail the few pleasures they have left in this world?

The AMERICAN SENTINEL contends for the right of every man—Christian or non-Christian—to enjoy himself on Sunday, in any way which does not infringe on the rights of others. This is a God-given right, of which no man can justly be deprived. The Ministerial Association of Akron would do well to bear in mind that the God of heaven and earth, the Creator of all, "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." It would go hard with Sunday breaking sinners in this world if some of these ministerial associations had control of the sunrise and the showers.
