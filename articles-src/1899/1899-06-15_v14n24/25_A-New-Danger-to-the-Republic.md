Under the heading, "Blacklisting: the New Slavery," the Literary Digest devotes several columns to a discussion of the danger which threatens the American Republic from the method employed by railway and other corporations of "blacklisting" employees who have not been subservient to their will.

An object lesson in this matter has recently been brought before the public by a suit for damages brought by Mr. F. R. Ketcham, a Chicago & Northwestern Railway employee against that company for having been blacklisted for joining in the great strike of 1894. It appears that an understanding has been reached by all the railway companies, by which no applicant for work who is blacklisted by one company can obtain work with any other company. He must first obtain the consent of the company by which he was last employed, this consent or release being commonly called a "clearance." The nature of this document may be understood from the following sentence contained in a "clearance" produced by one of the witnesses at this trial: "He has permission to obtain work elsewhere." Thus a railway corporation now arrogates to itself the privilege not only of withholding from an individual permission to work for that corporation, but even of obtaining work elsewhere! Such a system, it has been well said, amounts to "slavery pure and simple."

Are American workingmen to become slaves? If so, what is to become of republican government in the United States?

The counsel for Mr. Ketcham, Mr. W. J. Strong, sets forth the nature and the danger of the blacklisting system in the following language:

"The Supreme Court of the United States, at the last term, in the case of Allgeyer vs. Louisiana, held that the word 'liberty,' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, means not merely the right to freedom from physical restraint, but also the right to pursue any livelihood or calling. If, then, a man is denied the right of contracting for his labor, he is denied the liberty guaranteed him by the Constitution.

"If a man who quits the employ of another cannot get work in his chosen occupation without first obtaining the consent of the man whose employ he has left, he becomes a slave. He will not dare resist any oppression his employer may see fit to impose upon him. His wages may be cut to the starvation point; he may be called upon to work extra hours; yet he dare not complain, as he knows he cannot leave and get employment elsewhere. If he protests, his employer will say: 'Very well, if you don't like it, you can quit.' The man having a wife and children to support will bow in submission, knowing that his master has him in his power, and that he cannot support his family if he is defiant, as he cannot get work elsewhere without the consent of his employer.

"This is slavery pure and simple, yet it is without exaggeration the condition of most railroad employees in this country to-day. The blacklisting system is also being adopted in nearly all other branches of corporate employment, such as the large packing-houses, street railroads, clothing manufactories, and coal mines. It is one of the growing evils of the present era of combinations and trusts, menacing the liberty of a large class of our citizens.

"A recent illustration shows this. In 1897 the Chicago City Railway Company, as I have mentioned, forbade their employees to join a union, and discharged such as did join. The men, having freshly in mind the terrible suffering and privations of the American Railway Union men who struck out of sympathy for the oppressed employees of the Pullman Company, also knowing that winter was coming on, yielded to the tyranny of the company rather than bring misery and distress on their wives and children.

"The railroads use the black list not only to punish those who have been discharged, but to coerce and intimidate those still in their employ.

"How long will it be, if blacklisting is allowed to continue and spread, before the laboring masses of the country, having become the helpless tools of these mighty masters, will do their bidding in the exercise of the elective franchise? We shall then have a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations. The wage-earner who feels his little children tugging at his coat-tails for bread will fear, in voting, to assert his manhood and resist oppression. Can a republic made up of such citizens long endure? Are such mere tools fit to be electors in a government of the people? These are serious questions, which must be wisely answered by American voters at the ballot box, or the answers will be blood and revolution.

"Blacklisting is thus seen to be a chief agency in fostering anarchy. It destroys manhood in citizens and makes them slaves. There must be a change. The love of liberty is too deeply rooted in the hearts of Americans long to tolerate this dangerous abuse. It is peculiarly against public policy, because when men cannot find work they become paupers and public charges, if not criminals."
