The Sunday-closing crusade in Paterson, N. J., of which we have before made mention, has received an unexpected set-back in the courts. The judge before whom several cases were brought under the Sunday-closing law, threw them out of court, on the ground that they were not within his jurisdiction. This of course will rouse the crusaders to renewed activity to secure the triumph of Sunday closing, and probably the present set back to the movement will be of only temporary duration. From a press report of the matter we take the following:—

"The Sunday-closing movement in Paterson took a turn yesterday that surprised those working in furtherance of the project. Justice Vandervate decided that he had no jurisdiction to accept complaints for violations of the law requiring the closing of stores on Sunday. Two weeks ago he took a charge against Henry Bosehaus, a butcher. The complaint was made by the Riverside Butchers' and Grocers' Association.

"The defendant did not take the stand and was found guilty. A fine of $1 and costs was imposed. Notice of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas was immediately given. Bosehaus, acting on the advise of his counsel, kept open the following Sunday, and his sons, Harry, jr., and Charles, were again arrested. Both were found guilty and fined, but the second case against Bosehaus, senior, was dismissed for lack of evidence.

"The Justice thought the fines and costs should be paid, and when they were not forthcoming, issued an attachment on Bosehaus's goods. This was served, but no sale was made. The constable backed out, fearing he might go too far.

"The Magistrate announced yesterday that he had decided that he had no authority. He accordingly threw out all the complaints and convictions.

"Antonio Marino, a barber, called upon Mr. Randall yesterday and told him he was induced to plead guilty to opening his place of business and paid a fine of $2, under a threat that if he refused he would be sent to jail. Suit will be brought to recover, and the facts will be laid before the Grand Jury.

The Sunday-closing fight in Paterson has been taken up by the Paterson Grocers' Association, and there is prospect of a lively contest over the question of the validity of the old "blue laws." The World gives this statement of the situation:

"The Paterson Grocers' Association has decided to take up the Sunday-closing fight on behalf of the Riverside Butchers' and Grocers' Association, whose efforts to have fines imposed on Henry Bosehaus for keeping his butcher store open on Sunday failed.

"The grocers have engaged a lawyer and new complaints will be made against Bosehaus if he opens his store for business next Sunday.

"If this is carried out Richard Randall, counsel for Bosehaus, intends to push the blue laws to the limit. He has found that some members of the Grocers' Association were on a pleasure drive last Sunday, others went wheeling and others played ball. These acts are contrary to a strict observance of the old Sunday law. The same law would stop the running of trolley cars and stop the light works.

"Mr. Bosehaus was willing to close his place of business Sundays after the end of this month, but now he declares he will keep open every Sunday."

It should be remembered that the Sunday-closing question is always one of principle rather than of policy.
