MR. F. C. CONYBEARE, an English Protestant, has published a book on "The Dreyfus Case," in which he traces to its source one great cause of the evil which that case represents. "The Dreyfus case has been possible," he says, "because of the general want of backbone and private judgment" among the citizens of France, and he proceeds to account for this lack as follows:—

"This want of initiative and of moral courage is the result of Roman Catholic training, more especially of the confessional, which in Latin countries is so worked by the priests as to extinguish all faculty of private judgment, and even of independent moral criticism. Thousands of Frenchmen emancipate themselves on reaching manhood from the dogmas of their church, but not from the mental and moral habits which its discipline has impressed upon them. French Freemasonry, the religion of the anti-clericals, is in itself a symptom of these habits. Why need a secret society in order to combat the usurpations of the priests? Why not fight them in the open, as we would in England? The French Protestants and the Jews seem to be the only people in France who have a moral courage of their own, and the reason is that they have escaped Catholic methods of training. Indeed, to remain a professing Protestant at all in a country where the dominant religious traditions run the other way, demands considerable strength of character. These considerations explain why the Huguenots have almost to a man come forward from the first to protest against the iniquities of the War Office. To them belong such name as Réville and De Présensé, and, I might almost add, M. Loyson."

MR. CONYBEARE goes on to say that the conspiracy against Dreyfus has not provoked a single protest in "the great and dignified Gallican Church," and that an appeal made by Madame Dreyfus to the pope some time ago "was ignored and treated with contempt," while the entire weight of the Vatican was cast against her. The old Royalist families "have captured the French army," and these families "are entirely swayed by the Jesuits."

We have reached the point where we are discovering that wild-beast ethics are not enough upon which to base a permanent and enduring republic. The ethics of the wild beast—the survival of the strongest, shrewdest and the meanest—have been the inspiration of our materialistic lives during the last quarter of a century.

This has brought us to-day face to face with the inevitable result. We have a nation in which a few are wealthy, a few are in what may be called comfortable circumstances, vast numbers are propertyless and millions are in pauperism and crime.

Certainly no reasonable person will contend that this is the goal that we have been struggling for—that the inequalities that characterize our rich and poor represent the ideas that the founders of this Republic saw when they wrote that "all men are created equal."—Mayor Jones, of Toledo.
