The Rev. Phillips Verner, a Presbyterian minister now in Washington, calls for the legalizing of lynching, on the ground that such a step would lessen crime in the South. This is amazing even in this day of startling theories, and reminds us of the father who commanded his unruly son to do as he liked, in order to maintain obedience. A legalization of lynching would be a legalization of anarchy; it would be government ordering its own dissolution. The theory that "like cures like," whatever may be its value in the practise of medicine, does not hold in maintaining peace and order in society.
