Some appropriate words on the subject of Sabbath reform were read at a recent session of the American Sabbath Tract Society, by Mrs. M. G. Townsend, of Ohio. Mrs. Townsend is treasurer of the Ohio State W. C. T. U., an organization which is actively engaged in "Sabbath reform" work along the mistaken line of compulsory Sunday observance. To this conception of proper Sabbath reform effort the views of this Ohio official of the W. C. T. U. are in refreshing contrast. She said:—

"Christ's commission, under which we are to preach the gospel, involves the teaching of all truth, as it appears in the law of God, and in the life and teachings of Christ. Nothing less than this can give full development to the kingdom of Christ among men. That this may be accomplished, the gospel fits all classes, and meets the needs of all men, high or low. In the present state of things, Sabbath reform is a practical and important part of Christian truth and duty. My own experience, and my careful study of the failing regard for Sunday during the past years, has helped me to appreciate the importance of the Sabbath truth as I could not have done otherwise."

"The most valuable result in personal experience is, that Sabbath-keeping, as a part of Christian duty and gospel truth, brings the people of God close to the heart of Christ. Our times demand a rising up along all lines of Christian duty—such a demand as has not been known before. The individual lives of those who lead in Christian work must exemplify this rising-up, or they can never lift the masses into higher and broader conceptions of truth and duty. As related to public worship and religious culture, Sabbath reform is a vital part of the gospel truth at all times. One who has come to the Sabbath, to the rest and the strength which it brings, is able to aid others, as it is not possible to do without such personal experience.

"I have been so strengthened and blessed in my brief experience as a Sabbath-keeper, that I know whereof I speak. I know that the women of the United States, especially those connected with the Christian Temperance Union, need this higher conception of truth and of loyalty to the Word of God, and I know that many are longing for it. The hearts of the women of the United States furnish favorable soil for Sabbath truth, and while many influences may seem to turn them aside from it, I am sure that no richer field for this reform can be found.

"This question is so important that we cannot expect thoughtful people to break away from all their past teachings and associations, under the behest of this higher truth, in a moment; but no one who is acquainted with the loyal and consecrated women connected with the temperance work in the United States, can doubt the earnestness of their purpose, and their honesty in every endeavor to secure temperance, righteousness, and purity, for all classes. To such hearts, Sabbath truth will not always appeal in vain. Neither must we be disheartened because great numbers are not with us. The power of every great reform is proportionate to its accord with God, and not to the numbers that may join in it at the beginning.

"The work of Sabbath reform, as represented by this society, will not be in vain. Future evangelistic effort should be thoroughly permeated by this truth, as the efforts put forth in the State of Ohio during the past summer have been. Sabbath truth will give strength and richness to evangelism. It brings higher consecration to the evangelist, and enables him to preach a full gospel, enriched by the spirit of love and obedience. As the Sabbath stands in the center of God's divine commands, and as Christ, by repeated teachings and abundant example, taught the larger and better conception of Christian Sabbath-keeping, so Sabbath reform must always be an important part of that true evangelism which leads men to Christ, and to that love of truth which rejoices in full obedience to the law of God, to magnify and honor which Christ gave himself and his life. Evangelism and Sabbath reform are essential parts of the work of uplifting and extending the kingdom of Christ among men."
