The New England Sabbath Protective League, at a meeting held in Boston, September 19, organized a crusade to be carried on in Rhode Island against Sunday games and amusements. A committee is to be sent to the various resorts in that State to note how Sunday is being kept and enforce the law where it is disregarded.
