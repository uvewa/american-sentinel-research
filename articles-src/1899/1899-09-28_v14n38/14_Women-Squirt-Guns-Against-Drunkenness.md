A peculiar method, it is reported, has been chosen by women of Parkersburg, W. Va., for purifying the moral atmosphere in that place. They have armed themselves with half-gallon squirt-guns, with which to throw ice water on every man who appears on the streets intoxicated. Probably the innovation will not be extensively copied elsewhere.
