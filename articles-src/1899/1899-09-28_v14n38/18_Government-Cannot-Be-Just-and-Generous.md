That the civil government cannot be a morally responsible entity, as is a member of the human family, but is bound by limitations that confine it strictly to the domain of simple justice between man and man, is a truth well expressed in the following spoken by the Hon. Bourke Cochran before the Chicago Conference on trusts:—

"Government cannot create anything. If it cannot create anything, it has nothing of its own to bestow. If it undertakes to enrich one individual, the thing that it gives to him it must take from another. A government cannot be just and generous at the same time, for if it be generous to one it must be oppressive to another. If it does a favor it must have a victim. And that government only is just and beneficent which has neither favorites nor victims."
