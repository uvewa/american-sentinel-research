In Dr. H. K. Carroll's summary of religious statistics for 1898 in the *New York Christian Advocate* he shows that in the United States there were in 1890 111,036 ministers, 159,946 churches, and 20,618,307 communicants. In 1898 there were 143,320 ministers, 187,100 churches, and 26,657,969 communicants. In Dr. Carroll's compilation 148 denominations are represented. But he says: "There are only 29 which have 100,000 or more communicants each, while 26 have less than 1,000 each. Not a few are in progress of decay, and will soon disappear."
