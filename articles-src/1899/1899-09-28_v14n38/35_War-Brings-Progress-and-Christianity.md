At a political convention held in Omaha last week, a sentiment expressed by the chairman and approved by the audience was this: "Though war be frightful, through its channels has come the progress of the world. Though the islands in the Far East be red with blood, the result will be civilization where savagery exists; Christianity where paganism abides; progress where festers decay."

Then why not have war everywhere, in order that there may be general progress and that Christianity may supplant heathenism throughout the earth!
