Much attention is now being paid in this country to the discussion of the trusts. At Chicago and elsewhere leading orators have been speaking their minds on the subject to large audiences, and various plans have been proposed for eliminating or controlling this baleful new power in commercial life; so far, however, without arriving at definite results.

Is it possible to subdue the trusts—to overcome the power of these great business combines? It is proposed to overcome them by legislation; but can the people legislate more effectively than the trusts? Legislation must be reached through politics, and the trusts have become pretty well established in politics. Here in New York City, for example, there is a power trust which is purely political. The political trust is one of the oldest and most notorious of trusts. It is composed of the "boss" and his political machine.

The people have the votes, the trusts have the money; which side is best equipped for the contest? At this point we must remember that money can buy votes. And this is a fact which is always turned to big account in a political campaign. Money runs the political "machine," and the political machine has become the dominant power in politics.

Nobody appears to favor the trusts; they have been often fiercely denounced, and in some States legislated against; yet they continue to flourish and multiply without apparent check. Unless they contain the germ of their own destruction, they are likely to continue their rule in the commercial world.
