The expansion policy is but another and immoral expression of the spoils system. It provides a district so far away, that as Secretary Gage said, in substance, of Alaska, it is too remote to be able to apply civil service rules there. It provides new positions for politicians and their retainers. So many more lieutenants, so many more commissions to dangle before the workers on the eve of another election. I object to expansion, because it appeals to the lowest motives of conquest and commercial gain, as against our duty to lib liberty and free government; I object to it because it assumes that our people have no principles as against the base gains of trade and office, and that Americans are really cruel, despotic, and indifferent to a race fighting for liberty.

Some tell us that we can do what we please with the Philippines, because sovereignty over them belongs to us by treaty. So, also, when slavery was permitted to the United States by law, we were able to do what we pleased with the slaves we owned. Right and freedom are above all technical legal enactments, whether national or international; in the progress of mankind laws must conform to right.

We are told that the subjugation of the Filipinos differs in no whit from the reduction of the seceding States in the Civil War, whom we forced to accept a government against their will. There is a great difference. Did the Filipinos ever, through their representatives in a constitutional convention, join in forming our Government, which they afterward voted to accept, as did our States? Did the Filipinos ever create a part of a union by the voluntary consent of the governed, as did Georgia or Virginia?

In plain English we are in the Philippines on the highwayman's plea that "might makes right." If it is wrong to subdue them with 30,000 men, it is quite as wrong to do it with 100,000 men. In 1854 the Ostend manifesto of our ministers (Buchanan, Mason, and Soule) in Europe advised that Cuba be bought; if the price was refused, then take it by force. Whereupon the Republican national platform in 1856 resolved that the highwayman's plea that "might makes right," embodied in the Ostend circular, was in every respect unworthy of American diplomacy, and would bring shame and dishonor upon any government or people that gave it their sanction.

If the war were stopped, because we are in error, would it affect the political prospects of certain persons? Let each one draw his own conclusions as to why the war is continued. If the policy in the Philippines is being settled largely by its influences on the political fortunes of any set of politicians, then they should have no mercy.

If the war were stopped, would it in any way weaken the force of the great principles of Washington and Lincoln? Of course not. We are here to strive for great principles, not for any personal fortune; to protect the free institutions of our beloved country, irrespective of the effect of our words on the future of any politicians, or of any aspirant for office. It is in this spirit we demand "unconditional surrender" to the forces of liberty and justice.
