Events have been dealing harshly with the imperial contentions during the last nine months. It was said that if we did not take the Philippines, Europe would get into war over them. And so to save Europe from such a calamity we got ourselves into war. It was said that we could not give any recognition to or enter into any negotiations with the Filipino leaders to attach them to our interests until the treaty of peace was confirmed. Yet we negotiated with and secured the friendship of the Cuban and Porto Rican revolutionists at the very outset. It was said that if we left the Filipinos to themselves they would be given over to tribal wars. Yet we have found no tribal differences of enough consequence to give us any important native allies. It was said they would become subject to one-man rule instead of maintaining a real republic. Yet we have just confirmed one-man rule in the Sulu islands without establishing even the pretense of a republic. We overlooked, until recently, the fact that we must either ignore the clause of our Constitution which forbids slavery in any territory under the jurisdiction of the United States, or fight a war to abolish it in the distant East Indies. We have found that we must raise an army of 10,000 men to conquer an archipelago, which we foolishly fancied we had won already. And, finally, instead of creating for ourselves new markets, we are beginning to realize that imperialism deprives us of the right to protect our home markets from the cheapest competition in the world.
