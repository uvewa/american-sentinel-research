THE Washington Post is authority for the following, which illustrates a point upon which the late "Colonel" Ingersoll held views undoubtedly correct. One day on the cars, says the Post, Mr. Ingersoll met the Rev. Talmage, and the following dialogue ensued:—

"Then you would like to live in a place, Brother Talmage, where everyone had to be good by law?"

"Certainly," said Talmage.

"You would like to live where everyone had to go to church regularly every Sunday?"

"Yes, that would suit me."

"Where no man could get a drink and swearing was not permitted?"

"Yes, that's the place for me."

"And where every man would keep regular hours?"

"That would be heaven on earth," said Talmage, smiling and striking his knee with his open palm.

"Well," said Bob, looking over his glasses, "you'd better go up to Sing Sing. That's the way they do there."
