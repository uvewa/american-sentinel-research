Ignorance of the real nature of war is no doubt responsible in a large degree for the war sentiment which at certain periods springs up so readily among civilized and intelligent people. At the close of the Civil War, when both North and South knew by five years of terrible experience the truth General Sherman expressed in his pithy remark—"War is hell"—the war sentiment in this country was at a low ebb. It would have required something more than the sentiment of glory and conquest then to have revived the war spirit in the hearts of the people. Some far stronger reason would have been necessary in their minds than that some country needed to be "benevolently assimilated." They had seen enough of war, and thought of it only with feelings of the strongest aversion.

That was more than thirty years ago; and meanwhile a new generation has risen and become dominant in the national life. And while in many things educated beyond the attainments of their fathers, they for the most part remain ignorant of that which it cost their fathers so much to learn—the knowledge that a resort to arms is the worst possible way to adjust differences between individuals or nations.

Along this line of thought the following observations are made by the *Christian Register*, of this city:

"It has been pointed out that since the establishment of our national independence we have become involved in war at intervals of about 30 years; that is to say, about the lifetime of a generation. For a certain period after the close of hostilities, peace is perfectly assured; nothing could then drag the country into war. Gradually, however, the impression of horror and agony and loss fades out of the public mind. Thrilling stories of heroism and adventure remain permanently fixed in the literature of the land, with which children are made familiar in song and story; and thus in a brief term of years the youth of the country have grown to maturity, seeing and knowing almost nothing of the darker side of war. 'The rank and file of an army is necessarily made up of young men, who, when they enter into their first fight, have scarcely the faintest accurate conception what it will be like. In the narratives told by men who pass through the wars this confession is almost invariably made. It is safe to say that no people knowing truly the cost of war and how it looks at close sight, could be dragged into it save as a last and most desperate remedy.'

"While there is much in military discipline that is worthy of the highest praise, yet fighting itself is the most lamentable business to which men can be reduced. To give it its right name, it is murder by wholesale, and dire necessity is its only excuse. He who goes to war is entitled to all the exhilaration he can get from the 'pomp and circumstance' by which it is accompanied, for down in his heart he knows (or soon discovers) that the work cut out for him is no more pleasant to do than that of the butcher or the hangman."

The country has now reached a time when by the working of the forces which involve a nation in war, according to the precedent here pointed out, another conflict is to be expected. What a pity that civilized people should not in time become able to learn the lesson which war teaches, without the necessity of war's fearful object lesson before their eyes.
