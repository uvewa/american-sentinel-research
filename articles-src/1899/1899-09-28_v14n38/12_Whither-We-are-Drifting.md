## FOUR DOLLARS FOR WAR TO ONE FOR CIVIL EXPENSES.

*Washington Letter to "Buffalo Express."*

For the first two months of the new fiscal year our Government has expended $102,969,090.33, of which $21,066,489.81 has gone for the support of the civil and miscellaneous establishment, and all the rest for military expenses of one kind or another. The army got $34,262,080.06; the navy $9,688,245.40; military pensions, $26,055,674.80, and interest on the war debt, $9,153,845.38, a total on the military side of the ledger of $79,159,845.64 or at the rate of $474,959,073.84 a year for war-like outgoes, while the total cost of the civil establishment was at the annual rate of $126,398,938.86.

At the present time not quite eighty per cent. of the expenses of carrying on this peaceful country are on account of wars, past, present and anticipated, but the ratio is nearer to eighty per cent. than to any other round figure. Is there any other country, free or despotic, which spends a larger proportion of its income on war? I do not know, because I have not had the opportunity to look up the statistics, but I should be surprised, indeed, to find that any country of high civilization, or pretending to high civilization, spends four times as much on war and war-like preparation as on all its civil expenses put together. It is difficult to comprehend that, with hardly a realization of it by the people, we are becoming the most warlike of nations, so far, at least, as outlay on military matters goes.

Moreover, the taxes are largely taking on a new form. They are coming home to men's business and bosoms more closely than heretofore. The indirect taxes of the tariff, which have from the beginning of the republic been the mainstay of the federal government, are so no longer. For the first two months of the new fiscal year the receipts from the tariff were $37,518,151.53, while the receipts from the indirect taxes of the internal revenue were $52,559,613.96.
