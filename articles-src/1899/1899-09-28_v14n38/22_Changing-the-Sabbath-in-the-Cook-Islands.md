From information received from Raratonga, an island of the Cook group, it seems that the interesting experiment is to be made by the authorities there, of changing the day observed as the Sabbath in those islands. Up to this time the seventh day of the week has been observed there, this having become fixed under the impression that it was the first day—Sunday. The excuse given for the change now proposed is that it is a commercial necessity. A paper published in the islands, says:

"As Raratonga, or rather the Cook Group, advances there are many old laws that are being found not now applicable, and many customs of the past that have to be put aside to meet the necessities of the present. Among the latter is the observance of Sunday. As every one knows, owing to an error of the early missionaries, no allowance was made for difference of time when coming here; hence we have been keeping Saturday as Sunday. This is proving very confusing, and to vessels annoying and expensive. We prohibit them from working on the proper Sunday, and force them to work on their Sunday. To the Union Steamship Company this is extra expense, apart from delay, as by the Seaman's Union the company are forced to pay additional to their crews when working on Sunday. However, we are glad to hear that this is likely to be altered, as a bill is to be brought before parliament next session to have the correct day kept as Sunday, and we learn that the British Resident here favors this step."

The following additional information is sent us by a friend in Raratonga:

"About a fortnight since, the Arikies, or chiefs of the island, held their council meeting, and prepared their address for parliament. Among other things they propose, is a change of the rest day to Sunday, with heavy penalties for any violations thereof. Parliament will be opened for business next Monday, I hear. It remains to be seen what they will do."
