Clergymen who see things as they are, and are not afraid to state them as they see them, are not any too common these days, but one such is the Rev. Dr. Mackennal, an Englishman, who said before the International Congregational Council in Boston: "There will be no end to the liability of war until nations are Christian in the sense that men and women are so; and in this sense there is not and never has been a Christian nation."
