It is not surprising that the representatives of the labor unions were very shy of attacking trusts at the recent Chicago Conference, as reported thus by a correspondent of the *Evening Post*:—

"The organized labor people criticised the legislation adopted in restraint of Trusts, which, they said, had been applied to labor organization by the courts. They claimed that there was a vital difference between a combination of labor and one of capital, in that the labor combination was inclusive and invited all men belonging to the craft to join it, whereas the capitalistic corporation was essentially a monopoly, excluding all except its members from its benefits."

Actually the exclusion of "all except its members from its benefits" is the first principle of the labor union "trust" itself. Not only are they excluded from its benefits, but its whole power is extended positively to injure them. They are treated as "scabs" and the union uses every means within its power to prevent their obtaining employment. Members of the union refuse to work with them, resort to a strike if they are introduced into a business, and seek to ruin the business by deserting it at a critical moment and by introducing a boycott of it. The unions say practically to workmen: "Unless you join our trusts we will do everything possible to prevent your working at all and reduce you to starvation." They undertake to hound every workman who is not in the union, to subject him to social ostracism, and to terrorize employers so that they shall not dare to employ such a workman.

Of course the union "invites all men belonging to the craft to enter it," for it seeks to build up a labor monopoly, but the penalties for refusal to accept the invitation are the unrelenting hostility of the union. They do not respect the liberty of choice of a workman, but deny to him entirely the exercise of freedom by subjecting him to duress. "You are free to come into the union," they say, "but if you stay out you do so at your peril and at the peril of any one who employs you."
