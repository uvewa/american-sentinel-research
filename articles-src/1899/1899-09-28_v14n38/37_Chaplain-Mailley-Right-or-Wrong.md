The chaplain of a Nebraska regiment, Rev. Mr. Mailley, said recently in a speech before a political convention that, while he was for the right in time of peace, "after the old flag has been fired upon by an enemy whom we are trying to save and civilize, then I am for the Administration, right or wrong."

And that is about what army chaplains are for, all the time.
