REGARDING the alleged desecration to Catholic churches in the Philippines, as evidenced by photographs showing American soldiers inside such churches, the *Catholic Western Watchman* drops the sensible remark that "if the only desecration those churches receive is sheltering our poor soldiers from the killing Philippine sun, a very few drops of holy water will reconcile them."
