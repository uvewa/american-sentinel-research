A PROMINENT New England journal, noting that there are "evidences of uneasiness in Latin America because of the 'forward policy' of the United States, and that in view of this feeling in Latin America there is much "fidgeting" in official or semi-official circles in the United States, says:—

"The most solemn assurances to Central and South America are being uttered. It is 'very far from the truth,' say the imperialistic editors, that the great republic has aggressive designs. 'We do not covet territory;' no, indeed. Meanwhile, the whole of Latin America has been listening to the argument of our imperialists in favor of 'expansion.' Now, if the argument for 'expansion' holds good in Asia, it must be tenfold stronger when applied in our own hemisphere, as the imperialist editors and orators cannot withdraw all their fine reasoning about the vital national necessity for constant territorial growth and new 'responsibilities.'

"Latin America will very likely put two and two together—that is, the expansion argument and McKinley's deeds—and form its own conclusions. That this is being done needs no further proof. Attention, however, should be called to the following extract from the personal newspaper organ of the president of Brazil, which is taken from an editorial article on 'South American Alliances':—

"'Either we must suffer the effect of the ambitions of American expansion, or we must turn to Europe and beg aid against them. As a rule, we are not optimists, but in the present case we do not feel ourselves in the least embarrassed by the above dilemma. Without denying that the United States will attempt, with all the energy and tenacity peculiar to them, to assume in America, not alone the hegemony which they undoubtedly already possess and no one denies, but also political and commercial predominance, we firmly believe that in order to thwart them in such designs it is sufficient for the American nations to have a reasonable sentiment of their own rights and independence, and for their statesmen to be able to give expression in a systematic way to such a feeling.'

"What was the occasion of that article?—Advices from Europe, received in Brazil, that Germany, France, Italy and Austria would welcome and morally support a South American alliance against the United States."
