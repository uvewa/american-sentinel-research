THE mayor and bishop of Havana have protested against an order of the Cuban Secretary of Finance, directing that all title deeds of real property must be submitted for inspection by the central authorities. The protest represents the voice of the Catholic church, which, naturally enough, wants to retain all property now claimed by her in the island. But it is a confession that her claim will not in all cases bear investigation. A Cuban paper, *Lucha*, says:—

"Investigations that are now in progress seem to show millions of dollars worth of property which ought to revert to the State. In many cases the convents and other religious institutions to which the property was originally given no longer exist, and the income is being collected by the Church instead of reverting to the State, as it should have done. In one instance the ecclesiastical-authorities have burned their books in order to avoid investigation."
