While it is claimed by many in the United States that "this is a Christian nation," the heathen Japanese are not slow to see that the Christianity of this nation is merely a nominal one, and that true Christian precepts are not exemplified by civil governments anywhere on the earth. A Tokio paper, the *Tetsugaku Zasshi*, says:

"Neither in Europe nor in America is the religion of Christ faithfully followed by any government. No amount of twisting of the meaning of texts would suffice to prove that the American worship of the almighty dollar, or that the seizure of territory practised by Europeans, is Christian. It amounts to this, then, that in the West the Christian religion is followed when it does not come into conflict with state interests, but no further. When Christ's commands and the exigencies of modern politics are in direct opposition to each other the former hive to give way. With Christianity in Japan the same rule will doubtless be followed."
