Liberty is the gift of God; and is dealt to every man according to the measure of faith. Our Saviour's words are, "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." "Also, Ye shall know she truth, and the truth shall make you free." There must be a primary cause for all things, and sin must be the first cause for the absence of liberty.

Satan had the liberty of the universe until he sinned, and then his warfare was confined to the narrow limits of this fallen sphere.

It is not in Christ to force upon his creatures a single desire of his will: He knows no law but love, and can exact no service from his subjects. He grants to all created intelligences the fullest freedom to follow the way of their choice, and permits them always to decide their own destiny. He took upon himself, in the midst of humanity, the life of his choice, and consented to stand with the despised minority, and to suffer with them the raging intolerance of the majority of his own creation. On the tempest-rent waves of Galilee, or amid the jangling tumult of the Pharisees, his life was filled with fragrance of the sweet liberty that the world cannot give or take away; and as he fainted upon the cross, he still was free to tread the winepress of his choice; and when he rested in the sealed and guarded sepulcher, his immortal words were left behind, "I have power to lay down my life, and power to take it up again." And from this we learn, that from the time the angels sang "Peace on earth, good will to men, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord," until they sang again, "Lift up your heads, O ye gates,—that the King of glory may come in," he was free from the power of sin and men, and had liberty to follow the pathway of his choice.

His own announcement of his ministry, was, "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound"; and in all the ages this same gospel has found men in exile and prison who believed the glad tidings of freedom, and rejoiced in liberty that reached beyond prison bars or exile homes.

Earthly laws and decrees cannot affect the liberty of the child of faith; for he has learned in whatever state he is, to be therein content. And the peace that he has, the earth cannot give neither can it take away.

Behind bolted and barred doors Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, while others stood guard; yet this Son of Faith enjoyed such liberty that he slept the sweet innocent sleep of the just, and when it pleased the Lord to lead him forth, bolts and bars and even armed soldiers did not hinder the work of the heavenly messenger. "For where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty;" and no human power can keep that Spirit from us, no civil court can legislate away our right to enjoy his freedom. Therefore wherever we are, be it in jail, in exile, or in the chaingang, the Lord says we are to "Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free;" but we may know that as the truth shines brighter, the plotting against it will grow more dark, and greater efforts will be made to throw shadows over the liberty we hold so dear. But the word of the Lord is, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." We may not hope to avert the mighty tide of intolerance that is now sweeping through the land; we may not hope even to check it to any great extent; but we can know that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, and with a life that knows no fear, because of love, send clear steady streams of liberty upon a foe who knows no power but hate, and no friend but self.

Honesty of opinion will never justify the evil of an unrighteous cause. The combined organization of apostate churches will lead astray and ruin the governments of earth, but it cannot stand before the thunderbolts of God's eternal truth; and while nations are seduced by the harlotry of power-thirsting churches, and rapine, ruin, and murder, sweep in swelling tides throughout the land, the sons of God will rest behind the bulwarks of his truth, and listen for the voice which says, "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul."

The closing record of this world's history is pitiful to contemplate. Satan's six thousand years of plotting and planning is to culminate in crushing together as mighty millstones the men and nations of earth in a bitter struggle, and as ghastly trophies of her insatiable greed, throw them in ruin at the feet of the Christ for-saken churches, who will be held largely responsible for the darkness in which they wandered to their fate.

We as Christians may expect opposition; we may look for persecution in any form; but we should gird ourselves to love the liberty of truth more than our life, and be prepared to stand the test of faith when cruel power shall try to usurp the prerogatives of God.

Our battle is not against the state, our work is not to upbraid it for its wrong course. The "beast" and its "image" are God's implacable foes, and against these must the world be warned. The state will only become a persecuting power when forced to be such by the woman who sits upon the scarlet colored beast, and who is the mother of harlots, and the abomination of the earth. Therefore the message for today is, "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies." This message swelling from the heart of every child of God will hasten the inhabitants of the earth to take their final stand, and will speedily bring the time when the exiled children of the lord can sing with a new meaning, "Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth."

Goldfield, Col.
