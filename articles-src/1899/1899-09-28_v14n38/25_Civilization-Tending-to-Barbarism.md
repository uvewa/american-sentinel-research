That civilization—so-called—is to-day represented by an armed camp, by nations actively preparing for war and filled with the war spirit, is a fact too evident to be denied. That war is barbarous and tends always to barbarism, is equally a fact, whether equally evident or not. And therefore it is also true that civilization is not, as so generally understood, the opposite of barbarism; that carried to a certain extent, it is productive of harm rather than good. The truth of the matter is pointed out in the following from the *Springfield Republican*:—

"We appear to be suffering from what Prof. Goldwin Smith has described as a satiety of civilization.

"On both sides of the Anglo-Saxon world there is a manifested eagerness to go to war, regardless of causes or purposes or ends. No call to national self-defense or to rescue an oppressed people comes to England at the moment, but only one to champion a mighty and overbearing power in a contest to divest a weak state of its independence. And yet over this miserable cause there arises excessive patriotic emotion and a rush about the British home recruiting stations to get into the ranks of the army destined for South Africa. A battalion of troops was started from London for Natal Saturday amid scenes of the greatest enthusiasm, the crowds wildly cheering and the soldiers expressing the strongest eagerness to get at the foe—any foe would do. It is only 'some among us,' writes Herbert Spencer, who 'think that national honor is not being enhanced by putting down the weak.'

"Here in the other half of the Anglo-Saxon world enlistments proceed easily for the great army of distant conquest and subjugation. Within two months 15,000 men have been raised for this purpose, and another body of 15,000 men is being recruited at the rate of from 400 to 500 a day, under the severest physical requirements. And here, as in England, there is no deep industrial depression and idleness and want and enforced unemployment to drive men into the army for a livelihood, but, on the contrary, a notable industrial revival. And here, as in England, only 'some among us' apparently think that the national honor is not being enhanced by putting down the weak.

"The ultimate tendency of civilization, wrote a pessimistic philosopher many years ago, is toward barbarism. We seem, indeed, to have fallen upon a time when men have become surfeited with the peace and order and security attained by civilized progress, when its restraints bear heavily upon the natural man, when for one social class the apparently settled inequalities of fortune call loudly for a new 'deal,' and for the other social class a demonstration in force to fasten the fetters all the tighter, and when in consequence there is a temporary reversion toward the original state of society. But meantime may it not well be asked whether the civilization we have been fostering has been rooting up or smothering the chivalrous instincts of men? How otherwise account for the enthusiasm of the strong and powerful in the crushing of the unoffending poor and weak?"

And this only points to the world's need of Christianity as the one uplifting power in the world, the true opposite of barbarism and the one thing which can put down the fighting tendency in the human heart.
