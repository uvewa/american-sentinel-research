A PROMINENT religious journal of this city, *Christian Work*, calls attention to a "notable phase of the Sunday labor question" which illustrates the difficulty of dealing with the question by law. So long as people will work on the "Sabbath" unless they are actually prohibited from it by law—so long as they will not observe the day from obedience to the dictates of conscience—the problem of securing the desired observance of the day will remain unsolved. And so far as Sunday is concerned, it cannot be hoped that people will be restrained from work by conscience, because an enlightened conscience points to the seventh day, and not Sunday, as the true Sabbath. The *Christian Work* says:—

"One notable phase of the Sunday labor question, upon which as relating to Massachusetts we comment in other columns, is to be found in the fact that the very reluctance to Sunday labor, and resistance to work on that day, produces the directly opposite effect in promoting Sunday labor in other directions. Thus the action of the working people in resisting Sunday labor is natural and commendable, as it enables them to use the day for visiting neighboring pleasure resorts or making excursions by rail or water. This creates a demand for the service of car conductors and motormen, steamboat hands, waiters, bartenders, and a great variety of employees.

"Again, rapid increase in the population of larger cities—and this is especially true of this City of New York—has brought about a sharp change in social conditions, customs and habits. It has brought in the tenement and the flat with their slender accommodations, and made it necessary that grocery stores, milk depots, butcher shops, bakeries, and other places be kept open for at least a few hours on Sunday in order that tenants may obtain fresh supplies of food. It has caused an increasing number of persons to live in hotels and boarding houses, thus adding to the need for servants, cooks, waiters, steam engineers, and similar employees on the first day of the week.

"Sunday newspapers are now printed in all cities of any importance, and this has added an army of newsboys and newsdealers to the list of Sunday workers. Indeed, not a little of the increase in Sunday employment is due to church-goers, for in the larger cities churches are often situated at such a distance that persons are compelled to use a street car or a cab to reach them.

"All this is occasion for profound regret: especially is it so as relating to those whose circumstances place them above the necessity for seeking recreation on the Sabbath, and who class themselves as church-goers, yet with whom church-going has become the minimum quantity and recreation the maximum.

"One phase of the matter not to be omitted here is the superfluous carriage attendance at the churches. In many instances the distance covered by the carriages does not exceed three blocks: yet my lady must have her carriage out—the driver and the groom must be on hand, and she must roll up to church in state in order to confess that she has 'erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep,'—a comparison which is rather hard on the sheep, for they know no better. We add in this relation that on one occasion a well-known fashionable lady of this city, having to leave her church on 'the avenue' early one Sunday morning because of illness, was surprised and indignant, as she opened the church door, to hear the drivers in attendance exchanging ribaldry and indulging in profanity. So grieved was she that from that moment she discontinued the use of her carriage, and even took a pew in a nearer church that she might give effect to her resolution."

Conscience alone can settle the question of Sabbath rest, and to conscience it must be left by the State. Conscience is the one restraining power that can exert its influence in the heart, and thus control the life. But it can control only the one being in whom it resides.
