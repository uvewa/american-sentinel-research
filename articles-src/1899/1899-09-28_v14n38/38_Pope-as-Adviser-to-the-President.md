Now that the pope has become the confidential adviser of the President regarding affairs in the Philippines, Cuba, etc., not indeed as a member of the Cabinet or through an accredited ambassador to the Government, but as a "distinguished foreigner," the question may be asked how much advice this "distinguished foreigner" has to give in the matter. When will he be through giving his advice? Will he ever be through? If we know anything about papal principles and precedents, this question is decidedly pertinent.
