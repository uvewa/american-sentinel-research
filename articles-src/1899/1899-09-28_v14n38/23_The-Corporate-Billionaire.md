Millionaires are an old story—for some time the question has been when the billionaire would come.

The billionaire is here—not yet as a single individual, although it will soon come to that, but as a capitalistic combination.

The Vanderbilt-Rockefeller alliance, proclaimed by the entrance of William Rockefeller into the directorate of the New York Central, means the amalgamation of a thousand million dollars of capital into one mass, to be wielded as the minds that control it determine. The Crocker have been regarded on the Pacific Coast as financial powers of the first order, but the purchase of the entire Crocker interests in the Central and Southern Pacific Railroads is reported as a mere minor incident of the gigantic plans of the Cæsars who dominate the overshadowing Eastern Railroad Trust.

The Vanderbilt railroads extend at present from Massachusetts to the Dakotas, and from Canada to Virginia. They include over 26,000 miles of road—more than one-eighth of the total mileage of the United States. If the Southern Pacific system is added, the Vanderbilt-Rockefeller roads will reach every frontier of the Union, North, South, East and West, and will comprise over 33,000 miles of road, or between one-fifth and one-sixth of the entire American mileage.

No country in the world outside of the United States has as many miles of railroads as these few men will control then. Germany, which has more than any other country, had 29,422 miles at last accounts. France, which comes next, had 25,585. Russia, the third, had 24,012. Great Britain, the fourth, had 21,265. The Vanderbilts alone control more than any European country except Germany now, and if they get the Southern Pacific system they will control more than any country beyond the borders of the United States, without exception.

But that is only part of the story. The Rockefellers will not come into the combination empty-handed. They are already interested in many railroads outside of the Vanderbilt system. They do not operate with megaphones, but when they are ready to show their hands it will not be surprising if they raise the total mileage ruled by the syndicate to *FIFTY THOUSAND*.

If this were merely the monopolization of over a quarter of the transportation business of the country it would be portentous enough. But it is more than that. The Rockefellers are in every sort of industry, and their possession of the routes of commerce will give them an advantage over all competitors that will be simply crushing. What chance will a poor beggar with five or ten million dollars invested in iron mines or oil refineries have against rivals that can send their iron ore and their oil to market by the hundred trainloads over their own railroads?

Crush the trusts? Yes, but it can't be done when there are no more common carriers and the trusts turn the national railroad system into a guaranty of their monopoly.
