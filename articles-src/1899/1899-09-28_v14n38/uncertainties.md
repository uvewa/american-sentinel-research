# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, 1899-09-28 (v14n38)

## Article 04: "The Origin of Selfishness" (ATJ)

- **Location:** Paragraph 4, sentence about commandments
- **Issue:** OCR produced "beeng" instead of "being" — "These commandments beeng fulfilled"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — this is clearly an OCR error; the word should be "being"
- **Transcribed as:** "beeng" (preserved as it appears in OCR source; original may read "being")
- **Confidence:** HIGH that original reads "being"; LOW confidence the OCR is faithful to the original here
- **Reason:** Likely OCR misread of "being" — preserved faithfully from OCR but flagged for verification against original scan

## Article 29: "Professor Laughlin on 'Expansion.'"

- **Location:** First paragraph
- **Issue:** OCR produced "lib liberty" — "our duty to lib liberty and free government"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — appears to be an OCR duplication/error; original likely reads "our duty to liberty and free government"
- **Transcribed as:** "lib liberty" (preserved as it appears in OCR source)
- **Confidence:** HIGH that original reads "liberty" without "lib"; OCR artifact
- **Reason:** Probable OCR error splitting or duplicating word; flagged for verification against original scan

## Article 27: "Catholic Training Destructive of Manhood"

- **Location:** Block quote from Mayor Jones, Toledo
- **Issue:** The closing paragraph (beginning "We have reached the point...") through to the Mayor Jones attribution is somewhat unclear in context — it appears to be a separate quotation from Mayor Jones appended to the Conybeare discussion, not part of the original Conybeare text.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Included in the same article file, with the Mayor Jones attribution closing the piece
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the transition between the Conybeare discussion and the Mayor Jones quotation is abrupt; the Mayor Jones material may be a separate editorial note
- **Reason:** The OCR source does not use a clear separator between the two; treated as one article because they appear on the same page without a section break in the OCR
