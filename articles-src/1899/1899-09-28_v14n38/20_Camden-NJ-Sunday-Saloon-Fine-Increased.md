HEREAFTER any saloonkeeper in Camden, N. J., convicted of Sunday selling must pay a fine of $100 instead of $50 as heretofore. This was decided on by the excise board when a new excise ordinance was passed to second reading to take the place of the ordinance recently declared illegal by the Supreme Court.
