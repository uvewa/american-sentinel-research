*(Copyright, 1899.)*

*Lines suggested by results attending Sunday-law legislation—the outgrowth of malice and intolerance.*

A ruthless monster, fierce and strong—
Denying right; upholding wrong:

To quiet Censure, it doth draw
Beneath the guise of righteous(?) law.

Erst, ruling with an iron rod,
It crucified the Son of God.

Dictating unto kings, it still
Compels submission to its will;

And, eager now, as eager then,
To crush the liberty of men,
It fain would hamper more and more,
Free speech and worship, as of yore.

San Francisco, Cal. Fred Paddie Hanchett.
