Sunday observance is not very rigidly enforced in this city under Tammany rule, but it seems that the Sunday theater is not yet to be tolerated. A press paragraph of recent date says:—

"In the case of Maurice Kraus, the reputed proprietor of the Dewey theater, on Fourteenth street, near Third avenue, and his father, the general manager, both were held in $300 bail by Magistrate Meade, in the Yorkville Court yesterday, on the charge of violating the laws by giving a performance on Sunday.

"The men were arraigned three weeks ago on the complaint of William S. Hubbell, of the New York Sabbath Committee, and a number of hearings given. Magistrate Meade then reserved his decision until yesterday."
