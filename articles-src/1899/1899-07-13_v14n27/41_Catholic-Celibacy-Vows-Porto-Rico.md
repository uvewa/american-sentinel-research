ROMAN CATHOLIC authorities in the United States have been greatly scandalized and shocked by a recommendation made in the report of the Insular Commission appointed by the Government to investigate affairs and conditions in Porto Rico. The recommendation is "That priests and others who have taken the vow of celibacy may be permitted to renounce said vows and enter into marriage relations, the same as other people." This, says a report from Washington, D.C., "is regarded by the highest [Catholic] ecclesiastical dignitary here as 'a gratuitous insult' to the Catholic Church throughout the world."

It would be interesting to know the reasons back of this recommendation. Doubtless there is in those reasons that at which the Catholic dignitaries ought to be scandalized and shocked, whether they are or not.
