The Missionary Review prints a note on the "anti-Protestant efforts of the Roman Catholics" in the island of Madagascar, in which it states that the French government "has forbidden the English missionaries not merely to sell medicines, but even to bring medicines for themselves from England. As a result a great many remedies which they used to furnish at a moderate cost have gone up in price, so that it is impossible for the common people to secure them. In view of this the French society is making an effort to establish a medical mission to meet this new phase of the work. In another respect the situation is difficult. The French law requires military service, and the governors of the villages are relied upon to give the ages of the people who are liable. These are all Roman Catholics, and are very apt to discriminate very heavily in favor of their own people, giving their ages as outside of the limit, while they put down the Protestants as within the limit. So eager have they been in some instances as to create a very curious situation. In one instance they reported both a man and his son as of the same age—just twenty-one."

The French government maintains a union of church and state, and such instances as these described are only ordinary samples of its fruits.
