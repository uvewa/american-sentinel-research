The Roman Catholic church has declared herself favorable to American imperialism and an alliance of America with Great Britain to secure Anglo-Saxon supremacy in Asia. This is the accepted import of a speech made at the Independence Day banquet of Americans in London, by Cardinal Vaughan, the papal primate in England.

The New York Sun hails the event as a great gain for imperialism, and under the heading, "Rome with Us in the East," prints the following:

"LONDON, July 4.—A declaration of immense importance concerning the fate of the Philippines and all Asia was made to night by Cardinal Vaughan, Archbishop of Westminster, at the Independence Day banquet given by the American Society in London. There is good authority for saying that his utterance is an authorized announcement of the policy of the Roman Catholic church on the Far Eastern question. When it is said that he astonished and electrified his audience by his eloquent appeal to America and England, in cooperation, to carry civilization into Asia in opposition to Russia, it may easily be imagined what a sensation his words created.

"Nor was his the only imperialistic speech of the evening. It was the keynote of every word spoken, and the spirit of imperialism aroused an enthusiasm surpassing anything witnessed at former gatherings of Americans in London. The banquet was attended by the largest and most representative assembly of Americans ever held in Europe. It was nearly midnight when Cardinal Vaughan spoke, but the tremendous significance of his words entitles them to be the first quoted. He said:

"'I have in my heart the deep-seated and mature conviction that the welfare of the Christian world, especially those portions which have not yet been brought into the pale of civilization, depends in a great measure on the good feeling and cooperation that shall exist between the American and English peoples. [Cries of "Hear!" "Hear!"] We are living at the end of one century and are about to enter another. Some men may glory in looking backward, and they will have much to learn in retrospect. Others look forward. Their minds are cast toward the future, leaving behind the things they have accomplished, and they press forward. While we are on the eve of a new century the English-speaking peoples look forward to see in what direction their mission will be accomplished. It seems to me from the evidence of past years, and from the manifestation of friendly feeling expressed at this table by your ambassador and senators who have spoken, that we are preparing the American and English peoples for the great work before us in the century to come.

"'You no longer, if I may speak to my American cousins, you no longer are a self-contained power. You have come forth from your continent, forced by the acquisition of lands abroad. You stand with your foot on the threshold of the vast continent of Asia. You have entered into the comity of nations that has declared itself in many ways interested in the welfare and future of the Asiatic continent. You will never be able to withdraw [Cries of "Hear!" "Hear!"] the influence you have, and it will be greater in the future than ever it was in the past. It must make itself felt on the tremendous population of Asia, which is waiting for the advent of true Christian civilization. [*Italics ours.*]

"'The question that presents itself constantly to my mind—I do not know how it will strike your minds—is this: Which power in the future of the world shall be predominant over the great continents yet unreclaimed by Christian civilization? Shall it be the great despotic power that looms north of Asia, or shall it be the power of the liberty-loving nations represented by the English-speaking peoples? [Cries of "Hear!" "Hear!"] It is a question of which of the two extremes in modes of government shall prevail. There can be no doubt in this hall to which the preference should be given. If then the liberty-loving peoples bring happiness, civilization, and all the benefits of Christianity to the largest majority of the human race yet uncivilized, it can only be, it seems to me, through a good understanding being established between the two great branches of the English speaking people. [Cries of "Hear!" "Hear!"]

"'I am not speaking of commercial interests. I am not speaking of the wealth of England or America. I am speaking on the point alone of your influence and our influence abroad. I pray that the sentiments expressed so eloquently by many speakers to-night, sentiments which animate the English heart as deeply as the American, may continue to be woven one with the other, so that the missions of the English speaking races may be carried on successfully in the new century, and that the century may see the completion in a great measure of our common mission.' [Cheers.]"

Rome, ever since the days of the Roman republic, has represented imperialism; Hence it is not strange that she favors imperialism to-day. The papacy presents a system of government as far removed from republicanism as anything that could be devised. Rome denies that any person has a right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. This is as complete a denial of the doctrine of human rights, set forth in the Declaration of Independence, as could well be made. If individual rights have no existence in the sacred domain of religion, they have no existence at all. If an individual is under obligation to obey some other man in religious matters, he is by the same token bound to obey the same authority in matters temporal.

Recently the pope said of England that "England's return to Roman Catholicism is daily becoming more certain"; and of the United States he said, also recently, that it is marching into the Catholic church with rapid strides. Hence Cardinal Vaughan can very consistently favor British and American supremacy in Asia; for Russia, of course, is not under the influence of the papacy as are England and the United States. Rome hopes that these two countries will become supreme in the far East, and by that time she hopes to be supreme in them.
