The Chicago Times-Herald says in a dispatch dated at Washington, June 25, speaking of the policy to be pursued in the Philippines:—

"It must be remembered that besides the island of Luzon, there are hundreds of other islands in the archipelago, in which this Government will have to restore peace and order."

"Restore peace and order," by invading peaceful communities and making the people fight, as they are doing in the island of Luzon! A New York paper not biased by imperial sentiment, well says:—

"The censored dispatches from Manila and the orators of the Administration agree that peace prevails and order reigns in all of the Philippine Islands except the three or four where our troops have carried Mr. McKinley's proclamation demanding the unconditional submission of the natives and their recognition of our 'sovereignty.'

"There is, accordingly, none of the 'anarchy' or 'throat-cutting' which the upholders of conquest maintain would instantly follow should our troops be withdrawn. This is in line with the whole history of these islands. The tribes have seldom warred among themselves. Their fighting has been against Spanish rule, as it is now against our attempt to take Spain's place."

Surely, it must be very necessary for the American forces armed with their "benevolent assimilators," to invade the remaining islands of the Philippine group in the interests of peace and order!
