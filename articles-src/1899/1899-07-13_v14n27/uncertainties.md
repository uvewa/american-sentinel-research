## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 04 — "The True Peace Conference" (EJW)

- **Location:** Body text, first paragraph
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "and shall sit and rule upoth his throne" — "upoth" appears to be an OCR error for "upon"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "upoth" (preserved as-is per original OCR; likely OCR artifact for "upon")
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "upon" but preserving OCR reading pending verification against original
- **Note:** The original article likely reads "upon his throne" but without access to the original image this cannot be confirmed

### Article 07 — "Liberty—for the White Man"

- **Location:** Near end of article
- **Issue:** The OCR has "PATRIOTISM does not mean Patriotism." as a standalone line — this appears to be a short aphorism that may be an editorial insertion or part of the Buffalo Courier reprint
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Included within the reprint body
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — context suggests it is part of the reprinted material

### Article 08 — "Paganism and Sunday"

- **Location:** Page 6-7 boundary
- **Issue:** OCR reads "they resolved" with the next word cut at page break — text reads "they resolved" then continues on next page with "to adopt them." The word "su-festivals" appears in the OCR as a hyphenated break (likely "sun-festivals" or "such festivals")
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "su-festivals" preserved; break joined as continuous paragraph
- **Confidence:** LOW for "su-festivals" — likely OCR artifact for "sun-festivals" but cannot confirm without original image

### Article 28 — "The Golden Rule the Solution"

- **Location:** Body text, first paragraph of Markham quotation
- **Issue:** OCR reads "I have 'but one solution" with an apostrophe before "but" — this appears to be a typographic artifact
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "I have but one solution" (apostrophe removed as evident artifact)
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 8 editorial notes — ordering

- The short items on page 8 appear in a certain order in the OCR but some items bleed across columns. Order of items 11-21 preserved as they appear in the OCR flow.

### Attribution of "The Golden Rule the Solution"

- The article text begins with MR. EDWIN MARKHAM's speech but also contains editorial commentary. The editorial commentary at the end ("But all these principles must be applied...") is added by the Sentinel editor. Attribution is listed as "reprint" from Signs of the Times since that source is cited, and the editorial commentary is minimal.

### R. S. Owen — author initials

- R. S. Owen is an author not in the known authors list. Article ends "Hatley, Miss. R. S. Owen." — this is clearly a letter contributor, not a staff member. Used initials RSO for filing.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — explicit signature at end of article

### Fred Paddie Hanchett — author initials

- Fred Paddie Hanchett signed the poem with location "San Francisco, Cal." Used initials FPH.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — explicit signature

### "Public Opinion" poem footnote

- The footnote "*Lines suggested by results attending Sunday-law legislation—the outgrowth of malice and intolerance." appears at the bottom of a different page (page 11) in the OCR, suggesting it is the footnote for the poem whose asterisk (*) appears in the article title "Public Opinion.*" This association has been preserved in the article file.
