An "Anti-peace Congress" has been sitting in Amsterdam with the object apparently of offsetting the purpose and influence of the Peace Congress. In a speech at this opposition gathering the following noteworthy statements were made by a brother of the late President Faure, of France:

"Before we talk of international arbitration or peace, the ideals of Christianity must be realized upon earth. The present state of things is an affront to Christendom. While honeyed words of peace are wafted from The Hague, the thundering orders to increase armies and navies in Russia, Germany, England, and even America are sent forth to the various legislatures. The very men who are crying peace in The Hague are even now meditating new war plans in their hearts. Kaiser Wilhelm is the biggest hypocrite of all. While hobnobing with the czar he astounds his own people with gigantic war preparations. The Jews are still persecuted in Russia. The book of Bertha von Suttner and the common sense pamphlet of Baron von Stengel are alike shut out from Russia. Even America, while talking arbitration and disarmament, is carrying on a war with imperialistic intentions. I reiterate, let us aim first to change national and international social conditions and then let us talk of peace."
