An exchange prints the following:—

"One of the meanest revenges ever wreaked by bigotry upon a victim of its spite has been incurred by Rudolph A. Lee, a student in the University at Minneapolis, Minn.

"Mr. Lee is manager of the University baseball team and president of the graduating class. He is the son of ex-speaker W. E. Lee, of Long Prairie, and finished his course of study with credit to himself and teachers; but as he had the 'indiscretion' to arrange for a ball game between his team and another on Sunday, the faculty has suspended him and he must wait a year for graduation and the degree he has earned. Not less despicable is the action of the faculty in the case of young Rydeen, captain of the ball team, whose suspension is indefinite and may make it impossible for him to finish his course.

"Like the trustees of the Drake University at Des Moines, who 'took the Bible end' of a discussion about Professor Morgan, these trustees probably expect to escape criticism by taking the Sunday end of the case against the students. A Sunday game of ball, or a prize fight for that matter, would reflect glory upon its participants as compared with the act of these Minnesota pedagogues."

This exchange is against Christianity, and it is just such examples of bigotry and inconsistency as this on the part of professed Christians that furnish it with material to make its attacks upon the Christian religion. The enforcement of Sunday never made any Christians, but it has contributed powerfully to make infidels.
