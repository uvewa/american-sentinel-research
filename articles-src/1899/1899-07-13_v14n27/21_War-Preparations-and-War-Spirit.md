THE London Daily Mail recently printed a description of the war strength of the Boers, referring particularly to their superiority over British South Africa in the possession of artillery, and making the statement that "No cause is more responsible for the insane war spirit that has lately come to a head among the young Boers than the knowledge that they possess this powerful artillery force."

This is a significant statement, and calls out this comment from an English exchange:—

"Most naturally, yet people insist that the great war preparations by the Powers of Europe is the best guarantee of peace. But it does not work that way. Put a pistol into the hands of a boy, and he cannot be content without firing it off. Train a man as a pugilist, and he cannot rest without challenging somebody to a test of skill and strength. So when weapons of war are accumulated, and men are trained in their use, and the army is exalted as affording the most honorable career for a young man, a desire for war is inevitable."
