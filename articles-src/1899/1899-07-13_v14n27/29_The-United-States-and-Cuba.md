SPAIN is out of Cuba, but Cuba is not yet free. The government of Cuba is not self-government; it is a military government, than which nothing further from self-government could ever be. The United States went into the island to proclaim freedom to the Cubans, and as yet the latter are inquiring, Where is our liberty?

Will Cuba ever be free? Will the strong hand of American rule ever be relaxed from the island? This is a question, and an important one; and while the full answer remains to be given by the future, there are to be seen facts which suggest what that answer is likely to be.

The North American Review for July prints an article in which some of these facts are set forth. The article is by a high officer of the United States army of occupation, and makes what are regarded as some "startling statements" about the occupation as regards its bearing on Cuban affairs and prospects. His aim is to urge an immediate evacuation of Cuba by the American forces, in order to secure annexation of Cuba without violating the pledge given the Cuban people and all the world; that is, by the consent of the Cuban people. The longer the occupation is maintained, he says, the greater is the irritation stirred up in the Cuban mind, and this sooner or later will lead to open revolt.

The following quotations are from his statement of the conditions resulting from American intervention thus far:—

"There can be no doubt that the 'pacification' of the island is now accomplished. City for city, the towns of Cuba are more peaceful and orderly than those of the United States. There never was a more docile, quiet people. All the reports of 'bandits' are zealously forwarded to the United States, and half of them are lies."

"In addition, as a result of our military occupation, capital finds the islands in a state of transition, the laws in a state of uncertainty. The ordinary opportunities for investment are absent, and so the plantations remain grass-grown, the sugar mills silent, the wharves rotting and deserted, and the people, poor creatures, with haggard faces, still starving, still asking, 'How long, O Lord, how long?' And worst of all, we who control the destinies of the island cannot answer them."

"A military government at best is a tyranny. The best military government is the one which interferes least with the autonomy of the civil government. Our military government in Cuba, as a means of rapprochement between the two peoples, is a failure. And the extent to which this is the case is indicated by the remark sometimes now heard in Cuba, that as between the American military control and the Spanish military control, the Spanish was preferable."

"The irritation of the Cubans against the Americans and American military rule is daily increasing and will inevitably presently find vent in a revolt."

This is what is seen by an American military officer who is in a position to observe the facts of the situation. He sees that the best way to keep the pledge made against forcible annexation, is to evacuate the island now. But the Government has no thought of withdrawing the American forces just now. They will remain, the agitation and discontent will increase, until presently it finds vent in a revolt; then the Cubans will have committed the same crime as did the Filipinos, and will be treated in the like way.

Such are the present indications, according to the testimony of an American army officer in Cuba; and the only conclusion to be drawn is that the same kind of freedom has been conferred on Cuba that was conferred by Rome on the ancient republics of Greece; who when they had rejoiced at their deliverance from the yoke of the Macedonians, awoke to find themselves further from liberty than they were before.
