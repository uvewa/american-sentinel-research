THE Fourth of July was celebrated vigorously by American officers and men at Manila,—the place where American dependence (upon Great Britain and other nations) has lately been established by American arms. A poor place that, in which to celebrate American independence. For at that place American independence was lost, and unless the steps there taken be retraced, it is gone forever.

No nation on the globe is now truly independent. A year ago there was one such nation,—the United States; but now this one has played the part of Esau and sold its birthright for a mess of pottage. The dependence of the nations of the Old World is proclaimed by their alliances; not one of them feels strong enough to stand alone. Germany, Austria, and Italy are in one alliance; France and Russia in another; and England, to whom the others had turned the "cold shoulder" had been anxiously feeling around for an ally, and was only too glad to find one in the great American Republic.

A virtual alliance now exists between these two countries, and it is made necessary by the entrance of the United States into the arena of European strifes. For, as a British authority, speaking of this Republic under its new policy, said, "The young imperialist has entered upon a path where she will require a stout friend;" and her bargain for the Philippines was made "under the protecting naval strength of Great Britain," who will "expect a material quid pro quo for this assistance."

By the first American Revolution, a century and a quarter ago, independence was gained, and the American colonies were lost. By the second revolution, just completed, independence has been lost, and American colonies are again established. And as regards the principle of all this, it matters not that the seat of the imperial power has crossed the Atlantic, and the colonies have crossed the Pacific.

Events will yet make plain the fact to those who do not now see it, that this country is no longer independent.
