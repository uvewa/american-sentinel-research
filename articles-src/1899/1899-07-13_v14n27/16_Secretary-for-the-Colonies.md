A new official is soon to be added to the President's Cabinet, whose office will be that of "Secretary for the Colonies." The name of Robert P. Porter is mentioned as that of the probable man to be chosen to this new position. Of course, such an office is a necessary one under the imperial policy now pursued by the Government. The expression "American colonies" carries us back to the days of King George III. Our forefathers thought they had forever abolished that expression, but they were mistaken.
