COMPTROLLER COLER, of this city, is conducting an investigation of the city's gifts of public money to "private charities," with a view to the cutting down of the appropriations. A published list of such institutions, with the amounts given the last year, contains things worthy of note. For example, compare the appropriations made in the following:—

"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children... $30,000."
"Foundling Society of the Sisters of Charity... $295,568."
"Nursery and Child's Hospital... $57,000."
"New York Catholic Protectory... $286,000."
"Five Points House of Industry... $11,000."
"Missionary Sisters, Third Order of St. Francis... $92,877."

This shows how the idea of public appropriations to private "charities" "works" in practise. It secures much more than the "lion's share" of the funds for sectarian institutions. These denominational "private charities" are nothing more than institutions for the propagation, primarily, of the religious belief of the denomination, and the increase of its numerical strength. The public is taxed to promote sectarianism, under the guise of charity. The charity in all such institutions is a secondary matter.

The national Government has decided to abolish such appropriations in affairs under its control, and the State and city governments would do well to follow its example.
