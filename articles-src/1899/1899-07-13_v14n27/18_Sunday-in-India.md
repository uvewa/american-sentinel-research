In India Sunday was formerly a legal holiday, but now the British government refuses to make it a dies non; which fact, says the Indian Witness, "is a serious hindrance to the observance of the day of rest in this country."

This is true as regards its observance as a legal holiday; but Christians want something more than a day of rest observed as a legal holiday. The government can promote holiday observance, but only the power of God can promote true Sabbath-keeping; and no action by the civil government can constitute a "serious hindrance" to that.
