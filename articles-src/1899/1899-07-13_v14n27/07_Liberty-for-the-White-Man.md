"We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."—Declaration of Independence.

These immortal words of Jefferson, given to the world on the day of our nation's birth, were not the expression of new truths. They were the condensation into a few strong phrases of all that humanity had learned of liberty, gleaned from the history of the centuries and sealed with the blood of freemen shed on a thousand battle-fields. We may not, if we would, cast these teachings aside as the words of a visionary philosopher, an idealist whose doctrines have been proved to be unfitted to our needs after a trial of little more than a century. These are Jefferson's words, but the teachings are those of human experience. If we reject them we turn our faces away from the light and cast aside much that was good in the civilizations of the past. We abandon Greek democracy and Roman justice; the teachings of the Hebrew prophets, and the principles underlying our Christian civilization; the Magna Charta and the Reformation; the victories of our own people on the bloody fields of the Revolution and the Rebellion.

For summed up in this one brief paragraph we find the recognition of universal brotherhood, of eternal justice, of divine power and love for fellowman, of civil and religious liberty, of government resting on the consent of the governed, which forbids slavery and oppression of every kind. If these principles of the Declaration of Independence are of such transcendent importance in securing the happiness and welfare of men and of nations, then the American people can do no better on this anniversary than to consider calmly and seriously whether the currents of our national life are flowing in the direction that our Revolutionary ancestors would have chosen; whether our present policies are in keeping with the Declaration of Independence.

It is far easier to assume that these things are true; to point, as many writers and speakers will do to-day, to the Stars and Stripes proudly floating over seventy-five millions of people at home and a dozen millions more on the islands of the sea, without knowing or caring whether that flag is for these people a symbol of freedom, or of oppression. It would be easy to dwell upon the achievements of brave men who have since our last Independence Day raised that flag in new and distant regions, laying down their young lives that the red, white and blue might be planted in triumph among the ruins of an ancient and outworn despotism; but it is our duty to consider whether in the consequences of their sacrifice we have realized the high ideals of the American people. One year ago to-day we were rejoicing in a great naval victory by which the issue of the Spanish war had been decided, and the liberty of Cuba secured. Yet Cuba is not free to-day. The Spaniard has gone, but in his place the American has established a military rule which is as foreign to the principles of the Declaration as is the czar's iron rule over Russia. However beneficial its temporary results may be, the system is wrong. It is maintained in defiance of the sacred pledge of the American people made by Congress in the intervention, when the freedom of Cuba was acknowledged in the very words of our own Declaration of Independence.

Ten thousand miles away, across the broad Pacific, another shameful spectacle is presented. In the Philippines, an American army has contended for months, gallantly but unsuccessfully, to assert our claim of sovereignty over a brave people who fought with us against the Spaniards, but who unfortunately turned their guns upon us when it became clear that we would not grant to them that liberty, which is their "unalienable right." We have ravaged their country with fire and sword in the name of liberty and Christian civilization. Was there ever a more shameful spectacle of lust of land and greed of gold? "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," says the Declaration. All of these things have we taken from them, and in the judgment of the nations, we shall not escape the payment of the penalty.

We read much in these days about manifest destiny, about the duty of spreading Anglo-Saxon civilization, about taking up the "white man's burden." Are the principles of the Declaration applicable only to white men? Did Jefferson mean that all white men are created equal, that the Creator has endowed white men with unalienable rights, that "the consent of the governed" was not a necessary preliminary to the government of black men, or brown men, or yellow men? Lincoln did not take so limited a view of truth when he struck the shackles from the slave, yet a generation afterward we find public sentiment in the South justifying the lynching of the black man and the denial of all his civil rights under the form of law; we find public sentiment in the North justifying the conquest of the brown men of the Philippines; and we find the nations of the earth scrambling in indecent haste to divide the great domain of the yellow men of China.

Race prejudice is nowhere more powerful than in the United States, and this is in utter conflict with the Declaration. As for the claims put forward in China and the Philippines in the name of Christianity and civilization, it is time to realize that these terms are but a cloak for commercial schemes which aim at the exploitation of Asia for gain. An Anglo-American alliance would only preserve the peace of the world when it suited the traders of the two nations to abstain from war. When our British friends insist on joining us in celebrating the Fourth of July, it is time to ask ourselves whether it is not because we have departed from the ideas underlying the observance, that it has ceased to wound the nation whose pride was humbled in so memorable a way by the deeds which followed the Declaration.

Liberty—for white men only—that is the present-day limitation placed on the broad words of Jefferson. Have white men all the liberty to which they are entitled in this nation, founded on the principle of equal rights? Have we equality of opportunity to earn a living, and thereby to acquire the means on which "the pursuit of happiness" is so largely founded? Have we equality of educational privileges? Have we true equality before the law? Have we equality as citizens, except in theory? Does the poor man count for as much as the rich man, irrespective of individual talent or attainments? If any or all of these questions must be answered in the negative, then the problems that will confront the United States of America at the dawn of the twentieth century will not be easy of solution, if we are to live up to the high ideals of those who laid the foundations of the Republic.

HOLDING the Philippine Islands against the will of their inhabitants involves a new departure in government. I do not want as part of this nation, people who cannot read the Declaration of Independence. The doctrine of force lies behind, not in front of us. The expansion argument is the argument of George III.

Shall we say, on this day of celebration, that we have lived one hundred years under a wrong principle? No. Some say, take the Bible in one hand and a gun in the other. Thank God, I am not in favor of this way of Christianizing.—W. J. Bryan, July 4.

PATRIOTISM does not mean Patriotism.
