In an interview accorded a party of "pilgrims" by the pope, last month, the latter spoke of the slight that had been put upon him by his exclusion from the Peace Congress, and said:

"The sovereign pontiff will remain faithful to his calling. When Christ was upon earth dispute and conflict characterized society. There were always wars and rumors of wars, but Jesus Christ brought peace to all men of good will, and I have no more fervent wish than to follow in his footsteps. Now that the nations are becoming themselves convinced that disarmament, or at least reduction of armament, is necessary, and that it is possible to reach beneficent results by an international congress, the vicar of Christ, the Prince of Peace, is excluded.

"This is hard. I feel this the more since I am imprisoned in this palace as a slave for more than twenty-two years. Is my complaint exaggerated? Alas! the sovereign pontiff dare not show himself outside of these walls for fear of being insulted on the streets of Rome by fanatic enemies of the Vatican."

The pontiff has "no more fervent wish than to follow in his [Christ's] footsteps"; yet he "dare not show himself outside of these walls for fear of being insulted on the streets of Rome by fanatic enemies." But how long can any one follow in Christ's footsteps who will not go where he is afraid of being insulted?

The real Prince of Peace was not afraid of insults; and anyone who is truly His follower will be likewise unmindful of such things.
