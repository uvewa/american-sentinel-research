SELDOM, if ever, has the voice of the people been the voice of God. We read that "the voice of them [the people] and of the chief priests prevailed." But that voice demanded the life of the Son of God.

"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil," is the divine injunction. And, surely, the way of the multitude always leads to evil. "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it." But the way to evil is broad, "and many go in thereat."

In the days of Noah it was the voice of one man against the voice of millions, but the one voice was right. The testimony borne by the voice of Lot was true, while all the jangling voices of the cities of the plain were lost in confusion. It was the voice of one crying in the wilderness that condemned the religious world for their rejection of the Messiah.

The voice of God speaks in direct contrast even to the professing religious world. The people say, "Beat your swords into plowshares, and your spears into pruning-hooks," but God's message is directly the reverse: "Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears, and let the weak say, I am strong." The Lord's message is for the last day also, for it ends with the statement, "Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe." And Christ tells us that the harvest is the end of the world.

From this statement made by the people, many have taken the view that there will be a millennium of peace and happiness succeed the wars of time, and that now we are preparing for that great event. The czar's peace proposals appear to them as prophetic of the reign of peace. But while the many nations are speaking peace with their lips and in their professions, never in the world's history were there such tremendous preparations for war. The mighty men are being wakened up, just as God said they would in the last days. The closing struggle is yet to come. The Armageddon contest will settle the question of war forever.

The Lord knew, as he spoke through the prophet of old, what the mind of man would be in the last days. He knew that those who would be seeking the patronage of earthly governments for their religion would be crying Peace! peace! But the unregenerate hearts of men and nations would, despite that cry, be contemplating and preparing for war.

And thus it is to-day. The time of the end has come, and the shadows of the last days fall over the hilltops of time. We are approaching the millennium, but that only means "a thousand years." There is no prophecy of happiness or of peace in it. In fact, it will just be the opposite. Everything is reversed, and this we read in Jer. 4:23–27. The greatest battle yet before the world is the last battle, and in that struggle the broken weapons and wounded men will be left upon the battle-field never to be made whole again.

Those who are willing to follow the voice of the people will be unprepared to meet the realities that are pointed out by the voice of God. And herein lies the danger in taking our religion from human thought, or accepting the dictates of popular opinion. The voice of the people does not represent the voice of God, nor will it ever do so, till that time comes when sin and sinners shall alike be unknown.
