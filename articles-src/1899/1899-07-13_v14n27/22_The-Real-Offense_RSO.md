I have recently called on a man who keeps a bicycle shop a few paces from the place where I am to be tried. He tells me that he does more work on Sunday than any other day of the week, and makes as much money on Sunday as on all the other days of the week together. He rents wheels and has to work all the time to keep them in repairs. I asked him where they went with his wheels. "Out on the race track," was his reply. This man said he knew he was doing wrong to run his shop on Sunday. "If I should go to keeping the seventh day," said he, "I should be arrested at once for working on Sunday." It would really be not for working on Sunday, but for keeping the Sabbath. Yet this man, strange to say, advocates a Sunday law.

I talk with many people here in the South who think that our country would be in an awful condition if there were no Sunday laws; but I am convinced of this, that the more strict the Sunday laws, the less regard there will be for Sunday. I have lived eleven years in Canada and six years in the States of Georgia and Mississippi. In the Province of Quebec where I lived they have no Sunday law. Here they arrest men for the most trivial work on Sunday, that is, if he keeps the seventh day. Yet I have seen more Sunday work, Sunday games, Sunday picnics, and Sunday travel in one year in Georgia than in the whole eleven years in Canada. In Georgia it is backed up by law and in the other case it is backed up by a religious sentiment. Religion by law is but shallow hypocrisy. True religion is imbedded in the heart, and needs no law to enforce its claims by pains and penalties.

Hatley, Miss. R. S. Owen.
