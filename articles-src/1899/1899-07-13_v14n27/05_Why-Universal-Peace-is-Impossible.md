What the Peace Conference at The Hague has accomplished so far has not been officially revealed to the outside world. There is a rumor that the German government suggested that the sittings be made public, but that England refused. At any rate, the proceedings are secret, and all we hear is subject to the proverbial grain of salt. In the meantime the conviction is getting stronger that the Conference, so far as the establishment of universal peace is concerned, must necessarily be a failure. This is especially well expressed by a writer in the Handelsblad, Amsterdam, who, under the heading, "Ulterior Hopes," writes as follows:

"To make lasting peace possible, national ambition must be killed. Is that possible? Let us see.

"Here comes Marianne, the personification of France. The cap of liberty is on her raven locks, but it does not sit very firmly. Will it fall from that restless little head?

"'Do you think I am hopeless?' she asks. 'Have I forgotten Alsace-Lorraine? No, no, the Latin race is not dead. We will unite Spain with us; we will raise the pope—dependent upon our support—once more to a throne; we will teach Italy the step of our battalions. Does any one think I have forgiven Agincourt and Crécy, and Waterloo? No, and I have not forgotten the America and India of my forefathers. The Latin race shall once more rule the world, for my children are as countless as the sands by the sea.'

"'I have aspirations,' says John Bull. 'I want the consolidation of my empire, I want an alliance with the Anglo-Saxon on the other side of the water. Do you think I flatter him so humbly for nothing? Africa must become a British island. The Russians will be driven out of sight. When Ireland once more is loyal, my fleet shall rule the world, if only the Yankees will help me! I can always recruit an army out of the lower orders. The gold, the wealth of the earth must be mine. Let Britannia rule!"

"Here comes Pobydonoszeff, the typical Russian. He is master of Europe just now, thanks to poor Marianne. He represents the Slavic races, who dream no less of being masters in Europe and Asia than any other race. The Orthodox church must be made victorious everywhere, he says. He points to China and Central Asia, soon to be all Russian. He points to the want of unanimity in Europe, and tells us that the sword of mighty Russia is the real arbiter. And the three widows whom he has robbed, Finland, Poland, German Russia, bow their heads in fear.

"And now the youthful Kaiser, crowned by a helmet which bears the emblem of the fighting eagle: 'I hope for the realization of the dreams of Frederick, of Louise, the country's saint in the struggle with France, of my grandfather, who knew what he wanted, and knew how to be patient as well as to act. Let every one who speaks the German tongue be as brothers. Let an invincible navy defend our sons, our trade, our industry against the jealous. We need a mailed fist to obtain our share of the wreck of China. I stood upon the Mount of Olives, and I saw that all Asia Minor, once the corn chamber of the world, will be so again in the hands of the Germans. I shall do my duty and see to the fulfillment of my people's ulterior hopes.'

"But how is peace to be established with all this?"
