The Boston Transcript publishes a letter from Rev. Clay MacCaulay, dated at Tokio, Japan, last month, in which the writer states that Admiral Dewey had expressed to him his views of Philippine conquest in these words:—

"Rather than make a war of conquest on the Filipino people I would up anchor and sail out of the harbor."

He had also seen General Otis, and in a conversation the latter had said to him:—

"I was ordered to this port from San Francisco. I did not believe in the annexation of these islands when I came here, nor do I believe in their annexation now."
