WITHIN the next fortnight, three seventh-day observers in the South are to be tried under the Sunday laws, one at Gainesville, Ga., one at Rome, Ga., and one at Amory, Miss. Interesting developments are certain to arise at these trials, and at the earliest opportunity these will be set before the readers of the SENTINEL. At each one the interests of the defendants and of the cause they represent will be looked after by the president of the Religious Liberty Association, Allen Moon. Every lover of religious liberty has an interest in these trials, and is in fact on trial himself in the persons of the defendants who are before the courts.
