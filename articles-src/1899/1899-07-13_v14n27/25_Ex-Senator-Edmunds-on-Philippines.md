Ex-SENATOR EDMUNDS affirms that Spain had nothing to cede to us in the Philippines "other than a pretended sovereignty that did not exist." The rights which Spain claimed there were precisely those that we denied to her in Cuba. In putting ourselves in Spain's place as the subjugator and ruler of the Filipinos we are therefore in a position as indefensible legally as it is untenable morally.
