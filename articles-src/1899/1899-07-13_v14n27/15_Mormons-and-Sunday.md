On one thing, says Living Issues, a Salt Lake City journal, the Mormon Church and other more popular churches are agreed,—they denounce the desecration of Sunday. "As we write, the Presbyterians, in general assembly, are protesting against Sabbath desecration, while the Deseret News [Mormon organ] and the mayor of Salt Lake City are clamoring against the same thing."

This same regard for Sunday constitutes an essential feature of the Mormon, the papal, and the pagan religions of old time. This fact in itself ought to condemn it in the eyes of Protestant Christians.
