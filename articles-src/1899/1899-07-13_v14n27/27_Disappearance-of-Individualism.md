Whether or not much concern is felt in this country over the vanishing principle of individualism in government, the fact that it is disappearing is clearly seen, and is a matter of widespread comment. Such comments were deemed appropriate by many journals for the anniversary of Independence day, and our attention has been called to the following in the St. Paul Globe (Minn.) of that date. It is a clear statement of a very serious situation. Under the heading "1789-1899," the Globe says:

"After more than a century of experience in conducting representative government as closely as at all possible along the lines of individualism, the American people find themselves on the closing anniversary of the national holiday in the nineteenth century, brought face to face with political, social and economic conditions which threaten the complete disappearance of the principle of individualism.

"The minimum of interference with the rights and privileges of the individual citizen, either through government or otherwise, was the dominant principle in the theories of social and political control which prevailed among us during the greater part of the first century of our national existence. To-day the individual is of minor importance, and is everywhere yielding to the weight and control of the mass. In our industrial life the individual gave way completely before partnership and joint stock associations. They in turn made room for the control of the corporation. The corporation is fast being displaced by the aggregation of corporations. The individual, as a force in social, political or economic concerns, is, apparently, no longer of much moment.

"The Government conceived and administered by Jefferson was the antithesis of socialism. The Government administered by McKinley is as near a realization of state socialism as can be maintained without the making of radical changes in the organic law of the country. Government fifty years ago in America was a mere instrumentality growing out of the necessity of delegating certain duties which the individual could not discharge himself. Up to thirty years ago or so, the individual ran the Government. To-day the Government runs the individual. Then government was a mere necessary evil; to-day it is the individual, disassociated from his fellows, that represents the necessary evil. The Government existed then for the convenience of the individual; to-day the individual exists for the convenience of the Government.

"In the last analysis it is doubtful whether a more complete reversal of political theories could have been realized than has set in among the American people during the nineteenth century. We cannot close our eyes to it. It is but little more apparently than the precursor to changes even more radical in all the other relations of the individual toward society. How far the changes will go uncontested as they practically have been, or whether American society will ever find its way back to the moorings of individuals from which it has broken loose, are questions the solution of which is hidden in the secrets of the future. Thomas Jefferson declared that, in determining the duration of American free government, all would depend on the construction placed on the provisions of our Constitution. With the opening of the new century the prediction assumes a greater significance than ever attached to it in our national history."
