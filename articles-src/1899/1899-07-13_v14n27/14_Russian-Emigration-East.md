"Go East, young man," is the maxim of the Horace Greelys of Russia to ambitious youth in that country. This is largely due to the completion of the great trans-Siberian railway, which will now terminate at Port Arthur instead of at Vladivostok. Few people appreciate how useful this longest of all railroads is already to Russia, incomplete though it is. Tens of thousands of emigrants are transported to the East. Last year 200,000 colonists settled in Russian Manchuria.
