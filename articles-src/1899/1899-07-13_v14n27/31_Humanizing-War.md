In his address at the grave of Grotius yesterday Ambassador White declared it to be the duty of civilization to "go on with the work of humanizing war."

But how shall that be humanized which is inhuman in its very conception and in every detail of its waging? "War's a brain-spattering, windpipe splitting art," wrote Byron. "War is hell," said General Sherman. War consists in killing, maiming, destroying. It tears the husband and the son from the family hearthstone and sends them to slaughter and be slaughtered. It makes widows and orphans. It sows the seeds of pestilence. It breeds famine and gaunt disease.

No, no, no! We cannot humanize this hideously in human thing. Our task is to abolish it as we have abolished its twin sister, piracy. It is ours to find a better way and to follow it.
