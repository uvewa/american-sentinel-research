The president of a Filipino envoy sent to Manila to treat with the American representatives for peace, expressed to one of the latter his view of the war as related to the principles of American government. He said:—

"We have spent some time with your commissioners, incidentally considering the American Constitution. Its principles impress us profoundly.

"The plan of government offered the Philippines seems, in theory, a good colonial system. But why should a nation with your Constitution seek to make a colony of a distant people who have been so long fighting against Spain to secure the same rights your Constitution gives? You fought the same battle in America when you fought against England."
