# Cigars Can Still Be Sold in Atlanta on Sunday.

The city council of Atlanta has decided, says the *Atlanta Constitution*, not to disturb the present regulations relative to the sale of cigars, tobacco, and smokers' supplies on Sunday. This means that such things will be allowed unrestricted sale on Sundays as being articles of necessity.

In the discussion preceding this decision, the views of the Sunday-closing faction were voiced in a speech by Councilman W. S. Thomson, who said:—

> "There seems to be a class of people in Atlanta who believe in throwing everything wide open, regardless of the law of man or of God. I would just as well be in a community of avowed atheists in case they were to gain their point.
>
> "It is this great greed to make money that is one of the evils of the day, and that will bring this great Republic down to ruin. It was this greed that ruined Rome and Greece, and it is having its effect in Atlanta. There is already open in this city a great moral crevice which is growing wider and wider, and which if not stopped will lead to the very gates of hell. This council should not fail to take this opportunity of standing before the world as being in favor of Sabbath observance. I hope it can never be said that this body ever licensed traffic on the Sabbath more than was absolutely necessary. The Sabbath was made for the Lord's day, and still there are very few who observe it as it should be. I consider this a question of great importance, and the council should act in the fear of God."

The ground of this appeal is plainly religious, and that only. The city council of Atlanta was asked to restrict Sunday traffic for reasons which were purely religious questions. That is the ground upon which all Sunday legislation rests; but not all who demand such legislation are, like Mr. Thomson, honest enough to admit it.

A city council or a state legislature is not a proper body to decide upon religious questions.
