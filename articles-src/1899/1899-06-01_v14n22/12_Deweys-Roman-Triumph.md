ADMIRAL DEWEY is on his way back to America from the Philippines, and great preparations are under way against the day of his arrival in New York City. The papers have announced that he is to have a "welcome like a Roman triumph." Proceedings in this country are getting to have a good deal about them that is suggestive of ancient Rome, and it would be well for thoughtful citizens to ask themselves whether this Republic can continue to walk in the steps of the Roman republic without arriving at the end which that republic reached. That we are getting to be a good deal like ancient Rome is not a reassuring admission.
