## Another Sunday Arrest and Fine.

A member of a Perth, New Brunswick, community, which observes the seventh day Sabbath, writes the following to this office under date of May 25:—

"May 22nd, Bro. J. J. Brown was called before the magistrate to answer for the charge of working 'at his ordinary calling,' namely, farming, the particular work being plowing on 'the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday.' For this, he had to plead guilty because he did work on that day; therefore he was deprived of the right to plead for himself or to have any one plead for him. We were told that there was no chance to plead, as he had confessed to the crime and there was no discussion whether the Sunday was the Lord's day or not; it was simply the law of the land and must be obeyed. The fine was one dollar and costs, the amount of which I do not know as it has not been paid. The arrest is under a new Sunday law just passed. It is a trial of faith to the parties in question, as Bro. Brown is a poor man and has had some sickness in the recent past. His prosecutors are bent on making future trouble. Providing they continue to fine him and levy costs he will soon have nothing! H. J. FARMAN."

This poor man, who can only support his family by working six days in the week, and who conscientiously observes the seventh day as the Sabbath, is obliged to pay deference to the belief in Sunday sacredness, at the expense either of his family's comfort, or of his conscience. He is fined one day's time each week if he keeps the Sunday law, and one dollar and costs, or more, every time he breaks it. What kind of a law is it that penalizes an individual whether he keeps it or not?

Considering that conscience must be sacrificed in addition to the financial loss of one day's time in every week, if this "law" is kept, while only a financial loss is to be encountered by disregarding it, it is plain that the latter course can be afforded by anyone vastly better than the former. The value of conscience cannot be measured in money. The loss of conscience is a greater calamity than the loss of money, or of personal liberty, or even of life itself.
