## Five Minutes of War.

"Five minutes of war in the Philippines" is thus described by a correspondent of a leading daily in this city:—

"The rebels had built a strong breastwork of stone at the other end of the one bridge across the river. A sergeant of the Fourteenth, leaping from cover, rushed toward this breastwork two or three rods ahead of his men, calling upon them to follow him. From the time that this little force, which I accompanied, started until we reached the other end of the bridge it was not more than three or four seconds, but three or four seconds is a long time when you expect every instant that a volley of Mausers will be sent to greet you at a few yards' range. In truth, we were in no danger. The few insurgents who held this position ran without firing a shot. They had no doubt been posted there to delay our advance long enough to enable the rest of the garrison to get out of the town. If they had stayed five minutes longer what was the neatest and the meanest piece of man killing I have ever seen would not have followed.

"As we hurried down the street which ran across the outer portion of the town we saw below, in the parallel streets near the shore, the fleeing garrison. At such a time the private of the American Army needs few if any orders. No one stopped to think of the possibility of shots from houses or from the concealment afforded by a turn in the street.

"Beyond the town was a stretch of field three quarters of a mile in length along the shore. As we entered it we saw in a single file probably one hundred and fifty men hurrying across a path to the marshes beyond. They began to drop as if automatically in answer to the crack of our Krags. It was then that a light-haired youngster of the Fourteenth lifted up his rifle to say:

"'Boys, this is murder! Maybe those fellows aren't soldiers, anyway. Give 'em a chance to surrender.' There was a momentary pause, but none of the figures that seemed to be trotting rather than running along the skyline at a distance of from 200 to 500 yards stopped. Through the glasses it could be seen that all were carrying rifles. The women and children had been sent out of the town and only soldiers remained.

"Then, with pitiless accuracy of aim, we poured the bullets into the human targets. Perhaps a fourth of them escaped into the marshes.

"The killing had occupied five minutes."

Can this be justified by the assertion, true though it be, that the Filipino is a savage and doesn't know how to govern himself?
