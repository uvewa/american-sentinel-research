## Where Is God's Power?

BY T. E. BOWEN.

At Minneapolis, May 18, the one hundred and eleventh annual assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States opened its session. The retiring moderator, Rev. Dr. Wallace Radcliffe, of Washington, D. C., delivered the opening sermon. If the report is true as to what this professed minister of the gospel said at that time, one is at a loss to know whether that general assembly had access to the revealed Word of God or had ever read the sermon of our Lord and Saviour on the Mount, or not. Among other things the reverend gentleman from Washington is reported to have said:—

"It is significant to recognize the five epochal events of the past year, in each of them the pointing finger of the Mediatorial Ring—the Spanish-American war, the Anglo-American friendship, the czar's proposal for peace, the reformation of China, the opening of the Soudan.

"To-day, as we convene, the peace congress meets in the capital of Holland. The very call is the echo of Christ's prayer, 'Thy kingdom come.'"

Why not add, "Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven"? Again, why not quote in this connection, "My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world [in its present state], then would my servants fight; . . . but now is my kingdom not from hence?" John 18:36. Why, unless it was it would spoil the sweet morsel the doctor was presenting?

"In the presence of these opportunities the church cannot be careless. We dare not refuse obedience. He calls us to subjugation. Force is the only argument known to savages from Joshua to McKinley."

Who calls to the church to subjugate? Certainly it is not Jesus Christ. He says his servants will not fight to set up his kingdom here. He then who does fight for this is not a servant of Christ. Has Mr. McKinley yet spoken to the sun to stand still, and met the captain of the Lord's host in the plain, thus assuring the hearts of his subjects that he has been called to lead out in a holy war in the Philippines, China, or elsewhere? The doctor so infers:—

"The earth must be subdued, that it may bring forth the rose and fruit and the tree of life, whose leaves are for the healing of the nations."

"Our national life has new impulse and dazzling ambition. We are looking beyond from our provincialism. We have made war for humanity. We have conquered for humanity. The victory will be a defeat, and that endowment a poverty and destruction, save as through these open doors the church shall immediately and enthusiastically carry the vision of Jesus Christ.

"I see peace, white fields, inviting doors of commerce, liberty and enlightened races; but I see them all beyond the cross. There is no other way than by Calvary. I believe in imperialism, but an imperialism that is a beneficent republicanism.

"I believe in a war for humanity, but in a war for humanity that carries to humanity the enduring peace and good will of the gospel of Christ.

"We cannot escape responsibility. This is not the time for swollen ease. If we daily, another will dominate. If we evade, the scepter will fall from us."

What scepter? Surely it is not Christ's scepter, for that was transferred from Zedekiah to Him whose right it is to reign. Here is the authority: "And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God, Remove the diadem, and take off the crown [the scepter goes with the crown]: . . . I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and it shall be no more, until he comes, whose right it is; and I will give it him." Eze. 21:25-27.

When He comes to take it he comes as "King of kings and Lord of lords," and when God shall set up Christ's kingdom it "shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these [earthly] kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever." Dan. 2:44. The United States is not the kingdom Christ sets up; a "scepter of righteousness is the scepter of his kingdom."

"We have come into the kingdom for such a time as this. Hawaii, Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines—these are the summons of our Mediatorial King. The Man of Macedonia waves and calls.

"American imperialism must have its counterpart in Presbyterian imperialism, which will go forth and carry its republican beneficence, its spiritual republicanism, its divine spiritualism to the end of the earth.

"We will make Presbyterians if we can. If Presbyterianism is not suitable to the Philippines it is not suitable to America. But if we are not to carry Presbyterianism we must carry some Christianity thither, not a mongrel thing, not a false promise, but a Christianity which works by love, which purifies the heart, which overcomes the world."

It is plain to the close observer what this retiring moderator of the Presbyterian Church is planning on using expansion and imperialism, for the church must follow closely all the conquests to reap her rich reward. Has our Government descended to conquests for the benefit of a church? Has a church accepted the power of armies and navies for the power of God through the gospel?
