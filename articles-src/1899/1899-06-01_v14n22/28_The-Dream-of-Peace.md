## The Dream of Peace.

Under this heading the following appeared editorially in the Chicago Times-Herald, of May 13:—

"It must be rather discouraging to the czar if he is a sincere man to observe that the nearer his peace conference approaches the more numerous are the expressions of doubt concerning its practical value. At first there was such a tendency to applaud the high moral sentiment of his address to the powers that the nations paused for a while to indulge in the pleasures of a beatific dream. They toyed with the idea of disarmament and speculated on its possibilities.

"The very fact that Russia had taken the initiative in the movement for a conference was said to be significant of a remarkable change that had come over the world. Perhaps it was, but then again it was not half so significant as the increased expenditures of Russia on her army and navy or as her aggressive policy in China and her tyrannical policy in Finland. Somehow high moral speculations and practical politics do not seem to hitch.

"The height of absurdity was reached when a German delegate to the conference came out with an ecstatic panegyric on the holiness and virtue of war, but sober criticism is constantly insisting on the difficulties of a universal peace scheme. One of the best and at the same time least hopeful discussions of the subject that has yet appeared is that by 'Diplomaticus' in the Fortnightly Review. It is a historical summary, which shows how little of originality there is in the czar's idea, how ancient the speculation is, how futile have been all previous experiments in making for the prevention of war. The writer notes that 'Frederick the Great beguiled his leisure with thoughts of a European peace and disarmament congress,' that Napoleon 'protested from his exile that the object of all his wars had been to restore the 'beau ideal de la civilization,' by applying to the European nations the systems of the Greek Amphictyony.' It is said that even Moltke, in his young days, braved ridicule by confessing his belief in the idea of a general European peace, and thought that a mutual disarmament might possibly be a question only of decades.

"So much for the idea as it has fascinated military men, to say nothing of a long string of religious teachers and philosophers. And now for the attempt to put it into practice. This, too, is not original. The scheme of the Holy Alliance in 1815, the proposal of Napoleon III. in 1863, were quite as practical as anything that is likely to come out of the czar's conference. But they simply amounted to a demonstration that the difficulties were insuperable. In the present relations of nations the notions of peace and disarmament are incompatible. To disarm is to invite attack over many an unsettled problem, while the maintenance of a large army compels peace through fear."
