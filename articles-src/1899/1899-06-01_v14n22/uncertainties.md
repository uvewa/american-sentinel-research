# Uncertainties — v14n22 (1899-06-01)

## Article 07: "Works of Necessity" — Author Initials D. W. R.

- **Issue:** The article is signed "D. W. R." at the end. These initials do not match any known author in the project's known authors list.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "D. W. R." (preserved in body of article as signed)
- **Confidence:** HIGH that initials are "D. W. R." — clearly legible in the OCR
- **Action:** Attribution set to "editorial" since initials are unknown; the signature is preserved in the article body. If D. W. R. is identified, attribution should be updated to "explicit."

## Article 08: "Reforming the Nation" — Author R. M. Kilgore

- **Issue:** The article is bylined "BY R. M. KILGORE." These initials do not match any known author in the project's known authors list.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "R. M. Kilgore" in the byline
- **Confidence:** HIGH — clearly legible in OCR
- **Action:** Attribution set to "explicit" with author field "R. M. Kilgore" and no author_short since initials are not in the known list. If identified, update accordingly.

## Article 09: "From Beneath the Southern Cross" — Author John McCarthy

- **Issue:** The article is bylined "BY JOHN MCCARTHY." No known initials for this author in the project list.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** HIGH — clearly legible in OCR
- **Action:** Attribution set to "explicit" with author field "John McCarthy." No author_short assigned. The article dateline at end reads "Argentine Republic." which is the location of writing, not a separate author.

## Article 20: "The Post-Office and Sunday Closing in Arizona" — Author Geo. O. States

- **Issue:** The letter is signed "Geo. O. States." Not in known authors list.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** HIGH — clearly legible
- **Action:** Attribution set to "explicit" with author field "Geo. O. States."

## Article 18: "Sunday Breaking and Its Penalty in Ontario" — Author P. M. Hove

- **Issue:** The article is signed "P. M. Hove." Not in known authors list.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** HIGH — clearly legible
- **Action:** Attribution set to "explicit" with author field "P. M. Hove."

## Page 11, "The Presbyterian Assembly and Sunday" — Typo "Americanan Sabbath"

- **Issue:** The OCR reads "Americanan Sabbath" which appears to be a typo in the original (likely "American Sabbath" or a double-letter OCR artifact).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Americanan Sabbath" — preserved as it appears in the OCR source
- **Confidence:** LOW — this may be an OCR error for "American Sabbath" or may be an original printing error. Without access to the original scan, cannot confirm.
- **Reason:** Per project rules, text is preserved exactly as it appears. The unusual spelling is noted here for review against the original scan.

## Article 25: "Religion By Force" — Bracketed "[if]"

- **Issue:** The OCR contains "Presbyterian expansion is not in the least objectionable, for [if] it consists..." The word "[if]" appears to be a bracketed editorial insertion in the original text to clarify a grammatical gap.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "for [if] it consists" — preserved as in source
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the bracket appears in the OCR source and likely reflects the original text's editorial insertion, not an OCR artifact.

## Short Items on Page 16 — Segmentation

- The page 16 editorial notes appear as a continuous block without explicit section headers.
- Individual items were separated by context and paragraph breaks.
- Each has been given its own file.
- **Confidence:** HIGH that the segmentation is correct based on topic shifts and paragraph structure.
