## Sunday Breaking and Its Penalty in Ontario.

May 7, 1899, two brothers by the name of Scratch, sons of a local Methodist minister, united in spying out Benj. Sherk who was engaged in working on his farm that day. Mr. Sherk is a Seventh-day Adventist, belonging to the Albuna church, Ontario.

The case was tried at Leamington, Ont., May 19, at 2 p.m., the writer appearing for Mr. Sherk. In cross examination the witness who laid the complaint swore that he drove about ten miles, then went with his brother about (?) forty rods to get near Mr. Sherk. When asked why he went to all this trouble on Sunday, he replied, "I did it so I might prosecute him."

The younger Scratch said he was on good terms with Mr. Sherk, but it troubled him to see him ride a roller on the Lord's day. He believed Sunday to be the Lord's day. He was afraid his children would not know which day was the Sabbath. He went to spy out Mr. Sherk so as to prosecute him to save the rising generation.

Mr. Sherk was charged with being found unlawfully working at his ordinary calling on the 7th of May contrary to statute.

It may be remembered by the reader that the Ontario Sunday law was amended some time ago so as to incorporate the word "farmer" into the statute. The representative from the district where Mr. Sherk lives was the mover of the amendment, and he afterwards wrote that he had succeeded at last, and now he was sure the people in Essex in a certain locality would not be disturbed by 2nd-day Adventists working on Sunday. The intent of the law was directed against a certain class of men, and that because of their religion. The prosecution of this first case was conducted upon a religious basis.

The justice told how they of olden times who even picked up sticks on the Sabbath day were put to death. He did not intend to give a death sentence but would fine Benj. Sherk five dollars and costs, fine and costs amounting to ten dollars and two cents, to be paid at once or else orders to seize property and by distress obtain money; if failing to find property, then Mr. Sherk would be confined thirty days in the county jail at Windsor.

We are happy to say that by far the greater majority of Mr. Sherk's neighbors are much opposed to such work. They say he is a quiet man and a good neighbor, and should be left alone.

The old plea, "It is the law of the land," was given as the reason for the prosecution. A spirit to persecute all who in any way deny the right of the State to enforce Sunday keeping by law, is strengthening here very rapidly. The Lord's Day Alliance people are determined to secure from the legislature laws that can be enforced. The principle here is the same as in the States, and must be met. Stormy times appear to be upon all who wish to obey God's law in Ontario. P. M. Hove.
