# The Presbyterian Assembly and Sunday.

The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church devoted the most of one day of their late session in Minneapolis, to the discussion of "Sabbath observance." A press report says that "In the discussion, the Sunday street car, the Sunday train and railroad excursion, the Sunday newspaper, the Sunday-working Presbyterian, and every form of activity not in harmony with the literal meaning of the fourth commandment, was condemned."

The committee on "Sabbath" resolutions in their report declared that "The American Christian Sabbath is in imminent peril; in fact, in many of our large cities and in other parts of our land it is already nearly lost. This means that American liberty and American institutions are in peril, for of these the American Sabbath has been both the foundation and the protection."

An attempt was made to substitute the words "Christian Sabbath" for "American Sabbath" in the resolutions; but it was defeated. Evidently, then, in the Presbyterian view, the Christian Sabbath and the "Americanan Sabbath" are two different institutions. This is an important admission.

"As adopted, the amendments deprecate the secularizing of the Sabbath, urge members and young people of the church to realize the importance of Sabbath observance, legislatures and congress are urged to protect the Sabbath, the American Sabbath Union and the Women's National Sabbath Alliance are commended, every pastor is recommended to preach on Sabbath observance on some Sabbath of next October and take a collection for the Sabbath Union; the board of publication is requested to prepare and Sabbath school superintendents to use a specific Sabbath-observance leaflet. Sympathy is expressed with 3,000,000 of Americans who, because of Sabbath desecration, are compelled to do secular work on the Sabbath. President McKinley's attention is respectfully called to the fact that employes of the postoffice and many other departments of the Government are compelled to work on Sunday."

If Sunday work is a sin, as the Presbyterians say, and 3,000,000 Americans are "compelled" to work on Sunday, it is clear that 3,000,000 Americans are compelled to sin; and being compelled to sin, they are of course not responsible for sinning. But do Presbyterians really believe in compulsory sin? What about the martyrs who went to the stake rather than violate their consciences? If they were not compelled to sin, is a man compelled to sin when a refusal only means the loss of a job?

When people work on the day they believe to be the Sabbath, instead of keeping it as they believe God has commanded, does not the principal fault lie in themselves?

The President has of course discernment enough to appreciate these truths; and therefore we imagine the appeal to him in behalf of these 3,000,000 in "involuntary servitude" will not have very much effect.
