RELIGIOUS statistics gathered in a number of the larger American cities show the following:—

The most Catholic city in the United States is Boston, with 218,000 Roman Catholics in its population—almost half of the whole. The largest Protestant body in the city is the Baptist, with 42,000 members.

Next comes New York City, with 455,000 Roman Catholics, which is 29 per cent. of the whole population. In Chicago the proportion is almost the same, the percentage of Catholics being 28.

In Philadelphia only 18 per cent. of the population is Roman Catholic. In Brooklyn the Catholics are 29 per cent. of the whole.

This does not mean that all the rest of the people in these cities are Protestants,—far from it. In New York City, it is stated, "the Baptists, Congregationalists, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and the Reformed churches combined do not quite equal the Roman Catholics."

"In Chicago we find the Lutherans leading all the Protestant bodies, but unable to match in numbers the Roman Catholics, without the addition of the Baptists, the Methodists, the Presbyterians, and the Episcopalians.

"In Philadelphia we find the Roman Catholics considerably exceeded by the Methodists and Baptists, or by the Presbyterians and the Episcopalians, united.

"In Brooklyn the Baptists, Lutherans, Methodists, and Presbyterians nearly equal the Romanists."
