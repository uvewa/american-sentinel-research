# The Post-Office and Sunday Closing in Arizona.

*Flagstaff, Arizona, May 18, 1899.*

**Editor American Sentinel:** Arizona is not noted for being over-religious; yet there are occasionally straws which show which way the wind is blowing. Ever since coming here the middle of last January I have noticed that the leading minister of one church could be seen most any Sunday morning with the crowd at the post office for his mail. A few Sundays ago he preached on Sabbath observance, and among other interesting topics told his hearers how the Lord commanded in the olden times that a man should be put to death for picking up sticks on Sunday. He did not spare the ball-players, and between the morning and evening service some one told him he did worse every Sunday than to play ball. He asked what it was, and was told that it was going to the post office after his mail.

So that night before commencing his sermon he told us about it, and said he had never considered it wrong; but inasmuch as others did he would do so no more, which of course was his privilege. The next Sunday at the morning service he read a petition to the post-master-general, asking that he would order this office closed on Sunday, and urged his congregation to sign it. At the close of the service I went at once to the post-office for my mail, and soon the church people came stringing in for theirs. I did not remain at the church to see how many signed the elder's petition, but no doubt some did who at once came for their mail.
