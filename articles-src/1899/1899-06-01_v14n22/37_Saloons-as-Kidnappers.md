ALL New York City and vicinity has been stirred for a week past over the kidnapping of a child and the ineffectual efforts of the police to discover the victim of the terrible crime, or its perpetrators. The case bids fair to rival in its tragic consequences the well-known case of Charley Ross.

Yet there are cases of kidnapping, in this city and elsewhere, which give the public little or no concern. The form of the crime—the manner in which it is executed—seems to make a great difference in the public mind. For are there not child kidnappers stationed at almost every corner in vast districts of our large cities? In other words, are not the saloons kidnappers of the young? Do they not fairly deserve this designation?

The saloons "must have boys." They cannot continue business on the old drunkards; these rapidly die off, and the supply of victims must be replenished from the children. Of course, the outward form of the boy remains; but his real self, once the saloon gets hold of him, disappears, swallowed up in a gulf of shame and debauchery, more hopelessly lost than was ever the innocent victim of brutal violence. And no offer is ever made of restoration to the despairing mother. Why should not this, like all other forms of kidnapping be prohibited?
