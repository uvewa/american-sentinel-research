## "Physician, Heal Thyself."

When the physician is himself afflicted with a malady similar to that of which he is anxious to cure the patient, propriety strongly suggests that he should give attention to himself first of all.

It is with this principle in mind that the *Savannah News* gives expression to the following:—

"The women of the country are filling the land with their protests to Congress against allowing the polygamous Roberts, of Utah, to take the seat in the House to which he has been elected. Would they not do the country an equal if not a greater service if they were to make an effort to have a uniform divorce law in this country, a law that would permit a divorce for one cause only, namely, adultery?

"In an interesting article on 'Divorce,' by Cardinal Gibbons, this statement is made:—

"The reckless facility with which divorce is procured in this country is an evil scarcely less deplorable than Mormonism. Indeed, it is in some respects more dangerous than the latter, for divorce has the sanction of the civil law, which Mormonism has not. Is not the law of divorce a virtual toleration of Mormonism in a modified form? Mormonism consists in simultaneous polygamy, while the law of divorce practically leads to successive polygamy."

"The cardinal points out in his article that there are twenty-two causes for divorce in this country, most of them of a very trifling character, and in some of the States the power of granting a divorce is left to the discretion of the judge."

It needs a clear eyesight to cast out motes from other eyes successfully.
