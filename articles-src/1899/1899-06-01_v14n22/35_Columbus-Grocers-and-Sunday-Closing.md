INTERESTING developments are reported from the effort of the Retail Grocers' Association of Columbus, Ohio, to close up all grocery stores on Sundays. From the Press-Post of that city we learn that the force of the association's efforts in this line has been transmitted to business places in general, but not with the result anticipated.

The smaller grocery stores were compelled to close on Sundays by the action of the Grocers' Association, and they sought redress by trying to close up stores in other lines of trade. But they did not reckon rightly on Judge Earnhart. When they brought the case of other Sunday business into court, Judge Earnhart told them they were not acting from any desire "to have the Sabbath day respected." and that he would dismiss all such cases that might be brought before him.

Of course, it is not consistent to compel one line of business to suspend Sundays and allow other lines to go on. But this Ohio judge evidently appreciates the unworthy motive which has lent itself to Sunday closing in this case. Sunday laws seem to be well adapted to the calling out of what is mean in human nature.
