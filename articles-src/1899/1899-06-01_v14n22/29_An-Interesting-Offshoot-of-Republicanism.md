## An Interesting Offshoot of Republicanism.

New York "World."

PRESIDENT SCHURMAN, the head of Mr. McKinley's Philippine Commission, has submitted the following scheme of government, of which the President cables his approval:—

"While the final decision as to the form of government is in the hands of Congress, the President, under his military powers, pending the action of Congress, stands ready to offer the following form of government:

'A Governor General to be appointed by the President; a cabinet to be appointed by the Governor-General; all the judges to be appointed by the President; the heads of departments and judges to be either Americans or Filipinos or both; and also a general advisory council, its members to be chosen by the people by a form of suffrage to be hereafter carefully determined upon.'

'The President earnestly desires that bloodshed cease and that the people of the Philippines at an early date enjoy the largest measure of self-government compatible with peace and order.'

This is a wide departure from the views expressed by President Schurman in a letter to the World on the 31st of August last:—

"This Republic, whose soul is self government, does not want Asiatic dependencies or the military despotism they would entail. The proximity of Cuba made its misgovernment our affair. But we are not called upon to rectify the tyrannies of Africa or Asia. Nor are we under any obligation to Aguinaldo and the insurgents. Let us keep to our own hemisphere, seeking only naval stations in the Old World."

This was wise, sane, American. The "form of government" now suggested for the Philippines is a combination of the Spanish and the English systems. There is nothing American about it. What is there in our Constitution or our history to warrant the appointment by the President of a "governor-general" of a possession 10,000 miles away, who in turn is to appoint a "cabinet" and to coöperate with judges, "all to be appointed by the President," in ruling 8,000,000 mongrels and barbarians?

The sole part of the Filipinos in the government of their islands is to be an "advisory council" whose advice the real rulers are under no obligation to take—chosen under a "form of suffrage" to be determined on by their conquerors. Is not this an interesting offshoot of republicanism?
