# "Humane" War.

**Archbishop Ireland** is quoted as saying with reference to the work of the peace congress now in session, that "at least to a large extent, war can be made humane, without either abhorring or stigmatizing the sword."

War will be made humane when it is so conducted as to injure no innocent person; for certainly the injury of innocent people cannot be called humane. But what will war be when it is reduced to such a degree of harmlessness? It will not be war at all. War cannot be made humane without losing its existence in the process.

The powers that be, which are ordained of God, bear the sword for the terror of evil doers; and this is the only proper place for the sword. In any other cause, the sword is always to be stigmatized and abhorred.
