## Works of Necessity.

The exemption clause in the Georgia Sunday law, "Works of necessity or charity only excepted," is subjected to an elasticity sufficient in interpretation to expose many glaring inconsistencies.

Recently A. J. Waters, a Seventh-day Adventist of Gainesville, Ga., who conscientiously observes Saturday as the Sabbath, was fined $20 and costs—about $65 in all,—or six months in the chain gang, for plowing in some wheat on Sunday. The spring was very wet, and the farmers had great difficulty in getting their crops in. This Sunday proved very favorable, and the defendant had a small corner of land on which the wheat had been sown but not covered, and it was necessary that it be covered before it sprouted. The weather was still very unsettled and this favorable opportunity was improved and the wheat was plowed in on Sunday morning just as two State witnesses were passing on their way rabbit hunting.

About this time on a Sunday a neighbor, who keeps that day, burned off his pasture land because "the wind was just right and the grass was dry." A great smoke was created, filling the nostrils of the church-goers who passed that way. Mr. Waters plowed his wheat in "because the land was sufficiently dry" on Sunday, and was seen by two hunters while he was doing the "criminal" act. The plowing was, in the court, decided to be a "misdemeanor," and the penalty of six months in the chain gang inflicted, while the burning off of the land passed by unnoticed and was therefore interpreted to be, when performed by certain parties, "works of necessity."

Mr. Waters has another neighbor who fires his lime kiln on Saturday nights and attends to it on Sundays. This is interpreted to be a work of necessity, while everybody knows the lime could be burned on the working days and nights of the week just as well. The man who entered the complaint before the grand jury against Mr. Waters for plowing in wheat on Sunday, works men every Sunday on the Southern railroad, and quite recently worked a gang of men all day Sunday repairing a side track that could have been done just as well on the Monday following. He was not indicted for this work, and it must be that such works are works of necessity or charity. The defendant was also condemned for cutting oats to feed a mule his Sunday dinner, and for sawing wood to build a fire. Each of these acts are common as sunshine in Georgia, and never considered to be other than works of necessity, when performed by those who keep Sunday.

These distinctions in persons doing the same class of work proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Sunday laws are special class legislation; and this excepting clause of all Sunday laws clearly betrays their true character. It brands them as wholly religious laws, and in forcing our courts to attempt an impossible discrimination upon "works of necessity or charity," the legislatures have made our civil courts deal with a question of religious faith and dogma. The courts are not only forced to examine into a question of religion, but they are plunged into a boundless uncertainty by these exempted "works of necessity or charity." Men of the same social equality often differ in their ideas of what is necessary for them or what is charity. The decision of a jury as to what is or is not necessary in a given case might work great hardship and injustice upon one man and affect another just the reverse. It is, and ever has been, and always will be as absolutely impossible for the courts to determine what works are necessary or charitable as to decide upon any rule of faith and practice and to inflict a penalty for its violation.
