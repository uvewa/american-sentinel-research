THE Russian government has decided upon further severe measures against the Jews. A decree has been promulgated which forbids all Jews, foreign or otherwise, stopping in St. Petersburg, and intense feeling against the Jews is manifested in many districts. Serious outbreaks as the result of this feeling occurred in connection with the Easter festivities, and at one place 5,000 rioters attacked the Jewish quarters, wrecking hundreds of houses and shops, and causing much bloodshed. All this suggests that the czar might well give his attention to the peace within his own domain before undertaking to establish peace between the nations.
