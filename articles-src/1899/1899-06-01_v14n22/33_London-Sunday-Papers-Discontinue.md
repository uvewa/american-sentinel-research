APPARENTLY in deference to public sentiment, the London papers which recently introduced seven-day journalism into England, have decided to discontinue their Sunday issues. This is the only legitimate way of fighting the Sunday newspapers, and if public sentiment can force the Sunday papers out of business here, the SENTINEL will not object.
