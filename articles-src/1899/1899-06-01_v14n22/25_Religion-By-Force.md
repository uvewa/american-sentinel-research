# Religion By Force.

"Pittsburg Dispatch."

There is food for reflection in the address of Dr. Radcliffe, Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly. Many of the able clergyman's points are well made and effective. It may be noted, however, that he is more at home in the spiritual field than in that of politics. He is an expansionist in religion, and on that account imagines he is a territorial expansionist also. The qualification for his attitude is in the assertion that: "Force has been the only argument of savages from Joshua to McKinley."

That is no part of the ethics of Christianity which the good doctor preaches. His faith is founded, if anywhere, in the life and example of the meek and lowly Nazarene, who taught the philosophy of the soft answer and the duty when smitten upon one cheek to "turn the other also."

Presbyterian expansion is not in the least objectionable, for [if] it consists in carrying the light of reason and the salve of mercy to those in need of both. Not so imperial expansion. What justifies the one absolutely condemns the other. There is neither Christianity or reason in the theory that it is just to hurry one unprepared soul into eternity in order to gain the opportunity to attempt the salvation of another by missionary effort. Dr. Radcliffe certainly does not mean to advocate any such theory though that is what an endorsement of imperialism means.
