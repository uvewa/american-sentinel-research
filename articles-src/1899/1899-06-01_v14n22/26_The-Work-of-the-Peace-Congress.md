# The Work of the Peace Congress.

The limitations which circumstances have imposed upon the work of the Peace Congress, now in session at the Hague, Holland, are outlined in the following from the New York Sun of May 14. As will be seen, there is now no expectation that the vision of general disarmament called up by the first announcement of the czar's purpose, will be at all realized through the work of the congress. The Sun says:

"As the time approaches for the assembling of the czar's disarmament conference the expectations of a practical outcome of any importance continue to diminish. A very simple but decisive fact justifies this view. The instructions which the delegates of all the great powers, with the exception of Russia, carry to The Hague, while of course secret in all details, embody a virtual prohibition against the acceptance of any radical proposal for changing the present international relationship. The policy of diplomatic machinery will remain unaltered and the game of beggar your neighbor between European nations will probably not receive any serious check.

"The general impression in diplomatic circles is that the practical work of the conference will be limited to a revision of the Geneva Convention and within these narrow limits most of the delegates will probably be glad to discuss proposals to further eliminate the unnecessary cruelties of war. Nothing whatever is now heard of the talk of a general disarmament which was rife when the czar's rescript was issued. It is expected that there will be considerable discussion of two or three plans for arbitration and mediation. But the fact that such large class question are wholly outside the province of arbitration has almost destroyed all hope of the possibility of devising a workable scheme.

"It is generally admitted that it is Germany which has demonstrated with brutal frankness in advance of the meeting the futility of the czar's scheme to remodel human nature by fiat or even international conference. The German publicists of all parties have been pointing out with scarcely courteous emphasis, first that arbitration is impossible on any question involving national honor, and second that the country concerned is the sole judge of whether even a subordinate question is identified with such honor. It is such questions which almost invariably lead to war. Even the Times [London] in a cold-blooded but sound argument to-day indorses this view, saying, 'No form of words and no agreements will prevent men from resisting to the utmost when their honor or their gravest interests are touched. The best devised measures in such circumstances are as little efficacious against the perils of war as the armlets worn by the superstitious as guards against disease.'"
