THE peace congress which is now convened at the Hague, holds its sessions behind closed doors, and it is rumored that all is not peaceful even in the proceedings of this body. No plan for disarmament is expected to result from the congress, but it is hoped an impetus will be given to the project of establishing an international board of arbitration, to which all disputes between the powers may be referred.
