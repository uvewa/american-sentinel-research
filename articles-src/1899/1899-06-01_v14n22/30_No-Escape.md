## "No Escape."

"New York Press" Correspondent.

One of the sights of New York: About as many Irishmen as Italians are hired to tear up 125th Street for the underground trolley. On Wednesday I happened to be near Eighth Avenue as the hands were being paid off. Half a dozen or more Sisters of Charity formed a hollow square around them, and not a guilty man escaped their silent importunity. The Italians, however, without opening their envelopes, jammed the pay in pocket and ran as hard as they could till well out of reach. The Irishmen, without a growl or grumble that could be heard, went to the slaughter with the same courage that carried them under O'Neill to the destruction of the English at the battle of Benburb. Every man gave his tithe and felt blessed.
