A PECULIAR sentence, says a dispatch in the Sun, of this city, has been passed by the mayor of Bowling Green, O., upon an unruly boy in that city. For some misdemeanor of which he had been guilty, he was arraigned before the mayor, who sentenced him to attend Sunday school and church at the Disciple house of worship for eight weeks, with the alternative of going to jail for twenty days. We greatly fear the youthful culprit will not be helped by compulsory attendance at church. But the mayor's action is suggestive of the existence in some minds at least, of the idea that compulsory attendance at church would be good for people, and might be a means of reforming society.
