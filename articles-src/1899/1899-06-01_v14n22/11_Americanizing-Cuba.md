THE leading journals in Havana see many omens of coming absorption into the American Union. They complain that the American military forces "are modifying our customs," and "reforming our cities and courts according to their own ideas. They are supplanting our manners of life with their own."

It is only to be expected that the American forces will not give up their own ideas and manner of life, and that if they remain long in Cuba American methods and ideas will be strongly impressed upon that country, and that in course of time Cuba would become thoroughly Americanized and gravitate naturally and inevitably into the Union. It is this that Cubans who wish for independence have most to fear.
