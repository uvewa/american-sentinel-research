Notice.

THE International Religious Liberty Association has moved its headquarters from this city to Chicago, but the AMERICAN SENTINEL remains at its old address—39 Bond St., New York City. All business relating to the AMERICAN SENTINEL should be sent to this address. Do not send it to Chicago. For the present the AMERICAN SENTINEL will continue to be published in New York.
