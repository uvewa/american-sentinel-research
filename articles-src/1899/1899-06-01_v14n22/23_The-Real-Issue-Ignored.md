# The Real Issue Ignored.

A religious exchange published in London, Eng., points out that the real question in the controversy over Sunday journalism is not touched in the argument of the religious press:—

> "The comments of the religious press on the subject of seven-day journalism, continue to display a persistent misunderstanding of the real question at issue. The *Christian* says:—
>
> "The crusade against the *Mail* and *Telegraph* in their endeavor to force Sunday journalism on an unwilling community is steadily gathering strength."
>
> "One would think that people were being compelled to buy Sunday papers when they did not want them. It would be just as reasonable to say that beer-drinking was forced upon an unwilling community. Probably the greatest harm that is being done in the whole business is the general promulgation by religious teachers of the idea that men cannot be expected to stand out for what they believe to be right, unless circumstances favor such an attitude."
