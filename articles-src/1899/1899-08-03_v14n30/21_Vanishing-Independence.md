The following press dispatch gives interesting information relative to the plan of determining the future status of Cuba by ballot:—

"WASHINGTON, July 25.—If present Administration plans are carried out, the voters of Cuba, after the census is taken, will be asked to express through the ballot their preference for one of three forms of government—absolute independence, a protectorate, or annexation.

"There will be such restrictions upon the franchise as to obtain the judgment of the better classes.

"In the meantime the President will prepare recommendations to Congress relative to the final disposition of Cuba."

Thus independence is only one of three alternatives set before the Cuban people; and the franchise is to be restricted, so that only the "better class" shall have a voice in making the decision.

And yet it has been solemnly declared by the highest authority of the nation that "the people of Cuba [all of them] are, and of right ought to be, free and independent."
