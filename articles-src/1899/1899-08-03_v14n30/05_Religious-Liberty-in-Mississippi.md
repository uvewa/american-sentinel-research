The people of Mississippi are ordinary mortals, not worse by nature than other people on this earth; but they are unfortunate enough to have a law on their statute books requiring the strict observance of Sunday. This law is of long standing and for many years has been a dead letter, except that some of the industries of the State have been in a measure laid aside on the day called the "Christian Sabbath." Individuals have disregarded the day by chopping wood, hunting game, fishing, etc.

A few years ago, there appeared in the State of Mississippi a people known as Seventh-day Adventists. These people believe the seventh day of the week, or Saturday, is the Sabbath, and their practise is in harmony with their belief. No sooner had these people become known and their religious views come to the good people of the communities in which they live, than they also called to mind the fact that Mississippi had a Sabbath and a Sabbath law, and that it must be enforced. Some of the religious people of the State began at once to exercise a watchcare over the Adventists, fearing that in their zeal to obey the law of their God they would forget the law of the sovereign State of Mississippi. It was not long before they were astonished by the sight of the pastor of the Adventist community out in his garden early one Sunday morning going through certain motions in his morning recreation that was conjectured to be manual labor performed in violation of the statute and "against the peace and dignity of the State of Mississippi."

The minister, Elder R. S. Owen, was accordingly arrested and arraigned before a magistrate on the day he observed as the Sabbath; but a continuance was secured to a later date and the trial fixed to take place on another day of the week. The officer who went to make the arrest of Elder Owen arrived just as he was going into the pulpit to preach to his people, and to the credit of the officer he remained until the close of the service before requiring the minister to accompany him.

The 19th of July was the date fixed for the trial, and at the hour of 10 o'clock A. M., the court was called to order and the case of the State of Mississippi against R. S. Owen was called and the accused was asked to plead guilty or not guilty. The minister refused to plead guilty of any crime against the State of Mississippi, and the trial proceeded. The magistrate having given evidence of a strong desire to uphold the dignity of the law and make an example of the man who dared to be so presumptuous, Elder Owen decided to avail himself of his privilege to be tried by a jury. The jury was soon secured and the examination of witnesses began. Several men testified to having seen defendant in his garden very early on a certain Sunday morning, and that they could see the motions of his body as if he was hoeing; but none could say that he had a hoe in his hand. None could testify positively as to what kind of work he was engaged in, but all believed he was hoeing; several testified to the general good character of the defendant.

After the testimony was in, Elder Owen occupied an hour presenting his case, and laying before the jury the binding obligation of the divine law and the fact that the constitutions of the United States and of the State of Mississippi were not in conflict with the law of Jehovah, and that the God of nations had decreed that men should be free in all matters involving his worship and the honor of his name. All were impressed with the boldness and power with which he spake and many were visibly moved.

At the close of Elder Owen's presentation the jury retired for deliberation and in about twenty minutes returned with a verdict "Not guilty." This was indeed a surprise in view of the powerful influence wielded by some influential church members in favor of severe measures in dealing with the Adventist people; but it was evident that many of the better informed people rejoiced at the result of the trial. By another class the jurymen were upbraided for their want of loyalty to the laws of the state, but they replied that in case of a conflict between the law of the land and the law of God they preferred to be loyal to God.

Before the close of Elder Owen's trial another member of the Adventist community was arrested on a warrant charging him with violating the Sunday law. This time it was Josiah Nash, and his trial was set for the 21st of July, although a very strong effort was made to bring him to trial on the 22nd, Saturday, the day observed by Nash as the Sabbath.

The failure of the jury in the case of Elder Owen to convict seemed to add to the determination of the prosecutors to secure a conviction in the case of Mr. Nash, and accordingly they secured the services of a good Methodist lawyer and scoured the country for those willing to testify against the defendant, and several were found.

With the day of trial came people from all parts of the country, for the news had spread far and near. Mr. Nash also elected to be tried by a jury, which was soon secured, and the trial began. One witness testified that on a certain Sunday morning early in the month of last March he was awakened from his sleep at the early hour of four o'clock by sounds as of some one chopping wood; he arose and dressed himself and went into his yard and saw his neighbor Nash hewing on a log in a new house he was building. From other testimony it appeared that it was very dark at that hour, and that the new house was twenty-five or thirty rods away with woods between the two points, and that the witness—an old man—was possessed of very defective sight and hearing; and this was the only witness that testified to seeing the defendant at labor on Sunday; but several others had heard suspicious sounds that they had reason to believe emanated from the premises of Mr. Nash, and indicated that he was laboring.

Mr. Nash secured the services of Mr. Burkett, an attorney of the town of Amory, who was a member of the Baptist denomination. Mr. Nash made a short statement setting forth the fact that he did not regard Sunday as sacred, but he did recognize the binding obligation of the divine law requiring the seventh day to be sacred.

It was a unique spectacle to witness a follower of John Wesley on one side contending for the majesty of the law upholding the Puritan Sunday, and a follower of Roger Williams on the other side pleading for liberty of conscience and the right to worship God according to its dictates. These laws that have come to us as a heritage from Puritan days are responsible for such scenes as above described; for they afford an opportunity for the display of religious bigotry always present in the hearts of false professors.

The jury in the case of Nash was out but a short time when they returned with a verdict of "Not guilty." Thus was demonstrated the fact that the spirit of liberty has not died out of all men in the State of Mississippi, and if we can rely upon the expressions of many leading citizens of the place as an indication of the sentiment of thinking in that State, they would rejoice to see this relic of the days of religious rule blotted from the statute books of the State.

Let the good work of education go on until all can see that these State Sunday laws are antagonistic to our free institutions and subversive of the liberties of our people.
