When the Peace Conference assembled at The Hague, its ostensible purpose was to bring about a limitation of military armaments. It was also proposed that war should be to a considerable extent averted by making arbitration compulsory in certain cases. A further suggestion was made that the evils of war might be sensibly mitigated if private property at sea should be exempted from capture. Not one of these proposals has been adopted.

The protocol in which the results attained by the conference are set forth includes, besides some expressions of opinions and wishes which are binding upon nobody, three conventions and three declarations. Not even these conventions and declarations are obligatory upon any country until they have been ratified by its treaty making power, which, in the case of the United States, comprehends not only the executive but two-thirds of the Senate. It is certain that two-thirds of the senators will not sanction the third of the three declarations, and it is probable that they will refuse assent to the other two.

To this third declaration, which prohibits the use of bullets that will expand easily in the human body, the American delegates at The Hague refused to subscribe on the ground that their instructions forbade them to agree to anything that would be likely to trammel the development of American inventive genius in warfare. The United States Senate will probably hold that the spirit of their instructions should have impelled them also to decline assent to the second and third declarations, which prohibit the throwing of projectiles or explosives from balloons, and the use of projectiles having for their sole object the diffusion of asphyxiating gases. It is manifestly no more inhuman to annihilate an enemy by explosives dropped from balloons than it is to accomplish the same work by explosives discharged from cannon or mortars. Neither is it any more inhuman to put a hostile force hors de combat by gas than it is to effect the same result by volleys of musketry or by artillery. It is conceived that, in the event of a war between the United States and a European coalition, we might be forced to rely for self defense upon the superiority of inventive genius applied to the work of wholesale destruction. All three of the declarations would be found in practise to benefit those nations which are backward in respect of civilization, while they would fetter those which are capable of making continual improvements in the art of war.

Of the three conventions, the second and third are of only trivial significance. By the second, the laws and customs of war on land are modified but in a few details, and, by the third, the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1864 are made but partially applicable to naval warfare, the profound differences between military operations on land and those at sea rendering it obviously impossible to go far in that direction. It is only the first convention for which any considerable importance is claimed. This purports to provide for the pacific settlement of international disputes. All it does, however, is to establish a permanent board of arbitrators, to which international litigants may submit their controversies, if they choose. Nations, of course, have always been at liberty to arbitrate their quarrels, and it is probable that hereafter, when they have recourse to such an expedient, they will prefer a tribunal immediately and directly appointed *ad hoc*, in the composition of which each of the litigants has had an equal hand, to a standing tribunal with the selection of whose members they have had much less to do.

The chances are, therefore, that the members of the permanent tribunal contemplated by the conference will enjoy a sinecure. An attempt, indeed, is made to assure to them a certain amount of business by article 27 of the protocol, which makes it the duty of all the cosignatory powers to recommend a recourse to the tribunal whenever two nations seem upon the point of settling a dispute by war. If such a recommendation is to be other than perfunctory, if it is to imply a threat to compel by force a resort to arbitration, it is plain that the United States Senate will never accept the article in question. On the one hand, our assent to that article might bind us to take part in an armed intervention for the purpose of averting a European war. On the other hand, it would estop us from objecting to an armed intervention on the part of European powers for the purpose of averting a war in the New World. It is suggestive that article 27 was proposed by France, which, it is well known, would have witnessed gladly a joint interposition on the part of European powers to forbid the recent war between the United States and Spain.

On the whole, we are unable to see that this conference, which was called for the ostensible purpose of assuring international peace, has succeeded in taking any effective measures for the end proposed.
