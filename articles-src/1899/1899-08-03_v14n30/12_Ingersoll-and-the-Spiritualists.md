Almost immediately following the death of the noted agnostic, Robert G. Ingersoll, the announcement was made in the papers that his "spirit" had appeared and communicated with a Spiritualist "medium" at a "seance" held in this city. This was the claim made by the Spiritualists, and it is seldom that a noted man dies these days without an announcement following from the Spiritualists that his "spirit" has made its way directly to some Spiritualist shrine for the purpose of communicating again with the world.

That there are multitudes of people—in fact almost the whole religious world—who believe in individual consciousness after death, is one of the strangest facts known in the nineteenth century. Without any support in either reason or revelation—in the face, indeed, of all the testimony which these give—this doctrine is held by people who claim to make reason and revelation their sole guides. But it is not strange that such a belief should arise and prevail in the heathen world; and from heathenism it has found its way within the fold of the church.

The doctrine asserts that every human being possesses an immortal soul, or spirit, which is the real thinking and emotional part of the individual, and which at death is released from its mortal tenement, and enters upon the freedom and higher knowledge of the spirit life. This "immortal" intangible intelligence however loses all consciousness when the individual goes to sleep or is "knocked senseless" by a blow. At such times it knows absolutely nothing. Yet the functions of the bodily organs are at such times only partially suspended. A partial cessation in the action of the bodily machinery producing total unconsciousness on the part of the "soul," what then must follow when the machinery is stopped completely?—Oh, then at once the "soul" is not only conscious, but knows more than it ever did before!

Drowned persons have been brought back to life and consciousness after all organic action in the body had ceased; yet in no case of the kind did the individual know anything at all after consciousness was lost until his resuscitation. The Saviour, during his ministry on the earth, raised many persons from the dead, but not one of them had anything to reveal of spirit life and knowledge after death. Lazarus was raised to life after he had been dead four days; yet he said nothing about his "spirit" having been summoned down from heaven or from any other place to reincarnate his earthly body. If the soul is naturally immortal, furthermore, it must always have existed somewhere; yet nobody ever lived whose recollections extended back beyond the time of his birth.

THUS reason and the testimony of facts stamp this doctrine as both false and absurd; and the plain testimony of revelation also is, "The dead know not anything." Eccl. 9:5. See also Job 14:10-12; Ps. 146:3, 4; Isa. 8:19.

THIS Spiritualist doctrine of continued life and consciousness and higher knowledge after death, is a central pillar in the structure of the papacy, and thus it is evident that despite the professed antagonism between the trio, Spiritualism and the papal religion are closely related. It is the vital doctrine in both. And as the papal religion also stands for a union of church and state, it is plain that these two doctrines are neither strangers nor enemies. That this fact will appear even more plainly in the near future, we fully believe.
