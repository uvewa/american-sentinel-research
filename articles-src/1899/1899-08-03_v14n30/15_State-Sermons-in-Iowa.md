THE State of Iowa has fixed the price of sermons delivered in the State institutions at $3 each. Some of the clergy say this price is too little, and at Marshalltown, where several such institutions are located, they have organized for the purpose of enforcing a demand of $5 per sermon. Governor Larrabee and other members of the Board of Control, it is reported, declare that they will do the preaching at such places themselves rather than accede to the clergymen's demand.

A bill has been passed in Michigan which makes it a crime for an individual to teach the doctrine of polygamy in that State.

Efforts made by the clergy of Fort Wayne, Ind., to abolish Sunday ball playing, have not been greatly successful. A clergyman who visited a game disguised, to get evidence against the players, was discovered and ejected from the grounds. The city officials are indifferent in the matter.
