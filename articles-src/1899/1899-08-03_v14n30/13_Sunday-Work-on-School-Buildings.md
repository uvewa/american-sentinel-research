THE Central Federated Union of this city has taken action against Sunday work. It being noticed that Sunday work was being done on several school buildings in process of erection, a committee of the union called on the Police Board to request that such work be stopped. They were told that it was not in the province of the Police Board to act in the matter, but that they might see a magistrate and get out warrants.
