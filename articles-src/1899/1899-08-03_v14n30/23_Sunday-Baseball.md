The general situation as regards the conflict between Sunday baseball and the movement for Sunday enforcement, is thus summarized by *The Outlook*:—

"The question of Sunday baseball is attracting widespread discussion. The playing of Sunday games, both professional and amateur, in certain cities of the Middle West, like St. Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, with a consequently larger attendance than on any week day, has led to the attempt to start similar forms of athleticism (and financial gain) on Sunday in other cities. In some of these the attempt has been notably checked—in the case of Cleveland, for instance; in other cities, like Pittsburg, the introduction of Sunday baseball has been permitted. New York State is now the battle ground between the opposing forces. Interesting cases have been brought before the courts of three cities—Brooklyn, Buffalo, and Dunkirk. The Brooklyn case has resulted in a complete estoppel put upon Sunday baseball in the Borough of Queens. In the Buffalo case, while the police-court jury had decided that no offense had been committed, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, reviewing the case on appeal, held that ball cannot be legally played on Sunday, as manifestly violating the penal code of the State. The Court added that the legislature has authority to protect the Christian Sabbath from desecration by such laws as it shall deem necessary, and it is sole judge of the acts proper to be prohibited with a view to the public peace of that day. In the Dunkirk case, however, the police court jury rendered a similar verdict to that of the first jury in the Buffalo case. The Dunkirk case may now go before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court."
