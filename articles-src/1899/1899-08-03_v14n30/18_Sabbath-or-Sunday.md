**EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:** At Chilhowie Park near Knoxville, Tenn, the Traction Company is giving vaudeville shows on Sundays, under the name of sacred concerts. The ministry of the city are violently opposing these theatrical exhibitions as desecatory of their Sabbath(sic) or Sunday.

Among the leaders in the opposition is Rev. Dr. Neighbors, pastor of the Broad Street Methodist Church. The reporter that wrote him up in the *Knoxville Journal and Tribune* quotes him as saying: "That he would speak only to one class of people,—sensible, upright, reasonable people." Then he took up one by one the ten commandments, and reading them, asked the congregation if they were of use in this century.

Taking up the commandment, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," the reporter says the doctor reasoned as follows: "How is it that a certain class of people think they can strike out the fourth commandment at their discretion and not be punished? More stress is laid on this commandment than upon any other. The Lord says remember the Sabbath day. Already he had told his people that the Sabbath day was sacred, and he tells them again in this commandment to remember to keep it holy. So the men who desecrate the Sabbath are guilty in the same degree as those who violate the remaining nine commandments."

The doctor then quoted the State law, which punishes for breaking Sunday, or the first day of the week, and showed that some actions of attaches of Chilhowie Park were infractions upon this law. The gentleman concluded his discourse with denunciatory remarks about the management of the park, for permitting performances there on Sundays. The above is quoted bodily to show the want of logic and truth.

The "sensible and reasonable" people are told that Sunday is the Sabbath, when the very commandment the doctor attempts to quote tells him that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

The "sensible and reasonable" people would like to ask if Doctor Neighbors is not breaking the Sabbath when he teaches this congregation to keep Sunday holy, when neither the commandment he quotes nor any of the scriptures says anything about the sacredness of the first day of the week. "Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." Matt. 5:20. "But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." Matt. 15:9.
