**EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:** During the progress of my trial on the 19th of July, papers were made out, and Josiah Nash, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was arrested, on the charge of having labored on Sunday, March 5, 1899, "against the peace and dignity of the State of Mississippi." He was bound over to appear at court July 21, at 10 A. M. The next day, July 20, the officer was out in our neighborhood scouring the country in search of witnesses to prove our brother's guilt, and it was on the next day after the arrest that our neighbor Mr. Fugua first learned that he was prosecutor in the case.

That night our little band of Sabbath keepers assembled in the church at Hatley, to unite in seeking God's blessing and guidance in the ordeal through which we were again to pass. Our enemies had appeared chagrined after their defeat the day before and seemed more determined in their next attempt. They went around with a subscription paper to raise $2.50 to hire a lawyer who had promised for that amount he would convict the prisoner. The next morning witnessed two processions coming into the town of Amory; first, the instigators of the prosecution and their witnesses, and second the band of Adventists with their brother in bonds. At Amory we had to wait till 2 P. M. before all the witnesses were secured.

While waiting for the court to sit the prosecuting lawyer came to me expressing great sympathy and love for the Advent people. They were a good people and he did not want to make them trouble. "Now," said he, "I have a proposition to make, if you will promise to respect our Sabbath from this time on I will get this case dismissed." I told him I could not answer for others, they could do as they chose, but I could not entertain such a proposition. He soon found that no one else was willing to compromise in such a matter.

We could not respect a counterfeit sabbath that had been born of paganism, christened by the papacy, and was now usurping the authority of the fourth commandment and seeking to trample the true Sabbath into the dust. No! As much as we prize our liberties, we prefer the prison or the chain gang with a clear conscience to the slavery of the soul.

The hour of trial came at last, and a crowd were assembled under the same oaks where I had been tried. A jury was chosen and witnesses were duly sworn, who testified that Brother Nash had been heard and seen working on his new log house early in the morning on Sunday, the 5th of March, hewing the sides of the logs.

The prosecuting lawyer read the law and gave us his advice about keeping the law of the land. "You may cry persecution," said he, "and talk about the martyrs of the past ages; but we are living in an age of progress and we have got where men are smart enough to tell other men what to do, and they have got it to do." "These people have got to obey our laws or leave the country." Our brother was assisted in the defense by a friendly lawyer who spoke in behalf of the principles of religious liberty, reading from the constitutions of our State and nation, and also presenting the claims of the fourth commandment; after which the jury retired, and in about ten minutes returned with a verdict of "Not guilty."

*Hatley, Miss.*
