It is a significant fact in the present development of our national policy that imperialism and plutocracy should at the same time assume such immense proportions and boldly assert their authority. The sudden change in public sentiment, is to many, a mystery. Only a few months since a prominent New York journal, in speaking of our course with the Filipinos, said that this Government's position was only taken for the purpose of teaching them how to govern themselves, and then withdrawing as great, noble, and unselfish promoters of civilization.

But now in the same editorial columns we read: "Already our views about our destiny and our place among the nations of earth have been substantially altered by the novel experience of dealing with distant possessions." And again: "If we are convinced that we can make new markets for our goods and products by taking a hand at reclamation, we shall speedily discard our policy of isolation and forget our fears of the consequences of entanglements." Phlebothrony was the garb under which the war began, but now our political standing and commercial interests are openly avowed as reasons for its continuance.

It was in the "interests of humanity" that the United States entered Cuba, and it is now only natural that the Cubans should begin to inquire when our troops shall be withdrawn from their island. In speaking of this the *New York Tribune*, of July 24th, says that we "cannot agree to relinquish our control one year or one day before Cuba is ready to govern herself in accordance with the American standard of civilization." It then adds in the words of the song: "It may be for years and it may be forever." Doubtless it will be "forever" since in America's estimation no other people have reached or ever will fully reach the "American standard of civilization."

Froude states the truth when he says, "If there be one lesson which history clearly teaches, it is this, that free nations cannot govern subject provinces." This lesson, together with the principle "that all men are created equal," is fast fading from memory. As with vice, so with covetousness and conquest,—

"Seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace."

*Herkimer, N. Y.*
