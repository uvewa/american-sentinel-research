THE theory of republican government is, "government by consent of the governed." That was the principle upon which the republic of the United States was reared. But in going abroad to initiate republicanism, or rather to enforce it, it is found to be expedient to vary the initiative somewhat from the manner in vogue when that form of government was inaugurated at home. For instance, a press despatch from Manila informs us that—

"General Lawton and Professor Worcester, of the commission, visited the principal towns in the province of Cavite, out of which the natives were recently driven. Their chief purpose was to direct the election of the presidents of Imus, Bacor, Paranaque, and Las Pinas. Under the municipal system thus inaugurated, the presidents or the mayors of the towns are empowered to appoint their own minor officials and to levy taxes, which are to be expended solely in public improvements. Before acting General Lawton and Mr. Worcester had consulted with the leading men in each town and selected candidates whose honesty and friendliness to American rule were beyond question. Wherever they went the Americans were heartily cheered by the people."

That is to say, there were held popular elections in several towns under a republican government, but a government civil official accompanied by an army officer went around to those towns and selected the candidates. It would be interesting to know what would have happened had these candidates been defeated. But the republicanism which has been exported to the Philippines is of the same character as that now produced at home—not the original quality. Therefore the masses are supposed to be led by their political bosses. The only difference is, that in the Philippines the idea is carried to the logical end—dictation by the general government, backed by the army.

From the standpoint of a mere conqueror, the elections in those Philippine towns were just what would naturally be expected; the modus operandi was the logic of necessity. But to hold them up as incidents in the inauguration of a republican government is sheer political irony.
