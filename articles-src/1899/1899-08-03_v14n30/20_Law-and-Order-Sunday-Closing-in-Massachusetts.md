At Revere, Mass., a crusade against Sunday secular business has been started by the Revere Law and Order League. Thus far one person—a woman who sold groceries on Sunday—has been arrested, and a summons to appear in court served on a barber who refused to close his shop in accordance with the dictates of the League.

There are eight barber shops in Revere, and all but one of them have been closed Sundays since the League began to take action to enforce Sunday observance. The proprietor of this one was waited on by a committee of the League, but very properly told them he did not recognize the authority of a Law and Order League to dictate his conduct in the matter of Sunday observance. He did however promise to close on Sunday if ordered to do so by the chief of police; but the chief of police did not see fit to give him the order.

The League will now proceed against him by direct appeal to the courts.

It is strange that a company of intelligent men organized to promote law and order, should think that this end can be furthered by making people idle on Sunday. Good honest work is an excellent barrier against the spirit of disorder in people, and when this employment is changed for idleness, the spirit of disorder is sure to make itself felt. If men will not be religious on Sunday, and occupy themselves with spiritual devotions and exercises—if they are to be merely idle because they have no regard for the church—it is far better that they should devote the hours of the day to honest work; and this would be true even if Sunday were the divinely-appointed Sabbath.
