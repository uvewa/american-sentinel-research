FOLLOWING the outcry against Sunday papers in England's metropolis, by which that innovation was suppressed, a movement has been started to enforce an old act of King George IV., which prohibited baking bread on Sunday. Report says the question has been taken up by parliament, and that the Prince of Wales "no longer permits hot rolls to be served at Marlborough House on Sunday morning as has hitherto been the custom." An exchange remarks that "this is large and comprehensive statesmanship!"
