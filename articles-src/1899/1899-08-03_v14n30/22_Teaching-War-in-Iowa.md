The following, taken from an Iowa journal, shows how instruction in the art of making war is being added to the regular course of study in the public schools in that State:—

"BOYS: On recommendation of the commander of the department of Iowa, G. A. R., I have been appointed by the commander in chief of the national department of the Grand Army of the Republic, special aide in charge of military instruction in public schools, for Iowa.

"I have assumed the duties and responsibilities of the position in the earnest hope of encouraging the boys of Iowa, especially those attending the public schools, to organize themselves at once and without delay, into military companies under the guidance and direction of their teachers, for the purpose of military instruction, such as drilling in the manual of arms, marching, squad and company drill, the position of a soldier, the salute to the flag and the various evolutions in military instruction belonging to the school of the soldier.

"In many instances your teachers will be qualified to drill and instruct you, and will feel it not simply duty, but a pleasure to do so.

"There is also in every city, town and village in the State veterans of the civil war, or young men who have served in the Spanish-American war, who are very competent and will take pleasure in aiding you to acquire such a knowledge of military tactics as would enable you, in a short time, to elect your officers from members of your company, who would be competent to drill the company in all the evolutions of military tactics.

"S. A. MOORE, Special Aide."
