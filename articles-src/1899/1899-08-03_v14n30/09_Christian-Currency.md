A petition based upon the idea that the United States and Christianity are moving hand in hand in the earth, and which is a very common idea to-day, is to come before the next Congress. Its nature is set forth in the following from the *Buffalo Evening News*:—

"A novel currency reform is proposed by Mrs. Ella May Clemmons, of New York City, a sister of Mrs. Howard Gould. She is going to ask the next Congress to have all the coins made during the first year of the new century bear on their faces the likeness of Christ, and on the reverse side the crucifix. 'Christianity has made America,' says Mrs. Clemmons, 'and to-day is pushing her onward. In gratitude to God, we, as a nation, should the first year of the new century, have stamped on all our coins the e of the Redeemer. American coins are stamped with the benefactors of the country. Why not one year's coins be stamped with the image of the Great Benefactor of a'l mankind?'

Upon which the *News* appropriately comments:—

"No doubt a writ of reverence prompts the suggestion—but it is doubtful if Christianity would be advanced or reverence and gratitude promoted by mixing up coinage and religion. There is a New Testament record of the raising of a similar issue. The Redeemer himself advised keeping such matters separate. 'Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's,' was his verdict when the question of the superscription on a coin was mentioned. There may be such a thing as making the symbols of religion too common. They serve a definite purpose in their place."

At a recent meeting of veterans of the Cuban war, in Havana, a committee was appointed to present a memorial to the Washington Government, asking that the United States make formal declaration of its intentions and supposed rights based upon the resolution passed by Congress in April, 1898, declaring that "the people of Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free and independent." The Cubans are getting tired of waiting for their promise. Independence.
