The *New York Journal* is a staunch upholder of the policy of "expansion;" yet it admits that under it human slavery exists to-day in the Hawaiian Islands. It publishes the following statement of the facts:—

"SAN FRANCISCO, July 24.—The contract laborers of the Hawaiian Islands are slaves and serfs in fact and in name. Police run them down should they attempt to escape, and district magistrates promptly convict them for deserting contract service.

"A tall flagstaff arises above Oahu prison, at Honolulu. Upon the pennant that floats from it is emblazoned a bloodhound, trailing. That device tells the fate that awaits the contract laborers who may try to escape from their dungeons.

"Thirty six Galicians—contract laborers—are now within the walls. Their imprisonment is in direct conflict with the Constitution and the laws of the United States. The flag floats above Honolulu, but the banner of the trailing bloodhound, and not the Stars and Stripes, indicates the law of the land.

"When these imprisoned laborers contracted at Bremen to work upon the Oahu Company's plantations, they signed a document printed in three languages, which provided that each laborer and wife and family should be provided with free steerage passage from Bremen to Honolulu, lodgings at Honolulu, and transportation to the plantation.

"The laborer must take the work assigned him, and his wages are fixed at $18 a month of twenty six days' labor. A day's labor is ten hours' actual work on the plantation, or twelve hours in the field. Time taken for rest is deducted from the day's hours. A schedule of wages for male and female children, ranging from forty cents to twenty five cents a day, is attached to each contract."
