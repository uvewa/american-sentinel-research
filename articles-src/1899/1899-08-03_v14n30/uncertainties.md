# Uncertainties — v14n30, August 3, 1899

## Article 04: "Destiny, The Inexorable Logic of Events, No. 2" — John D. Bradley

- **Location:** Page 4, main body of historian quotation
- **Issue:** The word "unmished" appears in the OCR (". . . who have learnt from experience the real tendencies of things, unmished by superficial differences"). This is almost certainly an OCR error for "uninfluenced" or "unmixed." The phrase "unmixed by superficial differences" is a plausible reading of the historical prose style.
- **Transcribed as:** "unmished" (preserving OCR as-is, as the original printed word cannot be verified from OCR alone)
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR artifact; likely "unmixed" or "uninfluenced" in the original print
- **Reason:** Cannot correct without access to original scan; flagged for verification

- **Location:** Page 4, same quotation, closing passage
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "the roar of the ngry billows." The word "ngry" is clearly an OCR fragment of "angry."
- **Transcribed as:** "ngry" (preserved as found in OCR)
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR fragment; original almost certainly reads "angry billows"
- **Reason:** Flagged for correction against original scan

## Article 09: "Christian Currency"

- **Location:** Page 7, Mrs. Clemmons quotation
- **Issue:** OCR reads "have stamped on all our coins the e of the Redeemer." The word "e" is a fragment; context strongly suggests "image" ("the image of the Redeemer"), matching the preceding sentence about coin imagery.
- **Transcribed as:** "the e of the Redeemer" (preserving OCR fragment)
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR drop-out; almost certainly "the image of the Redeemer"
- **Reason:** Flagged for verification against original scan

- **Location:** Same quotation, closing line
- **Issue:** OCR reads "the image of the Great Benefactor of a'l mankind." The "a'l" is a broken OCR rendering of "all."
- **Transcribed as:** "a'l mankind" (preserving OCR as-is)
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR artifact; almost certainly "all mankind"
- **Reason:** Flagged for correction against original scan

## Author Attribution Notes

- **John D. Bradley** (article 04): The byline reads "BY JOHN D. BRADLEY." This name does not appear in the known authors list. Attribution preserved as explicit; initials not assigned as he is not a known Sentinel staff writer. Likely a contributed article.
- **Allen Moon** (article 05): The byline reads "BY ALLEN MOON." Not in the known authors list. Likely a contributed article or correspondent from Mississippi.
- **Roy F. Cottrell** (article 06): The byline reads "BY ROY F. COTTRELL." This is likely the same person as R. F. Cottrell (RFC) listed in known authors. Full name confirmed here.
- **R. S. Owen** (articles 17, 19): Byline "R. S. OWEN." Elder R. S. Owen, Adventist minister in Hatley, Mississippi; not a regular Sentinel staff writer.
- **Cyrus Simmons** (article 18): Letter signed "CYRUS SIMMONS." Not in known authors list; a reader correspondent.

## Article 08: "The Chinese Great Wall Coming Down"

- **Location:** Page 7, end of article
- **Issue:** The article appears to end mid-paragraph in the OCR, cutting off without a closing sentence. The OCR ends: "It traverses high mountains, descends into gorges and ravines, and crosses rivers, valleys, and plains without regard to obstacles." This may be the actual end of the article as printed (running into an adjacent column) or the OCR may have dropped subsequent text.
- **Transcribed as:** Text as found in OCR
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The article may genuinely end here (a common editorial style of quoting without further comment), or text may be missing
- **Reason:** Flagged for verification against original scan

## General Notes

- Pages 14-15 contain advertisements and book notices (Heralds of the Morning, Almost a Man, Before He Is Twenty, Books We Can Recommend series). These were not transcribed as article files per project guidelines (ads/boilerplate).
- The subscription pricing table on page 13 appears corrupted in OCR (showing ".00" instead of dollar amounts). This is boilerplate and was excluded.
- Page 16 editorial column items were grouped into a single file as they form a unified editorial column without individual titles.
