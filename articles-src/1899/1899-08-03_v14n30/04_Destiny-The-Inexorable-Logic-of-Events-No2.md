A great journal says, "Men may be masters of their own destinies, but nations are not." Yes, men not only may be, but are masters of their own destinies, and by that very token they are the masters of the destinies of nations, and nations are masters of their own destinies, because men are the nations. Nations are made up of individuals and nothing else. This is not to say that an individual or even a large number of individuals can always control the destiny of a nation. But it is to say that the individuals of which a nation is composed, being in control of their own destinies are in control of the destinies of the nation, because they are the nation. Individuals determine the destinies of nations. "The public life of a nation is but the life of successive generations of statesmen." And it is a rule with very few exceptions that the lives of statesmen are fairly representative of the lives of the people whose statesmen they are.

The history of the one other great republic of the world is important to the people of this Republic. The history of its transformation from republicanism into imperialism is very important to the people now. That which makes it most important is the fact that He that ruleth in the kingdom of men has especially called the attention of the people of this time to that very thing. Almost twenty-four hundred years ago the prophet Daniel was shown in vision the fourth kingdom, or power, that should be upon the earth, and when he sought for the meaning he was told by the angel certain specific characteristics that marked the transformation of that power from a republic to an empire. He was not told this for his own benefit, or for the benefit of the people who would live in the time of this fourth power, but for the benefit of the people who would live in the time of this,—the one other great republic of the world. The vision was "for many days," even unto "the time of the end." Almost the first words that a great historian was moved to write on commencing his sketch of "the conversion of the Roman Republic into a military empire," are these:—

"We talk often foolishly of the necessities of things, and we blame circumstances for the consequences of our own follies and vices; but there are faults which are not faults of will, but faults of mere inadequacy to some unforeseen position. Human nature is equal to much, but not to everything. It can rise to altitudes where it is alike unable to sustain itself or to retire from them to a safe elevation. Yet when the field is open it pushes forward, and moderation in the pursuit of greatness is never learnt and never will be learnt. Men of genius are governed by their instinct; they follow where instinct leads them; and the public life of a nation is but the life of successive generations of statesmen, whose horizon is bounded, and who act from day to day as immediate interests suggests. The popular leader of the hour sees some present difficulty or present opportunity of distinction. He deals with each question as it arises, leaving future consequences to those who are to come after him. The situation changes from period to period, and tendencies are generated with an accelerating force, which, when once established, can never be reversed. When the control of reason is once removed, the catastrophe is no longer distant, and then nations, like all organized creations, all forms of life, from the meanest flower to the highest human institution, pass through the inevitably recurring stages of growth and transformation and decay. . . . Nevertheless, 'as the heavens are high above the earth, so is wisdom above folly.' Goethe compares life to a game at whist, where the cards are dealt out by destiny, and the rules of the game are fixed: subject to these conditions, the players are left to win or lose, according to their skill or want of skill. The life of a nation, like the life of a man, may be prolonged in honor into the fulness of its time, or it may perish prematurely, for want of guidance, by violence or internal disorders. . . . Amidst the endless variety of circumstances there are constant phenomena which give notice of approaching danger; there are courses of action which have uniformly produced the same results; and the wise politicians are those who have learnt from experience the real tendencies of things, unmished by superficial differences, who can shun the rocks where others have been wrecked, or from foresight of what is coming can be cool when the peril is upon them."

These are general observations which have been confirmed by actual examples. The specific example from which they were drawn was the Roman republic. Today they are being confirmed by the republic of the United States.

The historian in pointing out how "tendencies are generated with an accelerating force, which, when once established, can never be reversed," states exactly what can be and what is seen and heard to-day in this country on every hand, and which is so plain that none may mistake it. His very words and phrases are echoed and re echoed, and the very air seems to be impregnated with them. In what is universally acknowledged to be the greatest crisis in this nation's history there is an almost universal demand that action be determined "from day to day as immediate interests suggest;" that only the "present difficulty or present opportunity" be considered; that "each question" be dealt with "as it arises;" and that "future consequences" be left "to those who are to come after." Said a prominent Chicagoan:

"Commercial interests, political interests, and every other interest demands the retention of the islands." Says Mr. John Barrett, former United States minister to Siam, speaking of "our policy of expansion in the far East": "The material interests involved are usually the deciding influence." Says Mr. Charles Denby, of one of the first and greatest problems of "expansion": "Let us leave it to be met by a race which has encountered and solved every difficulty that stood in its path to greatness." Said Congressman Charles F. Grosvenor: "Let us wait. It is not important to settle the status of the Philippine Islands now. It is not important to settle the character of the government, the stable government, which we promise to Cuba." Says another high officer of the government: "No one can tell to-day what is best for them and for us. I know no one at this hour who is wise enough or sufficiently informed to determine what form of government will best subserve their interests and our interests, their and our well-being." A great journal says one day that those who wish to discuss the matter should wait until Congress is in session; the next, that "the time for debate is past." A prominent dignitary says: "Follow your destiny. . . . Adhere to the instincts of the future." Another says: "Even though we shall for a time elect to stand still, yet shall we, like Nansen's Fram, be drifting toward our destiny."

Has the control of reason been removed in American affairs? Can any one imagine how that could be done more thoroughly than by the blind acceptance of "destiny" and "the inexorable logic of events?" To repudiate the plain principles of the Declaration and the Constitution for these things is nothing more nor less than a removal of the control of reason. The principles of the Declaration and the Constitution are reasonable and self-evident. Nothing is more pernicious and more directly opposed to the dictates of reason than is the doctrine that lurks in the terms "destiny" and the "inexorable logic of events."

The great men of this country have set aside as foolishness the great principles of reason and justice which have been the wisdom and the understanding of their country in the sight of the nations, and have announced that henceforth uncertainty is their wisdom, blindness is their guide, and irresponsibility is their law. The principles of the Declaration and the Constitution, say they, are "subtle and metaphysical," "above the realities of life," and fit only for "the aloofness of the astral intelligence." Therefore, "we must follow the instincts of the future," and, "like Nansen's Fram, be drifting toward our destiny."

We do not know what the fate of the Fram was, but we know what the fate is that awaits all drifting things, whether they be ships or men or nations. The port of safety is reached only by vigilance, perseverance, and untiring exertion. Those who are drifting to their destiny, can, if they will but listen, already hear the roar of the ngry billows upon the shoals of destruction; they can, if they will but look, already see amid the foam of the seething waters, the grim and ragged rocks upon which they are to perish. The surest way for a ship to reach destruction is to drift; and the surest way for men and nations to reach destruction is to drift. When a ship's compass and chart are thrown overboard, its pilot house deserted, and it is tossed helplessly on the waves and driven at the will of the fitful gale, it is doomed. And when a nation throws aside reason and justice and abandons the abiding principles which have been its guides and its life, in order that it may run blindly and greedily in the way of "destiny" and the "inexorable logic of events," it has not only taken the shortest road to destruction, but it has thereby invited destruction to meet it halfway.

Those who have so much to say of the "destiny" of America would do well to ponder carefully the following sentence recently spoken by Bishop Spaulding, of Peoria. It is a simple statement: as simple as that two plus two equals four. Yet it contains more sense and more wisdom than all the orators could say and all the editors could write in a thousand years in behalf of "manifest destiny." He said: "If it is our destiny to become an empire it is not our destiny to endure as a republic."
