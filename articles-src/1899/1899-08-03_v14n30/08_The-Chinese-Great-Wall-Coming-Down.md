The Chinese government appears to be setting an example of disarmament before the world, although in the present condition of things no nation could more ill afford to disarm. The "great wall" which was built to protect the country from invasion is to come down, report says, and a Chicago civil engineer has started for China in behalf of a syndicate of Chicago capitalists that expects to receive a contract for the work:—

"The ten-thousand-mile rampart of China is a remarkable fortification, and was constructed by order of Emperor Shi-Hwang-Ti, whose purpose it was to protect the northern and northwestern frontier of his empire from the hordes of barbarians who swarmed in the territory. The wall is said to be 1,255 miles long, from 20 to 25 feet high, with towers 40 feet high, about 200 to 300 yards apart. Several million men were occupied for about ten years in its construction. The top of the wall is broad enough to allow six horsemen to ride abreast. The facings are of hewn stone laid in mortar, and the interior is filled with earth and stone, the top being leveled off with a layer of brick. The wall was completed about 211 B.C. For years a large part of it has been in a ruinous condition. It runs from the seashore on the Gulf of Pe-che-lee westward to Soochow, on the borders of Turkestan. It traverses high mountains, descends into gorges and ravines, and crosses rivers, valleys, and plains without regard to obstacles.
