An example of despotism in its worst form has been given by the striking street-car employees in Cleveland, who employed riot and dynamite in an endeavor to prevent the railway company from operating its system in the city. We are accustomed to associate tyranny with wealth; but a very important truth would be overlooked if we should fail to discern that there is a despotism of the masses as well as of the classes. Despotism is an ingredient of human nature, and shows itself as readily in the proceedings of labor unions as in the operations of the trusts.

The street-car employees attempted to force the street-railway company to stop running their cars. This was their way of saying to the railway company that the company must give them employment on their terms. We do not doubt that the conditions on which this company offered employment to its men were hard conditions, reflecting no credit on the company from the standpoint of philanthropy. But the company was not bound to give them employment on any terms. No person has any right to try to force another person to provide him with employment. This was what the striking employees tried to do with the company when they sought to forcibly suppress the traffic on its lines; they not only demanded that the company provide them with employment, but that this be done on their own terms. This was despotism pure and simple, and was without any shadow of justification by the principles of free government.

There are too many workingmen for the work that other people have to offer them; and the only remedy is one that lies with the workingmen themselves; not by combining into unions to force employees to come to their terms; for no amount of force can make ten men fit in a place where there is room for only six; but by finding work which some other person does not offer; by getting more directly in touch with the primary source of all support, which is the earth; by cultivating independence, even at the expense of enduring hardships. If people had always valued their independence at its true worth, the distressing conditions now revealed in the laboring world would never have been reached.
