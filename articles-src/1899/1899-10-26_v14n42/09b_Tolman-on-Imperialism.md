THE indifference and even contempt which the President has displayed toward American ideas and toward the proper aspirations of a brave people, I for one cannot forget, and, politically speaking, cannot forgive. He has done his best to turn the great statue in New York Harbor of Liberty Enlightening the World into a colossal joke. He has made us and our boasted ideals the derision of the people of Europe. He has caused the nations of our own continent to drill armies and stand guard against the United States as a great freebooter, watching to rob them of their birthright. He and his counselors have largely thrown away our finest national possession—our moral influence. He has put into our history a black page which will shame us forever.—Prof. A. H. Tolman, of Chicago University.
