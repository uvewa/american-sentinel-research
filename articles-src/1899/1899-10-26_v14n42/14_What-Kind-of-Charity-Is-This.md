During the carnival festivities at Knoxville, Tenn., the Midway Show in which is especially featured the Oriental or choochee-choochee dance, was given under the auspices of the Elks, a local organization of this city. Among other things the advertisement reads: "The Elk's Carnival Midway; a benefit for the Charity Fund of the Knoxville Lodge B. P. O. E."

Dr. C. W. Dabney, President of the University of Tennessee, speaks of the show as follows:—

"In the name of holy charity and under the auspices of a local benevolent society there was brought into this city this year the vile, sensual dance with which the rotting oriental races debauched themselves since the days of Sodom and Gomorrah. This exhibition is too filthy for description; but it needs none; everybody, alas! knows what it was. Two years ago the moral sense of the country was shocked by the story of the Seeley dinner in New York. It is said that, besides the filthy public exhibition that everybody knows of, the worst features of that dinner were given in Knoxville last week behind closed doors. . . . That this filthy show has slipped in here in connection with our carnival, with the permission of its management, and under the shelter of a local benevolent order, will be an eternal disgrace to us. Think of it, good people of Knoxville! This indescribable horror, the choochee-choochee, brought here by our representatives, admitted free of county and city tax because it was for a local benevolent purpose, and then put in the heart of our city, on our best street, and run for more than a week, in the face of our city ordinance, and apparently thus with the approval of our city authorities,—could a more awful infamy be put upon us?"

Is the world growing better, or is that prophecy being fulfilled which says: "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived?" 2 Tim. 3:13.

The lamentable picture of wickedness, drawn by inspiration, fortelling the end of the world, is every day more plainly discernible on the canvas of time.

CYRUS SIMMONS.
