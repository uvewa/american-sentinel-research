It is interesting to note the uncertain tone of the public press of this country in its comments on Great Britain's threatened war of conquest in South Africa, the inevitable result of which will be the absorption of the South African republics by the British empire. Ordinarily, American sympathy would be wholly with the menaced republics. But since we have started upon a policy of conquest ourselves, the old American sympathy for the oppressed is growing feeble, and we know not what to say about imperial tyrants. Let us wait a little longer and we may yet grow fond of them.
