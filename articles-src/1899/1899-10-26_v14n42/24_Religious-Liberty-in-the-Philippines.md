WRITING on "Religious Liberty in the Philippines," in *The Independent*, of October 19, Rev. N. H. Harriman, who spent some weeks there under circumstances exceptionally favorable for getting at the truth of the subject, says that under American military government the Catholics will "get a mighty start of all other bodies," and that "If Protestants do not stir themselves, according to the present trend of favor shown to Catholics and withheld from Protestants, their task will be well nigh impossible at the close of the war." This partiality shown to the Catholics is due to the political influence of Catholics in the United States, and is in the same degree an injury to Protestants, contrary to the principles of government by which the nation is bound.
