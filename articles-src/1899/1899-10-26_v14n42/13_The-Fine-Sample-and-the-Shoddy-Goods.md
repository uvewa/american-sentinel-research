The *New York Journal* is one of the most outspoken advocates of the policy of foreign conquest; and when such a journal affirms that affairs in the Philippines under American rule are entirely out of harmony with the oft-repeated talk of the President and his supporters about the good government that would come in those islands with American rule, we may safely believe it speaks the truth. And this is what the *Journal* admits, on the strength of a dispatch from the Manila correspondent of the Hong Kong *Mail*:—

"Taxes are higher now than under Spanish rule, and the inhabitants bitterly complain that living expenses have doubled. The native police have been discharged, and the Americans appointed in their stead, being totally unacquainted with the language and modes of life of the civil population, are giving endless dissatisfaction. The old inhabitants state that murders, robberies, and crimes of every description are greater than before, and the American police, in their blundering endeavors to search out criminals, resort in their ignorance of the haunts and methods of the criminals to the most tyrannical means to obtain information for the capture of offenders. Another source of discontent is the use of the money secured from taxes and from customs for the support of the army, instead of using the funds for carrying out much-needed municipal necessities. All these causes serve to prolong the war by keeping the natives, who have lived in hope on promises of good government, in a constant state of irritation."

"The trouble with all the President's lofty professions," remarks the *Journal*, "is that his goods do not come up to sample." Of course! And the trouble is, further, that he has hardly more than a sample of the "goods" at home. There is hardly more than a sample, if there is even that, here at home of the wonderfully fine and just government which has been so loudly promised for the Philippines. And when the supply of good government at home does not begin to fill the demand, how can there be any surplus for export to other lands?

"It is true," adds the *Journal*, "that the American people do not want to oppress anybody in the Philippines, that they are there to liberate, and all the rest of it; but if the agents sent by Mr. McKinley to carry out their will impose higher taxes than the Spaniards did, double the living expenses of the inhabitants of Manila, use the money extorted from the taxpayers for the support of the army instead of for municipal necessities, and permit crime to run rampant, is it surprising that our benevolent intentions are mistrusted?"

No; it is not surprising. And the only surprising thing about it all is that anybody familiar with history should be surprised that the agents of a foreign power sent over to manage affairs in the Philippines, should run the government to suit themselves and their backers at home, rather than to suit the conquered and despised natives.

That is the way this kind of government has always been conducted. The United States is only repeating the old familiar story, and this was the only thing to be expected.
