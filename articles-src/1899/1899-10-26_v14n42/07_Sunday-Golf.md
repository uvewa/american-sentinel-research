The increase of Sunday golf playing is noted in religious journals as a "startling evidence of the decadence of keeping Sunday on the part of professing Christians." A writer in *Christian Work*, who makes this statement, relates that "Parents and young people who two hours before had come home from God's house, and even from the Sacrament table, set out regularly on Sunday afternoon, by cab, wheel, or on foot, to the golf links! And this going 'only to play a quiet game of golf on Sunday afternoon' means staying to supper at the golf house, with the promiscuous company and conditions of such a gathering."

That, of course, is not Sabbath-keeping, and would not be even were Sunday the true Sabbath day. Supposing, then, that these people were restrained by law from going to the golf links on Sunday, would anything be gained by it on the side of Sabbath observance? Would these Sunday golfers be keeping the Sabbath any better than before? If so, then Sabbath-keeping is a matter of the outward conduct only. And as Christianity is never a matter of the outward conduct alone, it would necessarily follow that Sabbath-keeping is not a part of Christianity. "That which proves too much proves nothing at all."

It may be claimed that the example of such people is demoralizing, and this might appear to be true of those who believe that Sunday is a sacred day. But if the example of people who regard not the day is demoralizing on the golfing field, what will it be elsewhere? From a religious point of view, the example of one who disregards the Sabbath is bad everywhere on that day, and nowhere worse than where it causes the least shock to the beholder, because there it will be most readily imitated.

From a Christian point of view, a person might just as well be playing golf on the Sabbath as sitting at home talking politics or discussing the yacht races or the crop prospects. And it is just as bad, from this point of view, for a person to learn to do one of these on the Sabbath as to learn to play golf.

And as golf playing is in itself a healthy and innocent exercise, it is certainly to be commended in preference to other forms of Sabbath desecration which do nothing to promote the well-being of either body or mind.
