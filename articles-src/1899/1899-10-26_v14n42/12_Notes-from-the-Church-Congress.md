THE Episcopal Church Congress held its nineteenth annual session in St. Paul, Minn., October 10, 11, 12, and 13. Speakers of note occupied the time. Among the subjects that were considered, were: "Does National Expansion Involve Imperialism?" and "The Sunday Question." "Empire for Christ," was a dominant theme in the discussions.

Bishop Potter, of New York, gave the opening address to the Congress, discussing the first topic. He took the affirmative of the question. The subject was presented in an interesting manner.

Among other things Bishop Potter showed that it took England 250 years after the beginning of her imperial policy to get a decent civil service. Comparing the Philippines and India, he said:—

"There are the same diversions of race, condition, religion, tribal religion, and the like, and in the case of these insular communities, there is no binding interest whatever. To undertake to superimpose upon them our free institutions would seem to be an utterly hopeless task, and, in such a situation, what is the alternative but a form of government which, while not nominally, yet practically, in its essential absolutism, is imperial?"

Several times during the reading of the paper and at its close, the bishop was greeted with applause. Other speakers followed, taking the opposite ground. One speaker lamented that there were some who "speak slightly of a benevolent assimilation policy."

H. F. Phelps.
