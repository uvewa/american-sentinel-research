# NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT

The New York State Assembly of Mothers has been in session at Albany. The feature of one day's session—the 18th inst.—was a speech by Governor Roosevelt on the training of children. As reported, he advocated a truly imperialistic style of training, and made this remarkable statement:—

"A boy that won't fight is not worth his salt. He will be no use in life and is a coward. Teach him to use his strength on the side of righteousness. Do not punish him if he fights if he is right. Teach him to be able to take care of himself and know how to act under all circumstances."

The governor was given a vote of thanks at the conclusion of his address; from which fact we may infer that his sentiments on the necessity of learning to fight were received by the assembled mothers with approval.

• • •

Let us look a little into the nature of this advice. "The boy that won't fight"—who is he? In the first place, if our observations count for anything, he is a very scarce product, decidedly more so than the boy who is a coward. Cowards are plentiful enough; but the boy who will not fight is so scarce as hardly to come within the observation of most people.

• • •

The coward will fight. Yes, the coward who is "not worth his salt"—if there be such a person—will fight, and do as much fighting as anybody else, too. He will fight because he is a coward; because the fighting instinct is a cowardly instinct. Who has not met at least once the individual who has acquired the title of "the bully," who is always fighting for the pleasure of it? He is usually mentioned as the "big bully," who relies on his superior size to gain the advantage over his opponents; for that is the only difference between the coward and the other boy who fights,—the former chooses an antagonist smaller than himself. And when the bully at last meets his match, he shows that he is a coward, and people tell with satisfaction how the "big coward" was soundly thrashed. The boy who is brave is the boy who "goes quietly about his own business," and is never ready to pick a quarrel.

• • •

Cowardice is the natural source of fighting; for fighting comes from an attempt to perpetrate injustice, and an attempt to perpetrate injustice is a cowardly exhibition always. To be just, and to be generous, are always accompaniments of true courage. "The boy who won't fight" is scarce enough; but the boy who is too cowardly to fight is so much scarcer that it may well be doubted whether any authenticated specimen of the class is in existence.

• • •

But in any case, whether against a weaker antagonist or a stronger one, fighting is, relatively, a manifestation of cowardice. It is below the highest standard of courage. The boy who fights to avenge an insult or to maintain his rights is braver than the boy who under like circumstances is afraid to do so. But the boy who can endure insult and injustice without retaliation, for the sake of principle, has the true courage, compared with which all other forms of so called courage are only degrees of cowardice. And to train a child so that he will develop just this courage, is not at all a chimerical idea.

• • •

That this is so, every believer in Christianity must admit. The mothers to whom Governor Roosevelt spoke—most of them certainly—must admit it; and the governor himself must admit it, for they are believers in Christianity. They are believers, professedly at least, in the supreme excellence of an Individual who as a child, as well as in later years, exemplified this very thing. For certainly no one who believes the Bible will claim that the child Jesus Christ ever used his fists upon one of his young companions. That he was, as a child, subjected to the ordinary experiences of childhood,—that he had occasion at times to feel insulted, that his rights were not always respected by his youthful associates, that some of them occasionally tried to "run over" him, cannot be doubted; for this is what every child has to meet. But that he ever retaliated, that he ever stood up for his rights with doubled fists, that he ever left a mark of violence upon one of his companions, is wholly beyond belief.

• • •

The picture of the child Christ engaging in a rough-and-tumble fight in the streets of Nazareth—such a conception no believer in his divinity could entertain for a moment. And even if anyone could entertain such a distorted conception of Christ's nature, he would be obliged with it to repudiate Christ's plain teaching on the subject of the proper treatment of one's enemies. Christ was the same in youth that he was when he taught his followers not to retaliate when smitten, but to pray for those who used them despitefully; the same in youth that he was when he forbade Peter to fight in his behalf; the same that he was when, without the least retaliation, he was crowned with thorns, smitten with reeds, and spit upon. It is absolutely certain, therefore, that the child Jesus was a boy who would not fight.

• •

And therefore, in saying that "The boy who won't fight isn't worth his salt," the governor of the State of New York really said that Jesus Christ, as a boy, was not worth his salt! Think of it,—the world's Redeemer not worth his salt! Of course the governor did not mean this; he would be shocked at the idea, as we are; but that is what he really said, and what everybody says who holds to the idea that a boy cannot become manly without being taught to fight. And whoever holds to that idea and carries out the principle of it to the end, will certainly repudiate Jesus Christ in the end as an individual for whom he has no use.

• •

So, MOTHERS, you at least who believe in Christianity, don't teach your boys to fight. Teach them that there is a manlier way to act under provocation than to give way to anger; a better way to settle controversies than by brute force. Teach them that a human being is on a higher level than a brute, and should settle disputes in a higher way than brutes do. Teach them that "Greater is he that ruleth his own spirit than he that taketh a city." Teach them that to overcome evil with good is the divine way, and the surest way of gaining a complete and lasting victory.

• •

THE idea that a boy can cultivate courage only by learning to fight, is manifestly absurd. And it is just as absurd to suppose that a nation must be weak unless it is pugnacious. That is the idea of the prize-fighter; the argument he offers to justify his plea that prize-fighting ought to be fostered by the nation rather than frowned down. And it is perfectly logical, too, if it be premised that the boys ought to learn to fight in order to become manly. And what can be expected of boys who are encouraged to fight in their youthful days, but that they will retain the fighting propensity when they are grown up; and that prize-fighting and its attendant evils will flourish in the land as the direct result? The nature of the crowd which always waits upon and encourages a contest of brute force, ought to stamp such a contest, in the minds of all good people, as a thing not deserving of encouragement in young or old.

• •

THE governor of New York is an ardent supporter of "expansion." That policy is, in his view, an application of the principle of using brute force to promote the cause of righteousness. It is the cause of righteousness, he believes, that is now being advanced by the armies in the Philippines. The small boy, who is in his own eyes an eminent judge of righteousness, should be taught to use his little fists when he is sure that he is fighting for righteousness; and when he becomes a man he will be just as sure that he is fighting for righteousness when he is helping to subjugate the weaker people of a foreign land. The "righteousness" which such actions promote is a kind that is contrary to the whole spirit of Christianity, and that every precept of Christianity condemns.
