WHEN the American army entered Manila there were five or six saloons; now there are 435 saloons and brothels where a decent man has not room to stand. One of our regiments contracted debts in Cavite amounting to $2,500, and the government could not compel them to pay. Another regiment did the same. We have not shown these people the virtues of temperance or good living. There is an American monopoly of drink at Manila, and what wonder that they should hate and despise Americans.—Rev. Peter MacQueen.
