# Uncertainties and Editorial Decisions — v14n42, October 26, 1899

## OCR Errors and Uncertain Readings

### Page 1, Untitled editorial (article 01)
- **Issue:** The word "EIGANTIC" appears in all-caps text: "AND SURELY THOSE WHO CRY OUT AGAINST THE EIGANTIC EVIL OF INTEMPERANCE..."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "EIGANTIC" (exactly as in OCR)
- **Confidence:** LOW — this is almost certainly an OCR error for "GIGANTIC." The original printed text almost certainly reads "GIGANTIC." However, per project rules, this is transcribed as found in the OCR source without correction. If the PDF original is consulted, this should be verified.
- **Reason:** Cannot verify against original PDF at this time; preserving OCR reading.

### Page 1, "The Promise of Liberty" (article 02)
- **Issue:** "WE MAY SET ASIDE, THEN, AS ALTOGETHER VAIN AND DE-" appears at page break (line 35-36), then the text continues on page 2 with "lusive, the promises of liberty..."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "WE MAY SET ASIDE, THEN, AS ALTOGETHER VAIN AND DELUSIVE, the promises of liberty made by any people..."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — standard page-break hyphenation joined as continuous text.

### Page 6-7, "The Crucifixion of Christ in the Nineteenth Century" (article 08)
- **Issue:** The word "fortelling" appears at line 363 in the text.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "fortelling"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — may be OCR for "foretelling" but could also be an archaic variant. Preserved as found.

### Page 7, attribution of "The Crucifixion of Christ in the Nineteenth Century"
- **Issue:** The article ends "Goldfield, Colorado." followed by the author's name "CYRUS SIMMONS." only appearing several paragraphs later (at the end of "What Kind of Charity is This?"). On careful re-reading, "Goldfield, Colorado." is the dateline/location for the Crucifixion article, and "CYRUS SIMMONS." is the author signature for "What Kind of Charity is This?" which appears on page 11.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Decision:** The Crucifixion article has no explicit author initials; it is signed only with a location dateline (Goldfield, Colorado). Author listed as B. W. Marsh per the byline "BY B. W. MARSH." at the start of the article (line 157).
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 8, "What Kind of Charity is This?" attribution
- **Issue:** Author name "CYRUS SIMMONS" appears at the end in all-caps.
- **Transcribed as:** author "Cyrus Simmons"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — not in known authors list; recorded with initials CS.

### Page 11, "Notes from the Church Congress" attribution
- **Issue:** "H. F. Phelps." appears at the end of the article.
- **Transcribed as:** author "H. F. Phelps"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — not in known authors list; recorded with initials HFP.

## Editorial Structure Decisions

### Untitled opening editorial section
The issue opens with several all-caps paragraphs about religious counterfeits followed by "The Promise of Liberty," "The Needed Power," and "A Baneful Progress" — all before the first `---` divider. These appear to be distinct articles sharing the first several pages. They were split into four separate files (articles 01-04) based on content breaks and headings.

### Tolman quote and Bigelow quote
A quote from Prof. A. H. Tolman appeared after "The Crucifixion of Christ in the Nineteenth Century" (between the Crucifixion article ending "Goldfield, Colorado." and the first `---` divider). A quote from Rev. Herbert S. Bigelow appeared after "The Philippine Purchase." These were treated as standalone short items and given their own files.

### Pages 15-16 advertisements skipped
Pages 15 and 14 (lines 538-656, 663-736) contain book advertisements and subscription information for Pacific Press Publishing Company. These were not transcribed as article files per project guidelines.

### Page 16 editorial notes
The final page contains a series of short, distinct editorial paragraphs, each on a different subject. These were split into individual files (articles 21-29).
