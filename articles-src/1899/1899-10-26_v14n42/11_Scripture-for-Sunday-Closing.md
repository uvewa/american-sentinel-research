A RELIGIOUS journal, the Christian Work, says that "We have no accurate date of when a 'Sunday-closing movement' was carried out in Jerusalem."

Think of it—a Sunday closing movement in Jerusalem! This journal thinks there was such a movement there and that we have the record of it, only without the date. It says further:—

"But we do know that the first marked censure to merchants who were engaged in money lending and other week-day occupations was when 'the Lord of the Sabbath' overturned and threw out from the synagogue the desks and all the men so engaged, and closed Jerusalem's 'Wall Street' with an anathema upon those who were spending his day as they did the other six!"

This incident of the cleansing of the temple, as every reader of the narrative can see, had no reference at all to Sunday or to Sabbath observance; yet it is seized upon and made to serve in the interests of Sunday closing. There is one thing this shows, and that is that ignorance of the Scripture and the Sunday-closing sentiment go well together.
