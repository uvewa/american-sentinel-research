HON. Joseph Chamberlain, speaking for Great Britain, says that the latter must be the "paramount" power in South Africa, and anything that would interfere with this must be put down. It is announced further by the British government that the South African republics will at the conclusion of the war be made over into a British province fashioned somewhat like the Dominion of Canada. And this is only a plain statement of what has been the real issue from the first—the survival or disappearance of these republics from the map of Africa.
