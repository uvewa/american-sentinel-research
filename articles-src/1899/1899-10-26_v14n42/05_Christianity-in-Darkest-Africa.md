A SEVENTH-DAY Baptist missionary in Africa, Mr. Joseph Booth, in a report of his work and experience teaching the Bible to the natives of the interior, says:—

"Now let me tell you some of the questions and comments of this people. They ask, 'Are the same words for all people?' I answer, 'Yes.' They ask, 'Why have not the white men in Blantyre told the people the same words?' I answer, 'I cannot tell.' They ask, 'If we now begin to keep God's day and obey his commands, will he forgive and hear us if we pray?' I answer, 'Yes;' and forthwith a number of strangers who are returning home from a long journey say, 'We much wish to travel and get home to our families, but now we will rest on this day of God and pray to him to make white men also hear his words "Thou shalt not covet, or steal, or kill."' They ask, 'Does the Book of God say it is wicked for white men to kill the black men?' I answer, 'Yes; the Book of God commands them not to kill or steal.' They say this is very good news for their country, for during this last month some English soldiers sent to the same village and whipped some and put others in chains and made them go away to fight against their brothers not far away. They ask, 'Is it not bad for black men to be made to take the life of their friends?' I answer, 'Yes, it is very wicked in the sight of God.' They ask if the white men will punish me for speaking these words, and I say I cannot tell; I leave that with God; he is able to take care of me. So now they have all gone away to talk over these words which seem wonderful to them."

And that is a striking comment upon the "national Christianity" exemplified by the soldiers of the "Christian" powers, with whom these poor ignorant people have come in contact.
