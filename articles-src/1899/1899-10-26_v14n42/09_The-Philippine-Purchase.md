The imperialist organs were not slow in seeing the significance of Judge Day's admission that our title to the Philippines rests upon a purchase. They insist that the islands became ours "by conquest."

One single question disposes of this claim: If we made a conquest of the islands, why haven't we got them? Why, after eight and a half months of war, are we still repelling attacks in the suburbs of Manila, and fearful of an uprising in the city itself, as yesterday's despatches reported? Would the capture of New York by a foreign foe complete a "conquest" of the United States?

Judge Day, as president of the American commission that made the treaty of peace with Spain, certainly knows the terms on which we secured our claim to the Philippines. And he says:—

"By the cession for a consideration we obtained an indisputable title. . . . It was not claimed (by the American commissioners acting on the President's instructions) that the United States had a right to the Philippines as a matter of conquest. The United States has never undertaken, so far as I know, to wrest from a foreign country lands or possessions simply by right of conquest.

"Had we been disposed to do so," adds Judge Day, "it must be remembered that we were in possession only of the city, bay, and harbor of Manila, under the protocol," and that "the capture, after the signing of the protocol, by General Merritt and his forces, whatever its legal effect may have been, included no more territory than we were entitled to hold under the protocol."

Judge Day claims that this title by purchase is "indisputable," but the inhabitants of Luzon have disputed it quite successfully thus far. The President, in his Pittsburg speech, took the same ground as his commissioner, saying that "peace brought us the Philippines by treaty cession from Spain." Waiving the important point that Spain could not cede that which she did not possess—that what she sold us was really, as Mr. Bryan says, only "an option on a war"—Mr. McKinley has put this free Republic in the position of having purchased "sovereignty" over 10,000,000 unwilling people, and then sending for their subjugation the largest army ever employed by the United States except in the civil war.

These are the exact facts as to the Philippine purchase.
