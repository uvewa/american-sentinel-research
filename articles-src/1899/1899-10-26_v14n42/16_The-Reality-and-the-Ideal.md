It is perfectly consistent that the United States, having reached the point of progress (?) where it denies to dark-skinned people both at home and abroad the privilege of self-government, should find itself bound by unwonted ties to the empire of Great Britain. For of that empire's attitude toward the like races of mankind it is truthfully said:—

"In the Transvaal difficulty the British profess that they will establish 'equal rights for all white men in South Africa.' Sometimes the phrase varies, and it reads, 'equality between white races in South Africa,' but however expressed, there is always used in it the word 'white.' The word is used intentionally, and it means that the British have not the slightest intention of granting political rights to colored men in South Africa. 'Equality' in that region is to be for a limited class—always and necessarily white in color of skin."

"The American ideal," to quote further from the same authority, "is far higher and is embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment, to the effect that 'the rights of the citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.' That this amendment is not enforced as it ought to be makes no difference; it has been written into the Constitution, and will there remain as an American ideal, no matter who may be false to it."
