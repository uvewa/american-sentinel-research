In his stump speech No. 45, in South Dakota, Mr. McKinley said:—

"We have a little insurrection in the Philippines which I trust will be very promptly suppressed."

Yesterday morning a Washington dispatch said—

"The combined military and naval forces of the United States in the Philippines, when all the troops and ships now under orders reach their destination, will aggregate more than seventy thousand men and forty-five war vessels."

A list of the regiments and ships was given. Is not this considerable of a force to put down a "little insurrection?" The army in the Philippines is more than double the size of our entire standing army before the war with Spain. It is three times the size of the force required to whip Spain in Cuba and Porto Rico. And it is three and a half times bigger than the armies under Scott and Taylor that conquered Mexico.
