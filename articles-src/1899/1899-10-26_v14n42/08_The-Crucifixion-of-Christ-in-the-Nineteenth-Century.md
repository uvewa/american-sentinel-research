"Howbeit when he the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth; for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come. He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine, and show it unto you." John 16:13, 14.

The crucifixion of our Lord, and Pentecost, are closely related to each other. In both events the power of God was manifested in a way that had never been known since the creation of man.

There was as much power of God manifested at the crucifixion as at Pentecost; and they stand, the first a solemn warning to all, of the fearful results of prostituting the power of God to the insane ambition of fallen man; the other a mighty testimony to all, of what will take place when man receives the Holy Ghost.

It requires as much power to kill as to make alive. With all his knowledge of life Lucifer was unable to destroy it until he had stolen the power God had created in man to produce life.

It is a law of sin, that a man will labor harder to accomplish an evil purpose than he will a righteous one; and for this reason the powers of man which were ordained unto life, when perverted by Satan into the channel of death, become mighty factors in destroying that which they have power to let live. There is life and immortality in the privilege of letting live, says Jesus: "I am the light of the world, he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life," therefore, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." John 8:12; Matt. 5:16.

Man's knowledge of death is more perfect than his knowledge of life. Men are adepts in taking life, from the life of the little sparrow to that of man created in the image of God. It seems a small matter to many to see death reigning everywhere, and to listen to the sad tales of woe as they multiply and fill the land. Life is considered a small thing and death a matter of little comment. Men are skilled in all the arts and sciences for causing death, and have scarcely a glimmer of light on the great secret of life.

The candle of hope has burned so low that nearly all accept as an inevitable guest the visitation of death, and in stoical despair are conquered, and go into the grave without a ray of faith to light the gloomy way. Christ is regarded as a strange being possessing unnatural instincts, and eternal life in his presence is a blessing feared and shunned by millions; Satan is becoming more and more regarded as a friend and benefactor of the human family, and his knowledge a thing to be desired, and the horrifying result is, that the race is, "wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge." And more than this, the Spirit and life of truth is terribly diminished in the hands of the professing churches through compromise with sin. There are very few who have the moral courage to stand for the right in the face of public sentiment, and for this reason we find a constantly degenerating church pastored by leaders who often compromise the truth in order to meet the favor of a backsliding people. And the result: "Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge, of God in the land. By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood." Hosea 4:1, 2. History repeats itself. "The thing that has been is that which shall be, and there is no new thing under the sun." What the Jewish Church did to Christ, the Apostate Church of the 19th century will do for his people.

The gospel of Christ is too broad for creeds and catechisms, and the creed-bound professor will sooner or later be found a persecutor. The Jews placed their tradition of the gospel above the gospel; they held their opinion of Christ in higher esteem than the living Christ. Their tradition was such a strange gospel, and their opinion of the Saviour so different from that which he really was, that they had to give up their traditions, sacrifice their opinion, and believe the true gospel, or crucify the Lord. And they choose to stain their hands with the blood of murder, rather than humble themselves before the Son of God. They reasoned that upon them rested the responsibility of maintaining the dignity of the church, and that Christ had no right to reveal himself as the Saviour, nor preach his gospel of salvation, unless duly authorized to do so by them. But the Bible proves that Christ invested no man with the authority to maintain the dignity of his church and gospel. The Holy Spirit alone can maintain the dignity of the Church of Christ, and to him only has the Lord given authority to direct the minds and destinies of men.

"For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout the earth. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth." Rom. 9:17, 18. It required a mighty testimony of righteousness to decide the Jews in their action toward the Lord. His message of sinless life was not found in their traditions. His doctrine of spiritual liberty was not taught by their priests and elders. God's message of love and freedom was received as one of bondage and condemnation, and so they reasoned: "If we let him thus alone, all men will believe in him; and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. And one of them named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient that one man should die, and that the whole nation perish not." John 11:48, 49.

The Jews argued that the doctrine of Christ was a menace to the nation, and it would be better to kill him, and thus settle the matter, than to permit him to preach his unpopular doctrine, and ruin them all. This is not altogether an old argument, for we have identically the same reasoning in this 19th century and with the same object in mind.

Let us compare modern reasoning with that of the Pharisees, and take warning from the similarity:—

"It is plainly discoverable that they (Seventh-day Adventists) more than any other class, are responsible for the Sabbath [Sunday] labor of to-day and for the disregard for the Sabbath that now disgraces us as an American people.

"Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we, for this man doeth many miracles."

"While churches have been growing conscienceless on the question of Sabbath observance, the various classes who perform compulsory Sabbath labor have grown in disregard for the churches until now there is a condition among a large body of laboring people, of hatred toward the churches, and disrespect toward all who profess to be Christians. Instead of our Saturdarian people comprehending the real cause of the present situation, they are undertaking work, which, if accomplished, will deepen the disregard for the Sabbath, and intensify among all classes of people, their hatred for the churches.

"If we let him alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away our place and nation."

"A form of religion that cannot exist without working on the Sabbath, even if it helps to send four or five men to hell every year, that one man might be protected in this liberty to pollute the Sabbath, should be regarded and understood as it really is: the greatest enemy to labor that exists, the devil excepted. Shall not the Christian people of this land rise up and guard against such a stream of poisonous literature being put into the hands and heads of the women and youth of this country? If you love the souls of the toiling thousands who are robbed of their rest, will you not manifest that love by standing firmly in the battle for a Sabbath for all the sons of toil?"

"If the conditions are allowed to be made worse along the lines that our Saturdayian folks are moving toward, labor will be driven downward with rapidly-increasing velocity, or a revolution will be provoked. Every patriotic citizen should take his stand to prevent either of the above issues from being forced upon us."

Every honest soul will awake to this warning parallel. For by it we can see how near we are to the climax, for arbitrary means is always Satan's last resort. But the torch of truth in the hands of fearless men and women will throw light on these dark designs, and prove more than conqueror over every combination of sin and force, be it as wide as the world. The very fact that we as a "people are few in numbers" should inspire us to a godly zeal; for as instruments in the hands of God, his truth through us is to stir the inhabitants of earth to a final decision. Let the gospel of freedom roll throughout the land. And may the statesmen of this favored nation go on the record books of heaven as men who had courage to meet public opinion with principles of truth, and to stand for the right when the world went wrong.
