War is not a means of grace, and if there is such a thing in this world as a necessary evil, it is certainly the greatest of such evils. It is demoralizing to the individual and to the public alike; it sears the conscience, dulls the moral sensibilities, obscures the vision, stimulates all bad passions, and I have felt intensely, since taking up my abode in this city (Manila), that every Christian should pray more earnestly than ever that the time may be hastened when nations shall learn war no more.—
*Bishop Thoburn (Methodist).*
