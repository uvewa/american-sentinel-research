BECAUSE it has criticised the action of the United States in departing from the principles of free government, the SENTINEL has been accused of going into politics. If criticising the action of the Government is going into politics, then the SENTINEL has been in politics from the first; for from the first it has opposed the enforcement of Sunday laws by the State governments, and the deference paid to Sunday in various ways by the national Government. "Expansion" has not yet been made an issue by any political party; but if it should be made an issue in the coming campaign, that would not alter the nature of the principle it embodies. Some years ago, in California, the repeal of the Sunday law was made an issue in the State campaign; but that did not make the question of religious liberty a mere matter of politics. It did not affect the nature of the contest between religious freedom and religious tyranny. People who opposed the Sunday law of the State, as being against religious freedom, did not thereby become politicians.

The person who sees only a question of politics in a denial of the right of self government, now, is preparing himself to see only a question of politics by and by in a national law to enforce the observance of Sunday. And that will be the mistake of his life.
