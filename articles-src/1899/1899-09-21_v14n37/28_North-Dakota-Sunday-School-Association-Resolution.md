The North Dakota Sunday School Association stands committed to the folly of political Christianity, by this resolution, adopted at its tenth annual convention, last May:—

"Resolved, That we indorse the action of the National Reform Association in their efforts to secure an amendment to our national Constitution, acknowledging Christ as King of Nations and the Bible as the supreme law, thus securing to us, on an undeniably legal basis, all the Christian features of our government."
