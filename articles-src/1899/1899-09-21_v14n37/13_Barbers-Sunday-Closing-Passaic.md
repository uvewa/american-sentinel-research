BARBERS in Passaic, N. J., have inaugurated a Sunday-closing movement similar to the one in progress in the neighboring city of Paterson, described in this SENTINEL. They will have various "ward committees" whose business it will be to "spot" any barber plying his trade on Sunday, and all such will be reported and prosecuted by the Barbers' Union under the Sunday law of the State. The "spotters" will break Sunday themselves in order that other barbers may be compelled to give the day a perfunctory observance.
