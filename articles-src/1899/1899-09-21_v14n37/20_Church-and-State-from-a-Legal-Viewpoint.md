## Church and State from a Legal Viewpoint.

[From a lawyer's standpoint, the proper relation of church and state to each other is defined in the following, contributed to a journal of this city:—]

In charging a jury in a divorce case a few days ago Mr. Justice William J. Gaynor, in Brooklyn, made use of the following language: "The church should not interfere or meddle with the laws of marriage. After a marriage has been annulled, if the church wishes to say that the parties are still married they then may live according to their religious belief, but we do not want any church to meddle with our laws. In deciding this case you must consider only the law, which allows a marriage to be annulled when the contract has been broken by either party."

It is gratifying to hear this flat footed expression of the fundamental principle of our legal system, that the common law knows no religion and that the sociological rules or code of morals developed by a religious sect or an agglomeration of sects have no force in the Forum, are not admissible as evidence, and in forensic argument even the presumption of their existence is not permissible. This expression, however, goes even further, for it requires the juror to expel from his mind and conscience the influence of religious teachings and view the facts before him in the light of the civil law, and in that light only, whether his ethical or religious consciousness approve of it or not.

In considering the portion of the charge above quoted it must not be forgotten that the justice making it is an orthodox Christian, and, to judge from some of his expressions, a devout one. From his lips, therefore, such words have added weight showing that the "God-in-the Constitution" principles have no foothold in our magnificent system of the common law.

It is a familiar rule that where there exists in the mind of a talesman a preconceived prejudice against a particular penalty in criminal actions, that he should be excluded from the jury in such a case. The commonest instance is that of the exclusion of the talesman who is morally opposed to the infliction of the death penalty in a capital case. In these instances, however, the juror is not accepted, and the question does not actually arise, but is avoided.

The charge to the jury, in our practise, consists of a statement by the trial judge of the law applicable to the case, and the jury is absolutely bound to follow it, and if in reaching its verdict it depart from or disregard it, the duty of the judge is to set aside the verdict.

It is thus apparent that under no stronger circumstances could such a catagorical statement be made by a judge on the bench, and there could not be a more terse and forcible statement of the principle.
