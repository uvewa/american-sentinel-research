IN England a cannon has been perfected which has a range so great that no "proving grounds" exist that are suitable for testing it. The range is estimated at fifteen miles. On board a war ship such a gun might bombard New York City in spite of all the protection that could be afforded by forts or harbor mines. The vast size of the city would make it an easy target at a range which would practically protect a warship from the projectiles fired from the shore.

The power which can command the seas will soon have at its mercy all sea coast cities not over fifteen miles distant from the open sea.
