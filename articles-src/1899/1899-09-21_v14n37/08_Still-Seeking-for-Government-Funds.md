## Still Seeking for Government Funds.

We made mention some time ago of the petition addressed to the Washington authorities by Cardinal Gibbons, in which he asked Congress to reconsider the whole subject of appropriations of public funds for Catholic Indian schools. Under a decision reached by Congress several years ago, such appropriations had greatly decreased and threatened to cease altogether; and the cardinal wanted this policy reversed, and the golden stream again set flowing in swelling volume from the public treasury into that of the papal church.

This scheme is still on foot, and its promoters have not at all abandoned the hope of pushing it to a successful issue. As indicative of this such utterances may be cited as the following from the *Catholic News*, of August 12:

"All who have studied the condition of the Indians in this country admit that religion and education are the two great forces that will civilize the red man. Experience has shown that without the influence of religion the Indian is sure, even after an elaborate education, to lapse into barbarism. But when education and religion are combined the result is perfectly satisfactory. In providing religion and education the Catholic Church has been more successful than any other religious body that has been working among the Indians. Notwithstanding this fact, the Government has allowed itself to be influenced by jealous and prejudiced persons to such an extent that it has absolutely cut off its appropriations to the Catholic Indian schools, and now these schools, which, by the way, were established at the invitation of the Government, are sadly crippled for lack of funds."

The editor sets forth that a great and good work has been accomplished for the Indians through the Catholic government-endowed schools, and adds:

"Under such circumstances the action on the part of Congress in discontinuing to make appropriation for the funds which alone can make the running of such schools possible, will hardly be considered just and fair, more especially as it was at the urgent request of the Administration that the Catholic Church entered upon the work to the extent that it did. As the cause of this unexpected and unfair treatment is traceable to the fact that religion is taught to the children, it may not be amiss to state what is well known to every one acquainted with the work in question, that in order to successfully civilize the Indian it is necessary to Christianize him.

"I hope and pray that this simple and short statement of facts may make the situation clear and induce the legislators at Washington to promote the welfare of the natives by continuing to extend a helping hand to the devoted men and women engaged in bringing to Christianity and civilization the American Indians."

Congress will no doubt be besieged by the papal hierarchy of this country at its next session, and it is to be feared that Archbishop Ireland may have one of his private interviews with the President over the matter, and secure the cooperation of the Chief Executive.

Rome may care something about the education of the Indians; but she certainly cares a good deal about any way to get money from the Government, and to secure governmental recognition of her claims. The education which Rome believes in and always gives her pupils is such as produces at once the most ignorant and the most Catholic peoples on the earth, as those of Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, etc. An incident that is pertinent here was lately reported from an Italian town not many leagues removed from the chief seat of papal authority. A balloon which had escaped from one of the government's scientific stations, descended near this town, and the natives, thinking it possessed with some kind of an evil spirit, carried it to the church to be "exorcised." But while the priest was engaged in driving out the evil spirit, the gas escaped from the balloon, and an explosion followed which injured many and badly wrecked the church.

All the education Rome had ever given these poor people, where she has had full freedom in that line ever since they were born, did not suffice to teach them that this balloon was not a mysterious something animated by an evil spirit. It is not that sort of an education that is needed by the Indians here.
