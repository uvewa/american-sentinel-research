## New Jersey Enforces the "Christian Sabbath."

*The Call* (Paterson, N. J.) of September 13, prints the following:—

"The trial of William Schmalfeldt, of Thirty-ninth Street, near Vreeland Avenue, charged with having on the 'third day of September, A. D., 1899, at the city of Paterson, in the county of Passaic, being the Christian Sabbath, or the first day of the week commonly called Sunday, engaged in ordinary or servile labor by exercising his trade or vocation of barber, contrary to and in violation of the statute of the State of New Jersey in such case made and provided,' took place yesterday morning before Justice Martin H. R. Van Hovenberg at his court room in the Katz building.

"There was a very large attendance of the members of the Barbers' Association and others interested, and the defendant was accompanied by a delegation of his friends. Constable Richard J. Krowley acted as court officer, and witnesses DeLong and Sherer, of the barbers' spotting committee, were also on hand.

"The defendant, who is a young man, after hearing the complaint read, by advice of counsel, pleaded guilty, and was fined $1 and costs of court.

"He alleged in justification of his offense that another barber in his neighborhood had shaved people at the latter's residences on Sunday, and that having lost some customers in that way he was tempted to break the law for self-protection, but with the exception of one Sunday he had otherwise kept his shop closed.

"The Barbers' Association have been furnished with the name of the alleged offender, and will take care of him and at once take action, should the allegation made prove to be well founded."

Besides this case, three others are reported in *The Call*, of the 12th inst., as follows:—

"Henry Bosehans, the butcher, of 622 River Street, and his two sons, Henry Jr., and Charles, were served with summons to appear in Justice Vandervate's court on Thursday afternoon. As intimated in yesterday's *Call* the Riverside Grocers' and Butchers' Association made a complaint against Bosehans for keeping open on Sunday morning, and against his two sons for performing manual labor on the same day, by working in their father's store.

"Last week Bosehans was arrested for a similar offense and fined, and filed an appeal, but the justice refused to recognize it until the fine and costs were forthcoming. If this is not done the justice will levy upon sufficient goods to satisfy the claim.

"Bosehans says he will keep open until cooler weather sets in, no matter how many times he is arrested, nor will he pay the fines until the higher courts decide the legality of the proceedings."
