## Napoleon on Sunday Labor by the Jews.

The Jewish Criterion prints the following translation of a letter written by Napoleon to one of his ministers named Portalis, regarding a proposed interference with the Jews under his authority, for working on Sunday. The letter shows that Napoleon grasped to a considerable extent at least the principle of separation between religion and the civil government, and saw that coercion in the matter of Sunday observance would lead the nation back to the Dark Ages, out of which the world was then struggling. The letter is dated, "Ostend, Dec. 25, 1807." It reads:—

"It is against the divine law to prevent the Jew from working on Sundays in order to gain his bread; the Jew has his necessities on Sunday as well as on the week days. The government could pass such law only if it were to give bread to those who have none; police and government have, therefore, no business to interfere.

"Even the holy fathers prescribed rest only for the people of wealth, or those who earned enough during the week to afford spending the Sunday in idleness. Therefore, in all Christian countries the custom to work on Sundays by special permission of the bishop or priest. Why should not the Jews be allowed to do so? Is it one of the bishop's rights, who hates the Jews, or the magistrate's rights, who has no love for the Jews, to grant or withhold such a permission?

"We had better be careful before we create a condition of affairs where we would be compelled to send policemen to the Jews, who must work for their living, in order to stop their Sunday labor.

"In either case the authorities would be guilty of superstition, either political or religious. God has made labor a duty, as he does not permit the enjoyment of a product of the earth, unless labor had been bestowed upon it. The laws of the clergy must be divided in such that affect religion in its essence, and in such that are passed for the object of extending their power.

"Mr. Portalis had better, therefore, be careful, because these concessions once made, the government undertaking to interfere in matters that are outside of its sphere, it will not be long before we will be taken back to the unfortunate period of the issue of letters patent of absolution, or the miserable epoch when the priest imagined the right to order the burning alive of the Jew, or to maltreat the citizen who refused to attend mass.

"The power of the clergy must be confined to the sermon; it is time that the sorely-persecuted Jews were left in peace. As long as I live, however, police and dungeon shall never be resorted to in France to tyrannize the citizens of another faith. There are many erring sheep in the Christian fold; let the priest lead these back to the practises of religion. An attempt to curtail still more the rights of Jews, which are curtailed enough, is priestly malice, and there is an end of that in France.

"NAPOLEON."
