"THE Sudan is being rapidly covered with a network of telegraph wires," says The Electrical Review. "It is expected that the telegraph will be 1,000 miles south of Khartoum at the end of the year. This means the practical joining up with Uganda, and as Rhode's telegraph is approaching Tanganyika the transcontinental telegraph may be expected to be finished early next year."
