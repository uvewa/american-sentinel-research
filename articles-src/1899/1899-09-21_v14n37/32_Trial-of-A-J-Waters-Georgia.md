WE are informed by the secretary of the International Religious Liberty Association that the trial of Mr. A. J. Waters, of Rome, Ga., before the Supreme Court of that State, will be held about the time this issue of the SENTINEL reaches its readers. If convicted, Mr. Waters expects to spend six months in the chain-gang. Our readers will be given the particulars in the case at the earliest possible moment.
