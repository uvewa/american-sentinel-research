Some facts which ought to be of much interest to those credulous people who believe that American colonial government in the Philippines will be a model of justice and order, in shining contrast with colonial government as the world has seen it under ancient Rome, under Spain and Great Britain, etc., are given in the report of Mr. Richard M. Collins, Associated Press correspondent at Manila, to his chief, Mr. Melville Stone, General Manager of the Associated Press. This report was called for in view of the statements previously made by Associated Press correspondents at Manila, alleging that important news was suppressed and the situation in Luzon grossly misrepresented by the American military commander. Mr. Stone sent copies of the letter to several Associated Press directors, one of whom, being editor of the Pittsburg Post, made it public in his paper.

Mr. Collins says that the press censorship at Manila was more severe than that enforced in war times in Japan, Turkey, Greece, Egypt, and Russia, or in Cuba under General Weyler. He says that the press correspondents were repeatedly told by the censor that the purpose was not simply to prevent the publication of anything that might aid the enemy, but to keep the knowledge of the facts from the people at home. His own words were, "My instructions are to let nothing go that can hurt the Administration." Now the truth has come out, and under such circumstances will "hurt the Administration" far more than it otherwise could have done.

"We were compelled," the letter reads, "to send nothing but the official version of all events and conditions, even when the official view controverted the opinions of the great mass of the officers in the field and of intelligent residents, and was a falsification of events which passed before our eyes. In this way every fight became a glorious American victory, even though every one in the army knew it to have been substantially a failure, and we were drilled into writing, quite mechanically, wholly ridiculous estimates of the numbers of Filipinos killed."

Under promise of a great change to be wrought in the situation, the press correspondents held back for a month, and then sent their "round robin" report, which stirred up so much comment here. First, however, they took it to the censor, who read it and said: "This is just the sort of thing the censorship is intended to suppress." The censor sent it to General Otis, and the latter immediately called before him the correspondent of the New York San (an ardent expansionist paper, by the way) and said to him: "You have accused me of falsehood. This constitutes a conspiracy against the Government," for which, he was further told, he with his associates in contumacy would be tried by a general court martial.

Coming to the subject of the situation in the island as affected by the conduct of American soldiers and their officers, the report says:—

"There has been, according to Otis himself, and the personal knowledge of every one here, a perfect orgy of looting and wanton destruction of property, and most outrageous blackmailing of the natives and Chinamen in Manila, and various incidents like the shooting down of several Filipinos for attempting to run from arrest at a cock fight, not to mention court martials of officers for cowardice and the dismissal of General — for getting hopelessly drunk on the eve of two important battles—all of which the correspondents have left untouched by common consent. Also, there are the usual number of army scandals and intrigues, which we have not aired, foremost among them the fact (it is universally considered a fact in the army) that Otis is deeply prejudiced against and jealous of Lawton, and has done everything in his power to keep Lawton in the background and prevent him from making a reputation."

This will suffice for the report made by this representative of the Associated Press. To it may be added the following deposition made by a private in a Colorado regiment, who for three months served as clerk under the auditor of public accounts at Manila. "He says," reads the report, "an examination of the vouchers forwarded to Washington will show that exorbitant prices are paid for all kinds of supplies purchased in Manila; that vast quantities of high class wines and other supplies have been purchased ostensibly for the Spanish hospitals, while in the American hospitals only the coarsest supplies are furnished.

"He says court-martials of private soldiers charged with selling Government property have been stopped because they would result in the exposure of official rascality.

"The robberies, he asserts, will aggregate an enormous sum."

We make mention of these things only to point out the evidence that provincial government under American authority will repeat the old story of mismanagement and corruption that has been told at length in the history of other nations. The governor of a Roman province was accounted stupid and incompetent if in such a position he could not rise from poverty to wealth in the space of two or three years. Under Spanish and English rule the like thing was true of men placed in that position, and American public officials have not a reputation as regards questionable methods of money-getting which will raise them above suspicion when in a place where they are face to face with the opportunity to acquire wealth rapidly and easily through the channels of government. This very thing is done at home to a notorious extent, and how can anything else be expected abroad? The evil is inherent in the very system of provincial government, which is a denial of the doctrine of government by consent of the governed, and is built upon the principles of injustice and denial of human rights which it exemplifies in its practical results.
