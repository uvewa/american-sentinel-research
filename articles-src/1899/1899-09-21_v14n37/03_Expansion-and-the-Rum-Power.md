"Pity 'tis, 'tis true," that expansion of American territory means expansion of the rum power. With the blessings of the nation's flag goes the curse of the legalized drink traffic. In the year 1898 this country exported to Cuba malt and other liquors to the value of $10,796; during the first five months of 1899 we—that is, everybody who is responsible, actively or passively, for the government's liquor policy—sent to Cuba liquor to the value of $472,272. In 1898 the value of liquors sent from the United States to Porto Rico was $3,668; in the first five months of 1899 it was $191,422. In 1898 we shipped $337 worth of liquor to the Philippines; in the first five months of 1899 we sent $86,833 worth! When it is remembered what the use of alcoholic drinks means to the people of tropical lands, it would seem as if the "benevolent" policy of the United States toward its new possessions were to kill off the natives as soon as possible.—*Union Signal.*
