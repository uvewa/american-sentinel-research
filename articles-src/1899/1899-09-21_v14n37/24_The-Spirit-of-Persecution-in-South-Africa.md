## The Spirit of Persecution in South Africa.

Human nature is the same in all parts of the world; and that manifestation of human nature which is seen in an attempt of the religious majority to coerce the minority by the infliction of civil disabilities and penalties, is not confined to any one land. The Transvaal government, which is deeply religious, is just now furnishing an example of this product of human nature, in refusing to grant to Catholics and Jews equal privileges with those accorded other denominations, in view of which a South African journal is moved to utter the following protest and plea for religious liberty:—

"A whole day's private sitting was occupied recently in the Pretoria Raad, discussing the Religious Disabilities Clause, in which it was decided not to grant equal rights to Jews and Catholics with other denominations. Why this difference? The reason was not given in the press report. We naturally inquire whether there could be a just reason for making this difference.

"Why should a Jew's or a Catholic's religion place him in a different relation to the state than the man who professes no religion, or who is a Protestant? What has the state to do with a man's religion? A man's religion has to do with his duty toward God, and in this duty neither his neighbor nor the state has a right to interfere. Why he should be deprived of his rights of citizenship because of his religion, we cannot understand. Does the religion of Jews and Catholics bring them into conflict with the laws of the state? Or is the Transvaal government fearful that one or the other of these religious bodies may come into power and then force their religion upon all other classes? If this be their fear, then is there not just as great danger from the Protestant bodies?

"Judging from observation, from public speeches, and the press, from church synods, and the proceedings of Parliaments, it would seem that there is greater danger of restriction in religious liberty from Protestant sources than from either Jews or Catholics. True the principles of Protestantism forbid any such thing; but it is a sad fact that many professed Protestants have sacrificed their principles, and are now ready to enforce church requirements by civil law. Every observer of public sentiment has doubtless noticed the growing tendency to unite religion with politics; for what purpose? O, to strengthen religion, and at the same time to place the government on a solid basis.

"Yes, that is just it. Somebody's religion must be built up. Whose shall it be? Evidently not the religion of the Jews or of the Catholics, in the Transvaal. It will be the religion of the most influential church, or combined churches—if they can unite on a basis of union. Such church, or combination, then petitions Parliament, and her wishes are enacted into law, and then—woe be to any who may conscientiously differ from the 'powers that be;' for are they not ordained of God? and would not resistance of the powers be to resist God? and to resist God brings the transgressor under condemnation of the divine law, does it not?

"This has been the process of reasoning by all persecuting religions, and because of this false view millions of genuine Christians have gone to a martyr's grave. Where did Christ tell his disciples to enforce his doctrines upon men? Such instruction cannot be found. We do find the very opposite of this, however; for Christ himself said, 'If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.' 'Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.' Christ leaves this to the will of the individual; but man would take the place of Christ, and force the will of his fellow-man. In this man shows his ignorance of Christianity. Without faith it is impossible to please God. If an individual then is compelled to do something in which he has no faith, is he pleasing God? The Lord says: 'Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.' It follows therefore that the power that would coerce a man's will, or a man's action against his will, compels that man to sin against God.

"But suppose the man refuses to obey the law which in his mind conflicts with his duty to God? Perhaps the reader would say, He must suffer the penalty of such refusal. Well, that is what Daniel chose to do, and God vindicated his choice. That is what Peter, and Paul, and nearly all the apostles chose to do; and we would like our readers to decide whether they made a wise choice. God has not left the matter of our personal relation to him—our individual responsibility—in the hands of any other man; nor has he delegated human governments with the least right to interfere with their subjects or to dictate to them in these matters."
