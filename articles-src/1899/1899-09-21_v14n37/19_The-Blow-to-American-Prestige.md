## The Blow to American Prestige.

*"Springfield Republican."*

MORE rumors come into Washington from Central and South America of a spreading distrust of the United States, and of combinations among these smaller republics to resist possible aggressions from the dominant power to the north. The news dispatches say that these rumors cause uneasiness in administration circles, and yet we have nothing to fear, have we? from any combination they can make, since in might of, arm we would still be as a giant to a dwarf.

No, it is not on this account that Washington is disturbed. Uneasiness exists because it is beginning to be realized that moral force is still a power among the nations, and that we cannot provoke the distrust and quiet unfriendliness of these neighboring States without injury to our commerce, our influence and our prestige in the ways of peace. It emphasizes the lamentable fact that we stand before the world morally discredited, and that our pretensions to disinterested motives in beginning and closing the war with Spain have become a joke and by-word among the nations.

Whether a country which gave such assurances to the world as we did, of being governed solely by considerations of humanity, and which proved to be not great enough morally to resist the very first temptation presented to turn the war to land-grabbing uses—whether such a nation is in a position to throw many stones at Erance at this moment may well be questioned. Are hypocrisy and weakness exhibited on such a scale more to be honored than a prostitution of justice to race prejudice and the so-called honor of an army machine?

We can still defy the world in arms, but we cannot so successfully defy that world-opinion which, without lifting a single musket, establishes and enforces a code of international law, and which can cause the greatest of nations to quail, as France is now finding to her cost—We have outraged republican sentiment wherever it exists, and provoked a return of suspicion and distrust and unfriendliness which must inflict upon us infinited damage as a moral force in the world.
