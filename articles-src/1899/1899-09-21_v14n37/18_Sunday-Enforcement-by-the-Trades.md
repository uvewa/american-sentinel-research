## Sunday Enforcement by the Trades.

The movement to enforce Sunday observance in Paterson, N. J., started by the barbers and icemen, is spreading, and may soon extend to all classes of business. This is a new method of securing Sunday enforcement, and one worthy of careful note. There is something about the enforcement of Sunday by the various trades, that suggests a text of prophetic scripture pointing to a time when "no man might buy or sell" save such as had the "mark" of a certain apostate religious power. See Rev. 13.

The progress of the Sunday movement in Paterson is thus described by *The Call*, of that city, in its issue of Sept. 13:—

"When the icemen of this city called upon Mayor Hinchliffe a few weeks ago with a request that his honor exert his influence in having all trade in the frozen product on the seventh day of the week suspended, it was little suspected that their action was to be the origin of a movement for the suspension of business in almost every line on the Sabbath. It seems, however, that such was the case inasmuch as that the barbers throughout the city and the butchers and grocers in the Riverside section since that time have inaugurated similar movements and are meeting with great success.

"Last evening one of the strongest and most influential organizations in the city seconded the movement and voted to lend its support in the endeavor to secure a proper observance of the Sabbath. The organization taking such action was the Grocers' Mutual Protective Association, a well attended meeting being held in its rooms in the Romaine building.

"At the present time the major portion of grocers in the city close their stores on the Sabbath, but a large number of the smaller retailers persist in doing business on Sundays. Some of the groceries with fruit stores attached are open from early morning till late at night on Sundays, and it is to this class that the association intends to direct its attention.

"Most of the representative grocers of the city were present at the meeting, and addresses strongly favoring the movement were delivered by several of the merchants. It was pointed out that there is a clause in the association's constitution prohibiting Sunday selling, and the privileges heretofore granted to some dealers to keep open on Sunday will be revoked.

"The action of the grocers will tend to decrease the Sunday street noises, as delivery wagons will not be permitted to travel about. This will be appreciated by many residents, as in some sections of the city vehicles are permitted to clatter about the streets for several hours each Sabbath morning.

"It was decided to assist the Riverside association in its endeavor to close up stores in that section on Sundays. The Riversiders' course in prosecuting the chief offender was approved.

"The association expressed its stand on the Sunday closing question in the following resolution, which was carried by the unanimous vote of all in attendance:—

"'Resolved, That this association stands ready to cooperate with and support the efforts of the butchers, barbers, and bakers in their efforts for a proper observance of the Sunday.'"

It is only to be expected that the movement thus begun in Paterson will be extended to other cities and to other States. It is quite as likely to be popular in one place as in another. And doubtless there will not be lacking to this end the fostering efforts of the numerous religious societies which seek every opportunity to promote Sunday enforcement.
