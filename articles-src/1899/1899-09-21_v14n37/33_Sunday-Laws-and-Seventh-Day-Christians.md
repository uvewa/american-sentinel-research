"SUNDAY laws do not compel seventh-day people to work on their Sabbath; they do not interfere at all with their worship on the seventh day," is an oft-made statement intended to justify such laws. Apparently it is true, before the seventh-day Christian gets into their toils; but when this is done, then, as a criminal, he is compelled to work on the seventh day regardless of everything; in case of refusal being subjected to the horrors of prison discipline. This justification of Sunday laws is as lame as that which it is intended to support.
