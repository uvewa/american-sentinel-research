## General Notes

This issue was processed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR source was reviewed and the following uncertainties were noted.

---

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 03 — "Expansion and the Rum Power"

- **Location:** Page 3 (continuation from page 2)
- **Issue:** The item about liquor exports begins on page 3 without a headline and follows immediately after the Canada/Michigan material. It ends with "—Union Signal." which identifies it as a reprint. It has been treated as a separate article reprinted from the Union Signal.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the reprint attribution is clear.

---

### Article 10 — "The Liberty of Christ" by B. W. Marsh

- **Location:** Page 7, body of article
- **Transcribed as:** "Man may break the heart of his fillowman"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW — "fillowman" appears to be an OCR error for "fellowman." However, per transcription rules, the original spelling as rendered in the OCR is preserved here, with this note. If access to the original scan is possible, this word should be verified.
- **Reason:** "fillowman" is not a word; "fellowman" is the likely intended word. The OCR may have misread the "e" as "i" and the "ow" cluster.

---

### Article 19 — "The Blow to American Prestige"

- **Location:** Page 10, paragraph 3
- **Transcribed as:** "Erance at this moment"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW — "Erance" is clearly an OCR error for "France." Preserved as found in OCR source; original scan should confirm.
- **Reason:** Context ("throwing stones at Erance") makes clear the intended word is "France."

---

### Article 19 — "The Blow to American Prestige"

- **Location:** Page 10, final paragraph
- **Transcribed as:** "must inflict upon us infinited damage"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW — "infinited" appears to be an OCR error for "infinite" or possibly "unlimited." Preserved as found in OCR; original scan should confirm.

---

### Article 11 — "War Is Not a Means of Grace"

- **Location:** Pages 7-8
- **Issue:** This short quotation from Bishop Thoburn (Methodist) appears between "The Liberty of Christ" and "Sunday Enforcement in Colonial Times." It has been treated as a separate reprint item attributed to Bishop Thoburn (Methodist). The dateline "(Manila)" appears in parentheses within the text as part of the quote.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — attribution is clear from text.

---

### Unattributed Material

- The "News, Notes, and Comment" section on pages 8-10 contains many short editorial items without individual bylines or attribution marks. All have been treated as editorial items.
- The "Discreditable Advice" article ends with "A. T. J." on the last line, which is standard attribution for Alonzo T. Jones.
- David Paulson, M.D. is explicitly identified by name as the author of "Abundance of Idleness."
- B. W. Marsh is explicitly identified by name as the author of "The Liberty of Christ."
- B. W. Marsh is not in the known authors list; initials BWM assigned.
- David Paulson, M.D. is not in the known authors list; initials DP assigned.
