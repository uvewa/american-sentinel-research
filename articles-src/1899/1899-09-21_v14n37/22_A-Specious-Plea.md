## A Specious Plea.

*"The Examiner" (Baptist).*

Archbishop Ireland does not approve of any efforts on the part of Protestants to affect the religious status of the inhabitants of our new island possessions. Judging from an interview with him published in the *Outlook*, he believes that the Catholic Church already has a first mortgage on them, and that, while many of the people may not live up to their faith, they have no idea of abandoning it for another.

The work of Protestant missionaries among them, he holds, would only tend to throw them into a state of absolute indifference or unbelief. It would also tend to make them distrust their American rulers, and lead to endless trouble. "If I were America's enemy to-day," he says, "I would say to American Protestants, Hurry on your missionaries to Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines, and have them tell the inhabitants of those islands that their historic faith is wrong and that they ought to become Protestants. This would be the speediest and most effective way to make the inhabitants of those islands discontented and opposed to America. . . . I speak as an American. Later on, when things are settled and when missionaries will be understood to be working in the name of their belief, and not as Americans, the question will be more easily solved as to what missionaries might be allowed to do."

This is an able but specious plea for Protestant inactivity in the Philippines, Cuba, and Porto Rico, but it hardly accords with the American doctrine of soul liberty. Should the archbishop's warning—or covert threat, as it seems to us—be heeded, we fear that the time will be far, far in the future, when things are sufficiently "settled" for the Protestant missionary to begin his work. No church or denomination has proprietary rights in any people—at least none which Rome is bound to respect. There is not a people or nation on the face of the globe where her emissaries are not to-day "under countless disguises, by a thousand arts," as Parkman well says, "luring, persuading, or compelling souls into the fold of Rome."
