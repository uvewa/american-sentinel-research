THE editor of a New York daily says the following:—

"William McKinley, President of the United States, was invited to lay a corner-stone. Any union that might have opposed his doing so on the ground 'not a union man' would have been justly considered idiotic.

"The Chicago stone masons elected Mr. McKinley to membership in their union and gave him a card.

"Mr. McKinley politely accepted. Thereupon he was informed that if he laid a corner-stone set by masons not members of the union he would be boycotted.

"Not only that, but wherever he might go hereafter to lay corner-stones, masons and others would declare a strike and forbid his laying the corner stone on the ground that he was a scab; and if he did any work on the building, even to rapping the stone with the trowel, no union workman could touch it.

"Could any stupidity be greater than this? Could there be any display of discourtesy more gross?"

Yet this is just the discourtesy—this is the tyranny—of all trade unions. They would not all exhibit it in the case of the President, but they would visit it upon people of lesser note, and that would be every bit as bad in principle. They are organized to fight tyranny, and do it by enforcing other tyranny,—by becoming themselves, in principle, like unto the thing which they combat. This is unfortunate, to say the least. Two wrongs do not make right, and two tyrannies in the place of one are not likely to increase the chances for the restoration of liberty.
