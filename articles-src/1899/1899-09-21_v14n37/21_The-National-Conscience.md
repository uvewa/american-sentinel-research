## The "National Conscience."

*New York "World."*

During the progress of the Dreyfus trial the hope of an acquittal was based chiefly on the relevant circumstance that Dreyfus was innocent, and also in part on the belief in the existence of a national conscience as a public influence.

The event has belied these reasonable expectations so completely as to suggest that a reliance on the workings of national conscience, even at the present day, is dangerous. It would have been absurd to have counted on any such influence in the days of the partitions of Poland or of the oppressions of the British colonies in America. But have we really advanced very far since then?

What part has the national conscience played in the partition of Africa or in the dealing with China? No interference of conscience prevented Germany from robbing France of Alsace and Lorraine, nor does it seem to influence Great Britain in dealing with the Transvaal republic.

We should like to believe that it was the province of our Republic to furnish to the world an example of the workings of conscience in national affairs, but even here, with the Philippine question before us, perhaps the less said about national conscience the better.
