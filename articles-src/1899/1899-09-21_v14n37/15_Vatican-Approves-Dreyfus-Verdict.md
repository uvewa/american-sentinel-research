THE Vatican approves the verdict given by the French military court in the Dreyfus case. So says the San, of this city, which is good Catholic authority. It says that "Cardinal Rampolla, in conversation with a diplomatist accredited to the Vatican, strongly expressed his delight over the verdict given by the Rennes court-martial." This was only to be expected from the Vatican in view of the fact that the Jesuits in France were leagued against Dreyfus. Jesuitism and militarism never antagonize each other.
