## Military Conscription Coming.

The specter of military conscription is menacing Great Britain, and is causing much uneasiness to men who are liable for military duty. And this fact is not without its lesson for citizens of the United States.

Protected as England is to day by an arm of the ocean which intervenes between her shores and the continent of Europe, and by a fleet which is able to ward off all danger from a hostile fleet, that country nevertheless finds herself confronted by the prospective necessity of military conscription, to maintain her army at the size deemed necessary to preserve the safety of the empire.

It is proposed by the British minister of war "that all persons between eighteen and thirty-five years be registered at their place of residence. Each county will be credited with the number of volunteers it furnishes for the army. The rest must be gathered in by conscription; but men of means will be permitted to buy themselves off, or to furnish a substitute."

Having reached the shores of Great Britain, crossing the stretch of ocean water between that country and the continent, the specter of military conscription has come measurably nearer to the United States. Now that the United States has advanced across the Pacific Ocean, it is separated from the domain of Old World strifes in Asia scarcely more than England is separated from her European rivals by the English Channel.

Great Britain needs a big army to protect her empire; and the same is true of other empires, and was always true of empires. Every empire on the earth today calls for a great standing army to defend it. And with the acquisition of American colonies, the same will be true of the empire of the United States.

A standing army of 25,000 men has sufficed for the United States while the broad oceans rolled between its territory and the "armed camp" of the Old World. How great an army will be required to defend American territory which is open to attack from this armed camp?

And when, as is now openly proposed, the United States shall actually join this armed conclave of world powers in dividing up the spoils of Asia, how large an army will be required to maintain the United States on an equal footing with its rival powers? A look at the size of the armies of those powers will furnish a sufficiently accurate answer.

The large standing army that will then be required will not be furnished by volunteers. Men do not volunteer to serve in a standing army as they volunteer in time of actual war. But one method of raising an army will then remain, and that is by conscription. And when military conscription becomes a standing necessity in this country, individual liberty will remain only to such as are able to buy it from the Government at the stipulated price.

Imperialism means empire, and empire means emperor and a large standing army. This in turn means military conscription, and military conscription means an end of individual liberty and self-government. In this way, if in no other, will the injustice of conquest abroad react upon liberty at home.

This is no fancy sketch. The world has reached a time when its great political powers are straining every nerve to develop military strength, and have armed themselves on the most gigantic scale; and any power that is to compete with them in the struggle for territory must do the same.

Commenting on the situation in England, the Westminster Gazette observes that "if the Peace Conference has produced some unanticipated results it has also been attended by some rather ironical circumstances. There is irony in the fact that we should be threatening war in South Africa, and that our War Minister should be reminding us rather ominously of the dormant conscription which exists even in the British empire, at the very moment when we are standing for peace and arbitration at the Hague." Yes; there is irony in the situation; there is a collision of sentiment with facts. But it is to facts that we must look, rather than to sentiment, if we would draw conclusions that will stand the test of time.
