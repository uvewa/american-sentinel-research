## Sunday Enforcement in Colonial Times.

The first case of persecution in this country of which record has been made, was for the profanation of Sunday. In an exchange we find the following account of it:—

"This occurred in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1676, and I think it will be of sufficient interest to give the entire record of the case. The question arose upon petition to the governor and council sitting in Boston, and is as follows:—

"To the honorable the Governor and Council now sitting in Boston, July 30, 1676—

"The petition of Jonathan Atherton humbly showeth: That your petitioner being a soldier under Captain Henchman, during their abode at Concord, Captain H. under pretense of your petitioner's profanation of the Sabbath had sentenced your petitioner to lose a fortnight's pay. Now, the thing that was alleged against your petitioner was that he cut a piece of an old hat to put in his shoes and emptied three or four cartridges. Now, there was great occasion and necessity for so doing, for his shoes were grown so big, by walking and riding in the wet and dew, that they galled his feet so that he was not able to go without pain; and his cartridges being in a bag were working with continual travel so that they lost the powder out, so that it was dangerous to carry them; besides, he did not know how soon he should be forced to make use of them, therefore he did account it lawful to do the same, yet, if it be deemed a breach of the Sabbath he desires to be humbled before the Lord and begs the pardon of his people for any offense done to them thereby. And doth humbly request the favor of your honors to consider the premises and to remit the fine imposed upon him and to give order to the committee for the war for the payment of his wages. So shall he forever pray."

"The decision of the council and the governor was as follows:—

"August, 1676.—The council sees no cause to grant the petitioner any relief."

This shows the persecuting spirit that is concealed in Sunday legislation, and the cruel and intolerant end that will surely be reached sooner or later from a beginning of Sunday enforcement, however mild. Admit the principle upon which all Sunday enforcement rests, and you will try in vain to fix a barrier in the various degrees of intolerance. The only sure way to keep intolerance from reaching the last degree, is to stop it at the very first degree; and that can be done only by repudiating the principle upon which it proceeds.
