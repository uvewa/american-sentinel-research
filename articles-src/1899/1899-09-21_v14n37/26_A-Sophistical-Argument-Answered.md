## A Sophistical Argument Answered.

To prove that the United States in its present course of conquest has not taken a departure from the pathway of justice and of republican principles of government, a leading argument advanced by defenders of the national policy has been that the coercion of the Southern States of the Union in 1861-'65 was as much a denial of the principle of government by consent of the governed, as is the submission enforced in the Philippines. This bit of sophistry is well disposed of by the following statement of facts and principles given by a contributor to the *Springfield Republican* (Mass.):—

"The fundamental cause of secession was not the denial of any rights whatever to the South, not even that of slavery, but was the arrogant determination of its leaders that that institution should be extended into the new States against the will of the majority in the North and West. Therefore, because the minority could not rule, they resolved to secede from a government of which they had become a part by their own consent, and from which they had suffered no infringement of their rights.

"Had the South seceded by reason of intolerable, despotic, crushing tyranny of the General Government even of a majority rule, it would have exercised a divine right and would probably have succeeded, but the foul blot of slavery, the only valid reason for separation, averted assistance.

"The refusal of a just and equitable government to allow a minor but integral portion of its people to withdraw therefrom in order to have a free hand in wrongful practises is no violation of the true meaning of the great principle of the consent of the governed, but is only the firm enforcement of an honorable contract and bears no comparison to the subjugation of a distant and alien people with the divine fire of liberty in their hearts."
