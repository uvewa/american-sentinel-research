**The Liberty of Christ.**

BY B. W. MARSH.

The least understood of all men, is the one who stands the staunchest for a principle of truth. When Satan had less experience than he now has, he succeeded in laying a plan that entrapped the parents of the human family, and almost smothered the truth beneath a fog of intolerance: and since that time God and his truth have been understood by but few of the human race.

It is not difficult to trace religious intolerance into heaven: and having found its origin, it is less difficult to follow it down through the ages. Lucifer became dissatisfied with the way God managed the universe; and desired to place his own mold on the affairs of heaven. Supremacy of self was the center of his ambition, and in order that he might attain that end, he planned to murder God, but lacked the power to execute his plan. It is plain enough that if he could have gained possession of the power it would only have been a question of time when he would have been the only intelligence in the universe.

When his warfare was confined to this earth he profited by his experience gained in heaven, and changed his tactics: and gained by stratagem on the earth that which he had lost in heaven. He traded man his own murderous intolerance for a world of peace and love, and set God's noblest creation at enmity with himself. And in the murder of Abel we have the first sheaf of the great harvest of religious intolerance this earth under its new management was to reap. Cain hated his brother because of his religion, and murder is the harvest of hate.

On this principle recorded on the first page of earth's sad history, rests all the plans of Satan for all time. He has often changed his tactics, but his original plan remains unchanged.

The elements of this are, Insatiable thirst for power, a self-willed way, and murderous hate toward all who oppose his plans.

The best way Satan has found to advance his cause in the earth is to work through apostate Christianity: and from this point will he make his final stand. He can here manifest great zeal, and yet so keep his motives covered as to lure millions to believe that his zeal is godly, and his motive of heavenly design. His plans are so cunningly laid that his zealous followers do not see the end of the path in which he leads them.

His supreme object is to combine all the elements of earth against God's people and the truth. But he sees that he cannot lead men to persecute inoffensive Christians without first educating them to believe that they have a cause for so doing. In order to accomplish this he must educate his subjects to raise a false standard of morality. He then has but to fire them with a zealous belief that they possess within themselves the power to work a reformation: and then the only logical outcome is to reverence the sayings of men above the law of God.

*His system of education is the most perfect his master-mind can invent; and the inevitable result of it must be a union of church and state in all nations.*

While Satan's system of work has for ages been one of sophistry and deceit, his object has been to educate the minds of his subjects to the point where he could reveal himself to them in his true character, and the only way he can do this is to possess men with his own attributes; and when this is accomplished, the Mystery of Iniquity, which is the Mystery of Selfishness, will stand clearly revealed.

In the united power of state and church, Babylon the Abomination of the Earth, will say, "I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow." Nevertheless the record of truth says: "Her plagues shall come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord that judge her." The time is soon coming when a deceived world will awake and their eyes will be opened to see what they have despised and lost.

God will not permit a universal law of force to long bear sway.

The climax of Satan's power will, when reached, bring his swift destruction, and will shatter every earthly hope.

The liberty of Christ, which knows no power but love, is the Christian's hope, and will give him the freedom of the universe.

Man may break the heart of his fillowman, and torture his life away; but he cannot force upon him one moment's peace of mind. And when the child of faith stands fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made him free, the combined powers of earth cannot take away his peace of mind, for it is the gift of God; and in the dungeon or on the rack his grace can give liberty to sing praises of victory to him who said, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."

*Goldfield, Col.*
