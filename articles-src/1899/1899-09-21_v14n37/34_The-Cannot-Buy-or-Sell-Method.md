Not long ago the American public were made familiar with the details of the street railway strike and boycott in the city of Cleveland, Ohio. A boycott was enforced against the car lines involved in the strike, and people who rode on those lines were "spotted" and could buy no goods at the stores where they had been reported. It proved, so it was said, a very effective means of enforcing an adverse attitude of the public toward the car companies. There is something about this that is suggestive. The cannot-buy-or-sell method of enforcing obedience to a human mandate has made its appearance, and how far off are we from that time prophetically described when "no man might buy nor sell save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name?"
