The journals of this city have recently devoted considerable space to a discussion and condemnation of "Christian Science,"—a so called method of treating disease in human beings. A female resident of a suburb of New York City, was taken ill with pleurisy, and was "treated" according to the principles of this "science," she being a believer in the same. The coroner's jury which investigated the case gave a verdict stating that the individuals who treated the patient "were guilty of a culpable negligence, which the public welfare requires should be stopped;" and earnestly recommended "that necessary steps be taken to accomplish that end." Two of these individuals were arrested and put under bail of $1,000 each, to await the action of the grand jury. This action of the civil authorities seems to have been received with general approval.

This is not the first time the SENTINEL has spoken of "Christian Science," and those who remember what it said on this subject know that it has no leaning in favor of such "science." It mentions the present case not to repeat what it has said, but to speak of other methods of "treating" the sick, practiced in the name of science by individuals of high standing in the medical profession, and not subjected to attention from a coroner's jury or the courts. The SENTINEL speaks of them because they are practices which set aside completely the doctrine of sacred, inalienable individual rights for which it stands.

"CHRISTIAN SCIENCE" invades the realm of individual rights when it lessens or destroys one's chances of retaining that "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" to which he is naturally entitled. But as the "Christian Science" method amounts to no treatment at all, it may be said of it that it does nothing to hasten the patient along the road to dissolution, as is often done by the administration of drugs. Unquestionably, drugs have killed a great many more people than have fallen victims to "Christian Science." These have been the victims of ignorance—of a mistaken belief followed out with an honest motive. But what must be said of practices where the deliberate intention of the operator is not to cure or relieve the sick, but to subject them to suffering and death if need be, in the interests of "science" alone?

RELIGION is not the only thing in the name of which men have ruthlessly invaded the sacred rights of their fellow-beings. Those rights have been and are to-day just as ruthlessly invaded in the name of science. It is possible for an individual to fall so completely under the spell of "science" that he becomes as much a zealot for it as ever contended for religion, and one no less dangerous to human interests. This is a fact; and it furnishes proof that "science" is not the saviour that the world needs. The world's hope of salvation lies not in that which appeals to the heart alone or to the head alone, but to both heart and head,—that Spirit which is the embodiment both of love and of omniscience.

We have received from the "American Humane Association," Chicago, a pamphlet treating upon the subject of vivisection performed on human beings. The subject is considered of course in its relation to those interests for which the association stands. Human vivisection is defined as "the practice of subjecting human beings, men, women, and children, who are patients in hospitals or asylums, to experiments involving pain, mutilation, disease, or death, for no object connected with their individual benefit but entirely for scientific purposes." We are asked by the association to give "a personal expression of opinion" upon the subject in the light of facts which the pamphlet presents. This we are very willing to do.

The vivisectionist idea of the value of human life was expressed by a writer in the N. Y. Independent, of December 12, 1895, thus: "A human life is nothing compared with a new fact in science. . . . The aim of science is the advancement of human knowledge at any sacrifice of human life. . . . If cats and guinea pigs can be put to any higher use than to advance science we do not know what it is. We do not know of any higher use we can put a man to."

What man? Does a vivisectionist know of no "higher use" he can put himself to than to be poisoned, mutilated and killed in the interests of his "science"?—Oh no; he knows of no higher use to which he can put "the other fellow."

But when a man holds to such doctrine, and carries it out in practice, he is himself of all men the most fit subject for this "higher use," which in his case would not only satisfy the demands of "science," but would rid the community of a dangerous menace to the most sacred interests human society has in its keeping.

A few of the facts cited in this pamphlet are the following:—

The *British Medical Journal* for July 3, 1897, mentions the experiments of an Italian doctor at Montevideo, South America, who wanted to find out whether he was correct in supposing that he had discovered the "germ" of yellow fever. A satisfactory way to settle the question would be to inoculate a number of well persons with the germs and note the result. So he obtained five unsuspecting victims from the immigrant quarantine station and from a hospital. These were his "material." To the vivisectionist a human being loses all personality and character as a soul related to God and man, to time and eternity, and becomes merely "matter."

Of his experiments and the results this physician said:—

"My experiments on man reached the number of five. . . . The injection of the filtered culture reproduced in man typical yellow fever. The fever, the congestion, the vomiting, the hemorrhages, the fatty degeneration of the liver, the headache, the backache, the inflammation of the kidneys, the jaundice, the delirium, the final collapse; in fine, all that conjunction of systems which constitutes the basis of the diagnosis of yellow fever I have seen unrolled before my eyes, thanks to the potent influence of the yellow fever poison made in my laboratory."

Another example is the following, reported by Dr. Jansen, of the Charity Hospital of Stockholm, Sweden, in a lecture before the Medical Society of that city:—

"When I began my experiments with black smallpox pus, I should, perhaps, have chosen animals for the purpose. But the most fit subjects, calves, were obtainable only at considerable cost. There was, besides, the cost of their keep, so I concluded to make my experiments upon the children of the Foundlings' Home, and obtained kind permission to do so from the head physician, Professor Medin.

"I selected fourteen children, who were inoculated day after day. Afterward I discontinued them, and used calves. . . . I did not continue my experiments on calves long, once because I despaired of gaining my ends within a limited period, and again because the calves were so expensive. I intend, however, to go back to my experiments in the Foundling Asylum at some future time."

Other examples might be cited, but these are sufficient as a sample of what is being done in "charity" hospitals and asylums in the name of science. Were ever deeds more perfectly diabolical in character? Was ever anything more utterly cruel than "science"? This is science with God left out—the "science" of the world, in contrast with the science of salvation. Science without God and religion without God are very much alike. Both are the essence of cruelty, and both are deadly enemies of human kind. Both ignore every individual right and every principle of justice and liberty.

As regards the bearing of the facts cited upon the question whether such things are done in the United States, the pamphlet says that while numerous scientific societies and medical associations in this country have protested against putting any restriction upon the practice of vivisection upon animals, not one, so far as known, "has ever made the faintest protest against the atrocious subjection of infants to mutilation, to inoculation with loathsome and sometime fatal disease, or to any other form of human vivisection. . . . It is here condoned by significant silence, and by absence of all condemnation on the part of scientific bodies."

Is deliberate murder justifiable in the interests of "science"? Does the State hold to such a view? Is murder to be made safe under the cloak of science? Certainly, if the State is to punish people who practice "Christian Science," which aims to cure the patient and at the worst only gives him no help, ten times more ought the State to punish the inhuman beings who do not scruple to put innocent babes to a more cruel death than the law allows to be inflicted upon the worst of criminals.
