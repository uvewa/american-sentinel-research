## Six Months in the Chain Gang for Working on Sunday.

Last January A. J. Waters, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Gainesville, Ga., was indicted for "working on the Lord's day." On May 16, in the county court he was convicted and fined $20 and costs, or six months in the chain-gang. The case now stands appealed to the supreme court of the State.

The Georgia law, by which Mr. Waters was tried, is as follows:—

"Any person who shall pursue his business, or the work of his ordinary calling on the Lord's day, works of necessity or charity only excepted, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."

The seven State witnesses testified that they had seen the defendant, or some one, plowing, cutting oats, and sawing wood on specified Sundays, but could not affirm that such works were performed by him regularly on Sundays, and neither they or the indictment alleged that farming was the defendant's "business" nor his "ordinary calling." The State, therefore, really failed to indict by not alleging that farming was the defendant's business, for the law can only apply to him who shall "pursue his business or the work of his ordinary calling," and the testimony of the witnesses proved that the defendant did these special lines of work only for a short time on special specified occasions which could not bring them beyond the possibility of coming within the exceptions of the law as works of necessity.

While the defendant did not justify the work done by the excepting clause of the law, he proved by the State's witnesses that the works they saw some one doing, and for which he was indicted, were works of necessity according to the popular interpretation of the law by the customs of that community, and this fact should have been sufficient to justify dismissing the case.

Again, as the law does not specify which is the "Lord's day," the defendant proceeded to show from the Bible that Saturday or the seventh day of the week was the Lord's day, and as he kept that day and did no work whatever, he could not be condemned by a law enforcing its observance.

As in all other cases of this kind the party foremost in the prosecution was a religious zealot—a kind of a preacher who is also a section boss on the railroad, and has men working for him on every Sunday in the year, and only a short time before the trial of the man he reported to the grand jury he worked a gang of men all day on a Sunday repairing a side track, which the men said, could have been done on the following Monday just as well.

The defendant did not employ counsel, but presented a simple statement of his conscientious convictions in regard to the observance of the seventh day Sabbath, and made a pathetic plea before the jury in behalf of his religious liberty, but it seemed that the persecuting spirit of 1737 that drove Wesley from Savannah back to England had again asserted itself in Georgia, and upon its return was in the possession of the Methodists and exercised against the Adventists, for we are informed that it is the Methodist element that is urging these prosecutions on account of their religious prejudice.

It ought not to require many such cases as this to convince our lawmakers that a law which gives one denomination the power to fine and imprison the members of another denomination is not a good law and is one that should be repealed.
