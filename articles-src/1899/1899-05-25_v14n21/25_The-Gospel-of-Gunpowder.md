## The Gospel of Gunpowder.

Wm. F. Dunbar, in New Orleans "Times-Democrat."

A NAKED savage stalwart stands
With bow and arrows in his hands,
And fights for his ancestral lands.

Beware the dart in David's sling,
O giant that would crush this Thing!—
For God still reigns as rightful King.

We're fighting dusky savages with slaughtering machines,
We're piling high the pagan dead in far off Philippines.
Our men are dying of disease, but do not shirk or shrink;
And I'm wondering, when it's ended, what the pitying Christ will think!

It doesn't matter—though we kill a thousand men a day,
We've got to have the islands for the gold we had to pay.
The creed that teaches "Tolerance, Fraternity and Love"
Was never meant for mortal men, but for the saints above.

We're marching on the "obvious way" to set creation right,
With canon and Krag-Jorgensens we flash our Christian light;
With gatling guns and ships of war, with bayonets and swords—
The "Destiny" of savages is ours, and not the Lord's.

With commandments all forgotten, the Bible out of date,
The "virtues of the fathers" we no longer emulate.
More land we must monopolize, and heathens must give way,—
No matter (when we get it) what the Saving Christ may say.
