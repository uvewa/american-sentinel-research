The annual national assembly of the Presbyterian Church in this country convened May 18 in Minneapolis. In the opening sermon, delivered by the retiring Moderator, Rev. Mr. Radcliffe, of Washington, D. C., the speaker said:—

"To-day, as we convene, the Peace Congress meets in the capital of Holland. The very call is the echo of Christ's prayer, 'Thy kingdom come.'

"In the presence of these opportunities the church cannot be careless. We dare not refuse obedience. He calls us to subjugation. Force is the only argument known to savages from Joshua to McKinley."

This is a doubtful sort of reference to the President, though evidently not so meant; but we would merely observe that it is rather startling, even at this day, to note a prominent representative of a leading Christian church thus deliberately advocating the "gospel of force." We trust this sentiment is not general in the Presbyterian body. This is certainly savage doctrine, and implies that the savages are not all in the islands of the sea.
