**THE** "best people in the world"—the religious people—are the very ones who are fitted to do and are doing the worst thing in politics; that is, forming a union of church and state. The best emperors of pagan Rome were the ones who most rigorously persecuted the Christians; and the more religious the people who engage in politics, the more danger is there that religion will be advanced by political means, and the church become united with the state. If the "best people" had kept out of politics, and let the "worst people" run politics, that worst of all things—the union of church and state—would never have been in civil government.
