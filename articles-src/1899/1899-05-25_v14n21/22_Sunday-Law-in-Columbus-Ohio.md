## Sunday Law in Columbus, Ohio.

In Columbus, Ohio, the Retail Grocers' Association has undertaken to enforce Sunday closing of grocery stores, so that its members who want to be religious can do so without losing anything. In connection with this movement an extraordinary ruling has been delivered by police judge Earnhardt, which ought to satisfy the most ardent advocate of Sunday enforcement. The judge declares that in the future persons arrested on Sunday for violation of the Sunday law or any other statute, must remain in jail until they are brought before a magistrate the following morning. His own words on the point are as follows:

"Hereafter it is ordered as a rule of practice of this court, and the court has such power, that in all cases where a person is arrested for the violation upon the Sabbath day he be detained in the city prison until an affidavit can be filed, and if one is filed the accused shall remain in prison until the arraignment the following morning.

"In all cases of arrest upon other days than the Sabbath after the affidavit is filed the clerk is authorized and required to accept a bond to his satisfaction as to surety . . . for the appearance of the accused in the police court at 8:30 o'clock a. m. the day following.

"This rule not including the Sabbath, may appear severe, and in some instances may work hardship, but it is a constitutional rule as broad as the wisdom of our fathers, and if a person seeks upon the Sabbath day to overthrow the law, the court takes the side of law and order."

And accordingly, any person who is arrested on Sunday in that city will be obliged under any circumstances to stay there until the following morning. No matter whether guilty or innocent, or how trivial the offense alleged against him he has no redress, because "it's Sunday."

In order that certain religious people may rest on Sunday at their homes, others must rest on that day in jail. In order that deference may be shown to a religious day, individual rights must be disregarded.

All this is characteristic of Sunday; but true Sabbath keeping never involves injustice to any person.

As a final reason for his ruling the judge said:

"If this was a prosecution by some outside body of men or persons, the court would look upon it with disfavor and impracticable, but as it is sought by the leading and by reputable gentlemen in the business, the court believes they know best what is for the physical and moral welfare of employer and employé and will not throw any obstacles in their way. At least the court will not fix a rule requiring the clerk to attend upon Sabbaths to aid those that by the judgment of associates are working injury to the business."

The Retail Grocers' Association must have been surprised to learn that it was accredited by the court with knowing what is for the "moral welfare" of individuals, since it is purely a business association, organized to promote the financial welfare of its members rather than to deal with questions of morals. The "moral welfare" involved is only another term for financial welfare. The "moral welfare" of some is made to depend upon the financial welfare of others. Unless the "moral welfare" of such as might want to keep open store on Sunday is attended to, there will be "loss to the business."

This is getting moral and financial interests strangely mixed, which confusion is characteristic of the effort to enforce a religious observance. Moral welfare and true financial welfare go together in the individual life; they cannot be separated. And the moral welfare always comes first. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these [temporal] things shall be added unto you."—Jesus Christ. Where the temporal interests are put first—where the "loss of business" is made the basis of measures for the "moral welfare,"—the divine order of things is reversed, and no good but only evil can be the result.
