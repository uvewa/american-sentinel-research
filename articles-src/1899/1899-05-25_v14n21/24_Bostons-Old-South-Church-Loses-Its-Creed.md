## Boston's "Old South Church" Loses Its Creed.

A press dispatch from Boston announces that the "new old South Church," Congregationalist, one of the oldest and most famous of Boston churches, has "formally thrown overboard" the "creed and confession of faith which was adopted in 1680 and which was for nearly two hundred years the test of admission." The creed, it is explained, has not been used since 1855, and "the congregation which heard it read last night was astonished at some of its moss-grown articles. They unanimously voted to abandon it."

The dispatch cites several articles from the creed, which relate mainly to the doctrine of predestination.

It is not strange that creeds are "outgrown" and discarded. Nothing else is to be expected, for that is the fate of every institution which represents the wisdom of man. And when a creed is outgrown and cast aside, it is only strange that men should not be able to learn from the fact the lesson that creeds are worthless, and save themselves the trouble of forming a new one.

This Boston church has now declared that the old creed was worthless. Some of its articles are astonishingly "moss-grown." If it is worthless now it was of course worthless when it was made, and has been so for the two hundred years it has been followed. And if it has been worthless, it has been worse than useless. If it has not been a help it has been a hindrance. If it has not been the truth it has been a lie, and as such it could not but be a serious detriment to the prosperity of the church. The ship of Zion cannot sail well with a cargo of error.

A new creed will be of no more value than the one discarded, and for the simple reason that it will be the handiwork of man, and can therefore form no proper basis of faith. Faith must rest on the word of God. There is no life in a creed—nothing to feed the soul; but the words of God "are spirit and they are life." A creed allows no room to expand, and without this there can be no growth, and without growth no life. The words of God are life because they are filled with infinite truth, which is more and more revealed as faith continues to be exercised. The student of God's Word can never arrive at the knowledge of all the truth they contain; he can be ever learning, and thus ever growing.

The only creed of any church, therefore, should be the Word of God. That is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; and nothing less than this ought to constitute a creed. And such a creed will never be outgrown.
