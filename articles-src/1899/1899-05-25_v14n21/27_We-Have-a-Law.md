**'We Have a Law.'**

[The following relative to the prosecution of Mr. A. J. Waters, for Sunday work, at Gainesville, Ga., appeared as an editorial in the Gainesville Eagle, of May 18. From it the reader may see how such prosecutions are viewed by some of Gainesville's residents:—]

Another twist has been given to the statutory religious persecution machine, commonly known as the Lord's day or Sunday law, and Mr. Burke Waters, an honest citizen, will have to pay out sixty-five dollars in hard-earned cash or serve a term as a leased convict—and for what, in this land of boasted freedom, of free speech, and free conscience? For obeying the command of God—for observing the fourth commandment—for serving his Creator according to the dictates of his conscience.

But "we have a law," so the Jews told Pilate—and that law a rudimentary fang, a survival in man of the primitive wild beast, an instrument with which an intensely-orthodox bigot may tear the flesh of his neighbor of differing creed; a survival despite the light that has dawned on the brain and conscience of men; that has survived in spite of the tenderness and charity that the Christ-life has infused into the great heart of humanity for nineteen hundred years.

The hauling of these Adventists before the grand juries is religious persecution pure and simple. It is always instigated by some fellow who is utterly devoid of religion himself—some hypocrite who does not care a rap for the sanctity of the Sabbath. If this were not true, why is it that none but Adventists are ever prosecuted for working on Sunday? And these sensitive, tender-hearted bigots who are so unutterably outraged by seeing an Adventist plowing on Sunday in his field four hundred yards from the road—why is it that they can go on Sunday and sit for hours and spit tobacco juice and listen to smutty stories in front of a livery stable, while the establishment is in full blast, breaking the Sabbath by hiring the tired and protesting dumb brutes to Sabbath-breaking picnickers?

Can any one tell why a man who believes the first day of the week is the Sabbath is not prosecuted for desecrating that day? Is it not as sinful to break the Sabbath, knowing you are breaking it, as it is to break it, believing you are not breaking it? Is it not as sinful to break the Sabbath for pay as it is to break it for conscience? The idea of the religious informer and the grand juror is that you may sin, but you mustn't believe you are doing right.

And right here is where the unspeakable infamy of the thing comes in—this censorship over conscience, participated in by the law and the religious spy. And here is where the rudimentary fang shows at its best, and where you see on it the blood-marks of the rack and the thumb-screw, those precious implements that were so effectual in persuading the minority to conform their belief to that of the majority.

We say again, and wish to impress it upon the people of our community, that this case of Burke Waters is an instance of the most reprehensible kind of religious persecution, instigated by men who are prejudiced against these Adventists, and who go out of their way to spy against them.

We believe in obeying the laws of the land. We believe in a quiet and orderly observance of the Sabbath, but it should be a matter of faith and conscience, rather than a conformity to police regulation. The observance of the fourth commandment should be a question of religion, and the State should interfere only to the extent of insuring protection, quietude, and order to such observances. The laws should not be used to persecute persons who, as a matter of conscience, keep holy the seventh day and work on the first, provided they are quiet and orderly and do not interfere with the personal or religious rights of their neighbors. And, above all, the law should not be used to oppress people who break it for conscientious reasons, while the more flagrant species of Sabbath-breaking goes unnoticed.

In most cases, you will notice, where persons have had their sensibilities shocked by seeing these Adventists at work on Sunday, the persons so shocked have traveled some distance out of their way to enjoy the luxury of the shock.
