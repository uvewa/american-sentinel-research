The hearing on the Rhode Island Sunday bill was held May 16, before a committee of the legislature, and the result was probably fatal to the bill, though the outcome of the matter is not definitely known. Only one person spoke in favor of the bill, while several speakers opposed it. Among these was the secretary of the New England Sabbath Protective League, who opposed the bill because it was not strict enough to suit the "Sabbath reform" idea. The spirit of Roger Williams seems, however, to be not yet dead in Rhode Island.
