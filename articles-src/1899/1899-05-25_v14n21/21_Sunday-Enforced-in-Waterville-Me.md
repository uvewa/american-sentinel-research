## Sunday Enforced in Waterville, Me.

A SUNDAY-CLOSING crusade has been started in Waterville, Me., which its promoters declare will be continued indefinitely. The facts as gathered from the Kennebec Journal, are these:—

The order to close on Sunday was issued by Mayor Philbrook, and applies to all places of business,—cigar stores, candy stores, drug stores (excepting an hour in the forenoon) included. Bicycle shops were allowed to do a "side-door" business, this concession being made on the ground that the bicycle business stood on a par with the livery business, which has no Sunday restrictions.

"Shortly before 10 o'clock, there was a crowd at different places on the street discussing the situation and the meaning of the movement. Half an hour later those who had become convinced that they could not find a cigar or anything of that kind in the city, except at the hotels, took the next car for Fairfield. As the result of that movement the street cars did a rushing business all day.

"The closing of the cigar and drug stores gave the hotel proprietors a rushing business at their cigar cases. One of the hotel keepers said that he had not done such a good business in the cigar line since he had been in the business."

Regarding news stands the mayor said he had given no orders. "He said that in spite of the cry made a few years ago against the Sunday newspapers, it had become recognized that the paper published on that day is a fixed institution. 'There is an understanding,' he said, 'that the news stands shall be open only while there is a demand for the papers.'"

"In reply to the question whether or not the Sunday closing is spasmodic, he said: 'No, sir, it is not. The rules will remain in force as long as I am mayor or until next March. I have not put on any extra police, but if it is necessary I will put on every man on the force on duty.'"

The reporter who interviewed the mayor on the subject adds that "It is simply a too open violation of the sacredness of the day which he wishes to stop."

"The sacredness of the day"—that is the idea which is at the bottom of the whole crusade; and that idea is a pure assumption. But supposing Sunday sacredness to be a fact and not an assumption, who knows what would constitute a violation of its sacredness and what would not? Why must the mayor's ideas on this point be taken in preference to those of any other intelligent resident of the city? Why should a civil magistrate constitute himself an authority in matters of religion?

And in rendering obedience in this matter to the mayor's decree, from a fear of the mayor's power, what else will the people be doing but keeping a day "sacred" to the mayor and the other individuals joined with him in this crusade? Where a human authority fixes the standard of "sacredness," and inspires the actuating motive which brings the people to it, what other than this human authority is honored in the proceeding? Candidly, is not this a correct statement of the facts?
