A New Sunday law is proposed for New Brunswick, its object being, as given, to "prevent the profanation of the Lord's day." It prohibits Sunday games and excursions, provides a fine of $100 for any person or corporation allowing their employés to work on Sunday, and of $20 or less for indulgence in such Sunday diversions as ball playing and running races.
