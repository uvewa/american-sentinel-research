---

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 04 — "Setting Aside Human Rights"
- **OCR text:** "**WROEVER** sets aside human rights..."
- **Second pass:** The bold lead word appears to be "WHOEVER" — standard Sentinel editorial style uses bold capitalized first word. "WROEVER" is an OCR error.
- **Transcribed as:** "WHOEVER"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — context and Sentinel formatting conventions confirm "WHOEVER"

### Article 13 — "The Constitution of American Imperialism.—No. 6"
- **Note:** This article contains two footnotes (marked * and †) that are printed at the bottom of pages 3 and 5 respectively. In the OCR, the footnote text for * appears mid-article (between points 6 and 7 as the OCR renders page 3's bottom content). The footnote for † appears after the main article body ends (at the bottom of page 5). Both footnotes have been preserved at the end of the transcription for continuity, which represents the most logical reading order even if the physical placement was at page bottoms.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the correct placement of footnote text relative to article body is inferred from context.

### Article 13 — Author attribution
- **Note:** The article is bylined "BY JOHN D. BRADLEY." This name does not appear in the known authors list. Treated as an explicit attribution with full name given.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — name clearly stated in byline.

### Article 15 — "Storm-Clouds"
- **Note:** Bylined "BY S. B. HORTON." Not in known authors list. Treated as explicit attribution.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

### Article 23 — "Bigotry and Intolerance"
- **Signed:** "G. B. T." at end of article. These initials are not in the known authors list.
- **Transcribed as:** attribution "explicit", author_short "GBT"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — initials clearly printed but identity unknown.

### Article 14 — "Saving the Nation" — Author name
- **Signed:** "BY R. M. KILGORE." Not in known authors list.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — name clearly stated in byline.

### Pages 14-15 — Ads and book listings
- Pages 14-15 contain a "MAP OF PALESTINE" advertisement and a "Books We Can Recommend" full-page book listing (Pacific Press publications). These are purely commercial/promotional content and have been skipped per instructions.

### Page 16 — "New York, May 25, 1899" section
- This section contains multiple brief editorial paragraphs without individual titles. Each has been given its own file with a descriptive title. The section also contains a cross-reference note ("On another page will be found particulars of the trial of Mr. Waters...") which serves as an editorial pointer rather than a standalone article; this pointer has been omitted as it is navigation text, not substantive content.
- Additionally the final two paragraphs of page 16 are cross-reference notes pointing readers to other articles in the issue ("Don't miss reading 'The Constitution of American Imperialism'..." and "'What will become of the Bible?'..."). These are editorial pointers, not standalone articles, and have been omitted.
