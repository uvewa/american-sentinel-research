As regards the question of how much the Filipinos need American civilization, one thing is certain; namely, that if the Filipinos have anything in their savagery that is worse than the American saloon, it has yet to be discovered and mentioned by any writer. There are some districts in the United States which might not unprofitably exchange their American civilization for that of the Filipinos, if they could thereby eliminate the saloon.
