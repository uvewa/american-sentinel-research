## What Will Happen to the Bible?

*New York "Sun."*

The Bible is now and has been for many years by far the most extensively circulated book in the world. It is sent forth annually by millions of copies, and among the religious agencies receiving most largely the contributions of the pious throughout the Protestant world are the Bible societies.

The Bible has been translated into hundreds of languages and dialects. Thirty years ago their number, as given by the British and Foreign Bible Society alone, was 173. Missionaries have constructed written languages for many peoples and tribes, with the single object of translating the Bible for their instruction in the way of salvation, and they have performed their pious task at the expense of enormous labor always, oftentimes of great sacrifice, and sometimes of cruel martyrdom. The whole missionary zeal of Protestantism has been inspired by absolute faith in the Bible as the inspired and unerring Word of God.

Now, what will happen if the view of the Bible held and propagated by the Briggs school becomes prevalent? Will not people begin to refuse contributions of money for the circulation of a book which they are taught to regard as human in its errors, more or less spurious in its authorship, largely fictitious, utterly incredible in its assertion of miracles as facts, and altogether misleading? If it is as faulty as Dr. Briggs and his fellow scholars make out, does not fairness to the people require that it should be published with warning explanations of its fallacies, contradictions, inventions, and misstatements, so that no one shall be deceived?

Is it wonderful, then, that Col. Ingersoll hailed Dr. Briggs and Bishop Potter last Sunday as allies of Tom Paine in his effort to bring the Bible into discredit?
