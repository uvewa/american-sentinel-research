## Saving the Nation.

BY R. M. KILGORE.

The highest tribunal in our Government has declared that this is a "Christian nation."

An association is formed, and is actively at work with the avowed object that this nation must be reformed. To accomplish this it is proposed to change the Constitution of our Government, incorporate into our national law all the laws, customs and usages of the Christian religion, and enforce the same with penalties.

If this is indeed a Christian nation, then to reform it would certainly change its character, and that would make it unchristian, which would destroy its prospect of salvation.

The theory that this Government must recognize, adopt, and enforce all the "Christian laws and usages" in order to save the people and nation, is contrary to the principles upon which Christ's plan is laid. If nations, as such, are, like sinners, to be saved, they must be "saved by grace, through faith," and they must be saved in order to be reformed. But sinners are neither saved or reformed by adopting and enforcing upon themselves Christian laws, or conforming to their usages. That would be self-righteousness, self-salvation, and Christ had died in vain.

To save a nation from the transgression of our law, by a change or an enforced obedience to another law, and the usage of another government, would make slaves of the people, instead of God's free men. The Filipinos are transferred to another kingdom, but they are neither transformed or reformed. They have, for years, longed for liberty, but the change has not made them free men and women. They submit to the new order of things, but unwillingly. They surrender because they are overpowered, and their cry for liberty may be hushed, while there lies lurking in their breasts the thirst for vengeance and blood, which, in time, gathers strength till an outburst is reached in a coming fearful storm.

The object of Christ's visit to this world was to "seek and to save that which was lost." If this nation is a "Christian nation" then it is already saved. If it is still sinning, and needs reforming, a change in the statute will not accomplish the end in view. There is no power in law or ordinances of any kind, to save from sinning.

This power is found only in the gospel, for "it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." "By these [exceeding great and precious promises] ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust." "He shall save his people from their sins."

How can the nation be saved from sin when it deals only with crime? The secret thoughts and purposes of the heart are hid from human eyes, and these sins remain unconfessed, while the nation "caught in the very act," goes unpunished. When will this nation be a partaker of the divine nature, and escape the corruption that is in the world? Until it does, is it a Christian nation?

Nations do not believe. They cannot legislate faith, nor can they take hold of a "substance which is hoped for," and such a commodity as "evidence not seen" is spurned at and rejected by the government. It will not be tolerated in any court. Yet this is faith, and the only faith that saves.

No nation has ever been reformed or converted from sin to righteousness. One whole city was saved because "the people believed God," when his servant Jonah announced the judgment then pending. "The people of Nineveh proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his great men (margin), saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything: let them not feed, nor drink water: but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not." Jonah 3:5–10.

Here stands alone a notable example of God's plan of saving a city. The same is true of a nation or a kingdom. It is not by a change of law, but of the hearts of the people, so that repentance, full and complete, works out an amendment of life. Then God stays his avenging hand and turns from his purpose to destroy. Jer. 18:7, 8.

The antediluvian world perished because they did not believe Noah, who proclaimed to them a message of righteousness. The vile inhabitants of the city of the plain scorned the message which righteous Lot preached to them, and their corruption ceased with their destruction. The Jewish nation would not believe Christ, while he wept over them. Their "house was left unto them desolate," and so it will remain. It, as a nation, is "cut off" forever. Rome never changes. Her doom is sealed. Our nation follows fast in the wake of its predecessors. Its tendency is downward. Men see it, and are calling for reform, but their scheme is not according to God's plan.

It is not a change of outward conditions, if giving men and women more favorable environments, or the more rigid enforcement of rules and regulations that inspires and produce right ways of living. That is not reform which begins without; reform must have its origin from within, and work outwardly. To know God, and Jesus Christ, whom he has sent, is eternal life.

Reform wrought out on this plan will save the individual, city, or nation. "The kingdom of God is within you." He will reign gloriously in every man and woman that will open the door and let him in. When this becomes a fact with every individual in the nation, then may we indeed be called a nation of Christians. Without this it can never be truthfully said that this is a "Christian nation."
