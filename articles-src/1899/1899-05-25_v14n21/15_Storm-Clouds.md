## Storm-Clouds.

BY S. B. HORTON.

The "trust plague" has gotten such a start and hold upon this country that a spirit of deep concern is being awakened. Many students and observers of this dread disease—greed—are crying aloud and sounding notes of alarm to a people whose liberties are being seriously trifled with, and who are likely to be treated as serfs in place of citizens ere a decade has taken its place in history.

The following from the New Orleans Times-Democrat is one of the blasts of the trumpet inviting attention to some storm-clouds:

"The philosophic observer of current events in the financial and industrial world cannot fail to remark the presence of storm-clouds of the most lowering kind. The announcement of the impending amalgamation of the interests concerned in the manufacture of steel into one colossal concern, with a capitalization of $800,000,000, is a quite unprecedented thing in the annals of finance. The new copper syndicate is capitalized at $70,000,000. From the present outlook, a capital of $100,000,000 will soon be considered to indicate very moderate pretensions on the part of the promoters of an industrial scheme.

"This remarkable state of affairs bears three aspects which it may be well to briefly consider.

1. What is to be the effect on the money markets and on the general status of securities? It is evident that a tremendous lockup of capital is in progress, and such a tendency almost always involves more or less disturbance of finances and values. It is notorious that many of the companies now in process of flotation are based on absurd over-valuation of the properties on which they are supposed to rest. So long as the public is disposed to look only on the brighter side of things, there will be no serious trouble; for chalk is cheap, and does its work so long as that hard schoolmaster, experience, is not abroad in the land. In the end, however, values must rest on earning power, and nobody has yet been able to make the American people go on with the contribution of their hard-earned wealth, in order that fat dividends may be paid on wind. Of course, the American Sugar Refining Company, and numerous similar corporations, have done wonders in this way; but the end is not yet. A really sinister event in the political or financial world would suffice to bring down the house of cards. The result would simply afford another illustration of the truth that a fool and his money are soon parted.

"2. What is to be the effect on the cost of production, in all the great departments of industry? From the standpoint of theory, the consumer is to be benefited as well as the capitalist, by the elimination of innumerable middlemen who are supposed to be drones in the hive, as things now stand. Is it so certain, however, that this theory is to be vindicated by the actual result? Every man of affairs is fully aware that the secret of success invariably lies in the most careful and personal supervision. Is such supervision physically possible in the case of these overgrown corporations, with their business spread over the expanse of a continent? Of course, bad management would escape detection much longer, but the ultimate results would be all the more disastrous.

"3. What is to be the effect of these appalling aggregations of capital, as regards the social and political life of the American people? The perpetuity of this Government is based on the fine individualism which has made itself felt in the most decisive way, at every critical moment of the nation's history. If the present process be carried to its legitimate conclusion, the great mass of Americans will be simply the salaried employees of the trusts, and the relation will be precisely that of the retainer to the baron, in the feudal days. Will the American consent to be a man without a future? Not unless his nature has undergone a fundamental change. What then would be the remedy for the disease in question? Obviously, state socialism would be the only refuge, and it might be accepted simply because the masses would prefer to be employees of the Government which they could control by their ballots.

"These are, indeed, questions of the largest import, since they concern the dearest interests of all the generations to come. Cheapness of production would be dearly bought, at the expense of the manhood which alone can prevent this great Government from being converted into a despotism of the most pitiless sort. Every system of life, whether in the moral or the physical world, is constructed after the manner of the coral reef. The most awe-inspiring results in the affairs of men are wrought out in silence from age to age. At the last, they stand forth with appalling distinctness, and stiffen the sinews of action in the most terrible way."

The subject of curtailing the avarice of these trust manipulators is engaging the attention of several governors of southern States, and it is proposed to have a convention of governors to map out uniform legislation by the States against the "plague." But will the scheme succeed? We would take an optimistic view of the matter did circumstances warrant it, but we believe that this country is following in the wake of ancient Rome, and how can we change the inexorable law of cause and effect?
