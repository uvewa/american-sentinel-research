## "Bigotry and Intolerance."

A minister in Essex County, New York, is preaching the commandments of God to the people. One of these commandments says that the seventh day is the Sabbath; the results of this work he communicates in a letter, as follows:

"Bigotry, prejudice, and intolerance has been manifested here in a degree that I did not think possible in an enlightened country. The pastor of the M. E. Church, not content with condemning us as a people and our methods of work, and warning his people against coming to the meetings, went and took counsel of a lawyer to see if there was not some way he could have me arrested and thus get rid of me for preaching against the so-called 'Christian Sabbath.'

What these gentlemen want, as was expressed by a noted apostle of national reform some time ago, is "law in this matter," and then they propose to make short work of those who do not worship according to their law.
