## Rhode Island People Protest.

Members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Rhode Island have prepared and sent to the legislature and governor of that State a protest against legislation for the enforced observance of Sunday. This has been done in view of the bill which is before the legislature, calling for additional legislation which will enforce the keeping of the day under heavy penalties. The protest is based upon civil and religious grounds, fortified by the lessons of history, and is a logical and forcible document. We would like to reproduce it entire, but its length will not permit. We give space to the following extracts:—

"We, the members of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination of the State of Rhode Island, would most earnestly and respectfully submit the following protest against any additional legislation for the enforced observance of Sunday commonly called the 'Lord's day.'

"We regard the observance of Sunday or Saturday, or any other day of the week, or the non-observance of those days, as a God-given and inherent right of each individual,—a right, therefore, which it is the very object of government to protect, and which no legislative majority has a right to interfere with. This we understand to be the civil theory of true Americanism.

"We know well that Sunday laws of various sorts have been registered on the statute books of most of the States from the colonial period. These laws, however, were understood by the fathers of the Republic, to be relics of the old church and state union; and it was hoped that, being unsanctioned by the Federal Government, they would soon become inoperative, and so be repealed.

**'THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS.'**

"On the obverse of the great seal of the United States is this motto in Latin: 'A New Order of Things.' By that seal the United States stands pledged before the world to take an advanced step in the practical application of the principles of liberty, and so to institute a new order of things.

"What was this new order of things to be? In all the past it had been thought that there were two orders of beings in the world, the ruling class, and the ruled. The first possessed, it was thought, all the rights; the last must content themselves with permissions from the dominant class. Under this theory of government, legislation was arbitrary, and the law was thought to create and confer rights. All this was to be changed in the 'new order of things.' The Declaration of Independence said: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'

"In the new order of things, government was to exist not to dominate a subject class, but to protect all men in the enjoyment of their inherent rights, and these rights were limited only by the equal rights of all. Laws were not to confer rights, or to take them away, but they were simply to define the natural, God-given rights.

"We most earnestly protest against the whole Sunday-law movement, as a complete denial of this 'new order of things' to which the United States Government stands pledged by its great seal before the world. Every man has an inherent, God-given right to the use of his time as he sees fit, and this right is limited only by the equal rights of all other men. If the Government at the request of the church can confiscate one seventh of a man's time and direct him as to just how he shall or shall not use that time, the whole theory of inherent rights is denied. It is now a mere matter of policy as to whether the Government shall direct as to his use of two-sevenths, of three-sevenths, or of all of his time, and so make him a slave. John Hampden said that if the king could tax him seven cents, he could, if he saw fit, confiscate all his estates, the whole principle of no taxation without representation was denied. It is so here.

"Secondly, we respectfully but earnestly protest against all these laws, as religious laws, as in just so far a union of church and state,—the church using the state to enforce its decrees,—and is therefore entirely contrary to the genius of our American Government and to the interests of that true Christianity which works only with the love power, and always from within. If one principle of the new, the American order of things, was the absolute civil equality of all men before the law, the other principle was the absolute religious independence of each individual before his Maker. God only has a right to command the consciences of men, and he does it only to uplift and set free; and even he has made men free to resist his will, and to refuse the slightest act of worship. He has therefore never commissioned any earthly ruler to do what he himself would not do, enforce his worship. All such legislation is therefore tyrannical. It is the church asking the state to bind men again in the chains of priestcraft."
