The pope, it is reported, has approved the speech made by Bishop Spaulding, of the Catholic Church, at the Anti-imperialist meeting held in Chicago April 30. In this speech the bishop referred to imperialism as being in contradiction to the basic principles of American government, and repugnant to the deepest and noblest sentiments of the American people. For this let the pope receive due credit. We wish he would do something every week of which the SENTINEL could speak with approval.
