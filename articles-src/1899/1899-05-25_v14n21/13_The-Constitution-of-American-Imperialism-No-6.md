## The Constitution of American Imperialism.—No. 6.

### BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

In concluding this series of articles we desire to state briefly its principal points.

1. Power uncontrolled by law and dictated by will is arbitrary power.

2. It has been declared by leading men of every profession, statesmen, editors, and publicists,—"men of high standing in the nation, representing the bench, the bar, the press, the pulpit, the universities, and the great business interests,"—that so far as it has to do with the policy of the American Government to-day, or with controlling the action of the Government or the nation, the Declaration of Independence amounts to nothing more than the paper upon which it is written; and that the Constitution, the supreme and organic law of the nation, is absolutely without limitation or restraint upon the men whom it was made to bind. Many have said this, and it has been expressed in many ways, but this is exactly what has been said.*

3. However, the doctrine of arbitrary power is not to be left thus naked in the presence of the American people. The form of constitutional government is to continue. The Constitution of the fathers remains, but for altogether other purposes than those for which it was ordained and established. It becomes the robe for the hideous and repulsive deformities of will government. For this purpose it becomes "elastic" and "expansive"—"the most expansive document ever written by the hand of man." As a garment for imperialism it is like the tent that Saladin gave to Richard. When it is folded it rests in a nutshell; when it is expanded whole armies can recline under its shade!

4. The sole use of this document is to "consecrate" and to "stamp legality" on all the acts of the men whom it does not bind. Its flexibility is determined alone by the demands of "time and occasion." When necessary "it can cover the world," and when necessary its most positive guarantees may be set at naught. We are given to understand its capacity for "contraction" by certain cases which it "contracted to suit." In these cases the trial by jury was denied and the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus was refused!

5. Therefore the very serious matter which concerns the American people just now is not the establishment of "stable" government in Asia, but the destruction of constitutional government in America.

6. The event which seven centuries have not dimmed and which is generally regarded as the most glorious in the annals of the English people was a complete and unequivocal denial of the doctrine which is proclaimed upon American soil in the year 1899, by Anglo-Saxons in the name of Anglo-Saxon civilization. The doctrine of arbitrary power is a violation of both the spirit and the letter of "the great Charter to which from age to age men have looked back as the groundwork of English liberty," and to which Anglo-Saxons have always appealed from the aggressions and usurpations of power. The close of the nineteenth century witnesses the adoption by Americans of the principles of government which Englishmen emphatically denied at the beginning of the thirteenth century.

7. The reason that is offered as to why it is all right for the American Government to proceed upon the principles of arbitrary power in defiance of the Declaration and the Constitution, is that the men who assume and who will exercise this power are too good, too just, too wise, and too humane to oppress anybody!

8. All human history echoes the words of the Scriptures, "On the side of their oppressors there was power." Despotic sovereigns were not born tyrants; by nature they were not worse than other men. They became despotic and cruel when they gained possession of power over their fellowmen. Human nature has never proved capable of restraining itself when in the possession of arbitrary power.

9. The language of inspiration has pronounced the exercise of such power "rebellion and supercilious contempt," and has branded the man who exercised it as "the extremely impious rebel."

10. The goodness which claims the right to trample on law is the worst thing in the universe.

Why is it that Americans will say and do such things? Why is it that all the lessons of human history, and especially the lessons of their own glorious history, are to be thrown aside? Why is it that all that the American Government has stood for in the world is to be trampled under foot as worse than nothing? The conclusion reached by Congressman Champ Clark, of Missouri, during the last session of Congress, is not a figure of speech, but is the literal truth. He said:—

"What subtle poison is working in the blood to produce a result so puzzling and so contradictory to our history and traditions? The evil one himself must have laid a spell upon the American mind for the purpose of luring to its destruction this great Republic, the last hope of constitutional government on the whole face of the earth."

But why does the evil one lure this Republic to destruction? Ah, he who has ruled the nation in anger, and whose continual stroke has been in wrath, knows that his oppressions must soon cease, and because he has but a short time he now has "great wrath." He is luring all nations to destruction; he is gathering them for the great battle of Armageddon. This nation could not go the way of all the nations until its principles were subverted; but when its principles are subverted all go faster than ever, because it has been those principles that have held the nations back from the full control of the evil one. He has therefore been the most active in the repudiation of those principles.

A few short months ago the great powers of Europe could have declared war and this nation would not have been involved. The evil one has so arranged things and so "laid a spell upon the American mind," that to-day if England should declare war this nation would be one of the first involved. The evil one has so arranged things that the nations instead of looking to this nation and being drawn toward peace and quietness and liberty, look, and then call for an increase of the armaments under which they are already staggering. The luring to destruction of this great Republic is something that is of the deepest meaning, not only to the people of this country, but to the people of every country. It marks the closing work of the arch-deceiver among the nations of the earth.

Why is it that with the assumption of the powers that have made all the tyrants and despots of history, such high professions of humanity and benevolence are made? Why is it that the professions of goodness and of disinterested benevolence over reach themselves and become nauseating, even exciting the contempt and disgust of European powers? Ah, it is written in the prophecy which this nation is fulfilling that "through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many." That was true of the imperial republic of Rome, and it is true of the image of the imperial republic of Rome. In the one case, the dragon spoke, in the other the image speaks "as a dragon." The prophecy is as true of the image as of the original beast. That is why Congressman Charles F. Cochran could say three months ago in Congress:—

"Why, sir, Froude's picture of the fall of the Roman Republic so aptly describes conditions now prevailing in the United States that, if unapprised of the subject under examination, one might readily mistake the great historian's picture of the last days of Roman liberty for a portraiture of the American Republic at this very hour."

In this series of articles we have had much to say of that glorious document written as the supreme law of this country by men who have long since passed into the grave. We have pointed out that which living men declare is to take its place. We do not contend that the living are bound by the dead. But we do say that there are some things that are affected neither by the living nor the dead. In conclusion we quote from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to Major Cartwright, an English gentleman, and dated Monticello, Virginia, June 5, 1824:—

"It has ever appeared to me that the difference between the whig and the tory of England is, that the whig deduces his rights from the Anglo-Saxon source, the tory from the Norman; and Hume, the great apostle of toryism, says, in so many words (note aa to chap. 42), that in the reign of the Stuarts, it was the people who encroached upon the sovereign who attempted as is pretended to usurp upon the people; this supposes the Norman usurpations to be rights in his successors; and again (c. 59), the commons established a principle which is noble in itself, and seems specious, but is belied by all history and experience, that the people are the origin of all just power! And where else will this degenerate son of science, this traitor of his fellowmen, find the origin of just power, if not in the majority of the society? Will it be in the minority, or in an individual of that minority?

"You will perceive by these details, that we have not so far perfected our constitutions as to venture to make them unchangeable—but still, in their present state we consider them not otherwise changeable, than by the immediate authority of the people, or a special election of representatives for that purpose expressly. They are till then the lex legum.

"But can they be made unchangeable? Can one generation bind another, and all others in succession forever? I think not. The Creator hath made the earth for the living, not the dead. Rights and powers can only belong to persons, not to things; not to mere matter unendowed with will—the dead are not even things. The particles of matter which composed their bodies make part now of the bodies of animals, vegetables, or minerals of a thousand forms. To what then are attached the rights and powers they hold while in the form of man? A generation may bind itself as long as its majority continues in life. When that has disappeared, another majority is in its place, holds all the rights and powers their predecessors once held, and may change their laws and institutions to suit themselves; nothing then is unchangeable BUT THE INHERENT AND UNALIENABLE RIGHTS OF MAN."

Republics may "to sickly greatness grow"; they may adopt the policy of "expansion" and contract into empires; constitutions may expand and they may contract; but when the remembrance of imperialism and its elastic constitution shall have perished, the self-evident truths will still remain "that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;" that all law and all government exists for the purpose of securing these rights to the beings whom God has made; that government by the consent of the governed is the only government that can secure these rights; and that there is no place in the universe for the rule of will.

"The Lord bringeth the counsel of the nations to naught:

He maketh the devices of the peoples to be of none effect.

The counsel of the Lord standeth fast forever,

The thoughts of his heart to all generations."

*Here is another expression which may be added to those quotations already given in these articles. On Sunday, May 7th, several large mass meetings were held in Chicago which were said to have been "a splendid demonstration of the loyalty of the people of Chicago to the Government of the United States in the performance of an unsought duty to humanity and civilization." At the largest of these mass meetings Dr. P. S. Henson, pastor of the First Baptist Church, in the course of "a vigorous speech," said:—

"As to that hallowed document which declares that all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, if that is to be literally construed there never was a greater falsehood palmed off by the devil upon a credulous world. It is not true of the government of God. . . . I do not think the principle will apply in a family. I am the father of a numerous progeny. I have not been accustomed to gather a congress of kids about my table to determine how the family should be run. And nations have their childhood just like infants. There never was a greater absurdity than the declaration that the people everywhere, regardless of character, regardless of advancement, of intelligence, and civilization, are fit subjects for popular government." He then refers to the civil war, at which time he says, "We shot that thing into smithereens." He says further: "You know whether all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed depends very much upon the people—the kind of people. There are conditions of society, there are nationalities for the government of which the iron hand is better than the hydra-headed monster."

This quotation goes to confirm what is already plainly evident, namely, that the representatives of the popular pulpit of this country are the very leaders in decrying and denouncing the principles of republican government. They go to greater lengths than anybody else in casting contempt and scorn upon the Declaration and the Constitution. This is natural; it is a case of "the logic of events." For years the representatives of the popular pulpit have been engaged in work which requires the repudiation of these principles. They have long demanded the substitution of "the iron hand" of despotism for the "hydro-headed monster" of free government Legislators under their influence have already repudiated the Protestant principles of the Constitution, and these representatives of the pulpit are only too glad to bring their influence to bear now in order that the principles they have so long advocated may be carried to their full length by the repudiation of the republican principles of the Constitution. We will give two quotations to illustrate the point we are making. At a joint convention of the National Reform Association, the State Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the American Sabbath Union, held at Sedalia, Mo., May 23, 24, 1889, Rev. D.W. Gray, who was secretary of the convention, made a speech, in which he said: "To appeal to divine authority in our legislation would be to fundamentally change the law of our land, or the principle adopted by our fathers, when they said that all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. I for one do not believe that as a political maxim. I do not believe that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. . . . Jefferson was under the influence of French ideas when the Constitution was framed, and that had something to do with leaving God out of the Constitution. . . . I see in this reform a Providence teaching us the necessity of recognizing something else besides the will of the people as the basis of government." And at the Chautauqua (N.Y.) Assembly in August following, Col. Elliott F. Shepard, speaking as president of the American Sabbath Union, said: "Governments do not derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." (*Italics supplied in above quotations.*)

†Since the above was written something has occurred which makes this quotation from Jefferson doubly applicable. A preacher of wide reputation at a mass meeting of national, if not of international, importance which was said to represent the convictions of the people of the second city of this country, saw fit to utter the following in a speech that was "repeatedly interrupted by tremendous cheers": "To-day there are those who wave the Declaration of Independence in our faces and tell us that the thing to do is to deliver over those islands of the Archipelago in the East to the people who are their rightful masters, for 'all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.' So wrote Thomas Jefferson. Do you remember that the Lord said to Joshua, 'My servant is dead?' And so is Thomas Jefferson. I do not believe that Thomas Jefferson was infallible. I believe that a live president in the year of grace 1899 is just as much of an authority as a president that lived and died a hundred years ago. I am no worshiper of a saint just because he is dead. Let the dead bury the dead."
