**AN EXCHANGE PRINTS THE FOLLOWING:**—

"Disregard for Sunday in the city of Philadelphia, as in every great city, grows with each succeeding year. A petition has lately been sent to Mayor Ashbridge, from the Board of Directors of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association, asking that the Sunday law be enforced with reference to a long list of items which accompanied the petition. According to the petition, business of almost every kind flourishes in that Quaker City."

The exchange thinks the petition will amount to nothing; but we are not sure of that by any means.
