## Sunday Enforcement in "Greater New York."

"GREATER NEW YORK" is at the present time under a "liberal" administration—so liberal in fact that a commission appointed by the legislature is in session conducting an inquiry into numerous charges of official corruption and demoralization in the city government; but as it now suddenly appears, there is one thing this liberality does not cover; namely, religious freedom in the observance of Sunday. The observance of Sunday is to be enforced to the prohibition of all public games and amusements on that day.

On Sunday last, the 14th inst., says the leading Brooklyn paper, "squads of police visited every open field where games were in progress and every inclosed park. No game was allowed to go on. In many instances the police, with drawn clubs, chased the players over open fields."

The N. Y. Sun, in commenting, cites several court decisions that have been made in this State touching the legality of Sunday baseball and the authority of the legislature in reference to general Sunday enforcement, and says:—

"In view of the construction which the courts have thus far placed upon the existing Sunday laws in this State it is obvious that the police commissioners of New York will run the risk of removal if they do not continue to pursue the same course which was adopted in the Borough of Queens last Sunday, in reference to the suppression of baseball upon the first day of the week."

This is a marked step in advance in the matter of Sunday enforcement in Greater New York.
