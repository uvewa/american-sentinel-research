# Uncertainties — v14n11, March 16, 1899

## General Notes

This issue was processed from a Mistral OCR transcription (`v14n11_1899-03-16.md`). The OCR source was generally clean and legible. No major reading uncertainties were encountered.

## Specific Items

### "The True Man" (file 17)
- **Author:** John M'Carthy (spelled with apostrophe in original, not McCarthy)
- **Attribution:** The poem is attributed to "Argentine Republic" at the end, similar to the "Thoughts Upon Intolerance" piece. John M'Carthy appears to be a contributor from Argentina; the attribution is treated as a reprint/contribution from that location.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — unclear whether "Argentine Republic" denotes a publication name or simply the contributor's location. Treated as reprint from that location.

### "Why It Was Not Done" (file 18)
- **Author:** H. F. Phelps — full name with byline "H. F. PHELPS." at start of article. No matching initials in the known authors list; recorded as HFP.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### "If We Let Him Thus Alone" (file 21)
- **Author initials:** F. E. B. — not in the known authors list. Recorded as FEB.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — initials appear at end of article.

### "Jimmie Green's Lesson" (file 34)
- **Author:** MRS. L. D. AVERY-STUTTLE — not in known authors list. Recorded as LDAS.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit at end of article.

### "Thoughts Upon Intolerance" (file 19)
- **Attribution:** Translated from the French by John McCarthy; dateline "Argentine Republic." Treated as a reprint/translation with original_publication "Argentine Republic."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "Argentine Republic" is the location of the translator, not a publication title per se.

### "A Serious Inconvenience" (file 33)
- The article contains two separate items: one about the established church in India (from *The Independent*), and immediately following it, the memorial of Felipe Agoncillo regarding the Philippines. These appear to be editorially joined on the same page without a clear separator in the OCR. They are kept in one file as they appear together in the original layout.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — could be two separate items; treated as one combined piece.

### News Notes and Comment — Short Items on Race/Assimilation (files 25–26)
- The OCR runs several short "News Notes and Comment" items together with bullet separators (•••). The items on the disbanding of the negro regiment and the subsequent commentary on assimilation are linked editorially and flow as a connected commentary. They have been grouped into two files: one for the regiment incident (file 25) and one for the broader assimilation commentary (file 26).
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — could be read as one continuous item or several.

## Page-Level Issues
