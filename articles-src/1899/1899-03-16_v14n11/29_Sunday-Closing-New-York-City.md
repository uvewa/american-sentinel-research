THE West Side Sunday Closing Association, of this city, have begun a crusade against Sunday opening of delicatessen shops; and on a recent Sunday, two proprietors of such shops were arrested and held for trial under the Sunday law. They affirm that they will make a test case of their right to sell food on Sunday undisturbed by the Sunday Closing Association.

Lawyer Gruber, who represents the defendants in the matter, gave this opinion of the merits of the Sunday closing crusade as concerning cases of this kind:

"Delicatessen stores are a blessing to the workingman's wife. She need not cook food Sunday afternoon, but can get what she wants for supper for her husband and children by sending to the store. Tired and weary with the work of the week, cooking, sleeping, and living in substantially the same room, the good wife of Straus, the carpenter, or McGinnis, the plasterer, wants a rest on Sunday afternoon and evening. She doesn't want to cook for the family and the friends who drop in.

"The little storekeeper who sells cooked ham, cheese, potato salad, and smoked fish is ready and willing to lighten her burden. Outside his store stands the righteous citizen who, forsaking all other duties to mankind for the time being, is watching with police escort for a violation of the Sunday law. A piece of ham is sold to Mrs. Straus. Horrible deed and crimson stain! Nothing will wipe out the stain but an arrest. The storekeeper, after kissing and quieting his crying wife and children, puts on his hat and coat and walks with the policeman to the station-house, a crowd following.

"And so we are now living in a part of New York City!"
