The Independent (N. Y.) calls attention to an "illustration of the inconvenience of an established church" which "is becoming very manifest in India." It says: "In view of the fact that the soldiers and a large part of the community are to a very great degree Nonconformists, it has seemed scarcely right that members of the Church of England should be the only ones provided with opportunities for service. Now, however, that the order has been issued granting these other communities the use of these churches on Government property, a vigorous protest has come from the Anglicans, who affirm that it is directly contrary to the whole spirit of the agreement by which these churches were erected. A protest has been addressed through the Bishop of Madras to the Government, and in case it does not meet with the answer that they expect they propose to bring the matter into Parliament to decide as to where the authority rests; whether the State has the right to give these churches regardless of the wishes of the bishops."

The memorial by the representative of the Filipino republican government, Felipe Agoncillo, to the Government of the United States, asking its recognition and sympathy, presents the following points as its basis and justification:

1. The United States, not having received from the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands authority to pass laws affecting them, its legislation as to their welfare possesses no binding force as against my people.

2. The purpose of the Filipino revolution was independence, and understanding this the United States encouraged the revolutionists to believe their desires would attain fruition.

3. The American Government for months has had in its possession evidence of the actual independence of the Filipinos.

4. Spain could not deliver possession of the Philippines to the United States, being herself ousted by their people, and, in fact, at the present moment the United States holds only an entrenched camp, controlling 143 square miles.

5. American purchase of public buildings, etc., in the Philippine Islands was ineffective, because the islands, having been lost by Spain to the Philippine republic, the last-named government had already by conquest acquired public property."
