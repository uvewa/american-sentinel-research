The Independent reports that "the question of giving Government aid to sectarian schools among Indians has, we hope, been finally settled by a compromise between the House, which allowed nothing for that purpose, and the Senate, which gave about $116,000, or 20 per cent. of the allowance for the year 1895. In conference it was decided to give contract schools next year 15 per cent. of the 1895 allowance, with the warning, 'this being the final appropriation for sectarian schools.'"

Not final, however, if Cardinal Gibbons and the rest of the Roman hierarchy in America can prevent it.
