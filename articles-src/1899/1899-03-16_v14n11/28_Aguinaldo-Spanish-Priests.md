THE Filipino leader, Aguinaldo, has a number of Spanish priests whom he is holding prisoners, whose release has long been sought by the Spanish government. The terms of release demanded by Aguinaldo are that the priests give up their landed estates, and that the pope recognize the full rights of the native clergy, as regards the coercive measures employed against them by their religious superiors. Evidently the Filipino leader knows that submission to American rule means that these religious demands will not be granted. If the Filipinos were assured of deliverance from the yoke of Rome, their submission would be much more readily obtained.
