BY JOHN M'CARTHY.

Give me the man who will dare
To stand up for conscience and right;
Who e'er his convictions can boldly declare,
And bravely God's battles can fight.

Give me the man who can love
An opponent who thinks not as he;
Who convinces by arguments framed up above
In God's mind; not by civil decree.

Give me the man who'll allow
Other men to be honest as he;
And not think he only has conscience, to know
What is best for humanity.

Give me the man who can stand
As a rock in the ocean, firm;
Who can lift up the standard of truth with brave hand;
Not slink off as a grovelling worm.

Give me the man who will live
In the light of the golden rule;
Who ne'er for a moment another would grieve,
Nor the rights of a brother annul.

This is the man who can show
By theory and practice as well,
The power of religion, he fully doth know
Of God's grace which the soul can heal.

Resolve ye henceforth to be true
To the principles noble, divine;
And although in this world ye may number but few
In so doing with God ye combine.

*Argentine Republic.*
