A bill to legalize the running of Sunday street cars and the selling of newspapers and the opening of barber shops on Sundays, is before the legislature of Pennsylvania. It might be well to inquire, in considering the proposed measure, how the morality of the people of Pennsylvania compares with that of people in States where there are no such restrictions. What good purpose have such restrictions ever served?
