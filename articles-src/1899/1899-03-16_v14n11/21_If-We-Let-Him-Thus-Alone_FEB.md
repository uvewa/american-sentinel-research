*(Concluded.)*

In behalf of church and state interests, it was decided in the synagogue of Satan, that it was not safe to let Christ alone, and again and again the same reason has been reiterated for persecution against his followers. In the early Christian centuries God's truth inspired men with the same fear, and earthly governments and churchly councils arrayed themselves against the advocates of Christianity. Paganism brought forth the same excuse for persecution, screaming "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!" and declaring that "these men who turn the world upside down, are come hither also." Romanism took up the same cry, and hunted the Waldenses from Italy, the Albigenses and Huguenots from France. Luther was brought before Worms on the plea that it was not safe to let him alone. The noble army of martyrs of all ages testify to the cruelty of the outcome of such counsel; for it did not hinder the nation from being swept away,—rather made its doom sure and its destruction inevitable.

Well would it have been for councils if they had listened to their Gamaliels. Was there not always some voice of wisdom that said, "Take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. . . . And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found to fight against God."

Why are men so slow to heed the warning of history? While denouncing the Pharisees of Christ's day for crucifying him, they carry out the same spirit, and maintain the same attitude toward the true cause and people of God. They repeat the same words, startling by their semblance to the words of old, "If we let them alone, all men will believe as they do, and some terrible calamity will be the outcome."

And yet what would happen? To believe the word of God brings salvation to the soul. Faith in the divine commands would rid the world of strife, sin, selfishness, war, and anarchy, and would bring in a reign of peace and righteousness. It is lack of faith in God's word that hinders men from doing his law. Why, then, with results of peace and righteousness following faith in God's word, do men declare that it is not safe to let the advocates of truth alone?

Many congratulate themselves to-day that they did not live in the terrible times when persecution raged, and when a man could not be left alone to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and fondly declare that the world has left the barbarism of the past; but how small is the cause for congratulation, and what vanishing reasons for a claim for higher civilization! The time is not yet at hand when men are let alone in the exercise of their God given rights. There has been a brief season of respite from the powers of darkness; but the prince of evil is not dead, and until he is chained in the pit, tyranny will not be forever past.

Already Pharisaic councils have gathered together, and have said, "Something must be done to stop this agitation of the Sabbath question. If it is let alone, we shall suffer national overthrow, we shall go back to anarchy and ruin." Already righteous men have been thrust in prison, have worked in the chain gang, have been sentenced to the stocks, and there are efforts being put forth to revive blue Sunday laws, and to secure general legislation on this question. The voice of the Pharisaic council has been heard in all lands. In free Switzerland men have languished in prison for their loyalty to God's word. In Russia the Stundists and Baptists have suffered cruel persecution, and the old cry has its echo in Europe and America.

The dragon is wroth with the remnant of God's people, and has instigated church and state leaders to carry on his war against the Christ in the person of his saints. Let society rub its sleepy eyes; for it was while men slept that the enemy sowed his tares. As Americans, we have prided ourselves on the absolute freedom we have attained, that has been guaranteed to us by our Constitution, by our Declaration of Independence, and by the spirit of our institutions and principles. Secure in the exercise of our rights, we have slumbered and slept, and have forgotten that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." The lessons of history have been forgotten, the principles once so dear to Americans have been ignored. We have ceased to read history, ceased to discuss problems of vital importance to the maintenance of our free institutions, and the enemy, seeing our indifference, has taken advantage of our false security, and woven about us his old net of despotism.

The very fact that men are ready to enslave foreign captives, endangers the free citizens at home; for we reap what we sow. The very fact that there is a clamoring for a law that will oppress a class of conscientious worshippers of God, concerning whom no fault can be found, save concerning the law of their God, proves how frail is the barrier against a sea of persecution and oppression. He who binds his brother's conscience enchains his own. Those who declared that it was unsafe to let Christ alone, and who nailed him to the cross, were themselves crucified by the Romans they feared would come and take away their place and nation, if Christ were not put to death.

It is not yet too late to hush this Pharasaic cry against God's work and workers. Let all open their neglected Bibles, and ask for the guidance of the unerring Spirit, and hear the voice of the True Shepherd, and take their stand where he leadeth, lest happy they be found to fight against God: "for if this work be of God, ye cannot overthrow it." It may suffer a seeming defeat. Laws may be made whereby its advocates may suffer and die. Men crucified the Lord, but in three days he rose triumphant over death and the grave, and was exalted far above all principalities and powers. God's witnesses may be slain, and men may be so deceived as to think that in killing them they are doing God service; but their blood will be required at their hands, and after all it will be found that their work of death accomplished nothing against the truth, but wrought simply their own ruin.

The judgment will set, the books will be opened, and whatsoever has been done against God's people, will be recorded as done unto the Prince of life and glory. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." The least that men and nations can do for God's work and workers, is to let them alone. "Every man shall give account of himself to God."
