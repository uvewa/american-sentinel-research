A REGIMENT of negro "immunes," having recently been disbanded in one of the Southern army camps, were taken by train through Georgia, and on the way conducted themselves in the manner of rioters, discharging firearms at houses and people along the route, and creating a general panic. While this conduct may have been largely due to the liberal use of whiskey with which the regiment had supplied itself, it still does not speak well for the discipline maintained in the camp and for the spirit which is bred by army life.
