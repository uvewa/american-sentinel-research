In a speech before Congress by Hon. J. D. Botkin, of Kansas, on the subject of army reorganization, we note the following:

"I desire to say, Mr. Chairman, that the most astonishing feature of this nation-wide discussion is the stand taken by many zealous propagandists of the religion of Jesus in favor of 'criminal aggression' in the Philippines. I am informed that a number of eminent ministers in the church to which I have the honor to belong, are insistent upon the organization of a powerful army for the forcible occupancy of those islands, presumably to the end that missionaries may safely go there to establish the church.

"I hold it to be the duty of this Government to protect American citizens, of whatever color, politics, or religion, engaged in legitimate business anywhere in this world. . . . But American soldiers must not be used to forcibly establish any religion or any church anywhere in this world. Christianity does not propose to conquer by force, but by the resistless power of love. You cannot shoot the religion of Jesus into the Filipinos with 13-inch guns, nor punch it into them with American bayonets. The only instance on record of the attempted use of the sword in defense of the Prince of Peace was in the garden when he was in the hands of a mob; and he said to Peter, 'Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.'"
