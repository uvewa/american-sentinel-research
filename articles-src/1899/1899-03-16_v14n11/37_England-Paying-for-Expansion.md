ENGLAND is paying dear for "expansion." Although the revenue of the British government is this year seven and a half million dollars more than that of any previous year, there is a deficit of twenty-five millions, which is said to be due entirely to the "jingo" policy of Lord Salisbury. There is a permanent increase made of just this sum in the expenditures for the army and navy. Out of a total revenue of $515,000,000, no less than $350,000,000 is required to maintain the army and navy at the standard of efficiency deemed necessary to meet the demands of the expanding empire.

To meet this deficit various expedients are suggested, none of which are relished by the people who have to "foot" these huge bills. The taxes must be made heavier; and if all this occurs at a time of unusual prosperity, how much greater will be the distress when the prosperous period shall have passed? This is the most serious question to be considered. "Expansion" carried beyond certain limits always means explosion and collapse.
