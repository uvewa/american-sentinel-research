*Translated from the French; by John McCarthy.*

**SHALL** we persecute those to whom God gives liberty?—*San Agustin.*

I do not come to preach of toleration; liberty of religion in its fullest sense is to my mind a right far more sacred than mere "tolerance," the which in itself is somewhat tyrannical, because the authority which tolerates, can also at their pleasure withdraw such toleration.—*Mirabeau.*

When you desire to create hypocrites, and impious persons, be fanatical and intolerant.—*Chateaubriand.*

To preach intolerance is to submit the Christian faith to the police; to do this would give the lie to the Primitive Church; justify the reason of the State, and the cruelty of Caesar.—*Laboulaye.*

From the inutility of the great persecutions, and terrible tortures, religious liberty first gave birth.—*Edm de Girardin.*

To have a very high opinion of one's own conjectures is to roast a man alive.—*Montaigne.*

Absolute liberty in the religious controversy is the result of the principle of religious liberty.—*Villemain.*

The republic of France [also the United States] has proclaimed that all men are free born, and all have equal rights, and none should be interfered with, nor molested because of their religious opinions; and that the Constitution recognizes only citizens, and guarantees to all without distinction, liberty of conscience. If we put an end to this grand principle, other nations will remember the same. They think that in the French [or American] soul is born the disposition to value men because of their honesty and intrinsic merit; and not judge them because of their birth, social condition, or religious confession.—*Emile Boutroux.*

*Argentine Republic.*
