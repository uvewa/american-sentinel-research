Some very valuable facts are being elicited in connection with the inquiry being conducted by the Government regarding the preparation of beef for the market,—facts that are "mighty interesting," or should be, to American beef eaters.

It has been testified, among other things, that beef which is condemned by the inspectors and thrown into a tank provided as a receptacle for diseased meat, is afterwards hauled out with grappling hooks, packed and sold for good beef. This testimony was given by Dr. W. S. Devoe, chief inspector of the Bureau of Animal Industry at the Chicago stock yards.

This testimony supplements that given by Mr. Tom Dolan, who was for several years a foreman in the employ of Armour and Co. To these is now added the affidavit of Mr. W. W. Budlong, ex-manager in Rhode Island for the firm of Nelson Morris & Co. From this affidavit we republish the following paragraphs, as giving information which every responsible American—and especially beef eaters—ought to know:

"I know personally that tons upon tons of poor beef, bad beef, ulcerated, tuberculous, carrion beef, have come into Rhode Island and been sold here at good prices to people who paid for good, wholesome beef and thought they were getting it. I was the agent of Nelson Morris & Co., and saw fit to remonstrate with a representative of the firm when a particularly horrifying sample came in the fall of 1893, I think it was. It was a side of beef and it contained a big ulcer. It also bore a yellow tag, about 2x4 inches, affixed by a United States inspector in Chicago, where the beef was packed, bearing the words in bold type, 'Condemned.' I am almost sure I called the attention of George Bradley to it. He was at that time assistant manager for Hyman, the packing company's general Eastern agent, with headquarters at Manhattan Market, New York City, and asked him what should be done with the condemned beef. I was told to sell it, and to sell everything that came to me, condemnation tag or no tag. I was there, he said, to sell beef, and not to inspect or criticise it.

"After that many of the consignments to me would be made up of poor, light cattle. Though dead and dressed it did not require the experienced eye of an expert butcher to detect that it came from broken-down or diseased cows, bullocks, etc., the worst on the market. They would come sometimes in horrible shape, the kidneys having been removed to conceal the presence of disease. Some would be full of ulcers and evidences of tuberculosis.

"I have seen ulcers bigger than your fist in some of the backs and sides sent to me, for sale, and the liver was unspeakably bad; but it was all sold, according to instructions."

"Any amount of bad beef with the tuberculous germs scraped off the ribs, as Mr. Dolan says, and no more fit to be sold for food than a dead cat in the street, has come into Providence and been sold. Some of it had been inspected and condemned, some had passed muster, but ought to have been condemned, and other portions had probably not even been seen by the inspectors.

"I have known that lots of the cattle sent here must have been dead before it was 'killed' officially, as was shown by the stagnated blood. Other lots of cattle that had been poorly bled, showing that they were in poor condition when killed, were sent here regularly. These lots have been killed when the cattle were in a dying condition, apparently to save it, for the blood was all clotted in the carcass."

"If the public only knew a small part of the fraud that is practised upon it by the packers a howl of indignation would go up that would astonish the nation."

"It is easier than it appears to be to dispose of the very worst looking lots of beef. A diseased piece is cut up and sold by chucks, bunch lots and ribs. One buying a lot of ribs or chucks would always get at least one piece of the diseased beef in with it. Good beef is not cheap. Cheap beef is not good. You may depend upon these two statements."

The moral to be drawn from all this is plain enough: the only safe course—for the average person at least—is to discard beef. Corpse—of beef or any other animal—is not a necessary article of food; it is not necessary to make your stomach a burial ground. There is, fortunately, no necessity for any person's falling a victim to the Beef Trust.
