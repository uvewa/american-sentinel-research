It is announced that the Japanese government is considering the advisability of making Christianity the state religion of Japan. If so, that government needs to be informed that the thing cannot be done. Christianity was never the state religion in any country or at any time; and it cannot be made a state religion to-day. Christianity is love; and love cannot be enforced. All that can be enforced by the state is the letter of Christianity without the spirit; but "the letter [alone] killeth"! This is just what state religions which claimed to be Christianity have always done—they have killed people. The time when state religion—professedly Christianity—was the most general, the most logical in what it did, and the most faithfully carried into effect, was during the Dark Ages, when good people by the million were being put to death for being dissenters. Let Japan be admonished by the lessons of history.
