Don't worry about whether the Sabbath is going to be "preserved" or not. God's Sabbath—the only one that is worth anything—is a living thing, giving life to man, so that he is refreshed in keeping it. It does not call upon men for their aid to preserve its life; it calls upon them to receive the life it has to impart, and that in never-failing measure.
