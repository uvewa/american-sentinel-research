EX-REGISTRAR BRUENER, of the local land office at St. Cloud, Minn., who is a staunch German Catholic, says of the recent transfer of land in that State by the Government to Archbishop Ireland, that "there is inside history which reflects no credit upon him as a Catholic prelate." The land secured by the archbishop was a tract of thousands of acres, upon which there were many settlers.
