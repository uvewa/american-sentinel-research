The bills now before the Connecticut legislature relating to Sunday observance, represent an effort to modify a law which is thoroughly Puritanical. Under this law no trains can be run on Sundays between "church hours,"—that is, between 10:30 a. m. and 3 p. m. Outside this interdicted period trains carrying milk and other "perishable" freight may be run; but no passenger trains; and a penalty of $50 fine is provided for the accepting by a railroad company of any reduced-rate ticket on that day. The penalty for violation of the general Sunday law is a fine of $250. The "rural legislators," it has been remarked, "offer no opposition to the milk trains for the reason doubtless that in many cases it is their milk which those trains are carrying to market."

The present Sunday law of Connecticut was enacted only twelve years ago,—an evidence of the vitality of the seed of Puritanism.
