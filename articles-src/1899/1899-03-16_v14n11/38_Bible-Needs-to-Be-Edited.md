THE Rev. S. P. Cadman, Methodist, pastor of the Metropolitan Temple in this city, says that the Bible needs to be edited. The same thing is said by many others who pose as Christian teachers; they want the Bible edited, and of course (though they do not say it) they are the ones to do the editing. They want to edit the Bible in order to get rid of the miraculous part of it—the creation in six days, the story of Joshua and the sun, Jonah and the whale, etc.

We have no use for a Bible that has had a human editor. That would be at best only a curiosity. For salvation, the Bible as God has edited it is infinitely preferable. A Bible without miracles in it would not bring much hope to us, for our salvation must be a miracle. A god who cannot work miracles cannot save anybody from sin.
