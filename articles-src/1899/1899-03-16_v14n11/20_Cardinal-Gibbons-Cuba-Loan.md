**CARDINAL GIBBONS** says that during the Cuban war the church in Cuba loaned the Spanish government many millions, none of which has been repaid, for the return of which it must look to Spain. One wonders how it got so many millions to lend. Imagine the Presbyterian Church or the Episcopal Church or the Roman Catholic Church in this country lending the United States Government millions of dollars! It was time for disestablishment.—*The Independent.*
