The New York Journal offers the following explanation of the fact that poor people are falling away from the church:—

"The clergy wonder once in awhile why it is that the poor and lowly stay away from church so much.

"Quite sensibly the good preachers say: 'The poor man has nothing here below. We are prepared to give him everything in the future state and to tell him all about the camel and the needle's eye. Why does he not come to hear us? We have comfort for the most hard up.'

"We think perhaps the poor man notices that modern churches are not fixed up on the 'needle's eye' plan. The richest man manages to pass through the door of the best pew, and in that best pew the poor man would be made to feel as thoroughly out of place as any camel that might happen to stray in.'

As a remedy for the situation, the Journal says the poor people should be given "first-class religion"; that cognizance should be taken of the fact that the poor man "looks upon himself as the equal of his neighbor, and demands to have his soul saved in first class manner by first-class ability, if at all."

This is true enough; and very fortunately for the poor man, soul salvation (unlike political or social salvation) is as accessible to the poor man as to any other. "First-class religion" is as free for the poor man as for the rich, and the poor man's soul will be saved if at all, "in first class manner by first-class ability;" since God himself provides the means of salvation and Jesus Christ represents the very highest ability that could possibly be employed in the matter.

"First-class ability," as recognized in this world, is very often associated with second-class religion, in which there is no salvation for either poor or rich. First-class religion is the old gospel of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, and that gospel is "the power of God." Rom. 1:16.

"First-class" religion and first-class salvation cannot be shut away from the poor man by any power except that of his own unbelief. With these a pew in a "first-class" church where one can listen to sermons by "first-class talent" have no necessary connection whatever. If religion could be controlled by a Trust it might soon be beyond the poor man's reach; but no Trust can control the Word and power of God.

If the poor man feels that he is shut away from the church to-day, he need not and should not feel that he is shut away from the best religion and the highest salvation.
