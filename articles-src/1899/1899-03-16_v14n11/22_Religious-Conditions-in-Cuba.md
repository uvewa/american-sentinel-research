In a letter from Rev. J. D. Kingsbury, commissioner to Cuba from the American Missionary Association, written to the Congregationalist, are stated the following interesting facts concerning the present religious conditions in Cuba:

"The religious condition of Cuba is in a state of transition. The priests have been in full control. Every acre of land was valued at its sale and paid on that valuation ever after a certain percentage each year to the church. This was the only land tax. The league between the church and the state made it impossible for any Protestant faith to get foothold, and being in sole possession the Catholic Church laid a heavy tax on everything. It was so expensive to be married that many Cubans were never married. The cost of baptisms and funerals and burials and seats in the house of God and for masses was in the aggregate very large. Therefore the church was rich, its priests affluent and independent, insolent and tyrannical. Now the land tax is not collectible and all currents turn away from the priesthood."

"I went by appointment to Bolondron to find out whether the people would favor the Protestant faith. My co-laborer was having a similar service in Guanabacha. I was met by the mayor of the city and all the city officials with a brass band playing welcoming music. Three little flower girls in white presented me with flowers.

"Then the throng of people, fully two hundred, marched to the mansion of Dr. Fernandes, where there was an address of welcome, and I responded. Then a sumptuous breakfast; then a service in which I set forth the freedom and largeness of the Protestant faith and worship. And all the people said, 'That is the religion we want.' I could have organized a church of a hundred members that day.

"We went back to the train in procession, and I received their tender farewells, which were so hearty and affectionate that they can never be forgotten. Strong men, who could utter themselves in no other way, embraced me in their arms. There is a deep and profound significance in those words which ring to-day through the Pearl of the Antilles: 'Viva Cuba Libre! Viva Cuba Libre!'"

"Cuba libre" means very little unless it means Cuba Protestant.
