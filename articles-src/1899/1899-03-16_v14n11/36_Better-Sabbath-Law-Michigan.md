A "BETTER Sabbath law" is called for in Michigan, says the Michigan Christian Advocate. What better Sabbath law does the Advocate want than the fourth commandment of the Decalogue? We believe they have that law in Michigan, the same as everywhere else. The Lord made that law; who can make a better one? Who can improve on the work of the Creator? That is God's law for Sabbath observance. Does the Advocate want Sabbath observance to be secured by any different law? A different law would not secure the kind of Sabbath observance God wants, but it might secure the kind the Advocate wants. Would not the Advocate, since it professes to be Christian, do well to examine itself and get into harmony with the Lord?
