The policy of "benevolent assimilation," which the Government is carrying on abroad, has also its illustrations at home. The possessions of the red man in this country have long been and are still undergoing assimilation by the white man; and in this process the natural disposition of the white man in dealing with an inferior race may be readily seen. An illustration to which we may properly refer, in view of facts which are now known and undisputed concerning the matter, is that of the Government's dealings with the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota, among whom an outbreak occurred last fall at Leech Lake. We present the facts as given by *The Independent*, of this city:

"It will be remembered that last fall occurred a totally unlooked for outbreak among the traditionally peaceable Chippewas of Minnesota. Fortunately it was confined to twenty of the Pillager band at Leech Lake. The statement as to the causes of the disturbance given in our columns at the time, and later in an address before the Mohonk Conference, was confirmed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who went to Leech Lake and examined personally into the origin of the troubles.

"The important point now is that not one of the frauds and outrages upon the peaceful Indians which produced that collision has been removed, but that they are still actively going on, and threaten, if not removed, to produce more serious troubles soon.

"One grievance was the quartering upon the Chippewas of a commission of three members, who were paid out of their funds $4,745 each, yearly, for nearly seven years. They in turn hired others under them so that the total expense to the Indians was about $80 per day. In 1896 the commission was reduced to one member, who continues to draw his $13 a day, and has a retinue of employés under him, while the Indians must pay the bills of their unwelcome guest. The records show that about $300,000 of their money has been expended on that commission and their underlings, when the work would have been better done by a good agent assisted by some inspector or other official of the Interior Department.

"A far more serious matter is the frauds which have been perpetrated upon them, under cover of the appraisal and sale of their pine. In August, 1891, a corps of appraisers, numbering over twenty, each receiving $6 per day, went to work on it and continued till May, 1893. Then their work was pronounced fraudulent; so the Government discharged them, and appointed a new set, twenty seven in number, each drawing $6 per day, to go over again what the first had done. Upon examination the second appraisal was also found to be worthless, and in August, 1897, the Government appointed a corps of twenty-three men to go over the work for the third time.

That second corps, in particular, was a jolly crew. The report of an Indian inspector shows that some were paper-hangers, some saloon-keepers, most had no knowledge whatever of pine, and that they spent their time mainly in drinking whisky and card-playing, and often guessed at the amounts of pine on the different tracts. In forwarding Inspector Wright's report to Congress, Jan. 26, 1897, the Indian Commissioner, Mr. Browning, said: 'It is quite clear to my mind that the estimates heretofore made are absolutely worthless.' A third appraisal is now in progress, and the Indian appropriation bill, now in conference, provides $45,000 for its continuance.

"But the waste of money in fraudulent estimating is not the worst, for Inspector Wright reports that on the lands sold under the second appraisal (sixty one tracts in all) there were 12,472,000 feet of timber, while the appraisers reported the amount as only 5,547,000 feet. It is significant that those tracts were all snapped up by purchasers on the basis of that appraisal, while twenty-four other tracts with 4,799,000 feet of timber growing on them, against 4,088,000 feet reported by the appraisers, have not been bought at all. The principal representative of the Government in the Indian country denounced those sales as fraudulent, and did all in his power to prevent their confirmation, but in vain.

"But now comes the principal source of fraud, and what the Indians to day most complain about. Under existing regulations green or growing pine cannot be cut at all, on the lands which the Indians have ceded or on their reservations, except on tracts that have been bought by individual purchasers—a very small proportion. To make this pine what is technically known as 'dead and down,' fires are made to run through it, scorching it a little, stopping the growth perhaps, but not really injuring its marketable value, if it be cut in a year or two. Pine logs in the Chippewa country are worth about $5 a thousand, but for 'dead and down,' or burnt timber, the Indians get but 75 cents a thousand. Of that 75 cents 50 cents goes to the credit of the Indians, and 25 cents to the Government for expenses. This is taking the Indians' pine from them for only ten per cent. of its real value, and, as a congressman has said, it is offering a premium to incendiarism. As white human nature is in those regions a man will hardly pay $5 for a thing when by touching a match he can get it for 75 cents. Also the testimony accumulates that under the pretence of cutting 'dead and down' timber white lumbermen are cutting mostly green logs, getting them, of course, for 75 cents, while the market price is $5. There may be on the tree a little blackening by fire, recent or remote, but its top is green.

"It was the irritation of these disgraceful facts which made the Bear Island Indians tell their agent last fall that they would take back their lands and undo the treaty; and reports are now coming in to the Indian Office from the Chippewa country that green timber is still being cut in large quantities under pretence of its being 'dead and down.' The same tactics are still going on, the Indians are becoming extremely irritated, and if these things be not stopped, the natural result will be armed resistance."

And when this occurs there will be great indignation among the whites, and the extermination of the Indians will be called for, as was done last fall in the case of those at Leech Lake by a leading journal of Minneapolis.

This is not saying that it is the intention and aim of the Government to deal unfairly with the Indians. Undoubtedly the Government intends quite the opposite. It may even aim to be "benevolent." But between the agents employed to deal with the Indians and the white men who cast covetous eyes upon their possessions, the Government's benevolent intentions are never carried into effect.

Only under self government can any people be secure in the enjoyment of their rights.
