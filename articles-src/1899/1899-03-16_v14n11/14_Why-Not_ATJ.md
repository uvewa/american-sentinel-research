Not long ago there was "a National Reform Convention" held in Bromfield Street Church, Boston, which called "upon this nation to make a recognition of God as the source of all authority, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and the Bible as the fountain of all law in the Constitution of the United States."

A few days later a meeting was held by the Hebrew citizens of Boston. In this meeting "there were a large number of speeches made." The Hebrew citizens of this country, the speakers stated, were fully satisfied with the present Constitution, and it was shown that they were among the first to lend their money and their aid by taking up arms in defense of their adopted country in every war in which it was involved, from the war for independence up to the Spanish-American war. They all agreed that the Hebrew citizens had stood by the Constitution and are among the last to ask for any change in it. But as a change has been asked for, they desire that the rightful first lawgiver known to the world be given the honor of having his name placed in the Constitution.

The following resolutions were unanimously adopted at the meeting:

"Whereas, free religious tolerance and freedom of speech is granted by the Constitution of the United States to its citizens of all creeds alike; and

"Whereas, the Hebrew citizens are among those who fought for the freedom and independence of the United States in every war in which this, their adopted country, was involved; and—

"WHEREAS, a certain other creed desires to change the wording of the Constitution, in which all citizens should have their say, be it—

"Resolved, That as Moses was the first lawmaker of mankind, as stated in ancient history, an official recognition of his supreme headship over all lawmakers should be shown in the instrument of civil compact in the United States of America.

"Resolved, That the Hebrew citizens, while in a small minority, though of greater numbers than the National Reform Association, deeply deplore the omission of Moses' name from the Constitution of the United States, as his laws were used in framing the Constitution.

"Resolved, That in our judgment as Hebrew citizens, Moses should be recognized for his gift to the world as the only supreme head and lawgiver of all nations of the globe.

"Resolved, That by placing the name of Moses in the Constitution of the United States of America, that of no other Hebrew or descendant of Hebrews will find a place there, and a wrong done by the forefathers in framing the Constitution of the United States of America will be righted, and the proper respect shown the followers of the first law-writer known to the world; and thus remove all jealousy existing at the present time among other creeds, which must acknowledge the receipt of their laws from that ancient people of which Moses was lawgiver and leader.

"Resolved, That as many well-known lawgivers, who have served their individual states from time to time, have tried to pass bills through the legislature of their individual states asking for the adoption of some of the ten commandments, the laws given to the Hebrews by Moses, can be easily seen the power centered in these laws and the honor due the writer who presented to the world centuries ago these laws which have governed and will govern the world forever.

"Resolved, Since the residue of power is vested in the people in this Republic, men to show their good citizenship are obligated patriotically, morally, and religiously, and therefore should employ all proper means to secure the insertion of the name of Moses in the Constitution of the United States of America and thus prove his authority as king and supreme lawgiver.

"Resolved, That a mass meeting be called at an early date to further discuss this most important matter and arrange for its adoption by the Government at Washington.

"Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the National Reform Association, a body that has labored arduously to have a wrong righted, and that cooperation and assistance be asked to gain the proper recognition due the first lawgiver known to the world."

Since at "the National Reform Convention the attendance was small," while at the meeting of the Hebrew citizens "a very large crowd was present;" and since the cause of the Hebrew citizens is equally just with that of the National Reformers, why should not the cause of the Hebrew citizens be espoused by the Government in the Constitution, equally with that of the National Reformers? Why?
