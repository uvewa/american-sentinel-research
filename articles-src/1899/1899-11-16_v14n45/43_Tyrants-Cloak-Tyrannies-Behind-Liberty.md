So! DEEP-SEATED, so universal is the human passion for liberty that all tyrants have been compelled to cloak their tyrannies behind pleas of defending the liberties of the people. And even a tyrant rejoices at news of the victory of a people engaged in a struggle for liberty in which he has no personal interest.
