# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, November 16, 1899 (v14n45)

## Article 28: "Why Men Do Not Go to Church" (file: 28_Why-Men-Do-Not-Go-to-Church.md)

- **Location:** Final paragraph, page 11
- **Issue:** The OCR text contains an asterisk and italic formatting that appears to continue the paragraph from the previous page, beginning with: `*air men's souls. What does the preacher stand for, if not for salvation?...`
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** The paragraph beginning `*air men's souls.` appears to be the continuation of the prior sentence cut off at a page break, where the original likely read "...the vital Bible doctrines of sin and atonement that always stir men's souls." The word before "air" is likely "stir" — the "st" was lost in the page break or OCR error.
- **Confidence:** LOW — "air" is what the OCR shows, but in context "stir" is almost certainly correct. Transcribed as-is from the OCR since the scan itself may be damaged.
- **Note:** The asterisk in the OCR likely indicates italic text in the original. The text has been preserved as italicized in the transcription.

## Article 45: "The Pope and the Fate of Dynasties" (file: 45_The-Pope-and-the-Fate-of-Dynasties.md)

- **Location:** The quoted text from the St. James (London) Gazette
- **Issue:** The OCR shows `"My kingdom [is not of this world"` — there is an open bracket `[` before "is" with no closing bracket. This may be a scan artifact or an editorial mark in the original (possibly indicating a missing word or a page column break).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** `"My kingdom [is not of this world"` — preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the bracket is likely an OCR artifact from a page crease or ink mark in the scan. The intended quotation is John 18:36: "My kingdom is not of this world."

## Article 47: "The White Man's Civilization Is Poison" (file: 47_White-Mans-Civilization-Is-Poison.md)

- **Location:** First word of the article
- **Issue:** OCR shows "Appraently" — this appears to be a misspelling of "Apparently."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Appraently" — preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR, since the error may be present in the original printing (the article is a reprint from the Springfield Republican and may have been typeset with the error).
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — likely a typo in the original or OCR error. Preserved faithfully per project rules.

## Author: H. F. Phelps (article 14)

- **Issue:** "H. F. Phelps" is not on the known authors list. The byline "BY H. F. PHELPS" appears explicitly in the article, so attribution is "explicit," but the full name and initials are uncertain.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "H. F. Phelps", author_short: "HFP"
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the name; the initials are inferred from the byline.

## Author: B. W. Marsh (article 15)

- **Issue:** "B. W. Marsh" is not on the known authors list. The byline "BY B. W. MARSH" appears explicitly.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "B. W. Marsh", author_short: "BWM"
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the name.

## Author: Z. G. Baharian (article 11)

- **Issue:** "Z. G. Baharian" is not on the known authors list. The byline "BY Z. G. BAHARIAN" appears explicitly.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "Z. G. Baharian", author_short: "ZGB"
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the name; spelling may differ from original Armenian transliteration.

## Author: Grant Adkins (article 31)

- **Issue:** "GRANT ADKINS" appears at the end of the Vermont report. Not on the known authors list.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "Grant Adkins", author_short: "GA"
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

## Author: H. E. Osborne (article 32)

- **Issue:** "H. E. OSBORNE" appears at the end of the Maine report. Not on the known authors list.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "H. E. Osborne", author_short: "HEO"
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

## Author: Rodney S. Owen (article 33)

- **Issue:** "RODNEY S. OWEN" appears at the end of the Mississippi report. Not on the known authors list.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "Rodney S. Owen", author_short: "RSO"
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

## Author: Geo. B. Wheeler (article 34)

- **Issue:** "GEO. B. WHEELER" appears at the end of the Massachusetts report. Not on the known authors list.
- **Transcribed as:** author: "Geo. B. Wheeler", author_short: "GBW"
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

## Structuring Decision: Short Epigrams (articles 01-08)

The first page of the issue contains eight short editorial epigrams/aphorisms before the first titled article. These were treated as individual articles per project rules. They have no individual titles in the original; titles have been supplied by the transcriber based on content (standard practice for untitled short items).

## Structuring Decision: "Bourke-Cochran" Attribution (article 41)

The item "Men are civilized to the extent that they can dispense with arms" is attributed to Bourke-Cochran, which appears to be a person's name rather than a publication. Attribution has been set to "reprint" with original_publication "Bourke-Cochran" to capture this. It may alternatively be set to "editorial" if the Sentinel is merely quoting this without reprinting from a named source.

## Structuring Decision: "Henry B. Metcalf" Attribution (article 46)

Similarly, "Henry B. Metcalf" appears to be a person's name, not a publication title. Same treatment as Bourke-Cochran above.
