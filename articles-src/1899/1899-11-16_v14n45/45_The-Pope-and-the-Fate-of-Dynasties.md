THERE seems, to say the least of it, something undignified in the spectacle of the pope, who claims to be the representative and vicegerent on earth of Him who said, "My kingdom [is not of this world," sulking by turns, and by turns raising protests and lamentations because he has had, at length, as king, to share the fate of all dynasties which have gone before. If Leo XIII. is prepared, for the sake of peace, to throw over the political claims of others, why should he so persistently cling to his own?
