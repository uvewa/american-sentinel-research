Friction between church and state has been increasing of late in Italy. The archbishop of Sorrento recently reprimanded publicly a priest of Vico Equense for urging the young people of his parish to take for their motto, "Religion, Italy, and the House of Savoy." Thereupon the Minister of Public Worship stopped the salary paid by the state to the archbishop. Cardinal Celesia, archbishop of Palermo, has suspended a priest for praising Italian unity and the work of Crispi.
