At the Protestant Episcopal Missionary Council, held recently in St. Louis, a clergyman from New York said that the English Church has a great advantage over the American Church because of its connection with the government;" adding that he would like to see the union of church and state in this country, and also, "I think that our flag would look better if it also had a cross on it."

A religious symbol on the flag would be altogether appropriate if this country maintained a union of church and state, for just this is what such a symbol would signify. But a cross or other religious symbol on the flag would not make the flag Christian; nor would union of religion with the state make the state Christian. Religion joined with civil force—a cross uplifted amidst the thunder and carnage of military combat—what effect do they have for Christianity? Manifestly the only effect of such incongruous unions is to discredit Christianity as a religion of persuasion and love.

This plea for an American union of church and state does not appear to have elicited from the council any strong expression of disapproval.
