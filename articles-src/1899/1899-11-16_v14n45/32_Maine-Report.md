## MAINE.

The year 1899 has marked a new era in the history of the "reform" movement in Maine. In 1897, the Christian Civic League of Maine was formally organized as a means of uniting the churches and all other "moral" forces throughout the State in an effort to promote "civic righteousness." The "reform" forces have been falling into line, auxiliary leagues have been formed in various communities, and in May of this year, the League had acquired sufficient strength to put a secretary in the field.

So popular is the movement that the secretary of the League declares that he "is constantly busy responding to invitations to give addresses in all parts of the State." The churches, the Roman Catholic not excepted, are promoting the work of the League in a public manner. The leading educators of the State give the plan their support, letters of indorsement having been given by the presidents of four colleges of Maine, and the press is, of course, giving the prospering movement its sanction.

The League has instituted a vigorous campaign for educating the people in a "reverence for law," and for enforcing present laws relating to Sunday.
