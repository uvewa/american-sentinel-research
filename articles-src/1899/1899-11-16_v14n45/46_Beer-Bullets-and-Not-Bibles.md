A NATION, nominally Christian, professing to accept a divinely-appointed mission to a benighted nation beyond the seas, and assuming that it has, providentially been called to be the guardian of a people incapable of developing its own Christian civilization, uses, as its missionaries, beer and bullets, and not Bibles. The Christian Church utters but feeble, if any protest, and appears to be blind except to visions of military and political glory? My protest may be without force, but I place it on record. May God save our nation from itself, its own worst enemy.
