## No State Aid for Religious Purposes.

Under this heading the Chicago *Times-Herald* of November 8 prints the following, in answer to a report that Archbishop Ireland had requested the Government to pay transportation for Catholic priests to be sent to the Philippines. It is worthy of note in this connection that Rome is steadily pressing for new concessions from the Government, and that she has an advantage in the precedent already established by the Government's support of chaplains for the army and navy, etc. On principle there is no reason for agreeing to support one army chaplain, and then refusing to support other proffered chaplains, Protestant or Catholic, under the plea that it would be contrary to the Constitution. There is no principle which allows the Government to maintain religious offices in the army and navy, and refuse to pay the costs of transportation in the cases in question. When the Government has taken one step in supporting a religious office, it violates no principle by taking additional steps in the same direction, no matter how far it may go. The principle was violated in the very first step.

The *Times-Herald* states what ought to be the standard of government under the American Constitution, but apparently does not see that this standard is far above the reality which is allowed by the American people. It says:

> "It is reported from Washington that Archbishop Ireland has requested that Catholic priests be sent to the Philippines at Government expense and that Secretary Root has denied the request. There will be no surprise over the secretary's decision, but it certainly is astonishing that a man of the archbishop's intelligence should ever have made any such suggestion.

> "The only justification for the plea, apparently, was a reference to the lack of chaplains in the army. His grace proposed that they should be recruited from his church, which was very meagerly represented, and promised that the church would care for the new men after they had arrived at their destination. In his reply Mr. Root said that the question of future support was of no consequence and that the law on the subject was prohibitory. Chaplains could be sent out only under an express provision, and they were already numerous enough if those in the service would obey the War Department and proceed to the islands when they were ordered there.

> "There is in all this no discrimination against any particular religious denomination. It applies to Presbyterians, to Methodists and to Baptists as well as to Catholics, and the promise in explanation of the plea weakens instead of strengthening it. This it does because it suggests an ultimate purpose, which has nothing to do with the army. The Government is virtually asked to pay the transportation charge of missionaries. That would surely be a very questionable precedent to establish. Missions are maintained by all denominations in all parts of the world, and there could be no distinction between them. Priests and ministers, Catholic and Protestant, would be encouraged to demand of the treasury that it should pay their fare to every part of the known world.

> "The proposition thus broadly put would provoke a protest from all believers in the American principle of the separation of church from state, and as it is more narrowly stated by the archbishop, it would start a war among the denominations themselves. In either case it is indefensible, nor would its acceptance, if that were possible, be of any advantage to church work. Missionary effort to be of any real value must have its origin in absolute self-sacrifice and devotion. It should seek nothing from the Government, everything from the individual and society. State aid is always significant of sinecures and the absence of earnest and thoroughly sincere endeavor."
