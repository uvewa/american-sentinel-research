SUNDAY bull-fighting in Havana, which prevailed under Spanish rule, has given place under American rule to Sunday horse racing, and this is with the approval of the military authorities. Some criticism on this desecration of Sunday, uttered by the *Washington Post*, called out this statement from Havana, dated November 12:—

"There is considerable editorial comment in the local newspapers regarding some criticism of Sunday racing here made by the *Washington Post*. The papers here agree that if horse racing is to take the place of bull-fighting as the popular Cuban sport, Sunday is the only day on which the meetings can be held. There is no wealthy leisure class on the island and week day racing would not be supported. The papers approve the action of the American officials in endorsing Sunday racing."

Wherever the sport-loving American cannot have horse-racing on any other day, we may be quite sure it will be had on Sunday.
