THE idea that Christians should not engage in politics is to some good people quite horrifying. What! the best people in the land withdraw and let the country's politics be run by the very worst! Dreadful! What would become of the government! etc. The thought brings up in their minds pictures of anarchy, barbarism, and governmental chaos.

But, good friends, the truth is the government would not be affected at all by the withdrawal of Christians from politics; for the simple reason that real Christians in this country—or in any country—are too scarce to make any impression, politically, upon the government. Real Christian people have not been running the government at all; it is the bad people who have been running it all the time. Anybody who denies this must be prepared to prove that Christians in this country are in the majority, in defiance of all statistics and the commonest facts of observation.

Take the State of New York and the City of New York, for examples. What would happen if the Christians in this city should withdraw from politics? Imagine the consternation that would seize upon Tammany Hall if that organization should be apprised that at the next election it would lose the Christian vote!

Would the withdrawal of Christians from politics in this city shake the throne of the Democratic "boss" who has so long ruled in the city government? or would the like proceeding in the State affect the sway of the Republican "boss" who controls in State affairs? If it would, then Christians might well be urged to stand aloof in the political arena not only for their own but for politics' sake as well!

It is admitted by Christians that "boss rule" and "ring" rule represent the worst form of government in this country. What worse government then could be feared from the withdrawal of Christians from politics altogether? and how could the country thereby be turned over to be "run" by the worst classes any more than it already is?

No; there is no danger that Christians will ever outvote the sinners and so get control of the government, in this or any other country on the earth. But there is danger—great danger—that through politics Christians will be drawn down from the plane of Christianity to that of the world, and lose all that Christianity has to give them,—a loss they cannot, under any circumstances, afford.
