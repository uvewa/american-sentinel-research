THE Ram's Horn says it believes General Funston "hit the mark in the center," when he said:—

"If Congress would drive out the friars and confiscate every inch of church property in the archipelago, the bottom would drop out of the insurrection within a week."

"This," says the Ram's Horn further, "may strike us as a drastic suggestion, but it is undeniable that the Filipinos hate the friars more than they hated the Spanish soldiers and civil governors, and that it is the support of the church by American authority that embitters them and produces distrust and dislike of our authority. It is certainly natural that they should suspect that we are fighting the battle of the Roman Catholic friars, when they see such representative Romanists as Archbishops Ireland and Chappelle holding daily conferences with our authorities in Washington, and after each visit of these ecclesiastical dignitaries to the Secretary of War, the order goes forth to prosecute the war with greater vigor."
