## Religious Persecution in China.

According to report received by the American Bible Society, persecutions of missionaries and Bible colporteurs are occurring in different parts of the interior of China. In one instance, it is said, "the viceroy was forced to telegraph for troops" to give protection from the mob.

A statement sent out by the Bible Society describes the experiences of six Bible colporteurs in one of these interior Chinese towns, where they were seized by the mob and beaten with clubs until they had received very serious bodily injury. Some friends by means of diplomacy and the payment of money rescued the victims and conducted them out of the place.

The account closes with the statement that "it is understood that the agents of the Bible Society will endeavor to obtain redress from the Mandarins of Lo Yang Hsien, the city in the province of Yan Suh, which rules the town where this disturbance took place."

But by this demand for redress, what power will the missionaries identify themselves with in the eyes of the heathen? How can they follow the example of Him whose gospel they have come to proclaim, in demanding redress when they have suffered persecution?
