A SUNDAY-CLOSING campaign has been started in Haverhill, Mass., as appears from this item which we note in the *Haverhill Gazette*:—

"The police began their active enforcement of the Sunday closing law yesterday, when Martin Marsdougian was arrested. He runs a fruit store in the 10-footer at the corner of Winter and White Streets. A week ago the police notified all the fruit dealers and candy stores to keep closed on Sundays and not to make any sales. It seems that the dealers had made complaints against each other, and it was decided to close all up. The complaints were due to the fact that a few wanted to close, while others wanted to remain open all day. The order for the closing of all was the result. Those who sell papers, however, open, claiming that right. Yesterday a complaint was made against the dealer arrested. He has been selling papers also, but it is alleged that he made a sale of fruit, and the complaint followed."
