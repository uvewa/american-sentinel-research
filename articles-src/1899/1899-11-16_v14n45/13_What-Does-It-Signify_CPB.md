## "What Does It Signify?"

BY C. P. BOLLMAN.

The following from the *Nashville American*, of November 8, is simply a candid confession from an unbiased source of a most alarming truth:—

### "DISGRACEFUL ELECTIONS."

"The disgraceful conditions prevailing in Kentucky and Pennsylvania especially yesterday, and in a milder form in almost every State where an election was held, is sufficient to arouse the public mind to a very grave concern for the fair name and safe government of the country. It is apparent to the most casual observer that such a condition as was presented in Kentucky, where federal marshals, State troops, police, and sworn deputies were on duty around the polls, and participated through their presence in the holding of the election, cannot be countenanced or allowed to continue if the glory of our free institutions is to endure.

"The stability of this Republic rests on an honest election and a fair count. The whole spirit of our Government is the will of the people must prevail, and if the will as expressed is not allowed to obtain on account of corruption and dishonesty, or if the people are intimidated from expressing their will by troops, policemen, and threats of any organization of citizens banded together for the sole purpose of controlling the election at all hazards, the very spirit and ideal of our Government are shattered and we become nothing but the serfs of the designing, the corrupt, the tyrannical, and the bold.

"We published a few days ago a few extracts from the *Philadelphia Ledger*, concerning the condition of affairs in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, the sum and substance of which was that decent and respectable citizens seldom voted, the two principal reasons being that they did not care to take the risk of being insulted or brought into a difficulty by making the attempt to cast their ballot, and the second being that they were not assured their ballots would be counted even after they were cast, or what is more important, be counted for the person for whom they were cast. The condition of affairs in Kentucky we have pictured from time to time. In Ohio, in Virginia, in New York, the same cry of 'fraud' goes up from both sides.

"What does it signify? A lax state of the public morals, a bluntness of the public conscience, and a lack of appreciation by the public of the tremendous danger which such a condition is to safe government, commercial prosperity and the security of life and property.

"A public sentiment which demands that elections must be inviolate, and that corrupt acts at elections must be held in the same category as corrupt acts in business life is absolutely necessary."

Truly the condition described does signify "a lax state of the public morals;" and as "public morals" are only the aggregate of individual morals, it signifies likewise a lax state of private morals on the part of a dangerously large proportion of the people.

The condition is little worse in one State than in another. Occasionally the better element is aroused by some more daring, high-handed, political outrage than those which characterize every election, but these acute stages of disease in the body politic are followed not by health, but by an even more hopeless chronic condition of moral leprosy.

The "public sentiment which demands that elections must be inviolate," etc., is a most illusive thing. Practically it results in nothing more or better than the "turning of one set of rascals out" that another set no better at heart may take their places. Honest men there doubtless are even in public life, but they are hopelessly in the minority and no party is better than "the machine" by which it is manipulated.

The United States is simply repeating the history of Rome just as nearly as it is possible for one people to follow in the footsteps of another. The Word of God long since foretold it, and current history attests the truth of divine revelation.
