Appraently Macaulay's Maori is not to have the privilege of surveying the ruins of London. The recent report of the registrar-general of New Zealand shows that that fine race is going the way of all primitive peoples touched by the blight of civilization, and will be extinct in a few more decades. Debauchery and unsuitable European clothing are among the causes assigned. It would be well to stop canting about the elevation of inferior races long enough to point out a few that have been elevated. The frontiersman's grim prescription for making good Injuns prevails everywhere, and when gunpowder fails drink and the devil do for the rest. The Kanaka is going, even the Eskimo in his icy citadels is going. If Japan is saved it will be at the muzzle of well-aimed 13-inch guns. The white man's civilization is poison to "inferior" races.
