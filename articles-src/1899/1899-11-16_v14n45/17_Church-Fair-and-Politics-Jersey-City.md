In the First Congregational Church of Jersey City, Rev. Dr. Scudder, pastor, a fair was held recently, at which one of the most conspicuous objects was a stack of ballots, with "pasters" containing the names of candidates whose opponents are in the saloon business. Each visitor on coming in was requested to use the "pasters" on election day. This evident mixing of religion and politics caused, report says, "some adverse comment." However, a religion that sanctions a church fair is not likely to be hurt very much by mixture with policies.
