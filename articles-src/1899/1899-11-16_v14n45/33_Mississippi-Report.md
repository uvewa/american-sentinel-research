## MISSISSIPPI.

COLUMBUS.—On a recent Sunday I listened to a sensational sermon from the text "A good soldier." The speaker described a soldier in the United States regular army. He surrenders his will to the Government and promises to obey the orders of his superior officers. Several illustrations were given of the implicit obedience of true soldiers in the army, such as "The Charge of the Light Brigade," as described by Alfred Tennyson, quoting the words:—

"Theirs not to reason why
Theirs not to make reply
Theirs but to do and die."

This was presented as a parallel to what is expected of the members of the Methodist church to its officers,—the bishops, presiding elders, pastors, deacons, etc. As applied to God our Sovereign Ruler, or to Christ the Captain of our salvation, I could admire the illustration; but putting the officers of the church in the place of God, clothing them with absolute authority, enjoining upon the members the surrender of their private judgment and their unquestioning obedience, appeared to me like following in the footprints of the papacy.

I could not help contrasting this sentiment with the teaching of Christ in Matt. 20:25-28: "We know that the princes exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them; but it shall not be so among you; but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant. Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."

"One is your Master even Christ; and all ye are brethren."
RODNEY S. OWEN.
