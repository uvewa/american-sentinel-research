**MASSACHUSETTS.**

A CRUSADE against the opening of the barber shops on Sunday has been opened in Boston, and warrants have been issued against three shops connected with hotels for violation of the Sunday laws. This is the result of a united effort on the part of the International Barbers' Union, the Boston Barbers' Union, the United Labor Union, and the New England Sabbath Protective League. Several arrests have also been made in Lynn recently for violation of the law against fishing and gunning on Sunday.

The rapid advancement of the Sunday law movement over the country carrying along with it many of the labor organizations, under the deception that they are to be benefited by it, by having their inherent rights curtailed by law, ought to be a cause of serious alarm to all lovers of liberty. Many fail to see the true character of this Sunday movement from the fact that it is covered up under the plea of "The Civil Sabbath," "Humanitarianism," etc. In conversation recently with one of the leaders of the Sunday movement in New England upon the efficacy of a law compelling employers to give their employes a day of rest one day in seven, which he favored, and which would meet every requirement of humanitarianism, which is so strongly emphasized by Sunday law advocates, the question was asked whether if such a law could be passed he would favor the abolition of the Sunday laws. His reply was, "No; their purpose is to maintain the Christian Sabbath." And there is abundant evidence to show that that is the sole purpose of all Sabbath organizations in the country.

A law that would meet every demand of a "civil sabbath" by giving an opportunity to rest one day in seven, but which does not enforce the observance of any day as a sacred day, is not what the Sunday law advocates want; what they want is to have their own views of what they believe to be the sacred character of a particular day of the week, which they call the Christian Sabbath, enforced by the power of the State upon every one. The right of belief, or choice, is denied by them to every one who does not agree with them. This is intolerance. They cannot tolerate a course of action in others that is not in harmony with their own belief as to the sacred character of the first day of the week.

The rapid revival of this spirit of intolerance in the country bodes it no good, for it will not be satisfied with Sunday laws alone, but will only be content when the civil and religious rights of the people are entirely subverted.
GEO. B. WHEELER.
