## The Rights of God.

BY H. F. PHELPS.

There can be no question but that the Creator of all things has certain rights. And the time will come when he will arise and vindicate those rights.

In a recent issue of this journal, the writer spoke of "the rights of God and of the people." We then elucidated, in brief, upon the rights of the people, showing how the Government of the United States had espoused these rights. It is a fact that in thus espousing the unalienable rights of the people—the rights with which the Creator had endowed all the people—this Government did thereby, indirectly, acknowledge the rights of God. But what are the rights of God? Let us look again at fundamental principles.

Inasmuch as the Creator did endow man with certain natural rights, among which "are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;" and did this at creation, it is evident that it was not the purpose of God that man should dominate his fellow-man concerning the exercise of these rights; for to dominate in these matters is to attempt to deprive the people of these rights. It therefore was the purpose of God that all men, irrespective of nationality, should be left altogether free in the exercise of these rights. This last proposition is a self-evident truth; for when man was created, all nations of men centered in the one man Adam. And having endowed the man Adam with these natural rights, and having given to man the privilege of the exercise of such rights, even to the point of disobedience to the divine will, there could have been nothing less in the divine mind than that man should have been left forever free in the exercise of these natural rights.

These rights are not only natural, in that they come to all through the course of nature; and unalienable, in that they are not transferable; and individual, in that they are the individual property of every man in his individual capacity; but, coming from the divine One, according to the divine mind, they are divine rights. Hence, any man or set of men that attempts coercion in a matter of these rights, will find at the last that they have been intermeddling with the divine rights, which were given to man. And not only so, but with the rights of the divine One himself. This will be evident when we refer again to foundation principles.

If it had been the purpose of the Creator that force should be used in regulating the moral conduct of man, the Creator himself could have used force in the creation of the man Adam. God himself could have dominated the will of man in his creation. Man could have been created as a mere automaton, like any other machine, to run in any certain channel according to the will of the designer. But in such case man would never have been in possession of natural rights. These rights would have been an impossibility—an impossible inheritance. It is therefore, a perfectly clear proposition, that any attempt to regulate these rights in any other manner than the protection of all in their enjoyment, is an attempt to take them away.

Inasmuch, therefore, as the Creator did not use force, did not exercise the power which he possessed so to do, even in the creation of man; did not compel man by the act of creation, to walk in any certain course, but endowing the man with these rights, left him perfectly free, even to the point of disobedience, in the exercise of these rights; it follows, as a necessary conclusion, that the Creator has the right to expect that all men will recognize these rights, each in himself. Moreover, God has the right to expect that man, as a rational being, seeing these rights in himself, will also recognize these same rights in his fellow-man.

And still more: When in the course of human events, it became necessary, as a means of safety, for men to formulate some kind of government among themselves, God had the right to expect that these same men who recognized these rights in themselves and in their fellow-men, should also recognize the rights of God by protecting every individual in the government, in the exercise of these God-given rights; and so recognize the principle that "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed;" and that earthly governments do not make rights, but that it is their duty to protect all equally in their exercise, ever holding in check that selfish disposition which would encroach upon the equal rights of another.

Our fathers sought to place this Government in right relation to these principles in the beginning of our history as a nation. But does the Government stand there now? Or, has it narrowed down to that point where it claims rights for itself that are being denied to others? Let the reader study to know which.
