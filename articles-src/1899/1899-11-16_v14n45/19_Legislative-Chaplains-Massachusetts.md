The Haverhill Gazette (Mass.) thinks that only a few relics of the old days of church-and-state union are left in that State, and that these will ere long be done away. "It is hoped," it says, "that the next legislature will take steps looking in the direction of the abolition of legislative chaplains." We hope so.
