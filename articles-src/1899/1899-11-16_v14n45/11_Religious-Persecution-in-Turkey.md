## Religious Persecution in Turkey.

BY Z. G. BAHARIAN.

MAMOURET UL-AZIZ or Kharpout is a province in Asiatic Turkey, where Armenians live in great numbers. At the late massacre they were much lowered and even forced to leave their religion and accept the faith of Islam. In this way they tasted religious persecution amidst the political convulsion. They hated the Turks greatly because of this; and by the aid of other Christian nations they were allowed to return into their former religion.

But as soon as order was re-established, they forgot this sad experience. Last year about twenty-six souls in Malatia accepted the faith of Seventh-day Adventists and began to keep the Sabbath of the Lord and to hold meetings. This at once stirred the bigots, among whom was the Protestant minister as leader. He called to the police and stopped their meetings. But they continued in keeping the Sabbath and even dared to work on Sunday. The Protestant minister knew what to do. He called on the Catholic bishop of this city, and together they called on the Pasha (the chief governor) and asked his power to stop this new religion. He also, like Pilate, consented, and called these Sabbath-keepers and told them to close their shops on Sunday and work on Sabbath.

They did not consent to this proposition. The result was that some of them, the prominent ones, were put into jail. While there the Protestant minister called on them and tried to have them promise to pollute the Sabbath and keep Sunday in order to be released from the jail. This scheme did not succeed well. Then the Pasha, in the midst of the winter cold, sent these Sabbath-keepers to Kharpout, the chief city of that province, where the chief governor—Vali—lives. When their case was presented to him, he proposed to them a compromising way,—that is, to keep both days. As they were not yet well trained in the truth, they accepted it, and were sent back to Malatia.

But their enemies were not satisfied. Their purpose was to force them to give up their Sabbath-keeping. They induced the Pasha to watch them closely that they might not have any acquaintance with each other even at the market. You can imagine now their pitiful condition. One of them had his son lately come from America; one day he was walking with his son, when they were seen by the police and arrested. Then the father proved with several witnesses that he was his own son, and not a Sabbath-keeper.

Lately a Seventh-day Adventist minister was sent to Malatia from Constantinople that these Sabbath-keepers might be established in the truth. This minister would open a shop there and work his trade too. At once the Pasha called him and proposed that he should work on Sabbath and close on Sunday, as a condition of his being allowed to remain. When he refused it, he too was sent to Kharpout.

This is the condition of things in Armenia. The persecuted now persecute. Though the government is of a different faith, and knows that Armenians never desire the good of the state, nevertheless it joins itself with them and becomes an easy instrument in their hand to persecute the innocent. It is very sad indeed to see Protestant ministers, embracing with one arm the Catholic bishop and with the other arm the state, lead in the persecution. When the Seventh-day Adventists heard about it, they laid it before the head Protestant representative, to let him know what his minister was doing. His answer was this: "Surely, it must be so, because you are outlaws. You cannot belong to one [class] of the recognized religion and nation; therefore you have no place in this country, except jail."

But a day is coming, and very near, too, that the jail also will be thought too good for them. They should be cut off from the earth, unless their Saviour should come from heaven and save them.

It is of no use to tell us that the Christian ideal is the highest known to man if its fruits are to be the propagation of the warlike spirit and of a hard legality and stern unlovely discipline all over the world wherever the Christian nations set their iron feet. "By their fruits ye shall know them," is the test of the Founder of Christianity, and if some other form of religion stands this supreme test better than the conventional Christianity of the churches, we may depend upon it that the churches will decline, and will decline with the approval of all good men who care more for the spirit of Christ's teaching than for all the forms and rituals of the Christian world.—London Daily Chronicle.
