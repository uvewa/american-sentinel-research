## Why?

*From "The Broad Axe," St. Paul, Minn.*

If the United States flag stands for freedom, why does it wage war on the Filipinos who are fighting for freedom?

If Aguinaldo represents only a small minority, why not let the Filipino majority crush him?

If the Filipino war against Spain was unjust, why did we stop Spain in her efforts to crush it?

If the Filipino war against Spain was just, why isn't their war against us just when we take Spain's place in the fight?

If the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to declare and prosecute war, why does Mr. McKinley violate the Constitution by an executive war instead of calling Congress together?

If McKinley establishes the precedent of an executive war, why won't other presidents have the same right?

If the Filipinos are not fighting for freedom, why do they fight? If they are fighting for freedom, why isn't their flag a flag of freedom? If their flag is a flag of freedom, why does a flag of freedom oppose it?
