THE report which we print this week concerning religious persecution in Turkey, written by a converted Armenian who has for several years been laboring among his brethren in that field, throws light on the nature of Armenian "Christianity." It is to be noted also that in that country, where there is no public sentiment to be reckoned with, the opponents of the seventh-day Sabbath sought not only to prevent the observers of that day from doing work on Sunday, but also to force them to make the seventh day an ordinary day of labor. It is only public sentiment that stands in the way of the like undertaking in some parts of the United States.
