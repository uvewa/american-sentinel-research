Not long ago a congress of labor associations in Montreal passed this resolution:—

"Resolved, That this congress protest against the inhuman practice of compelling men to work seven days in succession, and affirm that one day's rest in seven is a natural law and absolute necessity of human life, and cannot be broken with safety; therefore, be it resolved that it be an instruction to all organizations affiliated with this body to co-operate to secure legislation for one day's rest in seven."

* * *

Analyzing this statement, we notice, first, that the practise of compelling men to work seven days in the week is declared to be "inhuman." But the "compulsion" here meant is not compulsion in the ordinary sense of the word, or in any true sense; but is only the fear of losing one's "job" by observing a weekly day of rest. From the Christian standpoint, the question is whether a person shall obey the Sabbath command or not at the expense of financial loss; and the resolution declares that to maintain such a condition of things is inhuman. Yet it is just the condition of things that is necessary to the development of Christian character; and the Christian will not complain of it. The Christian is required to sacrifice much more than this for the sake of obedience to God. He must give up not only his financial prospects, but his very self and all that goes with self. He must lose his life, in order that he may save it. He must be "crucified with Christ," and be "dead," with his life "hid with Christ in God." And the Christian does not count all this as being anything inhuman, or to be complained of, but accepts it all joyfully, because the Lord gives to him in exchange infinitely more than all he is required to give up.

Secondly, the resolution states that "one day's rest in seven is a natural law." Now the discovery of "natural law" has been going on in the world for centuries, and all the natural laws that seriously affect our lives are well known and susceptible of scientific demonstration. They have mostly been deduced from the observed phenomena of nature. But where in nature is the evidence of a law for one day's rest in seven? Nature does not rest on the seventh day any more than on the sixth or fifth days. All the functions of the body go on as usual, and nature in all her fields is as active then as at any other time. The sun does not stop shining, the earth does not cease revolving, the trees and all vegetation continue to grow, the streams flow and the winds blow as usual, gravitation is not suspended,—nowhere is there any *natural* evidence when the seventh day is reached that it is one which is different in character from the six days that have preceded it. It may be asserted that the physical nature demands extraordinary rest at the end of six days of work; but no proof whatever can be produced that there is any natural demand for more rest then than at any other time. Nature's only indicated time for physical rest is night; and if people would improve the night for rest, as they ought to do, they would not need physical rest at any other time. To make the seventh day a day of physical and mental inactivity would be to make it, from the standpoint of natural law, the worst day in the week.
