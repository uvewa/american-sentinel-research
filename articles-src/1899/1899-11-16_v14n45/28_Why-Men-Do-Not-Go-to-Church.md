## Why Men Do Not Go to Church.

*From the "Homiletic Review."*

Men stay away from church because they do not want to go; that is the simple, naked truth about the matter. The question, Why do they not want to go? is another matter. Various answers may be given to it.

Many have doubtless become so secularized as to have lost out all sense of their sinfulness and lost condition, and so, all sense of need of salvation. These men are not under any such moral pressure as would lead them to attend church. They have nothing to go for. Indeed, they usually have some other place to which to go—to the clubs, the races, etc.—and the going to which shows that it is not "overwork" that keeps them from church.

There are other non-churchgoers, who have some appreciation of sin and salvation, who have been churchgoers, but who find nothing in the church services that meet the needs of their lost souls. They become weary of moral essays, reform harangues, political diatribes, socialistic platitudes, and sensationalism generally, and so let their wives and daughters do the churchgoing.

Another reason doubtless is that the religious atmosphere and the newspapers are so permeated and saturated with the new infidelity that discredits the Bible and practically dispenses with sin and salvation that multitudes have been turned against the churches that still hold to these vital truths and regard the Bible as the Word of God. Why should men go to church if the Bible is a mass of myths and legends, if there has never been any fall "except a fall upward," and if sin is only an incident—praiseworthy rather than otherwise—in the evolutionary struggle for progress and perfection?

And this calls up still another reason, and that is that much of the preaching has lost its grip on the souls of men, because there is nothing in it concerning the vital Bible doctrines of sin and atonement that always *air men's souls. What does the preacher stand for, if not for salvation? Whatever his culture, his brilliancy, his smartness, he will in due time preach out his congregation, if he fails to appeal to this deepest need of human souls.*
