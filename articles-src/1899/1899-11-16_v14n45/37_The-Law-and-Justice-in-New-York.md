RECENTLY in this city, under the law which regulates "boxing contests," a "world's championship" battle was fought between two leading pugilists, in which one of the contestants had a rib broken, and was badly disfigured, while both were pounded in the severest manner. All this was lawful; but a few nights later, in the same city, one of these same pugilists was arrested under the same law for giving an exhibition as part of a theatrical performance, in which no real blow was struck or intended. And yet a certain class of persons never tire of telling us that because anything is "the law of the land," it must be bowed down to with all reverence and obeyed without question. Some statutes are not entitled to any thing but contempt. The important question in any case is not, Is it the law? but, Is it justice?
