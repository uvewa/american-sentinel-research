## The Irony of "Civilized War."

*New York "World."*

The Boers kill General Symons, and the leader of the Boers at once sends a telegram of condolence to the widow. Joubert finds that he has not ambulances enough to carry off the wounded after the explosion of British shells, so he sends over to the British and borrows ambulances. Briton and Boer spend the day in slaughtering one another, and late in the afternoon sit down to "swap" medicines, nurses, and other ameliorations of warfare.

What could be more supremely ridiculous? Does it not reduce warfare among civilized peoples to the utterly absurd? Does it not show how completely the masses of mankind have outgrown the instinct for the "man-hunt?"

To stab one's enemy and then put one's arm about him and fall to with the medicine bottles and the surgical instruments to undo what one has done, weeping the while and saying, "Poor fellow! so sorry! It breaks my heart!"—then, as soon as the poor wretch is able to get upon his feet, to fall upon him with knife and pistol—

Really, the human animal has only a surface sense of humor!
