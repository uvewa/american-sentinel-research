## VERMONT.

While there has been no real outbreak against religious liberty in Vermont, yet it is as plain as can be to a close observer that the spirit of Puritanic intolerance lingers here in the hearts of many. That spirit of persecution is a smouldering fire, which only awaits the opportunity to be fanned into a blaze. We hear a few murmurs and threats against those who believe in the "divine right of dissent" from the religion of the majority; still no arrests have been made of late for violating the Sunday law.

GRANT ADKINS.
