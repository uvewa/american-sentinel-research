THE Golden Rule in politics—as far as that principle is ever likely to get into politics—was illustrated in the late campaign in Ohio, where "Golden Rule" Jones was an "independent" candidate for governor, and received some less than half the number of votes cast for the successful aspirant. It is surmised that if Mr. Jones had not been in the race for the governorship, a Democratic instead of a Republican governor might have been chosen to the office. However this may be, it is certain that at most the only result of Mr. Jones' "Golden Rule" politics was to shift the balance of power from one of the leading parties to the other, leaving the purification of politics and the overthrow of "boss" rule as far from being realized as it was before. There is a more hopeful way than this to work for the establishment of the Golden Rule in the earth, and that is to work for its establishment in the individual heart by the power of God. This is God's way, and his way is not going to fail.
