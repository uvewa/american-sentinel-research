UNDER their American masters, the Filipinos have now received their first lesson in self-government, and the impression made upon them will no doubt be lasting. They will understand that they cannot hope for the privilege of self government till they are able to fight better; for their signal defeat by the forces of civilized America is accepted everywhere as the most convincing demonstration of the absurdity of their idea of a Philippine republic. After all that may be said of the higher ideals of civilization, it is brute force and the ability to use it effectively, that most surely wins recognition and respect from the civilized world. No nation thinks of disputing the right of self-government with a people who are efficient in the use of modern firearms.
