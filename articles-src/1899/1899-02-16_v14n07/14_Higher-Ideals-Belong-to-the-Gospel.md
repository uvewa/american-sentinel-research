THE higher ideals of life belong not to civilization, but to the gospel. A Christian "savage" is actuated by higher impulses than the "boss" who controls the politics of an American state. A Christian "savage" is a better example of self-government than a civilized state which is dominated by a political "boss." The slave of human passions can at best be but a poor representative of a free people. The unchristian ambitions of men are a far greater obstacle in the path of true self-government, than is the ignorance of a savage tribe. No people are so ignorant that they cannot understand the foundation principles of self-government. Not the ignorance of the Filipinos regarding the ways of civilization, but their disregard of human rights, must be dispelled in order to fit them for self government; and that can be done not by force of arms, but by the spread of those influences which emanate from the divine principle, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
