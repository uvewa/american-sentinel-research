The army canteen has been abolished by authority of the Government. This act will no doubt do something to lessen the contrast between the principles of Christianity and the practice of soldiers of a "Christian nation."

The organ of the party who want God put into the Constitution, expresses such disappointment because no "suitable acknowledgment" of God was put into the treaty lately concluded by the United States with Spain. The commissioners were requested by letter to frame the treaty in harmony with the ideas of the church-and-state party, and it was hoped thereby to pave the way for a similar acknowledgment in the Constitution. This "religious reform" party are untiring in their efforts to enforce their ideas of Christianity by the machinery of the law, and never were they molding public sentiment so rapidly to the belief that religious legislation is proper and necessary, as just now.
