## The Bible, Protestantism, and Papacy.

### IS PAPACY BIBLICAL?

BY S B. HORTON.

Is papacy biblical? That is, does the papacy advocate the teaching of the Bible? Does it claim that the holy Scriptures are all-sufficient for the followers of the Author of Christianity, and are they able to make one wise unto salvation? A little familiarity with papal literature will help one to arrive at a proper response to this question. Cardinal Gibbons, of Baltimore, takes very decided ground that the holy Scriptures are not sufficient as a rule of faith, nor a competent guide to salvation. This is what he says in his work, "The Faith of Our Fathers":—

"A rule of faith, or a competent guide to heaven, must be able to instruct in all the truths necessary for salvation. Now the Scriptures alone do not contain all the truths which a Christian is bound to believe, nor do they explicitly enjoin all the duties which he is obliged to practice. Not to mention other examples, is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday, and to abstain on that day from unnecessary servile work? Is not the observance of this law among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify."

In the view of this leading prelate of the papacy it is evident that the Bible is not the sole rule of faith and a competent guide to heaven. This view of holy Scriptures is not biblical, and it is certainly the very opposite of the view assumed by Protestantism. Still the Cardinal's estimate of the value of the Bible is in keeping with all that has been said by the Roman Church aforetime on this point. For instance, Pius VI., in a Bull issued March 24, 1564, approved the work of the Council of Trent which enacted a code of rules on prohibited books, one of which reads as follows:—

"Rule 4 Inasmuch as it is manifest from experience, that if the holy Bible, translated into the vulgar tongue, be indiscriminately allowed to everyone, the temerity of men will cause more evil than good to arise from it, it is, on this point, referred to the judgment of the bishops or inquisitors, who may, by the advice of the priest or confessor, permit the reading of the Bible translated into the vulgar tongue by Catholic authors, to those persons whose faith and piety, they apprehend, will be augmented, and not injured by it; and this permission they must have in writing. But if anyone shall have the presumption to read or possess it without such written permission, he shall not receive absolution until he have first delivered up such Bible to the ordinary. Booksellers, however, who shall sell, or otherwise dispose of Bibles in the vulgar tongue, to any person not having such permission, shall forfeit the value of the book, to be applied by the bishop to some pious use, and be subjected by the bishop to such other penalties as the bishop shall judge proper, according to the quality of the offense. But regulars shall neither read nor purchase such Bibles without a special license from their superiors."

This feeling against the general reading of the Bible in the "vulgar tongue," has been the rule since 1564, and "Bulls" have been issued condemning and proscribing societies for the free circulation of copies of holy Scriptures. In a pastoral letter pope Pius VII. in 1816 uses the following language on the subject of Bible societies:

"We have been truly shocked at this most crafty device [Bible societies], by which the very foundations of religion are undermined. We have deliberated upon the measures proper to be adopted by our pontifical authority, in order to remedy and abolish this pestilence, as far as possible,—this defilement of the faith so imminently dangerous to souls. It becomes your episcopal duty that you first of all expose the wickedness of this nefarious scheme. . . . Warn the people entrusted to your care, that they fall not into the snares prepared for their everlasting ruin."

Bulls against the reading of the Bible in the "vulgar tongue" were also issued by pope Leo XII. in 1824, Pius VIII. in 1829, Gregory XVI. in 1832 and 1844, as well as by Pius IX. And as "Rome never changes" she will and does, wherever she controls, advocate the policy of keeping the holy Scriptures from the common people. An instance or two of the present attitude of Rome toward the Bible comes to us recently from Peru, South America, where the hierarchical scoper of Rome holds absolute sway in matters of religion. In Arequipa, Peru, two Christian men engaged in colporteur work were arrested and imprisoned for selling and distributing Bibles and Protestant literature. It is said that the feeling was so strong against these men that threats of lynching were freely made.

So it is plainly evident that Rome does not cherish nor does she teach her subjects that the Bible is the all-sufficient guide and rule of faith, that it alone can make one "wise unto salvation." But what does she endeavor to maintain as sufficient and more clear and safe for the seeker of truth and salvation? Let "Catholic Belief," a work published by authority of the Roman Church, answer this question (page 45):

"Like two sacred rivers flowing from Paradise, the Bible and divine tradition contain the Word of God, the precious gems of revealed truths. Though these two divine streams are in themselves, on account of their divine origin, of equal sacredness, and are both full of revealed truths, still, of the two, tradition is to us more clear and safe."

The author, speaking for the Roman Church, draws his conclusions from the standpoint of the so called "fathers" of the church, one of whom, Origen, said, "We are not . . . to believe otherwise than as the churches of God have by succession transmitted to us;" and another, Chrysostom, gave out as an axiom, "It is a tradition [of the church]; seek nothing further." Still another, the bishop of Hierapolis (Papias), said, "If anyone came to me who had accompanied the elders, I questioned him concerning their words, what Andrew and Peter said; for I did not think that what is in the Books would aid me as much as what comes from the living and abiding voice."

Rome, therefore, stands for tradition preferably to the Bible, whereas true Protestantism advocates the Bible. In the case of Rome, the Bible is not a sufficient rule of faith because, as Cardinal Gibbons puts it, it is not competent "to instruct in all the truths necessary to salvation;" and so must depend upon "the living voice" of man in tradition. In this position Rome is always prepared to meet the charge that she is not in harmony with the doctrines and instructions of the Bible by saying, "We are in harmony with the tradition of the church, and consider it more clear and safe to follow."

On the other hand, true Protestantism says, "The Bible and the Bible only, is the religion of Protestants! Nor is it of any account in the estimation of the true Protestants, how early a doctrine originated, if it is not found in the Bible."

It will be well to know how Protestantism views tradition.
