A SUNDAY-CLOSING MOVEMENT IS IN PROGRESS IN OMAHA, THE FEATURES OF WHICH ARE OF MORE THAN ORDINARY INTEREST. A PRESS DISPATCH FROM THAT CITY TO THE CHICAGO TIMES-HERALD SAYS: "THIS CITY IS CONFRONTED BY ANOTHER NOVEL PROPOSITION. IT CONSTITUTES A CLOSE COMBINATION OF SUNDAY-SCHOOL AND CHURCH WORKERS AND SALOON MEN AND BREWERS, ALL UNITED TO STRICTLY ENforce THE SUNDAY LAWS WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR."

ADVOCATES OF SUNDAY ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN WONT TO POINT TO THE SALOON AS THE ALLY OF THOSE WHO OPPOSED THE MOVEMENT; BUT HERE, THE MOVEMENT FINDS NO STAUNCHER SUPPORT THAN THAT THE SALOON ACCORDS IT. THE DISPATCH SAYS FURTHER: "THE CHURCH PEOPLE HAVE CALLED A MASS MEETING FOR SATURDAY, AND THE SALOON MEN'S LEAGUE HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION OF GIVING THE MOVEMENT ITS MORAL SUPPORT, AND INCIDENTALLY ANY OTHER KIND OF SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL SALOON MEN CAN GIVE THE MOVEMENT."

THE "MORAL SUPPORT" OF THE SALOON! IN BEHALF OF WHAT OTHER "CHRISTIAN" INSTITUTION OR VIRTUOUS MEASURE DID THE SALOON EVER OFFER ITS "MORAL" SUPPORT? AND IN WHAT GOOD CAUSE WERE EVER PILATE AND HEROD MADE FRIENDS? "THE CHURCH PEOPLE ARE NOT A UNIT YET IN THE SUNDAY CLOSING MOVEMENT, BUT THE SALOON MEN ARE A UNIT IN ITS SUPPORT, AND ARE READY TO PUT UP THE MONEY NECESSARY TO PROSECUTE ALL THOSE WHO DO NOT OBSERVE THE LAW IN EVERY PARTICULAR." THE ZEAL OF THE SALOON IN THE MATTER IS REALLY GREATER THAN THAT OF THE CHURCH! AND THIS REALLY PUTS THE SALOON AT THE HEAD OF THE SUNDAY-CLOSING PROCESSION.

Of the scope of the movement, it is said that "Every barber-shop, cigar store, bath-house, hotel, restaurant, and newspaper office in the city will be forced to suspend, as all come under the ban of the Sunday state law. Street cars will not be permitted to run, and some of the saloon men insist that all those ministers of the gospel who preach for pay are amenable to the provisions of the law and should be arrested; but some of the saloon men are in favor of exempting the ministers in return for the aid the preachers will give in keeping others from violating the Sunday law."
