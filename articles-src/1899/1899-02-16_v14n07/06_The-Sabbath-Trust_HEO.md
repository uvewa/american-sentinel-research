## The "Sabbath" Trust.

### BY H. E. OSBORNE.

As the numerous organizations devoted to the "protection" of the "Sabbath" progress in their work, the spirit which prompts them becomes more apparent. It therefore happens that their own zeal frequently results in happily acquainting the observer with the actual animus of their movement.

At a recent meeting of the New England Sabbath Protection League, in Boston, considerable attention was devoted to Sunday bicycling as a menace to their pet institution. Among those invited to speak was President Eliot, of Harvard, who found occasion to dissent from the views of the preceding speakers on this particular question, and he therefore urged moderation on the part of the League. Presumably this was quite distressing to the League, but the incident served to set before the auditors a very instructive contrast. That some were thereby edified is apparent from certain "Editorial Points" in the Boston Globe, of January 31. Here is one of them:

"By inviting President Eliot to address them, the members of the New England Sabbath Protection League offered themselves the opportunity to listen to some lovely common sense."

Now it is but fair to infer from the above that in the estimation of at least one person the League is not accustomed to hearing "common sense," and it was so refreshing to him that he enthusiastically denominated it "lovely"! That is good, but better still, the Globe apprehends the spirit of monopoly which moves the League to the prosecution of its purpose. In proof of this statement we quote the following:

"President Eliot's position is substantially that the Sabbath was made for man, and not for the New England Sabbath Protection League."

Thus does the Globe naively expose the trust spirit behind this organization and its movement. If only it might be learned that the Sabbath was indeed made for man, not for leagues; and that individual men and not leagues will be held amenable for its desecration, how speedily would disappear these methods involving the force of human law. Once establish the divine principle of individual accountability, and the worse than wasted energies of these "leagues" and "unions" would immediately be applied to useful ends.

The ordinary trust only ventures to control the price of a given commodity. Perchance the trust would hail with pleasure a law compelling the people to buy, but they do not venture to promote such enactments. What shall be said of the "Sabbath" Trust, that, with amazing boldness, not only prescribes the method of "Sabbath" observance, but demands legislation compelling all the people to observe their chosen day of rest? In greed for gain, the Oil Trust seeks to control the price of that for which a natural demand exists. In greed for creed, the "Sabbath" Trust would both create the "demand" and fix the "price"!
