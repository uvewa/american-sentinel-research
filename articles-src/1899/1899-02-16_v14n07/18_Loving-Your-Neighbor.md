## Loving Your Neighbor.

### CHRISTIANITY AS IT IS PRACTISED IN THIS "CHRISTIAN NATION."

*"New York Journal," Jan. 30, 1899.*

Here is a story that was in the newspapers yesterday for you to read: A woman named Kate Brasch, who lives at No. 420 East Sixteenth Street, was arrested with a child in her arms for begging on the street. Her husband, she said, was a gardener. They had four children.

When she was arraigned in the Jefferson Market Police Court on Sunday—you were probably in church at the time—the agent of the Children's Society, who had arrested her, begged the magistrate to discharge her. He said that he had visited the home of the Brasches and found it scrupulously clean, but almost bare of furniture. Every article of value had been pawned to keep the family alive during the months that the father had been vainly looking for work. The father and the three children were sitting around a bare table when the agent entered. All there was to divide among the four was half a loaf of stale bread and some water."

It is at least some satisfaction to add that the woman was discharged, and that the policemen and lawyers in the court room made up a purse for her.

Let us now consider another item of the day's news. The Evangelical Free Churches of Great Britain, after many months of work, have compiled a new catechism. This catechism was published in this country yesterday for the first time. In glancing over it we find Articles 6 and 8 to read thus:—

"6. Q. What is sin?
"A. Sin is any thought or feeling, word or act, which either is contrary to God's holy law or falls short of what it requires.
"7. Q. Say, in brief, what God's law requires.
"A. That we should love God with our whole heart, and our neighbor as ourselves."

New York professes to be a Christian city. The suggestion that the millions of human beings who live in cozy homes in this great city and pride themselves upon their Christian life are, after all, only sinners, would make them stare and gasp. Yet unless you challenge the above definition of Christian law or prove that the story of the begging woman is untrue, how can you deny those two facts?

"Love our neighbors as ourselves!" Man alive, have you and your children ever fed on stale bread and water? Or would you lie snugly in bed if you knew that your children, who are virtually a part of yourself, were waiting for their mother to bring home the fruits of begging?

"Oh, well," we hear you say, "if I had been in court I would have contributed liberally to that purse. In any event, now that the case has been brought to my attention, I'll send those folks something."

That isn't religion. It isn't even decent charity. It is that miserable makeshift known as Charity Organization Society Charity, which isn't real charity at all.

You know just as well as we do how much you love yourself. If, like the Oriental adepts, you were to project your astral body to the other side of the globe, and then from the distance saw your real body surrounded by your children feeding on stale bread and water because you had no work, what an agony of wretchedness would seize you! How you would yearn to rush back and wipe out that awful condition once and for all. Ah, yes. You love yourself. But how much do you love your neighbor?
