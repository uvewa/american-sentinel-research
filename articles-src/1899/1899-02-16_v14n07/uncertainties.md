# Uncertainties — v14n07 (1899-02-16)

## General Notes

- The OCR file for this issue was transcribed by Mistral OCR from scanned pages.
- Several passages appear in ALL CAPS in the OCR — these likely represent normal text in the original that was OCR'd inconsistently. The all-caps rendering has been preserved faithfully in the transcription; the original may have used normal case.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 9, "News, Notes and Comment" — ALL CAPS passages
- **Issue:** Multiple paragraphs appear in ALL CAPS in the OCR (e.g., "IF AMERICA IS TO TEACH THE PHILIPPINE NATIVES REPUBBLICAN GOVERNMENT..."; "THE NAVAL COMMITTEE..."; "A SUNDAY-CLOSING MOVEMENT...")
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — these appear to be OCR artifacts or scanning anomalies, not original all-caps text.
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved exactly as rendered by OCR (all caps).
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The word "REPUBBLICAN" in the all-caps passage appears to be an OCR error for "REPUBLICAN." Preserved as-is since the original scan could not be directly verified.
- **Note:** The word "DISSTITUTED" (in the warships passage) is likely an OCR error, possibly for "dissatisfied" or "disgusted." Preserved as OCR rendered it.

### Page 9 — "News, Notes and Comment" heading
- **Issue:** The section "NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT" on page 9 contains multiple short editorial items separated by bullet points (• • •). These have been treated as individual article files.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — standard format for this column.

### Author "S B. HORTON" (page 7)
- **Issue:** The byline reads "BY S B. HORTON" — missing period after "S". This is likely a typo/OCR error for "S. B. Horton."
- **Transcribed as:** "S B. Horton" (preserved as OCR rendered it; may be "S. B. Horton" in original).
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — preserved OCR rendering; second pass suggests period may have been present but missed.

### Page 16 — "DISSTITUTED"
- **Issue:** The word "DISSTITUTED" appears in an all-caps paragraph about naval warships. This is almost certainly an OCR error.
- **Possible readings:** "dissatisfied," "disgusted," "disenchanted"
- **Transcribed as:** DISSTITUTED (preserved exactly).
- **Confidence:** LOW — the word is clearly garbled; original likely reads differently.

### "The War of Principle—No. 17" — Author "F. E. B."
- **Issue:** The author initials "F. E. B." are not among the known author list for the American Sentinel.
- **Transcribed as:** F. E. B. (preserved exactly).
- **Confidence:** HIGH for transcription; author identity unknown.

### Page 2 — "how to the dictates of Despotism"
- **Issue:** In the "New Temptation on the Mount" piece, the OCR reads "how to the dictates of Despotism" — this is likely "bow to the dictates of Despotism."
- **Transcribed as:** "how to the dictates of Despotism" (preserved as OCR rendered it).
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "bow" seems correct contextually, but preserved OCR reading.

### Page 6 — "ENforce" (mixed case)
- **Issue:** The word "ENforce" appears with mixed case in the all-caps passage about Omaha. This is an OCR artifact.
- **Transcribed as:** ENforce (preserved exactly).
- **Confidence:** HIGH for transcription; original likely reads "enforce" or "ENFORCE."

### Articles 09–11 (Page 8 aphorisms)
- **Issue:** Four short aphoristic editorial notes appear on page 8 without clear article titles or bylines. They have been grouped as: (09) two notes on civil government and religious legislation together, (10) note on citizenship, (11) note on popular sentiment.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — grouping judgment call; originals may have been formatted differently.
