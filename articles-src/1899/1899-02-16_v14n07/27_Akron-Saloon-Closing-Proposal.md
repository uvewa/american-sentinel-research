It is proposed in Akron, Ohio, to close all the saloons of that place for two years, and this by the liquor dealers themselves, as a heroic measure to convince the ministers and other crusaders that the saloons are a necessity to the city. The National Liquor League proposes to buy all the saloons in Akron and pay to the proprietors, in addition, a sum equal to their profits for the two years past; then to close the saloons and prohibit any others from opening in the place for two years. It is to be hoped this program will be carried out in full. But to make the test a fair one it should be also provided that the sum habitually spent by the residents of Akron for intoxicants be paid into the city treasury in lieu of the revenue derived from saloon licenses. If the people of Akron should do this they would have just as much money left as when they spent it in the saloons, and would retain the immense advantage of keeping sober.
