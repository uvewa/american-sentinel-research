THE NAVAL COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AT WASHINGTON HAVE RECOMMENDED THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWELVE NEW WARSHIPS, TO MEET THE PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT. THE COST OF THESE VESSELS MUST OF COURSE BE PAID BY THE PEOPLE, WHO WILL REAP A RETURN NOT IN TANGIBLE BENEFIT, BUT IN "GLORY." THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH GLORY OF THIS SORT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO BUY WITHOUT DANGER OF BECOMING DISSTITUTED WITH THEIR BARGAIN. WHILE THE MOST OF THEM HAVE ENOUGH TO DO TO PROVIDE THEMSELVES WITH THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE, CAN THEY AFFORD TO SPEND VAST SUMS ALSO TO PROVIDE WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE NECESSARIES OF DEATH?
