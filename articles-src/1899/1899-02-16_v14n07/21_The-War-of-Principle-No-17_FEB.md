**The War of Principle.—No. 17.**

"How sensitive the Jews were as to having their opinions, traditions, and notions questioned," said Cecil. "How much more sensible it is to be unprejudiced, to be willing to investigate, and, if shown to be in the wrong, to acknowledge it like a man, and adjust one's life to the truth!"

"The Jews were no more sensitive than we are, Cecil, and sensible as it may seem to investigate as you advise, there are very few willing to do so."

"But, Aleck, it is so bigoted, egotistical, senseless, perfectly foolish, to set one's 'stakes,' and then blindfold with prejudice, and say, 'This is the limit of truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'"

"And yet you can see that such a course is the logical outcome of self-dependence. It must have a definite, limited, finite boundary,—one that it can control."

"Why is it, Aleck, that from the Jews down to the last Christian sect, this 'setting stakes' business is so much in vogue? Why, I can see that persecution of all kind has come out of it from first to last. People who do not have any definite belief, are more tolerant and accessible."

"I think, Cecil, that it is something like coral formation; while the life is there, the reef grows. When life departs, there's nothing left but the petrified form of what was once a living thing. The devil is behind the prejudice and the persecution. A dead form is of no practical benefit to the right formation of living character, and he sways human nature to contend for what men still blindly imagine is the living faith."

"But one would think they would contend against total unbelievers more than against those who were going on with the true life."

"No. They are really more in harmony with the unbelieving, even though preserving the form of life. Besides, the true life points out the humiliating fact—that their old form is really dead—only a 'stake.'"

"Yes; that is so. Where actual living truth goes, there is interest awakening, new advocates, and, of course, a rallying of the foe," said Cecil.

"Yes. And as there is really no power from above, and power must be had, men seek it in the state, in society, in themselves."

"This is all illustrated in Paul's preaching at Antioch. He proved the Jews guilty of crucifying their Christ, showed how by despising his testimony, they fulfilled the words of their own prophets, and invited all who would, to partake of the grace of God. When the Jews refused it, he preached the gospel to the Gentiles, and because multitudes responded, envy took hold of the jealous Israelites. Then they took the next step, and stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their coasts."

"Both unbelieving Jews and Gentiles took part against them in Iconium," said Aleck.

"Yes, and the next experience shows how unreliable human nature is."

"How is that?"

"Why, Paul was instrumental in healing a poor cripple. The people were idolaters, and began to cry that the gods had come among them. They were ready to do sacrifice to the apostles, and indeed Paul had a time of it to convince them that he was not to be worshiped. He preached the true God to them. Shortly after, their Jewish persecutors came down and changed the friendliness of the people to the bitterest enmity. They stoned Paul and left him outside the city, supposing him to be dead. Next day he was able to leave the place."

"Surely, Cecil, that does show the fickleness of human nature, and the utter foolishness of thinking to trust in it."

"But, Aleck, are not men advanced and nobler today? Would they be so intolerant, so fickle, so cruel? Has not the lesson of the past done something for the world, to teach them to be charitable? After all though the Christian sects have put in their 'stakes,' they certainly do not contend for the faith as they used to,—with implements of torture, and with the backing of civil law. Now do they?"

"Cecil, wait till the living truth puts them to the test. What does it mean, my friend, that there is such a widespread movement in our country to-day for the union of church and state? What does it betoken that the church is asking for power, and asking for it at the polls instead of at the throne of God? Can you tell me what this means?"

"Aleck, you must know something that I do not. You have hinted at telling me startling news for a long time. When am I to be enlightened?" F. E. B.
