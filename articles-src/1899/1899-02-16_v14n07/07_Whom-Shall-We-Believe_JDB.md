## Whom Shall We Believe?

BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

On November 19, 1863, Abraham Lincoln, in his capacity as president of the United States and commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, stood upon a great battlefield of the civil war, and gave expression to his idea as to the cause for which that war was being waged, in the following language:—

"Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. . . . It is for us, the living, . . . to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is for us . . . to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us,—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion,—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain,—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom,—and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth."

That was Abraham Lincoln's idea in regard to that war—that it was a test as to whether this nation, or any nation, could endure on the proposition that all men are created equal,—that it was to give this nation a new birth of freedom in order that 'government of the people, by the people, and for the people, should not perish from the earth.' Lincoln had an opportunity to know about this matter.

Now, in the year 1899, listen to the great republican newspaper, the Chicago Times-Herald, as to what was accomplished by those men who "gave the last full measure of devotion." We quote from its editorial columns of January 21:—

"The civil war knocked the last remaining breath of humbug out of the Jeffersonian phrase against government without the consent of the governed. The Southern States are still a part of the United States without their voluntary consent."

Now the Jeffersonian phrase, "against government without the consent of the governed" is not intricate or ambiguous, but is short and simple; and if it was a "humbug" in the first place and the civil war "knocked the last remaining breath of humbug out of it," of course it was about wiped out entirely by the civil war. That is exactly what the Times-Herald means and is trying to establish, as is shown by the language which immediately follows the above:—

"So in the Philippines when the senate ratifies the treaty we will govern them with or without their consent, so long as we are held responsible by the civilized world for their conduct."

That is, "we will govern them" whether or no; and they can give their consent to the exercise of arbitrary authority on our part, or not, just as they like. Despotism has never been able to go further than this. No system of oppression has ever attempted to deny to its victims the privilege of consenting to their miseries and the sacrifice of their rights. Even the Inquisition allowed its victims to recant, and gave them absolute freedom of choice between that and the torture chamber. They could do just as they liked. But to get fully what the Times-Herald means by its statement in regard to what was accomplished by the civil war:—

"If in the course of time they become fit for self-government, we can grant it to them. [But will we?] Or if we find that they do not rise to the level of self-government and become a burden to us, we can arrange for their transfer to the guardianship of some other power better equipped than we may prove to be for colonial government."

That is, as the civil war knocked the last remaining breath of "humbug" out of the doctrine that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, we can rule people just according to our own arbitrary will, and they can give their consent to it or not, just as they like. And as the civil war has completely knocked this doctrine out we can do more than that,—if we find that we cannot wring and extort from them what we expected to get when we paid two dollars a head for them, "we can arrange for their transfer" to somebody who understands better than we do the business of handling slaves profitably. Of course, this "some other power" to whose guardianship we will transfer them will be one of those tyrannical and grasping nations of Europe who can't understand our love of liberty and who sneer at our disinterested war in behalf of humanity and oppressed peoples.

So, according to the Times-Herald, the great accomplishment of the civil war was the complete extinguishment of the principle for which the Revolutionary war was waged. Of course something was said at the time of the civil war about a new birth of freedom, and the Southerners were told that they must respect the rights of others; but the real purpose and accomplishment of the war was to show that the principle of the domination of man over man is exceeding broad and may be rightfully practiced wherever we are in power! Of course the Southerners were told that slavery must not be extended beyond certain limits, and that the traffic must remain within those limits; but it was simply that they might wait a little longer until that glorious time that was to be ushered in by the civil war, when the institution of slavery would be elevated to its proper dignity, when the doctrine of slavery extension would be expanded in its scope, so as to embrace not a few States, but the whole world; when the traffic would become a matter, not of individuals in a certain section, but of whole nations of people wherever conquest might give to us the power of domination! The slaves were liberated in the South, of course, but the object of the war was to show that we can establish slavery wherever we please and sell the slaves to anybody we please when we find that they are not a paying investment!

Of course most people have thought that the civil war accomplished better things than these. But no, it simply knocked the "humbug" out of the Jeffersonian phrase that "governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." "Jeffersonian phrase" indeed! Well, there are phrases that are worse than Jeffersonian phrases, and such phrases abound in this country to-day. But we are thankful that this phrase is more than that. It is more even than a phrase of the Declaration. Thomas Jefferson knew that it was more than that, and because it was more he wrote it in the Declaration. It is one of the greatest principles of justice that ever found a place in the documents of human government. It may be "humbug" to tyrants, but liberty and justice declare that it has "stood the closest scrutiny and the severest tests; that it has been tried in the furnace and has proved pure; that it has been weighed in the balance and has not been found wanting; that it has been declared sterling by the general consent of mankind, and is visibly stamped with the image and superscription of the Most High."

No, the civil war did not knock any "humbug" out of that phrase; and a war "solely for humanity"—no, not a thousand of them—will ever knock any "humbug" out of it. It is a principle of God's own government, and though the earth should remove and the heavens depart it will stand fast forever, strong in the might of original justice.

The writer is a Southerner, and his father was a Southern soldier who followed the fortunes of the South throughout the war, beginning at Fort Sumpter on April 12, 1861, and ending at Appomattox in April, 1865. So perhaps, owing to sectional prejudice, he cannot look at this matter with that clear and unobstructed vision that is possible for the great republican newspapers of the North; but he has always credited Abraham Lincoln with understanding the object and purpose of the war which he largely directed, and has never been disposed to find any fault with his utterances on that point.
