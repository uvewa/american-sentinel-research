AGAIN has a great victory been achieved by American arms, on Sunday. On that day of the week, February 5, the American forces at Manila fought the forces of the Filipinos and defeated them with terrible slaughter, while sustaining but little loss themselves. And thus another proof is added to those furnished by the first battle of Manila, the destruction of Cervera's fleet, and the capture of Santiago, that Sunday is as proper a day as can be wished for settling a controversy by resort to arms. But little indeed can be found in these events to indicate that Sunday is a day calling for rest from work and for religious devotion, or is especially the day of the Prince of Peace.
