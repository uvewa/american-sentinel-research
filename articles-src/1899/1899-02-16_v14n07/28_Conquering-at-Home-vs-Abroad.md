The important question with every civilized nation is not whether it can conquer abroad, but whether it can conquer at home. If it cannot conquer at home, it will avail nothing to possess the power to conquer abroad. Rome was mightiest in foreign conquests when she was being overpowered by the foes of free government in Italy. The United States is conquering foes abroad, but there are many of its citizens who feel that their interests and those of the nation would be much better served if the Government were to combat some of the foes which seem to be defying it at home; as the Standard Oil Trust, the "Embalmed Beef" Trust, and other like monopolies, which exist in defiance of State law.
