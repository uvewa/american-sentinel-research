THE secretary of the Anti-Imperialistic League, Mr. Erving Winslow, in reply to the charge of treason made against his society, points out that, as regards the present campaign against the Filipinos, "it is not pretended that this war was declared by Congress, or that it had been approved by Congress, in which body alone, under our Constitution, the right to declare war exists."
