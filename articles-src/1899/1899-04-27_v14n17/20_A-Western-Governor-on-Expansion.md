### DEMANDS RETURN OF MEN.

Governor Lee, of South Dakota, Sends President McKinley a Warm Letter.

Associated Press Telegram in "Kansas City Times," April 15, 1899.

PIERRE, S. D., April 13.—Governor Lee has written to President McKinley, demanding the return of the South Dakota volunteers from the Philippines. He recites the facts of enlistment to fight for humanity against Spain, declares that "the South Dakota volunteers have fulfilled every obligation which they owe to their country and its flag," and should be allowed to return home. He says: "We view their present or future detention as unconstitutional and a violation of the law which called the organization into being, and feel sure they will not be retained against their will, against the law and against the moral sense of the people of our State without offering some subject reason for so doing."

He declares the present course "repugnant to the fundamental principles of this Government, a violation of the Declaration of Independence, a repudiation of the theory upon which we engaged in the war with Spain, and utterly inconsistent with your excellency's splendid announcement respecting the policy to be pursued toward Cuba."

He says the people are "unable to countenance the present attempt of this Government to enforce title with bayonets to a nation of brown men purchased from a disgraced and vanquished despot and regard the further sacrifice of our soldiers, in a conflict waged against liberty and in the interest of exploiting capitalism, as totally incompatible with the spirit of our institutions."
