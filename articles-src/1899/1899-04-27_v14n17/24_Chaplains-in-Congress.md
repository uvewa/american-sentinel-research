Some early history of the opposition to chaplains in Congress, in which the merits of the question were clearly set before that body, is given in the pamphlet "A Conspiracy Against the Republic," noticed before in our columns. The author quotes from speeches made on the floor of Congress, and reported in the Congressional Globe. These speeches are worthy of note because they form a part of Congressional history, and because they are equally pertinent to the situation to-day.

The opposition to chaplains in Congress, says the author of this pamphlet, "appears to have first made itself known at the first session of the 26th Congress." Continuing, he says:—

"On the 27th of December, 1839, a motion was made in the House to reconsider the vote by which the resolution of the Senate relative to the appointment of chaplains, was concurred in.

"Mr. Cooper, of Georgia, said he believed the House had proceeded in this matter without just and proper authority. He believed the effect of the employment to be evil. Who is the chaplain? Is he an officer of this House? By what authority do you appoint him? If there was any authority, he wished to be pointed to it. What are the effects of the practice? they seemed to be evil. The resolution, to be sure, proposed to elect two chaplains of different denominations, but notwithstanding this, he objected to it, because this matter of religious denominations should not be agitated in this House. This matter of sectarianism might create no difficulty for some time, but a time might come when it would.

"'It is not two hundred years since a king of England was required to make a formal declaration of religious tolerance. It is not one hundred years since a man in this land of liberty dare not think religiously as he pleased; and it is scarce fifty years ago when, by the adoption of our Constitution, it was found necessary to declare that no religious tests should be required.

"'All history tells us that this matter is one which never failed to force itself on every government, and to connect itself with every organic movement, for the purpose of carrying out its objects.

"'Does the devout man come here to make merchandise of his calling? Here, then, if I am not misinformed, is the place where men in high places meet to drive bargains. Here, too, he may have his contract signed, sealed, and delivered, whereby, for and in consideration of a certain number of prayers, suitably short, a given number of sermons not too long, singing excepted, by him the said chaplain uttered and delivered, we, the members of this House, do agree to be and appear in our seats on such occasions, devoutly, and in order to listen, and after a certain time to pay him $500. [This sum was afterward increased.] . . .

"'It is, sir, to avert this deleterious example, and prevent the insinuation of religious denominations by sects, into this House, that I urge a reconsideration, that we may not exercise powers not granted, and may prevent a union of church and state.'

"Mr. Rice Garland was glad the motion had been made, as it would give him an opportunity to record his vote against the resolution for the appointment of a chaplain. He had seen enough in this hall to prevent him from ever supporting a resolution for the appointment of a chaplain for this House. He had seen the claims of ministers urged upon this House upon the ground of political predilection, and one had been selected upon the sole ground that he was a friend of the President of the United States.

"'There is a regular system of electioneering for the office of chaplain, and the general inquiry is, "Does he make short prayers?" the person making the shortest prayers being the greatest favorite. Besides, while the chaplain is making his morning prayers, a large portion of the members are reading newspapers, or walking about the hall. In fact, the service is nothing more than a solemn farce, and I trust that the House will dispense with the chaplain.'

"Mr. Wise was supported by Mr. Nisbett and Mr. Slade.

"Mr. Crabb said he was one of those opposed to the appointment of chaplains for that body. He thought they had no right to appropriate the public money for such a purpose.

"Mr. Cooper: 'I ask gentlemen to put their hands on the authority by which they would take the money of their constituents and pay it over to a chaplain. Tell me, where is your authority for appropriating the money of the people in this way? Believing, as I do, that such power would be dangerous, I would be the first man to persuade the people to take it away, and thus sever all connection between church and state.'

"Mr. Craig spoke in favor of maintaining chaplains.

"On a call for the previous question, but twelve votes were recorded against the chaplains.—[Cong. Globe, 1st session, 26th Congress, pp. 83 to 85.

"But the moral influence of these twelve votes, and of the speeches which had been made in their justification, was great, and laid the foundation for stronger opposition thereafter.

"In the meantime, the disgraceful squabble over the chaplainship, in order to secure the $500 per annum, was continued.

"On the 7th of December, 1840, Mr. Cooper, in the House, asked leave to introduce a bill to repeal the laws then in force fixing the salary of chaplains. Leave was refused; but the vote against the chaplains was now increased from 12 to 21 . . . —[Cong. Globe, 2d session 26th Cong., p. 38.

"At different times, especially in the 29th Congress, remonstrances were presented against the election of chaplains.

"Mr. Pettit claimed that the chaplain was an unconstitutional officer.

"Mr. Chapman said whenever he was called on to act, with the Constitution on one hand, and his personal safety on the other, he had but one alternative. If any gentleman could show him any authority, either constitutional or otherwise, to vote the people's money to such a use as that contemplated in this resolution, he was prepared to vote for it most cheerfully; but until then, neither to promulgate the gospel nor any other creed, would he take the money of the people and apply it to any unconstitutional purpose.

"He knew very well that in this case precedent might be pleaded, and gentlemen might refer to the uniform practice of the House; but with him precedent did not weigh one straw. The Constitution was his guide; and though it could be shown that the House had been perpetually in the breach of that instrument from the very foundation of the Government, he was ready to take all the consequences of refusing to vote.

"He was excused from voting. The resolution was adopted, the House refusing to order the yeas and nays.—Cong. Globe, vol. 15, pp. 40, 41.

"In the House, on the 22d of December, 1845, thirteen nominations for chaplain were made. Election on third ballot.

"On this occasion, Mr. Pettit made the following protest:—

"'It is clear by the Constitution of the United States that this House of Congress cannot legislate on the subject of religion. I therefore believe that it is a direct and palpable violation of the Constitution to foster in any form or manner any religion whatsoever; or to pay out one dollar, ay, one farthing of the public money on that object. Believing so, I ask to be excused from voting.'

"Mr. Sawyer, of Ohio, desired, also, to be excused from voting, because, he said, he had conscientious scruples, and did not believe that he could vote, consistently, with the oath he had taken. Both were excused.—[Cong. Globe, vol 15, p. 92.

"Petitions and remonstrances against the practice continued to be presented.

"March 22, 1850, in the Senate, Mr. Underwood, of Kentucky, presented petitions, asking Congress to abolish the office of chaplain, and henceforth to refrain from all legislation on religious subjects. A portion of one of the petitions was read.

"The petitioners said, among other things, 'A national chaplaincy, no less than a national church, is considered by us emphatically an "establishment of religion."'

"In the House, Feb. 28, 1860, Mr. Millson, having offered a resolution to proceed to the election of a chaplain, stated it was a resolution offered to complete the organization of the House.

"Mr. Burnett said: 'I would be glad to know where the gentleman from Virginia gets his authority. If there is anything in the Constitution, anything in the laws, anything in the rules of this House, authorizing the election of a chaplain, and making his election necessary for a complete organization of this House. I have never seen it.'

"March 5, 1860, in the House, Mr. Millson offered a resolution for the election of chaplain, claiming it as a question of privilege.

"Mr. Houston said: 'It cannot be a question of privilege, unless a chaplain is by law a part of the organization of the House. There is no law for the election of a chaplain. Is the chaplain an officer of this House? Where is the law for it? Where is the Constitutional provision for it? By what authority is he an officer of this House?

"An exciting discussion followed, in which there were many interruptions on points of order, etc., in the course of which Mr. Houston said:—

"I see there is a determination that we shall not have a fair vote on the contesting propositions, but that chaplains are to be foisted on the people."

"Finally, a vote was reached on the motion to lay the resolution for the election of chaplains on the table. The vote stood: Yeas, 61; nays, 116.]—Cong. Globe, 1st sess. 36th Cong., p. 944.

"Here it will be seen, that the vote against chaplains, which was 12 in 1839, and 21 in 1840, had, in 1860, risen to 61.

"For the last thirty-eight years, but little has been said about chaplains in Congress."
