In an article from the *Christian Herald* is the following statement: "Abolish the Sabbath and you abolish your religious privileges. Let the bad work go on, and you have 'the commune,' and you have 'the revolution,' and you have the sun of national prosperity going down in darkness and blood."

This statement is literally true, as is shown in that great object lesson, the Jewish people. God chose Abraham because he knew him, and he obeyed God's voice, and kept his charge, his commandments, his statutes, and his laws.

When Moses went down to fetch Israel out of Egypt, they had wandered from the way in which their father Abraham walked. A reform was necessary. Moses began by calling them back to the observance of the Sabbath of the Lord. Pharaoh objected to this and said: "Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works?" "Behold, the people of the land are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens." Ex. 5:4, 5.

The opposition of Pharaoh could have been easily met if the people had been willing to obey God. Infidelity and atheism can do but little against reform, if the people are willing to be reformed. Israel of old would not "cast away the abominations of their eyes; neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt." Eze. 20:8. In this chapter the Lord brings the charge against them over and over, "My Sabbaths they greatly polluted."

While they were yet in the wilderness he told them that if they did not reverence his Sabbaths and keep his statutes they would be scattered among all nations. They insisted, however, upon turning again and again to Baal, the sun god, until there was no remedy. The Lord let them go and the people were scattered.

When Christ came those who still held to the true Sabbath had it so buried under their own ideas that the Lord of the Sabbath was not recognized by them. He did not keep the Sabbath as they thought he ought, "Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay him." John 5:16. Thus they followed him through the corn fields into the synagogue, where the withered hand was restored, and the crooked woman made straight.

They contended with the man whose eyes were opened, and finally rendered their decision: "This man [Jesus] is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath day."

Israel would not obey God. They wanted a king like the nations around them. A king arose who told them where, when, and how they should worship. They turned away to Baal and polluted God's Sabbath. The "bad work" went on until "the revolution" rent the kingdom asunder, and now (in Christ's time) they have dug a grave wide and deep. In it they have placed the Sabbath given by the Creator. Over its bound form they have heaped their traditions high. Still the "bad work" goes on until they mount the godless pile and with the blood of the "Lord of the Sabbath" dripping from their fingers (Matt. 27:25) watch their "sun of national prosperity go down in darkness and blood."

Why is it that the governments of earth will not learn the lesson? From the beginning of earthly governments the "brittleness of clay" has entered into them just to the extent that they have undertaken to direct in the things of God. The civil government and the church of Christ do not "cleave one to another." "The gospel is the power of God unto salvation." The seventh day Sabbath, the Sabbath that was made by the Creator, is the sign of God's power to create men anew. When human governments take God's work in hand, they say to him, "We must save the nation; your work is a failure."

Look at Spain to-day, the mere shadow of her former self. She considers herself the minister of religion to all her subjects. The iron and the clay will not mix.

Stranger than all the work of civil governments is the action of those who profess to believe in Christ yet are appealing to the governments of earth for help. They are calling for the death and burial of God's Sabbath, and want the nations to exalt and establish the Sunday Sabbath. There is not one text in all the Holy Writ to sustain such shameful work.

God has a controversy with all who are engaged in this bad business. He says to them as he did to Israel of old, when they were engaged in a like work: "You have dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in the land, among those that profess my name; for ye have profaned the holiness of the Lord [Ex. 31: 15, margin] which he loves, and have married the daughter [Sunday] of a strange God" (Baal).

The teachers "have been partial in the law." The Lord "will cut off the man that hath done this, the master and the scholar." Mal. 2:9-12.

Any person who in his own belief and practice abolished God's Sabbath abolishes his own spiritual privileges, becomes a fit subject for "the revolution," and will in the end see his own sun of self-righteousness go out in everlasting darkness, fire, and blood.
