IT has been discovered that there is a Mormon chaplain in the United States army, Elias Kimball by name. He was commissioned in July of last year, but, says the Christian Advocate, in making note of the case, "the department did not know that he was a Mormon up to the time of his appointment" and for some weeks afterward. The inference is that if the department had known it, Mr. Kimball would not have been appointed; and the Advocate is much surprised at this "official recognition of Mormonism as a religion." But why is not Mormonism as much entitled to recognition from the Government as any other religion? Why are not the Utah regiments in the army as much entitled to a Mormon chaplain as are the Maryland regiments to a Catholic chaplain?

IF the Government would refuse to appoint and pay any army chaplain, but leave this matter entirely to the management of the various churches, it would be much to the advantage of the soldiers and helpful to the cause of peace between the churches.

Governmental recognition is no recommendation for any religion. The only true religion is Christianity; but Jesus Christ was never recognized in his divine character by the civil government, and how can it be expected that his religion will have recognition from the same source? The civil government condemned Jesus as an imposter, and this is precisely the view civil governments have always taken of his religion.
