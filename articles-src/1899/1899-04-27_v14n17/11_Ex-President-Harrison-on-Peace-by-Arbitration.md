EX-PRESIDENT HARRISON recently, in reply to the proposition of the Christian Endeavor Society for a "war against war, and peace by arbitration," said the following:—

"For myself, and much more for the great body of its citizenship, I express the desire of America for peace with the whole world. It would have been vain to suggest the pulling down of block houses or family disarmament to the settlers on a hostile Indian frontier. They would have told you rightly that the conditions were not ripe. And so it may be, and is, probably, true that a full application of the principle is not presently possible, the devil still being unchained."

THE conditions will be ripe, then, when the devil shall have been chained. But to chain the devil for the world at large is more than the Christian Endeavor or any other society, religious or secular, can accomplish. The Scriptures tell how this will finally be done (Rev. 20:1-3); but under the present order of things there can be only banishment of the devil from the individual heart, and that by the power of God.

MR. HARRISON might have added no less truthfully that in the Christian warfare, such as all Christian societies are supposed to wage, there can be no "peace by arbitration."
