A DISPATCH dated "Washington, April 17," says: "A Catholic chapel on the Government reservation at West Point is now assured. Acting Secretary of War Meiklejohn on Friday last issued a license under which the structure will be erected. This action was taken after Archbishop Corrigan had talked with the President and Mr. Meiklejohn concerning the matter, and is in pursuance of the authority granted to the War Department by Congress in an act approved July 8 of last year."

Some of our readers may remember that Attorney-General McKenna, a Catholic, rendered an adverse decision in the matter of allowing a sectarian establishment on the West Point grounds, which put a stop for the time to such proceedings. But, says this dispatch, Father O'Keefe, for the Catholics, has been "especially active" in seeking the desired permission from the Government, and with full success. The Catholic authorities can be depended on to be "especially active" always in getting their religion recognized by the Government.
