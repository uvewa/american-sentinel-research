The legislature of Massachusetts has petitioned the General Court, says a press dispatch dated at Boston the 18th inst., "praying that the sentence of banishment for Massachusetts against Roger Williams be revoked." The petition for this relief, it is added, was drawn up at a Baptist conference in Boston.

Roger Williams was banished from Massachusetts by the Puritans in 1635, because he held and taught "heretical" doctrines, one of the chief of which was that the civil magistrate could not rightfully punish a person for a breach of the law prescribing our duties to God. The sentence of banishment decreed that he should never return. Now, however, having served two hundred and sixty-four years of his sentence, it is thought the descendants of his banishers may be satisfied, and be willing to revoke the decree of exile.

We do not see how this petition, if granted, is going to affect Roger Williams personally. He cannot return in person; but it would be a most excellent thing if Roger Williams' spirit—that is, the spirit of toleration, of respect for human rights, and of true piety, which he manifested, would return not only to Massachusetts but to every State in the land.
