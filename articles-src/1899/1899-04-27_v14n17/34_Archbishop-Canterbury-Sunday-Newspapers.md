SUNDAY newspapers in England are to be boycotted, if nothing worse. The archbishop of Canterbury, the head of the Established Church, has called a conference of bishops to assemble May 10, to take steps for the suppression of Sunday journalism, to which the archbishop refers as "the growth of the pernicious system of breaking the Sabbath by publication of newspapers." This same church allows the English saloon to flourish seven days in the week with scarcely a protest.

The Established Church, it would seem from recent events, needs to be itself delivered from the devil of ritualism before it can properly undertake to cast out the devil of the Sunday papers.
