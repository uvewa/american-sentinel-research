A LONDON, Eng., religious journal, makes a noteworthy comment upon the attitude of some of the church people toward the Sunday paper innovation. It says:—

"The complaint against the Sunday newspapers, which are about to be issued, and to which we referred last week, grows in volume. One man writes the following pitiful letter to a religious journal:—

"'As a bookseller and a large newsagent, I feel it difficult to know what to do. I know what Jesus would do, but I have to consider my business—my only means of livelihood. What effect will these Sunday papers have on my business? I have had several applications to supply the papers, and if I am not prepared to send the Sunday edition, I am not to send it on the other days, my customer will get them where he can get his Sunday edition, the result to me is probably a great loss in business and possibly bankruptcy.'

"'Again, I shall be debarred from work in the Sunday-school. I shall be unable to get to a place of worship—at least on Sunday mornings; I shall be compelled to keep my shop open and send out my paper boys with the papers, and thus my influence as a Sunday-school teacher is destroyed.'

"The present test is the best thing that could come to this man. He thinks he is a Christian, and working for the Lord, but his business is his god. He will follow where that calls him to go even against his conscience. Such a teacher can have no real influence for good, for acts speak louder than words. 'I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead.' God does not ask men to honor Sunday. 'The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord,' but those who do not obey the first commandment will not keep the fourth even though they see clearly that it has never been changed."
