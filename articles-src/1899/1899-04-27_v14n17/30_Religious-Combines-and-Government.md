"COMBINES" are getting to be almost as popular in the religious world as they have become in secular affairs; and they promise wonderful things. See the article, "The United Christian Party," page 259. In secular affairs the principle of such combines is recognized as bad and dangerous to the prosperity of the country. What then must be said of religious combines whose power is to be exercised in governmental affairs?
