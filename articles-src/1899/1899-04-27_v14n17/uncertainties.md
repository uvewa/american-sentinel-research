## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 06 — "The Constitution of American Imperialism.—No. 2."
- **Location:** First paragraph of the body text, sentence "…it is not a matter of 'putting down the rebellion,' and of having 'our authority acknowledge' and unquestioned'…"
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "acknowledged" split across a page break as "acknowledge" + "edged and unquestioned" at the top of page 5. The text was joined to read "acknowledge" + "d and unquestioned" = "acknowledged and unquestioned". The transcription renders this: "having 'our authority acknowledge' and unquestioned'" — the closing quotation mark placement is slightly ambiguous across the page break.
- **Second pass:** Yes. The phrase appears to be a single quoted clause: "our authority acknowledged and unquestioned". Transcribed accordingly with the close-quote after "unquestioned".
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — page-break split makes exact quotation mark placement uncertain.

### Article 03 — "The New-Fangled Good Samaritan."
- **Location:** The article by A. T. J. ends at the bottom of page 2 ("…wrath of her fornication?"), followed immediately by A. T. J. initials, then the Parkhurst quotation begins at the top of page 3 without a section break. The Parkhurst quote is presented as a separate standalone item (article 04).
- **Decision:** Treated as two separate articles: ATJ's editorial (article 03) and the Parkhurst quote as its own reprint/standalone item (article 04).
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the content and authorship are clearly distinct.

### Article 09 — "A Frank Admission."
- **Location:** The attribution "Present Truth. (London. Eng.)" appears as a heading above the article body (not at the end). This is treated as a reprint from *Present Truth*.
- **Decision:** attribution = "reprint", original_publication = "Present Truth (London, Eng.)". The embedded Rev. Frank Crane quote at the end is part of the reprint text, not a separate article.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

### Page 1 — Short Editorial Items
- **Location:** Multiple short editorial epigrams appear on page 1 before the first titled article "What Evangelist Moody Says on the Question."
- **Decision:** Grouped into a single file (01_Editorial-Epigrams_ATJ.md) as these are the standard front-page editorial aphorisms typical of this publication. Attribution is editorial.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

### Articles 25–28 (page 13 short notes) and Articles 29–36 (page 16 editorial notes)
- **Decision:** Each distinct paragraph-length note was given its own article file per the project instruction that every item gets its own file.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.
