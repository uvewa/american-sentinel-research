The Nashville Banner (Tenn.) of the 13th inst. makes note of a new Sunday-law bill which has been introduced in the State Senate. It says:—

"Mr. Boyd to-day introduced in the Senate a bill 'to secure a more rigid observance of the Sabbath.' The bill provides 'that every person who shall either labor himself or compel his servant, apprentice, or any other person under his charge or control to labor or perform any work other than the household offices of daily necessity, or other works of necessity or charity, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be subject to a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $25, and imprisonment not less than thirty days nor more than three months, provided that this section shall not prohibit any ferryman from crossing passengers on any day in the week.' The second section provides 'that any person who shall expose to sale any goods, wares or merchandise, except such goods, wares or merchandise be sold for the sick or dead, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, fined not less than $25 nor more than $100.'"

Tennessee already has a Sunday law under which a number of people have been worked in the chain gang for doing ordinary work on Sunday, although they were good citizens and conscientious observers of the seventh day. What does the State want of a "more rigid" law than that by which good, conscientious people can be worked in the chain gang? If a more rigid observance of Sunday is really aimed at, some severer penalty than the chain gang should be provided, such as solitary confinement or death. And by the way, where will the demand for a "more rigid" observance stop short of the most rigid observance of the day that the severest penalties of human law can secure?
