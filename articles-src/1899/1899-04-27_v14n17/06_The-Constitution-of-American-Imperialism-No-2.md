IMPERIALISTS have been clamorous for a recognition of the situation "as it is." They have been impatient that anybody should stop to think and talk of the past instead of addressing themselves to "the question and the situation just as it is," which "has not come through any fault on our part." The men from whom we quoted last week in a certain sense recognize the situation and have addressed themselves to the question as it is. So plainly, so directly, and so coolly have they done so that their language is not likely to mislead anyone as to the situation that now confronts the American people. In the light of these outspoken declarations of leading imperialists, the situation is too plain to admit of doubt. He who knows the value and meaning of liberty and free government will need nothing more to bring him to a most lively realization of the situation as it is, indeed. And in the realization of what it is, he will realize what it is not.

The situation as it is and the serious and over-shadowing question with which the American people are brought face to face, is not a matter of a few Americans having gotten into Manila and can't get away; it is not a matter of "who will haul down the flag where conquest of arms has placed it;" nor of "who will withdraw from the people over whom it floats its protecting folds;" it is not a matter of committing the free and enfranchised Filipinos to the guiding hand and the liberalizing influences, the generous sympathies, the uplifting education, of their American emancipators;" it is not a matter of "the success of our own arms and the maintenance of our own honor;" it is not a matter of "putting down the rebellion," and of having "our authority acknowledge" and unquestioned" by the "rebels," "mobs," "outlaws," "bandits," and "cut-throats" of the Philippines; it is not a matter of "fixing" and "locating sovereignty in the Philippines—taking it out of the air," as ex-senator Gray puts it; it is not a matter of "standing by the peace that has been secured, even if we have to fight for it," as Whitelaw Reid puts it; it is not a matter of "turning timidly away from the duties imposed upon the country by its own great deeds;" it is not a matter of showing "ourselves worthy of the great trust which civilization has imposed upon us;" it is not a matter of "manfully and bravely accepting our responsibilities;" it is not a matter of "keeping pace with what our arms have accomplished;" it is not a matter of "bearing the white man's burden," in the sense that Mr. Kipling puts it; it is not a matter of bringing "8,000,000 rude people in southern seas to desire and acquire bedsteads," as the Secretary of the Treasury puts it; it is not a matter of doing "our share of the world's work," of "playing our part in the great work of uplifting mankind," of holding "our own in the struggle for naval and commercial supremacy," of "grasping the points of vantage which will enable us to have our say in deciding the destiny of the oceans of the East and the West," or of "showing ourselves weaklings, unable to carry to successful completion the labors that great and high-spirited nations are eager to undertake," as the governor of New York puts it; it is not a matter of "shirking or discharging the responsibilities upon us;" it is not a matter of "either Spain or the United States in the Philippines;" it is not a matter of "leaving the Philippines to anarchy and chaos, or of tossing them into the arena of contention for the strife of nations;" it is not a matter of "the great trust to which we are committed under the providence of God and in the name of human progress and civilization;" it is not a matter of "our perils and sacrifices in order to benefit these remote peoples;" it is not a matter of "our responsibility to civilization;" it is not a matter of "pilloring our good name," and of proving "recreant to the instincts of humanity;" it is not a matter of "leaving our work only half done;" it is not a matter of "taking the people of the Philippines kindly by the hand and leading them into the blessed light of freedom," as Mr. Charles Denby puts it; it is not a matter of having "new outposts of defense and influence to place the seal of security upon the designs of peace," and of "holding in trust the liberties of nearly twelve millions of human beings," as the assistant secretary of state puts it; it is not a matter of "having a share in the great work of controlling and civilizing the tropics," and of becoming "a potent and irresistible factor in promoting the peace and civilization of the world," as Joseph Chamberlain puts it; it is not a matter of rising "to be a world power, henceforth to be reckoned with among the very few great nations of the earth," as Senator Lodge puts it; it is not a matter of aiding "in advancing civilization, promoting enlightened and humane government, furthering the progress of the Christian faith, and protecting innocent people from barbarous and inhuman treatment," as the chief of the bureau of equipment for the navy puts it; it is not a matter of "the great development of the great force of Christian civilization on earth," which force "was behind our army at Santiago and our ships in Manila Bay," because "we have been chosen to carry on and to carry forward this great work of uplifting humanity on earth," as Senator Platt of Connecticut stated it in the United States Senate.

No; the situation as it is is not all nor any one of these things. In the plain and direct statements which we quoted last week the froth of imperialism is dispensed with, and the thing itself stands before us just as it is. The question as it is is not to be settled by a campaign of guerilla warfare in the Philippines. It is not necessary for any American to go ten thousand miles from the capital of his country and seven thousand miles from the western seaboard in order to meet the situation as it is. The language which we quoted last week from leading imperialists brings home to every American citizen the real situation, which he can, and does, face as he stands on his own threshold.

The thing with which the American people are brought face to face is this: Shall the natural and inalienable rights of American freemen, which have been recognized and guaranteed to them in the Constitution of their fathers, continue to be upheld by that Constitution, or shall those rights become dependent upon the will and caprice of men who have arrogated to themselves supreme and irresponsible powers, and who propose to "consecrate" and to "stamp legality" upon their acts by means of an "expansive" and "elastic" constitution "interpreted by men supremely great?"* Is the American Government to be a government of law or is it to be a government of will by men who know no law but "destiny" and the "inexorable logic of events," and who declare that they are not wise enough and that they know of no one "who is wise enough or sufficiently informed to determine what form of government will best subserve . . . our interests and our well being?" Are the plain statements of the American Constitution to stand as they are written and to mean what they say, or are they to become subject to the jugglery of "stern men with empires in their brains?"

The question is: Is American law to be corrupted at its very fountainhead; is justice to be thrown into the streets; and is equity to be debarred from the American Constitution? Instead of being a matter of "holding in trust the liberties of nearly twelve millions of human beings," it is a question of striking down the instrument which is the legal bulwark of the liberties of nearly one hundred millions of human beings. Instead of being a question of "either Spain or the United States in the Philippines," it is a question of constitutional government or of an arbitrary system on American soil.

That is the situation *as it is*, and woe unto the American people if they fail to recognize it.

We shall have more to say in regard to this matter next week.

*That is the exact expression used by Theodore Roosevelt in an enthusiastic speech in favor of imperialism, delivered in Chicago on April 10.
