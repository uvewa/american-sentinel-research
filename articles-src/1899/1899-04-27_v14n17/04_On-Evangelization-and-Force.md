If you put cold lead into a man's heart for the sake of trying to civilize him, his children may be pardoned for receiving with only chill cordiality the gospel you undertake to put in their hearts for the purpose of Christianizing them. If Jesus had gone armed, it would have been a confession on his part that the brute force of the visible world is more than a match for the spirit power of the invisible world. You cannot make a man believe in God if you do not convince him that you believe in God yourself. Peter, by brandishing his sword, denied the divinity of Jesus. And any other man cheapens God when he goes about to yoke God's Spirit alongside of carnal contrivances. It is the absence of such carnal contrivance that explains the rapid extension of Christianity during the first three centuries of our own era. God worked mightily because he had no backing. Up to that time armies and navies were on the side of the pagans. Christianity is never so powerful as when it is unprotected, and evangelization that depends upon soldiers and gunboats has no future.—Dr. Chas. H. Parkhurst.
