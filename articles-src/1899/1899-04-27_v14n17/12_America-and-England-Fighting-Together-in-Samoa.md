IN a letter written home by an American sailor at Samoa, where American and English ships of war have been acting in concert against hostile natives, this interesting statement is made:—

"When the 'Porpoise' left for the point our band played 'God Save the Queen' and their band played 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' and cheers were given and returned with a will. The Americans and English are like brothers. The captain of the 'Porpoise' came aboard our ship and grasped Admiral Kautz by the hand, saying, 'Well, Admiral, this is the first time that America and England have ever fought together, and I am proud of it.'"

"THE first time that America and England ever fought together," may well be looked upon as an occasion of importance; and doubly so, in view of the circumstances which now logically bind America and England together as imperial powers.
