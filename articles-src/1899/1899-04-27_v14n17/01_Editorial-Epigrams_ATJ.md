"THE revealed will of God" is a phrase often used to conceal the will of a bigot.

The true religion wants nothing which it is in the power of the civil authority to give.

STEEL and lead are not good conductors for an outflowing current of Christian benevolence.

Society cannot elevate or reform itself any more than a machine can create power to run itself.

The truly "Christian conscience" seeks not to have men punished for their sins, but saved from them.

The saloon may be induced to keep Sunday, but this will be very doubtful honor for the "Sabbath."

The doctrine of imperialism assumes the people of foreign lands to be guilty until they are proved innocent, incapable until they are proved capable.
