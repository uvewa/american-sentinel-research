Such is the title of a new organization which has arisen, and is heralded in the press as "a new candidate for political preferment and reformation of the world."

This new reform party is not altogether distinct from other parties that have been longer in the field of "reform." In its essential principles it is in harmony with the great religious organizations which aim to secure moral reform through politics, and upon certain fundamental issues can work in harmony with these, as it no doubt will; while it will all the time work to pull these other organizations toward the line of the realization of the ideal for which it stands distinctively, and which is as complete an embodiment of church and state union as has yet appeared in the United States.

To this end this new party has issued a "call" to "all who are substantially agreed with the declaration of principles" which it puts forth, "irrespective of sex or creed, nationality or previous affiliations." It is to hold a convention at Des Moines, Ia., July 4, 5, "for the purpose of completing a state and national organization." At this convention it "will nominate a governor, lieutenant-governor, judge of the supreme court, state superintendent of public instruction and a railroad commissioner." It is to be thoroughly political from the start.

From the following, which is a part of this "call," the reader can grasp fully the character and purpose of this new party:—

"This call is extended, first, to all the denominations of the Christian Church; second, to all other religious organizations; third, to the young people's religious societies; fourth, to the Y. M. C. A.; fifth, to the W. C. T. U.; sixth, to all reform societies or parties; seventh, to the National Reform Association; eighth, to all other benevolent associations not herein enumerated, and to all persons who desire to see the principles of Christ triumph.

"Come and coöperate with us in the greatest reformation in the world's history.

"In the impending conflict between right and wrong, between political righteousness and political corruption, between the power of God and the power of the devil; in the interest of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man; for the Christian religion, humanity, and the final establishment of the kingdom of God on earth.

"Come! Let us unite in His name and exalt His name together and hasten the time when our swords shall be beat into plowshares; and when every tongue shall confess that God is God and Christ is Lord of all and King of kings.

"The kingdom of Christ is Christ's reign on earth, and is of a fourfold division, viz. the individual, the family, the church and the state. Each of these divisions are of divine authority, and the salvation of each division is essential for the salvation of the world.

"The state and nation, a divine institution in Christ's kingdom, is the political field rejected by his builders, and can only be reached through political methods, by a union of all Christian forces.

"Not a union of church and state, but a union of Christian prayers and ballots, that legalized wrong may be overthrown and righteous laws established in harmony with the divine law of the revealed will of Christ, as of supreme authority in both church and state, that God's will may be done on earth. 'The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.' Isa. 9:6-7. Then with this motto as our standard of right:

**WHAT WOULD JESUS DO?**

With the Christian response:

"'I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.'

"'Thy will be done on earth.'

"Then, with the 20,000 Christian voters of our State all united at the ballot box, Iowa will at the next general election become a government from God, through Christ, by the people and for the people.

"To the honor and glory of God, as revealed in the prophecies: Ps. 33:12; Isa. 9:6–7; Isa. 2:4; Dan. 7:18; Dan. 7:27; Rev. 11:15; Rev. 19:16, or, as Abraham Lincoln portrayed the same reign of the Prince of Peace, in his first public speech away back in the Washingtonian temperance movement, in the following words:—

"'And when the victory shall be complete, when there shall be neither a slave nor a drunkard on earth, how proud the title of that land which may truly claim to be the birthplace and cradle of both those revolutions that shall have ended in that victory! How nobly distinguished that people who 'shall have planted and nurtured to maturity both the political and moral freedom of their species.'"

The "declaration of principles" of this new reform party is, as might be expected, decidedly interesting. It is as follows:—

"We declare our purpose as a party of reform, to be in favor of whatever tends to make men and women more virtuous, intelligent, and happy, and to be identical with that of the national Constitution thus far to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, to promote the general welfare, and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

"Knowing that God gave us a foundation for law and a standard of justice through Christ, which is beneficial for all men and women, and that it was the intention of Christ that his followers should be united.

"We hold that all governments derive their just power from God and through and by the consent of the governed, and that the mere right to vote for rulers does not constitute self-government.

"We do therefore declare for the adoption of the system of direct legislation known as the initiative and referendum, together with proportional representation and the imperative mandate that the power of the people may be justly and effectually exercised in government.

"We recognize the fact that there are many great and important reforms needed, and that none of these can be accomplished until we acknowledge Christ, unite in his name, and the right to rule has been restored to the people. Not a union of church and state, but a union of all Christian votes at the ballot box.

"We therefore present this system of government to the people, in the name of Christ, not as a substitute for other reforms, but as the only method by which further reforms can be accomplished.

"Therefore we, as a Christian party of reformers seeking the welfare of all the people, pledge our entire energies to the work of securing a system which will make reform possible.

"We believe that it will be impossible to secure direct legislation without a union of all Christians and all reformers and reform parties; we therefore ask all of His followers, regardless of nationality, creed or color, sex or previous politics, to join hands with us at the ballot box in making this a government which shall be in fact a government from God through Christ by and for the people.

"Resolved, That we, a body of Christian men and women assembled in the name of Christ, for the purpose of considering ways and means to unite the Christian voters at least one day in a year at the ballot box, and believing that Jesus Christ is the rightful ruler, and his name entitled to all the honor and glory; that there is no need of more than two parties—namely, the Christian party and the devil's party,—do hereby resolve that we will not cast our ballots in any other name than in the name of Christ, and that we will aim and endeavor to be guided by God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

"We believe in direct legislation of the people, and in order to make our Government a government from God through Christ, by and for the people, we will be governed in all things, lawmaking included, by this standard, 'What Would Jesus Do?'

"W. R. BENKERT, Chairman of Committee on Resolutions, Davenport Iowa.

"J. F. R. LEONARD, State Chairman, Ainsworth, Iowa.

"CHAS. W. MYERS, Secretary, Packwood, Iowa."

"What would Jesus do?"—that is indeed a pertinent inquiry in connection with such work as is proposed by this and similar organizations calling themselves Christian. But are they serious in asking it? Do they really believe he would adopt any of the methods of reform which they propose?

What would Jesus do? That can be best answered through the query, What did Jesus Do? Jesus is the same to-day that he was when he lived under the rule of the Cæsars. Would he vote? He never did vote. Would he be the candidate of a political party? He pointedly refused that very thing in Judea. See John 6:15. Would he be a party to any plan to coerce people into obedience to his will? He could have coerced the Jews, but he never did.

Jesus refused to be made a civil ruler. What then can be the result of this scheme to make him ruler to-day by "Christian" ballots? The vote will not make Jesus the ruler, for he will not serve; he is of the same mind to-day that he always was. But the "Christian" vote will make some one ruler; that is certain. And it is certain that it will not be Christ, or any representative of him. That vote will not set up the kingdom of Christ, for the reason already stated, and which must be constantly kept in mind, that Christ refused to let the people make him a king. What kingdom then would be set up by these "Christian" ballots and who would be its ruler?

As appears from this declaration of principles, it is designed by this movement to divide the political world into two great parties, "the Lord's party" and the "devil's party." All who shall have the temerity to oppose this great combine of "Christian" voters will of course belong to the "devil's party." And from this may be anticipated the coming social and political standing of all such as are resolved to conform in belief and practice to Jesus' declaration before the Roman governor of Judea,—"My kingdom is not of this world."
