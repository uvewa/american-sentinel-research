The fast-day proclamation of Governor Rollins, of New Hampshire, has awakened comment and discussion in many quarters, and it appears that not all of those in "the rural communities" alluded to in the proclamation, view with approval the assumption of an ecclesiastical role by the State's chief civil executive. The query is raised as to what proper place religious opinions and exhortations can have in a State document, in a land where church and state are not united. One individual of this class is the Hon. Thomas P. Cheney, of Ashland, an expansion agent, who has taken pains to publish a reply to the governor's proclamation, in which he says:—

"The idea of the governor of a State, 'clothed in a little brief authority,' in a State paper discussing such theological and sectarian questions as 'the efficacy of prayer,' 'evidence of the fundamental truth of Christianity,' 'the problem of the condition of religion in the rural communities,' 'unchristened children,' 'marriages solemnized by justices of the peace,' and 'burial without the benison in the name of Christ.'

"Have we ever seen in these modern days a more puerile and unmannerly piece of officious impertinence and usurpation? I think this belief has been quite general in the poor deluded 'rural communities.' We 'miserable sinners' in the rural communities had supposed that the provisions of Article 4 of the Constitution, which reads, 'Every person has the natural and inalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience and reason,' meant what it said, and that meant that if a person did not believe in 'the efficacy of prayer,' he should not be forced to pray, nor publicly advertised, criticised, and anathematized by the governor if he did not pray.

"We unworthy, semi-civilized people in the backwoods of 'rural communities' have been green enough to suppose that we had a right either to join no church at all, or to be members of a church, or religious sect or denomination, which does not require or even permit infant baptism, or the christening of children, and still, for this heresy we are belabored and denounced by public proclamation, in this age of the world by a supreme civil magistrate.

"As to our 'marriages by justices of the peace' in New Hampshire unenlightened rural communities, I merely remark that such marriages are legitimate and legal under the laws of New Hampshire. If there has ever been in the dreadful 'rural communities' of New Hampshire a 'burial without the benison in the name of Christ,' possibly it was because the friends of the dead were too poor to pay the minister, or perhaps it was a case of small-pox."

Leave religion, as General Grant said, to the church, the home, and the denominational school. These agencies are ample to provide for the religious interests of any community; and if they were not, the matter could not be helped by an intrusion of the civil authority. The civil power never helped religion, but always hindered it, by intruding into its sphere. The civil authority can furnish the true religion with nothing for which the latter has any possible use.
