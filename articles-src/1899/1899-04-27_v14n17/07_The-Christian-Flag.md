A CHRISTIAN flag has been originated and brought before the public, which is designed to be the common standard of Christians the world over. It is now used at Chautauqua, at campmeetings, conventions, and has been adopted by a large number of churches throughout the country. Its object is said to be that every sect and every nation when on the Lord's business shall carry his colors, and an effort is being made to have it recognized by the Government in connection with religious services in the army and navy.

The Christian Flag Extension Society has been organized for the purpose of securing its adoption by the Government and to introduce it throughout the country. The flag itself is a beautiful one, consisting of a field of white, with a blue square in one corner in which is a red cross.

In the gospel provision for the Christian warfare no mention is made of a Christian flag. It was never used by Christ or the apostles. The flag is always used to represent force. Every nation has its flag, and that flag represents the power of the nation. Thus the Stars and Stripes represents the power of the United States. God is love; his kingdom is one of love. A flag does not properly represent love. This must be done by works which are the result of love. The Christian warfare is not carnal, but spiritual. The Lord says, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts."

A Christian flag recognized by the Government might easily be made to represent a distinctive form of Christianity, or some institution or doctrine in which the majority of Christians were agreed; therefore to speak against or oppose any such institutions or doctrines would be to speak against the flag, which would be regarded as a treasonable offense. As a flag is the proper emblem of force, a Christian flag recognized by the Government would naturally represent the power of the Government behind whatever the Christian flag was made to represent; and in view of the great efforts that are now being made to have a distinctive form of Christianity recognized by the Government, there is not much doubt but it would, if adopted, be used for that purpose.

Let not the attention of the world be called to Christianity by means of a flag, but rather by the power of the gospel.
