A gentleman who has recently visited Rome writes as follows in the Christian World:

"Rome would, if she had the power, still force her creeds by fire and faggot. I was talking one day while in Rome with a prelate of the church on the question of heresy. 'As a matter of fact,' I said to him, 'I could not believe many of your doctrines.' They are to me simply unbelievable.' 'Ah, well,' he replied, 'we distinguish in cases of heresy.' 'In what way?' I asked. 'Well,' he said, 'there are two kinds of heresy—there is passive heresy and active heresy. Passive heresy is simply to doubt, but active heresy is to propagate the doubt. In the former case the church is very merciful.' 'But,' I asked, 'suppose you as a church had supreme power to-day as you once had, and suppose I felt it my duty to openly oppose certain articles of your faith. What would the church do?' 'It would stop at nothing to stamp out the heresy,' was his reply.

There is nothing to be surprised at in this, but there is danger that men will regard Rome as having a monopoly of the persecuting spirit. Persecution began with Cain. It was seen in Ishmael, and it will appear in every one who is not born of the Spirit. As then, "he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now." People may think that they will never persecute, but they certainly will unless they be born of the Spirit. Those who do not gather with Christ scatter abroad, and this is persecution. There is no such thing as "passive heresy" against the false doctrines of Rome.

The proclamation of the United States Government to the Filipinos (and will some one rise and explain why we spell the island with a "Ph" and the islanders with an "F?") is decidedly unsatisfactory. The administration so far has carried the great mass of the American people successfully with it; but a few more screeds like this and the anti expansionist ranks will be filled with converts. The pronunciamento is unfortunate in the wording of its first article, which smacks of conquest. The thing to impress upon those islanders is not that we are determined to subdue them and that "those who resist can accomplish no end other than their ruin," but rather that we are determined to maintain order and peace, by force, if necessary, and thereafter to give them such government as shall secure to them the same liberties and rights we ourselves enjoy. The public opinion of the country should so emphatically disapprove of this ill-sounding utterance that the administration may not be tempted to repeat the mistake.—Rev. Frank Crane, Pastor Trinity Church, Chicago.
