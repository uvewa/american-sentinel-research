Emma D. Dunham, in "The Ram's Horn."

She tripped along a wooded path,
A maiden, young and gay;
Quite free from any self-reproach,
She hummed a roundelay.

A little boy comes running by,
With heart that's just as light,
A bird's nest held within his hand,
With eggs of purest white.

"You cruel, naughty boy!" she cried,
And caught him by the sleeve;
"How could you pain the mother bird?
"How could you make her grieve?"

"Now, Miss, to tell the honest truth,
I do not cause her pain.
The nest the mother bird has left;
She will not come again."

"How do you know, you wicked boy,
Why do you tell me that?"
"Because—because—," the lad replied,
"You've got her on your hat!"
