IT is asserted by persons claiming to be familiar with the facts underlying the situation in Samoa, that the contest between the rival native rulers represents a contest between Catholics and Protestants for the supremacy; Mataafa being a Catholic, and Malietoa, whom the American and English forces favor, being a convert of the London Missionary Society.
