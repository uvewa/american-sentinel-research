A MILWAUKEE (Wis.) court has decided that "a note given on Sunday for a church donation is valid, although a note given on that holy day for any other purpose would be void." This ought to be satisfactory to the advocates of a religious state; though it is another illustration of the fact that in acting for the benefit of religion the state never pays much attention to logic.
