We have repeatedly called attention to the recent determination of the Russian government to Russianize the inhabitants of Finland, and of their efforts and protests against the tyrannical measures to deprive them of their rights and liberties. While among the most loyal of the Czar's subjects, they have from time immemorial been free to conduct their own local government. But all this is now prohibited by an imperial manifesto. The Finns in America have protested against this despotic movement, and the following letter and appeal from a Finnish lady will convey some idea of the feeling that prevails in Finland in regard to it:—

"Terrible things have happened to poor Finland. We are crushed as a free nation—our Constitution is crushed and annihilated. The Czar . . . had sworn to keep our laws undefiled, and yet he has broken his Imperial word. We cannot utter a single word in our defense; newspapers are, by utterly severe "censure," condemned to silence—not a groan of despair may rise from our ranks. The Imperial Manifesto, making an end of our most precious national treasure, could not be published in due order by our official papers on account of the printers' refusal to print that which is our death doom. Russian printers, knowing a little Finnish and Swedish, had to do it! The people are mourning as only our nation is capable of doing—deeply, silently, utterly hopeless as our state is!

"And why has this been done to us, who always have been the Czar's most loyal and obedient subjects? Just now, when Europe is invited to participate in the Peace Congress in St. Petersburg, and Mr. —— is arranging his 'Peace Crusade' to glorify the author! How we wish that Britain, always ready to help the oppressed, would speak in our defense! Mighty England could help us, not with army or navy, but with its moral support, and by its influence upon the public mind. The eyes of Britons ought to be opened to see what the Czar means in his renowned manifesto of peace, by the free development of minor nations! We should like you to see the gulf between theory and practice, now made manifest in Finland. Do what you can, speak to every one about our national misfortune. Do help us! Statesmen, clergy, all ought to know what a wrong has been committed in silence against a peaceful nation, which has lived its happy, lawful (law abiding) life under the scepter of the Czar, and now is doomed to perish! . . . All Finnish ladies are wearing black now."

Some years ago the Evangelical Alliance interposed its influence with the Czar against the persecution of the Stundists in that country; and we respectfully submit that this persecution of the Finns furnishes a similar occasion for its interposition. It is true that the persecution of the Stundists was a religious persecution; but as the Finns are Lutherans, the movement to deprive them of their rights of education and worship is also really a religious persecution, and comes within the sphere of the Alliance for its action in behalf of religious freedom.

We therefore respectfully submit the case of the Finns as a proper one for the interposition of the Alliance.
