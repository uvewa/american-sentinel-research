MARCH 20, the birthday of Neal Dow, the eminent temperance advocate, is proposed in W. C. T. U. circles as a day for collecting a freewill offering to be used in furthering the work of Dr. Crafts, of the "reform bureau," at Washington. With the money to be raised in this and other ways, it is proposed to "sow the whole country knee deep with literature of reform work." Reader, don't forget that whether you are doing anything to spread religious liberty literature or not, the other side are at work, and will keep at work till they have sowed the country "knee deep." Now, now, is the sowing time.
