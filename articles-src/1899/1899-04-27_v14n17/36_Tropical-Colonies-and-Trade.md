TROPICAL countries are not valuable acquisitions from the standpoint of trade interests. Recently, before the Academy of Political Science it was shown that Great Britain exports $15.34 per capita to her non-tropical colonies, and only .56 per capita to her tropical colonies. The Treasury Bureau of Statistics has shown that "if we had all the trade of these dependencies, they in requital having, of course, free access to our markets, the balance against us would be over $100,000,000 a year."
