THE projected peace conference is already sailing through troubled waters. There is, it is said, a "complete change in the attitude of the Dutch people" toward the delegates, who in consequence "will assemble in a hostile instead of a friendly atmosphere." The reason of this change is, first, the czar's oppression of Finland, with which the Dutch nation has a strong affinity; and second, the exclusion, at England's demand, of the Transvaal and Orange Free State from participation in the congress. "The confidence of the Dutch people in the good faith of the whole affair," it is stated, "has disappeared." It is safe to say that other nations are not more credulous. But from all this some valuable lessons may be learned by thinking people.
