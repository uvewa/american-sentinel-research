Life in its relations to others is very much what we choose to make of it. If we choose to seek offense in their acts, we shall find plenty. Isaac could have got up a quarrel with Abimelech and the Gerarites which would have embittered his own life and passed down as a vendetta to his posterity. But he knew that "it takes two to make a quarrel," and he resolved not to be one of the two. Once and again he yields the point, and fairly wears them out by his courtesy. And with what result? Did they ever think him a poltroon, whom they could trample over? At the last they come meekly and ask to enter into covenant with him, declaring they never meant him a bit of harm, or did it either. He was manifestly the conqueror through his patience and his courtesy, in which they began to see something divine, and they hurried to make terms with him. His quietness under wrong-doing was too much for their blustering quarrelsomeness, as it always will be if a man has the heroism for it. The greatest of conquests was that by the one who gave his cheek to the smiter.
