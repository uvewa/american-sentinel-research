"SUFFERING hath this ministry—it is a safeguard. Constant prosperity enervates," writes Rev. Newell Dwight Hillis, D. D., in his "Secrets of a Happy Life," series of articles, in the June Ladies' Home Journal. "Iron is powdered by unceasing electricity, but recovers itself when the current intermits. Steady sunshine ruins the tropic races, and luxury often barbarizes men. The great civilizations lie along the snow belt. Men grow great only where winter stimulates to the best possible use of summer. Frost puts tang and crispness into the winesap and jonathan, and frost also spices the people's thinking. Wealthy parents are often put to their wits' end to invent some device to do for their children what poverty and adversity did for them. If man needed only one throb of pain in each organ to teach him the law of health for that member, he would master every principle of sound living within the period of childhood. Then all his days would be days of happiness."
