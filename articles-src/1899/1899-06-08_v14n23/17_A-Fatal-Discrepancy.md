A Fatal Discrepancy.—The very name "Roman Catholic" is a contradiction in terms. Rome is a city in Italy with a glorious though bloody history; it is not a city through which the life of to-day pulses; it belongs more to the past than to the present time; but at any rate, it is one particular spot on earth. "Catholic" means that which appertains to the whole world, to the entire earth wherever it is inhabited. Thus "Roman Catholic" is a "particular universal;" and it is obvious that a church which in Roman cannot be catholic, and one that is catholic cannot be exclusively Roman.
