The Catholic Mirror says that the reason why religion is on the decline in the "rural communities" of New Hampshire, as asserted in Governor Rollins' fast-day proclamation, is that Protestantism in the State is in a "deplorable condition"; and adds that there are 100,000 Catholic residents in New Hampshire, and that Catholicism there is flourishing. This confirms the opinion expressed on the point by the SENTINEL some weeks ago.
