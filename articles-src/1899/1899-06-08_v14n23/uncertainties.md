## Article 30: "Some Letters from the Philippines"

- **Location:** Body text, paragraph introducing Professor Hall's added judgments
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "Professor Hall" but earlier in the same article the name is given as "Prof. W. G. Hale." This appears to be an OCR error or a variant in the original text. The paragraph reads: "To these extracts Professor Hall adds the following judgments..."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Professor Hall" (as it appears in the OCR source)
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely "Professor Hale" in the original; the OCR may have misread "Hale" as "Hall"
- **Reason:** The name "W. G. Hale" is clearly stated at the beginning of the article; "Hall" in a subsequent reference is likely an OCR error. Preserved as-is pending verification against original scan.

## Article 33: "The Rainbow of Universal Peace Note"

- **Location:** Editorial note, page 16
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "New York *San*" — this appears to be an OCR misread of "New York *Sun*" (the New York Sun newspaper, which is the source cited for article 18).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "New York *San*" (preserving the OCR text as given)
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "New York *Sun*" in the original; "San" is a common OCR misread of "Sun"
- **Reason:** The article reprinted in this issue (article 18) is attributed to the "New York Sun." The editorial note on page 16 references the same article, so "San" is almost certainly "Sun" in the original.
