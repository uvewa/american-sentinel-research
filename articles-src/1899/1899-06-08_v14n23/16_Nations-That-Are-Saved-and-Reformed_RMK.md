RETURNING to the prophecy of Isaiah, referred to in our last article, we find some additional expressions which would appear to teach that in the last days there would be an absence of evil influences, and a preponderance of all that is good. Another prophet (Joel 3:9–14), speaking also of the same time, presents a view so contrary to that by Isaiah and Micah, we beg the indulgence of the reader, while we place before him both of these prophecies:

### ISAIAH.

"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountain, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord." Chap. 2:2–5.

It will not be questioned that these prophets are speaking of events which are to take place at the end of this world. The "last days" spoken of by Isaiah and Micah, and the "harvest" time, when the "day of the Lord is near," referred to by Joel, must be one and the same time. Matt. 13:39. But the difficulty lies in the fulfillment of their opposing statements. One says, "Nation shall not lift up sword against naion, neither shall they learn [the art of] war any more"; the other commands, "Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up [to war]." One says, "They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks." The other commands, "Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears." One says, "Come ye, and let us go up to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths." The other declares that their "wickedness is great." "Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision." Chap. 3:9–14.

### JOEL.

"Proclaim ye this among the gentiles: Prepare war, wake up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near; let them come up; beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong. Assemble yourselves and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about, thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord. Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there I will sit to judge all the heathen round about. Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision." Chap. 3:9–14.

Now, the reader will say, These are palpable contradictions, and they both cannot be realized. Yes; they are contradictory, and let us look for their fulfillment. The harmony is found in the fact that two parties of opposite opinions are making these utterances. In Isaiah and Micah we have what the Lord declares that "many people" and "many nations" shall "say" in the "last days," and that in Isaiah 2:3 and Micah 4, verse 2, and which follows, is the language of the "people." While that in Joel is what the Lord has said, verses 8 and 12. The "many people"—the "multitudes" are found to be in conflict with the Lord. They do not harmonize with him, and this is not surprising at such a time of confusion as that will be. The multitudes and nations never have agreed with the Lord, and but "few" of the people will walk in the strait and narrow way; but "wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat." Matt. 7:13, 14. The people are wrong, but the Lord is always right.

Now, what is being done, and what are the people saying? Already a world's congress of religions has been called; evangelical alliances are formed; millions of people petitioning Congress to enact and enforce Christian laws upon all the people, and associations, leagues and societies are organized, and determined that these measures shall be carried out; and now a world's peace congress is just before us, with the object of disarming the nations—laying down their implements of war, taking up the implements of husbandry, and are saying, Let us learn war no more. But what are they doing? With the cry of "peace, peace," comes the command from all the great powers of earth, "Prepare war, wake up the mighty men." In obedience to which the arming of the nations proceeds. Battle ships of every description multiply; cannon of still greater volume and power are manufactured and placed in position; later patents of more effective musketry are put into the hands of increased armies, and new devices and explosives for the destruction of life and property are constantly coming to the front and put to execution. New territory is being acquired, and the thirst for expansion and still greater power is only satisfied when the "foot-holds" held by the weaker nations are occupied by the greater and stronger powers. The earth is filled with violence, crime of every description is increasing,—their "wickedness is great,"—millionaires are made in a day, trusts and syndicates multiply, to whom the Lord says, "Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days" (James 5:3) while the cry for bread, and "wages kept back by fraud" is heard on every hand. Against this untold wealth, combined labor is arranged, anarchy rises and asserts itself, and instead of peace we behold trouble—"men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth." Luke 21:26.

Now, dear reader, what next? Need we look for and expect a change for the better? No, indeed; for "evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived; yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." 2 Tim. 3:12, 13. What hope, then, have we for a reform? National reform is but an experiment. The reality is a thing as yet unseen. The element of reform is not in the nations; they are composed of men, and "it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps." In his "flesh dwelleth no good thing." "There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God; they are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one." Rom. 3:10–12.

Then they are lost, and need to be saved. Here, again, the nations are powerless. They have studied methods of destruction rather than the plan of salvation. They can destroy, but they cannot save either themselves or each other. So the prophet concludes, "Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel." Jer. 3:23. "So all Israel shall be saved," "by grace through faith." These are the children of faithful Abraham, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ; saved out of "every nation, kindred, and tongue, and people." To these the gates of the city above will open, "that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in." Isaiah 26:12. "And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the [new] earth do bring their glory and honor into it; and the gates of it shall not be shut at all: for there shall be no night there; and they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it." Rev. 21:24–26.
