Roman Catholics of Austria are making strenuous efforts to combat the movement of secession from the church of Rome, by the power of the civil government. In Austria church and state are united, and the action of the church in this matter simply shows the purpose for which such a union is desired by the church. It is only to help the church maintain supremacy in spiritual affairs.

The Literary Digest says that the secession movement "is assuming daily more important dimensions," and the authorities "are beginning to busy themselves with it. A number of Protestant ministers have been indicted for unlawful proselyting. Protestant divines who are not very careful in their utterances are punished for 'attacking a lawfully established religious organization,' i. e., the Roman Catholic Church."

The Vienna Tageblatt, however, counsels the authorities to proceed with moderation. It says:—

"Many parents are grieved because their sons, students who are not yet of age, have joined the movement and leave the Roman Catholic Church for Protestantism. The government is asked to interfere by altering the constitution. Article 4 says that 'every Austrian above the age of fourteen, without distinction of sex, is free to choose his or her religious faith, and the authorities must protect them in the exercise of this freedom.' To abolish this rule would be a serious infringement of our liberties, and likely to do more harm than good. Enough is done to prevent the Protestants from obtaining influence by unfair means, as in some cases the courts endeavor to discover whether the convert 'was left perfectly free to choose the religious community he wished to join,' that is to say, whether his conversion was not obtained by threats or misrepresentation."

The church-and-state party in Austria want the constitution altered there in the interests of religion, and the church-and-state party in the United States want the Constitution here altered for the same reason. In both countries, according to their view, the Constitution allows too much freedom. But if the constitution of Austria is altered to suit the demands of the church there, it will be in the interests of the Catholic religion. And if the like thing is done here, will not a like evil be the result?

Protestants in Austria want the constitution to remain as it is; and why should not American Protestants have the like wish for the Constitution of the United States?
