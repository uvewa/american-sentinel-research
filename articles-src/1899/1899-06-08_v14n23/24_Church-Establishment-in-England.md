The ritualistic controversy in the English Church seems to be doing much to open the eyes of English people to the evil of "church establishment," which is only another name for church and state union. The fair-minded clergy of all parties, it is said, are coming into harmony in the view that religious questions must not be settled by a political body. Under the establishment, parliament has the authority to settle such questions for the church, and to take that authority away from parliament means disestablishment. Establishment means the surrender of church freedom in exchange for political support—a bargain, which means only incalculable loss to both the church and the state. "Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." 2 Cor. 3:17. No church which is moved by the Spirit of God can be bound by the power of the state.
