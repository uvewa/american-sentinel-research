THE Methodist denomination has undertaken the work of "reclaiming" the Fourth of July, and to this end will have its congregations and Sunday schools celebrate this year and henceforward a "Christian" Fourth of July, on which the special effort will be not to see how much whiskey can be drunk in order to properly celebrate the day, but how the cause of temperance can be promoted, to the end that if possible the nation may be saved from the drink curse. While the day itself cannot be made Christian by any act of man, it is certain that all Christians and every foe of strong drink can well occupy themselves on the Fourth in working for temperance reform, and we hope much good to the temperance cause may result from the undertaking.
