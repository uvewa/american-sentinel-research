THE Rev. Minot J. Savage, well known as a clergyman and lecturer, has announced his conversion to Spiritualism, and says he believes the "spirits" can be photographed by the camera. This, with the recent conversion of Mrs. Mary Lease, the woman lecturer, indicate that Spiritualism is making progress to-day. But more effective than all the work it does openly in its own name, is the work it is doing among the people under an assumed name; for it is no doubt true that some of the "sciences" which command such a wide following in the religious world to-day, embody the real essence of Spiritualism in their teaching.
