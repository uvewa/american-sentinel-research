Some remarkable testimony was recently given by Attorney-general Monnett, of Ohio, before a commission appointed to examine into the business methods of the Standard Oil Trust in that State. This is the attorney-general who was, he declares, lately offered $500,000 by this Trust if he would refuse to prosecute it.

"He described in detail the methods by which the Trusts choked off competition, by buying up competitors, the employment of agents known as 'buzzards,' to get competitors' prices and undersell them out of the business, and the conspiracies with the railroad corporations to make grossly discriminating rates or to delay delivery of a competitor's product."

"He declared that if the principles of the Trust were extended to all the public industries the Government itself would be controlled by such a universal combination."

Concerning an alleged influence of the Standard Oil Trust over the Ohio press, the attorney-general said:—

"Yes, it is in testimony that there was an agreement between Col. Squires, of the Trust, and a news agency, in the interest of the Trust, by which certain newspapers agreed to publish 'if acceptable,' matter defending the Trust. I presume it was acceptable, as it was published. The newspapers received, it was stated, eight cents a line, and some of them were paid four cents a copy for the number sold."

"Mr. Monnett said that the Trust also managed to secure from the agents of the railroads the business secrets of the competing companies."

Such is the character of the business methods of the modern Trust, according to the attorney-general of Ohio, who may reasonably be presumed to have full knowledge of the facts to which his testimony relates. The Trust represents commercial despotism, and civil liberty and commercial despotism cannot flourish together.
