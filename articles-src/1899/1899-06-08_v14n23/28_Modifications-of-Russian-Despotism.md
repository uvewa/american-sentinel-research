Widespread interest has been aroused by the announcement from across the water that the czar, in addition to his undertaking in behalf of international peace and disarmament, has determined upon the abolition of the horrors of the Siberian exile system. Possibly it had occurred to the czar that the sincerity of his appeal in behalf of peace might be seriously questioned, while the system of Siberian exile was maintained under his authority. This, however, is not the motive assigned in the matter.

The following comments on the subject are made by the New York Journal:—

"The czar has just given another proof of wishing to be a progressive despot. The first prominent proof was his taking the initiative in the Peace Conference that is now sitting at The Hague; the second is found in the news, just received, that he has presided at a meeting of a council called to consider transportation to Siberia and work in the Siberian mines as a punishment for crime, and to devise a substitute therefor.

"To be sure, the motive assigned is that the use of Siberia as a penal colony seriously interferes with the development of that province; nevertheless, the humanitarian and philanthropic sentiments of the young czar should be given due weight.

"If during the last one hundred years any one wanted a picture of an earthly hell, all he had to do was to point to Siberia. That was not merely on account of the work in the mines by convicts, in a region erroneously supposed to be an Arctic waste, but because many of the victims were political prisoners, condemned, not by the courts, but simply by administrative decrees, and mainly because of the hardships on the long route, walking, as the prisoners had to do, chained to each other. The writings of the American, George Kennan, ten years ago, roused the world to protest.

"And yet the British penal colony at Botany Bay was, and the present French colony at New Caledonia is, fully as horrible.

"Some years ago a large pamphlet in the French language was sent to all civilized governments by the chief of the Russian prisons. Our Labor Department in Washington also received a copy. The document, perhaps, was intended as an answer to the charges of Kennan. At all events it sought to prove that the Siberian prison system had been entirely changed since 1890, and that millions of rubles had been expended for that purpose.

"It asserted first that all work in Siberian mines had practically been abolished, and that all Russian penitentiary convicts were henceforth to be sent, with their families, to the island of Saghalin, on the east coast of Siberia, and after their sentence expired they were to remain there as free colonists. In other words, the island of Saghalin would in the future be the sole penitentiary in all Russia. Next it affirmed that all walking in chains by prisoners to Siberia was abolished; that from that time onward the prisoners would be transferred by ship from Odessa through the Indian Ocean to Saghalin.

"How much of that was really true we do not know. If true, it was clearly a vast improvement on what Kennan said he saw. The pamphlet did not say that there were no convicts in the Siberian mines, but maintained that there were but a few thousands, and these the most hardened criminals.

"Nevertheless it will be a great advance at the dawn of the twentieth century if, owing to the czar, Siberia ceases entirely to be a penal colony."
