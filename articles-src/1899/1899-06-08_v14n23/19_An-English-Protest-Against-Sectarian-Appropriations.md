It seems that Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour are not making easy progress in their scheme to establish a Roman Catholic university for Ireland. This is as, some weeks ago, we predicted it would be. The Presbyterians, through their Committee of the General Assembly in Ireland on the Higher Education, to whom a similar university in Belfast was offered as a sop, have unanimously rejected the proposal, and remain true to their principles of nonsectarian education.

It has also been shown that the alleged grievance of Catholics is not a genuine one, and that they already have in the Queen's colleges in Cork and Galway, whose presidents and professors are Catholics, in the Royal Irish University and in Trinity College, Dublin, adequate and equal facilities with Protestants of obtaining for their sons the higher education, with full protection to their creed.

Protestants object to being taxed for the maintenance of a university for the benefit of "an ecclesiastical and a political organization that no bribe less than the crown and scepter of England would satisfy." No objection is made to the Catholics having a university all their own, provided they will furnish the funds for its establishment and maintenance. To the American mind this position is the just and proper one to hold.
