> ANOTHER case of arrest for not keeping Sunday is reported from Georgia. In a letter dated at Rome, Ga., May 25, to the SENTINEL, the writer, Mr. J. T. Eaton, says:—

> "I was arrested yesterday, tried before a justice of the peace, and bound over to court to appear the 17th of July, to answer to the charge of doing ordinary work on the Sabbath day. It is a case of religious persecution pure and simple."

> SINCE receiving the foregoing Mr. Eaton has sent us the following letter:—

> "Rome, Ga., May 31, 1899.

> "EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: I came here from Indiana last August to canvass for denominational publications. I have resided where I now live since the 21st of last October.

> "I have a garden patch, which I rented, that we might produce our own vegetables. I have a wife and three children.

"Until spring opened up I did not have much work to do at home, so did but very little on Sunday; but during the last two months I have had plenty of work, and I did not feel that I could afford to lose one sixth of my time; and more, I could not conscientiously observe Sunday and act the hypocrite, professing by my actions to keep a day that I did not believe in. So I went quietly to work on Sunday, never doing anything that could possibly be considered offensive.

"Two of my neighbors talked with me on the question, urging that I should keep Sunday because the laws of the State required it. One, who is a witness against me, said while talking to me, that he did not know but what I was right, but we must keep the laws of the State.

"A warrant was sworn out by one of my neighbors, the charge stating that 'The said J. T. Eaton did on the 14th day of May commit the offense of pursuing his ordinary business on the Sabbath day.'

"The warrant was issued the 24th day of May, and I was arrested the same date and taken before the justice of the peace about 3 o'clock, P. M. He asked me to stand trial at 6 P. M. the same evening, but I replied that I was not ready for trial; so the justice set the case for 6 o'clock, P. M., the following day, and asked me to give bond. He suggested I get one of my brethren to go on my bond; so the bailiff started down town with me in a buggy to hunt up the brother to sign the bond. On our way down town the bailiff suddenly stopped and jumped out of his buggy, asking me to hold his horse while he went and made an arrest. He soon came back with a man under arrest and asked me to get out of the buggy and stay around until he took the fellow to jail. He said he was not afraid of my going away.

"He then told me to take my bond and go by myself and hunt up the brother to go on the bond and come back to the justice's office. I had to go nearly a mile to find the brother where he was at work.

"My trial came off the next day. The witnesses swore that on the Sabbath, May the 14th, they saw me hoeing in my corn patch. When questioned on the witness stand they said that I was a peaceful citizen, etc., and that neither their rest nor that of their families was disturbed; also that they would not have known that I was at work if they had not seen me.

"When asked why they issued the warrant, the prosecuting witness said he thought it was his duty to enforce the law.

"I was bound over to appear before the Superior Court of Floyd County the 17th day of July. Many of the people here are standing for me and religious liberty, but the Sunday law is being agitated, and nearly every business is stopped in the city on Sunday."

Mr. Eaton adds that he is willing, if need be, to go to the chain-gang "for His sake," and that of the truth to which he holds.

A RECENT Christian Endeavor convention was held on the island of Jamaica, in a court-house, where seventy-five years ago a number of Baptist ministers were tried and found guilty of preaching to slaves without license.
