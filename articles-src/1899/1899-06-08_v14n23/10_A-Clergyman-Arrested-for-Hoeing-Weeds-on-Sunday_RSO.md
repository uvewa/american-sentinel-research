*Hatley, Miss., May 28, 1899.*

**EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:** I am forty-eight years of age, am the youngest son of a numerous family. The history of my ancestors extends back through many generations, one line of which reaches to the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, who, fleeing from religious persecution, landed on the bleak shores of New England in 1620. Yesterday, for the first time in my life and for the first time in the history of my family, so far as my knowledge extends, was one arrested and led away under the escort of an officer charged with a misdemeanor. I have met in our family reunions where our ancestral history has been talked over, and it has been a source of many congratulations that we could present so clean a record as law-abiding citizens. But to-day I stand before the world under bonds as a criminal awaiting trial.

On the nineteenth day of July next, I am to appear before the court at Amory, Mississippi, to answer for my conduct on the fourteenth day of May. And what is the crime for which I am to suffer this reproach and perhaps to suffer further indignities after the case is tried? You may ask if I have been engaged in some evil plots against the rights of my fellowmen? I can answer with a clear conscience before God in the language of the Apostle Paul, "We have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man." If I had, I should have no complaint to offer if I should suffer the extreme penalty of the law. The act with which I am charged and for which I suffer these indignities, is that on that fourteenth day of May, after having rested the day before, which was the Sabbath, I took a few moments' exercise in my own garden in the early morning hour, using a hoe with which to extricate a few obnoxious weeds from among some choice plants, the seeds of which had been presented to me by an esteemed friend. After this refreshing exercise I went back into my house, wrote some letters, then attended services in the Baptist church, and preached in my own church at night. I am a minister of the Seventh-day Adventist church and believe and teach that the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath; that the Sabbath never was changed from the seventh to the first day of the week by divine authority.

A little over a year ago I organized the first Seventh-day Adventist church in this State, here at Hatley, with eleven members. Since then our membership has increased to twenty-nine. Some have not been well pleased to witness the interest taken in the truths which we teach, and not having scriptures with which to oppose them, have sought to stir up a spirit of persecution against us. We had thought, however, that so long as we conducted ourselves as good citizens we were accountable alone to God for our religious faith, and that Seventh-day Adventists had the same right to the exercise of their religious freedom that is enjoyed by other denominations of Christians. I had read the following Article of the Bill of Rights of the State constitution of Mississippi:—

"Sec. 23. No religious test as a qualification for office shall ever be required and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious sect or mode of worship; but the free enjoyment of all religious sentiments and different modes of worship shall ever be held sacred. Provided, the rights hereby secured shall not be construed to justify acts of licentiousness injurious to morals or dangerous to the peace and safety of the State."

I find no other clause in this constitution making Seventh-day Adventists an exemption to those who may enjoy these rights. Neither can I conceive how the extricating a few obnoxious weeds from my own garden can be construed to be an "act of licentiousness" or "injurious to morals or dangerous to the peace and safety of the State." If I could be convinced of this I would humbly acknowledge my fault, pay whatever fines were imposed on me, and never pull any more weeds.

But I am charged with having broken the Sabbath; this is the charge in the bond, while in the indictment it is for working on Sunday, the first day of the week. But what is Sabbath observance but a religious observance? It is most emphatically so. God's Word declares the Sabbath to be a sign between him and his people; that he gave it to them for that purpose, and that it would be a sign between him and them forever. See Ex. 31:13–17. Also that by keeping the Sabbath they are to know the Lord. Eze. 20:12,20. The Apostle Paul also agrees with this when he says in Rom. 14:6: "He that regardeth the day regardeth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it." Here then is a religious service, and in respect to such the constitution of our State declares that "no preference shall be given to any sect" and their "free enjoyment shall ever be held sacred."

Under this guarantee in the fundamental law of the State we have felt that we had not only the God-given right but the constitutional right to work six days and and to rest the seventh day as God has commanded in his eternal and unchangeable law. For my loyalty to God and for the exercise of this right I have been deprived of my liberty and brought before the authorities as though I were guilty of crime.

The circumstances indicate very clearly that these who are taking a hand in this prosecution are acting purely from a religious prejudice. Work of various kinds is being carried on almost every Sunday in almost every community more than that with which I am charged, but no attention is paid to it. I am told that hundreds go to the river to fish on Sunday and the explosion of dynamite on that day to kill the fish can be heard miles from the river. On my way home from court I was told by a man of good standing in the community that he had run seven plows at a time on his farm on Sunday and was never molested for it. Chopping wood on Sunday is so common that it causes not the slightest comment and yet the only arrests made for Sunday work in this State for years that I have heard of is that of my seventh-day brother Robert Nash for cutting some sprouts from stumps in a field, and of myself for taking exercise with my hoe in my garden. The officer who arrested me stated at my dinner table on the day of my arrest that he could go out and work on Sunday and no attention would be paid to it; but if any of us would do the same thing we would be arrested for it. It is only prejudice. I feel clear before God in my faith and in my practice and now if it is his will that I should suffer for it I hope to bear it patiently. I have realized the presence of my Saviour in this experience thus far and his promise is, "My presence shall go with thee." Where he may lead I do not fear to follow.

As we were going to court the officer said to me, "I have great sympathy for you people and you may be right, but you have a hard thing to buck against the whole State of Mississippi." "We are not bucking against the State of Mississippi," I replied. "We are the servants of God; he has given us commandments which we are bound to obey and he has promised to be with us. Those who molest us in this are 'bucking,' against God." God is my shield and in him will I trust.
