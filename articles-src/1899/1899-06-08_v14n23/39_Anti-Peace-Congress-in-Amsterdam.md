HOLLAND has not only a Peace Congress sitting within its borders, but an Anti-peace Congress, the latter being in session at Amsterdam. The object of the Anti-peace Congress is to protest against the czar's peace movement, which is denounced by the Amsterdam congress as being the most flagrant diplomatic hypocrisy of the nineteenth century. The delegates to the Anti-peace Congress include persons of note, among them being a German university professor, a Dutch author, and the brother of the late President Faure of France.
