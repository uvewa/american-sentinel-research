**THE** State must not be allowed to profess religion; it is not right that it should do so. If it does, it will want to join the church; and who will say that it should not if it can rightfully profess religion? But when it joins the church, there is a union of church and state, which is always an unmitigated evil. Therefore it is evident that in religion the state cannot do that which would be proper and right for an individual.
