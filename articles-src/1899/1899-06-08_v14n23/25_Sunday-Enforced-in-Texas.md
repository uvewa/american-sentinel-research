A press "special" to the St. Louis, Mo., Chronicle, from Galveston, Texas, under date of May 27, states the following:—

"The most indigo-hued of last century's New England blue laws pale into whiteness when compared with the statute of Sunday law at Alvin, this State.

"Henry Bunch, a section hand, has an invalid wife. He cooked the food for his wife and self before going to work in the morning, leaving his wife's portion by her bedside.

"On Sunday he washed the family clothes, and after hanging them out to dry, he cultivated a garden back of his little house. People attending a nearby church objected, and he was tried before a justice of the peace and a jury of six. He was found guilty and sent to jail to work out a fine and costs, amounting to $28.75. His wife was left penniless.

"The case will be brought to the governor's attention."
