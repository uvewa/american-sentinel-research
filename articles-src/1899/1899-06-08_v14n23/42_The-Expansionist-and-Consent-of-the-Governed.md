THERE is not an expansionist in the land who is willing to be governed himself according to expansionist principles. Each one wants to be among the "some of the governed," whose consent is to be reckoned with in the government. When we find one who is willing to be among those whose consent is ignored in government, we shall listen to his argument with more patience than we have felt for those we have heard thus far.
