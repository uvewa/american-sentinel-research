A LIVELY Sunday-enforcement crusade is in progress in Akron, Ohio. The crusade is being pushed by ministers of the Evangelical Alliance, and is directed especially against Sunday theaters and games. The following facts in the matter are given by the Cleveland Press:—

"Rev. C. J. Tannar, pastor of the First Christian Church, made affidavit, late yesterday, for the arrest of L. E. Beilstein, manager of the Akron Traction & Electric Co., and three of the performers at Lakeside Park casino, charging them with violating the Sunday law by giving a theatrical performance on that day.

"The papers were given to Sheriff Kelley, last evening, and he served them. The cases will be heard in Justice Hoffman's court.

"It is said warrants will also be issued for the arrest of Menches Bros., proprietors of Summit Lake Park, on the same charge.

"Not all the ministers of the Evangelical Alliance are in sympathy with the movement begun by the alliance.

Revs. F. C. Haddock, W. H. Brightlire, N. J. Myers and E. T. MacMahon are opposed to the 'preachers making themselves police officers,' as one expressed it. Rev. Mr. Myers spoke of this in a sermon, Sunday night. He denied he lacked backbone, but said he did not believe the work was in a preacher's province."

It is pleasing to note that some of Akron's clergymen are opposed to this crusade, appreciating the great truth that an "ambassador for God" is not called by duty to make himself a spy and an informer against people and secure their imprisonment in jail. The ambassador for God is commissioned to proclaim not imprisonment, but liberty; not condemnation, but justification.

We find also in the *Press Post*, of Columbus, the following reference to this subject:—

"There is a lively war in the Evangelical Alliance of this city. It is composed of the Protestant ministers of the city. Several weeks ago, at a secret meeting, a number of the ministers decided to begin a crusade against the Sunday theater and ball games. Several of the ministers dissented. The others severely criticized them for want of 'backbone.'

"Sunday the crusaders visited the casinos at Summit Lake and Lakeside Parks. Rev. N. J. Myers, of St. Paul's Lutheran Church, one of the dissenters, preached a sermon in which he said he would thank God when the theologian and Christian philosopher could give his whole time to the study of the Bible and the consideration of progressive thought and that when the Lord's day arrived, he would not be obliged to hunt up the sheriff and prosecuting attorney and arrest men for playing ball. In his sermon he referred to the century A. D. 2500. Looking forward to that period, he said: 'I was glad that I did not live in the last days of the nineteenth century when the ministers of God's word were expected to lower their ministerial dignity by descending to the low level of the Sunday afternoon spy, and that Christian charity and good judgment had been so thoroughly developed that when I refused to do so I was not branded as a coward or accused of lack of moral backbone.'

"This sermon has amused the ministers who are active in the crusade."

Evidently, it requires more "backbone" on the part of a clergyman to stand out against one of these crusades, than to join in it. It always requires backbone to stand on the unpopular side.
