Is it often said to her, "Not you alone will be deformed, but your child may be stunted; perhaps you will not even have the power to create a human being"? Is the young man taught that his drinking and dissipation may injure not himself alone, but his yet unborn child also?—Katherine Louise Smith, in Good Health, June.
