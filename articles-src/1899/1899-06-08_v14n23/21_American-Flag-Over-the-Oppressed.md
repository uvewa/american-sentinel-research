In an article which is approvingly noticed by imperialist journals, Julian Hawthorne says:—

"True Americans must believe that America is the hope of the human race. We are bound to demonstrate that belief, even by unfurling the flag over those who have been the victims of oppression."

This would make it binding on America to unfurl the American flag over the principal countries of both hemispheres, and would give the world another great universal empire, provided America could first conquer the world. And that is the trouble with the idea of liberating the oppressed people of the earth by conquest; it means world-wide war.

America cannot conquer the world by war; but American principles of government could and would to a large extent, conquer the principles of despotism and liberate the oppressed in a peaceful manner, if America would exalt those principles before the world. Not liberty conquering the world with sword and cannon, but "liberty enlightening the world," is the hope of the world's oppressed people.
