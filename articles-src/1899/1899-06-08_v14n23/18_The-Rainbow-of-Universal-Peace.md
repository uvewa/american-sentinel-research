The Americans at The Hague have submitted their preliminary plan for the establishment of a permanent tribunal of international arbitration.

Our Commissioners and the Administration which sent them are entitled to congratulations upon the favorable reception of the scheme. Its simplicity, directness, and promise of working efficiency have commended it at once to all concerned. The propositions advanced by the representatives of several other powers, including Great Britain, are obviously inferior; the British plan, indeed, seems by comparison so inchoate that it has been practically laid aside already in favor of the American scheme. Whatever is accomplished by the Peace Conference in this department of mundane amelioration will have received its first impulse, its general form, and its clearest definition from this side of the Atlantic.

Our Commissioners propose that at least nine of the sovereign powers of the earth shall join by treaty in the establishment of a permanent international court to try and decide disputes likely otherwise to lead to war. The essential features of this high tribunal are briefly sketched in the resolutions submitted.

The nine or more sovereign powers are each to have one representative upon the international bench, nominated by the highest court in each country and holding office for an indefinite term. In the case of the United States, for example, the Supreme Court would select our international judge. His term would last until the Supreme Court at Washington deemed it advisable, for one reason or another, to supersede him by appointing his successor.

The organization of the international tribunal and its rules of procedure are to be determined by its nine or more members; and the meeting place is to vary according to convenience.

The court is to be always open, not only to the contracting nations, but also to other nations which may desire its services, although not parties to the treaty.

Litigants may elect whether to have their causes adjudged by the full bench of nine, or by any smaller number not less than three. General expenses are to be borne by the nine or more contracting governments. Outside litigants using the court are to be charged for the expenses of the cases they bring. The judges are to draw salaries only for time when actually engaged in the duties of the court. Every defeated litigant is to have the right, for three months after a first decision, to reopen the case on account of newly-discovered evidence or questions of law not submitted at the previous hearing.

That is all the machinery. It is simple and effective. We have reserved to the last the provisions of Article IV., which contains the essence of the proposition:—

"Any and all questions of disagreement *may, by mutual consent*, be submitted by the nations concerned to this international tribunal for decision, but every such decision shall be accompanied by an undertaking to accept the award."

In the words *italicized* abide the fatal defects of any scheme, no matter how ingeniously contrived or elaborately decorated with the rainbow hues of hope, for the preservation of peace among nations by means of an institution analogous to those upon which civilization depends for peace and justice as between individuals.

1. *By mutual consent*. For the effective settlement of differences one party to the dispute must be able to summon the other before the court and compel him to abide by its decision.

2. *May be submitted*. As long as the word *may* is the foundation of every proposed scheme of international arbitration, and until the word *must* replaces it, so long will the exaggerated hopes of the dreamers of universal peace through the agency of arbitration be doomed to disappointment.

It is common to imagine a tribunal of nations similar in a general way to the courts before which the people of all civilized countries carry their disputes. "If possible among men, why not possible among governments?" is the question often asked. There is no parallel. The analogy misleads. The indispensible factor that exists in one case is absent in the other, namely, the power of enforcement.

Behind the courts of justice in every land on earth that possesses such institutions is a sovereign power able and ready to execute the courts' decrees. Behind the treaty tribunal of nations there will be no sovereign power. There will be an aggregation of independent sovereignties, it is true; but the idea of the intervention of a majority of these separate sovereignties to coerce a single sovereignty into accepting a majority verdict or obeying a majority decree, involves a usurpation on the one side and a renunciation on the other alike inconceivable to the human mind in its present stage of political enlightenment.

So the American proposition adds to the existing appliances for the preservation of peace nothing more than an admirably conceived machine, and a moral influence the exact value of which experience alone can determine.

If we could conceive the possibility of a general willingness on the part of the nations at The Hague to surrender sovereignty for the sake of universal peace, and to agree that a *must* should be put into the proposed convention instead of a *may* could the decisions and decrees of this exalted tribunal then be enforced?

Is there any way in which the formal agreement in advance to abide by the court's judgment could be rendered effective, in order that war might be averted and a pacific settlement assured?

Yes, there is one way. How?

In the answer to that How? the rainbow disappears.

The decisions of the tribunal could be enforced, and the defeated litigant nation made to obey, by police duty on the part of the other treaty nations. The eight could coerce, or attempt to coerce, the one. That is to say, by superior force. That is to say, again, by armed intervention and conflict in case of resistance. That is to say, finally, by War.
