Some good things on the enforcement of Sunday observance in Georgia, are forcibly said by the Commercial Argus, of Rome, Ga., with reference to the arrest of J. T. Eaton, of that city, for Sunday work.

Referring to the notice of the case which first appeared in the Rome Tribune, the Argus said that, "In all candor, we don't think that there was much religion shown by the intermeddling neighbors in having the case made against Mr. Eaton; certainly there was no Christianity displayed;" and that "for other churches pretending to be Christians, to assume to themselves the right to dictate to others, is a species of bigotry unworthy the religion of Christ. There is no religion in it. It is fanaticism pure and simple."

This called forth strong replies from some of those most opposed to the Adventist religion; of which the Argus took note by printing the following:—

"Our waste basket is filled with vigorous and somewhat intolerant, not to say impertinent, denunciations of our editorial, which appeared in the Commercial-Argus last Friday, commenting upon the case made against one J. T. Eaton by his intermeddling neighbors for working on Sunday.

"With all due respect to the superior grace and wisdom of our critics, we have nothing to retract nor even modify in the article denounced.

"We said that so far as violating the State law, Mr. Eaton was amenable to the state courts and might be punished, but so far as violating an ordinance of the living God, that was a matter with which the courts should have nothing to do.

"The Constitution of the United States, evolved out of the wisdom of the fathers who framed the original laws of the land, wisely prohibited the prosecution of a citizen because of his religious opinions, but left every man free to worship God in his own way and according to his own conscience.

"In this particular case Mr. Eaton was conscientious in his belief—and there are thousands of others of the same faith—that the Sabbath consecrated by God as a day of rest was the seventh day of the week; the day upon which God rested from the work of creation and which He commanded men to observe and to keep holy, and as such he and his family observed it, doing no manner of work upon that day but keeping it sacred, if not holy.

"This other Sunday, the first day of the week, ordained by man, he does not believe in, but being a law-abiding man, it should have challenged his obedience however much it might fail in appealing to his sense of duty to his God.

"It is an unreasonable and unjust law, and ought to be repealed.

"It is just such laws and the bigoted spirit that insists upon their enforcement that is causing some of the most advanced thinkers to doubt the truth of the Christian religion. . . .

"What we meant in our defense of Mr. Eaton was not to encourage him in the breaking of the law, but to exculpate him from any violation of the law of God. He obeyed the dictates of his conscience when he observed the seventh day, Saturday, with religious scruples, and felt no moral obligation to observe the legal Sabbath."

Upon just one point the position of the Argus is open to criticism: the Sunday law must fail to challenge the obedience of seventh day observers, for the simple reason that a law requiring the sanctification of the seventh day of the week is by the nature of the case directly opposed to a law requiring the sanctification of the first day, and to observe both is an impossibility. The seventh day is not sanctified as the commandment requires unless it is set apart from all other days of the week, by rest from labor, as God set it apart at creation. The commandment requires that this deference be shown only to the seventh day. He who tries to sanctify both the seventh and the first days sanctifies neither one. This is how Sunday laws invade the realm of conscience.
