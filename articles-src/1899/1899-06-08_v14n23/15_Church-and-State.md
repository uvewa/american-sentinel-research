Church and state are organically, though not sympathetically, distinct and separate. Government property should on no account be turned over to the church. The state should aid no creed nor sect by gift or loan. From the days of Constantine the unholy alliance of church and state has been the cause of nations corrupting the church by making it dependent on the state and paralyzing the state by making it subservient to ecclesiastical authority. Between the two let there be no organic connection; render to Cæsar Cæsar's things, no more, no less, and to God God's things, no more, no less. —Rev. Kerr Boyce Tupper, Baptist.
