THE AMERICAN SENTINEL will give special attention to the work of collecting and presenting the news of what is being done in all quarters for and against the preservation of the rights of conscience; and you want the SENTINEL for the sake of this news, even if you do not agree with the principles it maintains. Think of this, if you are disposed to drop the paper, and ask yourself if it is not true.
