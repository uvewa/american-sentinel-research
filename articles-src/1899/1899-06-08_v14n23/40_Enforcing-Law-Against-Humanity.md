NO HUMANE official of the civil government would be willing to enforce a law commanding the execution of a person known to be innocent; and the fact that he would refuse to perform such a deed, is evidence that every such official does weigh the law in his own mind, and approve it, before he enforces its penalty. He does not enforce it simply because "it is the law." If the principle of enforcing law because it is the law is to be followed in one case, it is to be followed in all cases, regardless of the character of the law; but no individual could do this without parting company with his humanity. The principle of such a thing is against humanity, and is therefore wrong.
