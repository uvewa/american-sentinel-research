**WHILE** the state is not a moral personality like the individual, it is yet bound to do that which it was instituted to do; namely, preserve the natural rights of man. Man was created for the glory of God; the state was created for the protection of man in society. Only through force can the state protect society; but only through love can man glorify God. The state cannot glorify God because it cannot love. The state represents man's power, but God does not want man's power. He wants man's love, and by loving God men will work most effectually to preserve peace and uprightness in society. Love to God is the great preventive of the ills of society; and an ounce of this prevention is worth a pound and more of the state's attempted cure.
