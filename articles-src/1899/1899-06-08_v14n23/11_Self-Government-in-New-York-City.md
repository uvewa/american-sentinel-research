While the United States is slaughtering and devastating in the Philippines because the natives are savages who do not know how to govern themselves, it is interesting and instructive to note the status of the metropolis of the United States as regards this same matter of self-government. Is New York City able to govern itself? In answer to the question we quote the following from the New York Independent, than which there could be no better authority on the subject. Under the heading "Boss Rule in New York," the Independent says:—

"The results of the Mazet Committee's inquiry as to the evils of boss rule in New York should be considered in connection with the political agreement or alliance which enabled Croker and his associates to take possession of the municipal government. At the earlier sessions of the committee it was shown, chiefly by the admissions of the Tammany boss himself, how the judges, who had been required to pay large assessments for their nominations, were expected to use their political influence for the enrichment of the boss and his associates; how various industries, depending in some measure upon the favor of the municipal authorities, were made to contribute something to the accumulations of the leader and his friends; and how this leader, in the words of his own boastful declaration, was working all the time for his 'pocket.' More recently the deplorable condition of the Police Department has been disclosed by the testimony of the four commissioners of police, the chief who was removed, his successor, and others. The mayor and certain other subordinates or assistants of the boss admitted that they had for years been the friends of men reputed to exercise control over numerous pool rooms and similar resorts kept open in violation and defiance of law.

"The chief of police, who declined to transfer to remote and undesirable stations officers who had annoyed these law-breakers by attempting to bring them to justice, could not at first be removed because the two Republican commissioners in the bi-partisan board were unwilling to vote against him. These commissioners were removed, and in their places were appointed two other Republicans—one of them upon the recommendation of Senator Platt—who promptly voted to retire the obnoxious chief and to put in his place a man who has since been conveniently ignorant of notorious violations of law.

"One of these new commissioners made the humiliating confession that he voted against Chief McCullagh, knowing that he was a good officer, simply to keep his salary of $5,000 a year. Abundant proof was then produced that more than one hundred pool rooms or gambling places were open in the city. Both the present chief and the mayor had professed to be ignorant of such violations of law, but it was clear enough that the Police Department had been reorganized with a view to the protection of such law-breakers."

This is what exists in New York city government today. It is "boss" rule, and it hardly need be said that "boss" rule is not self government. Such rule is just as far from self-government as is the government of Russia, or the government that has existed in the Philippines.

It must be admitted, then, that the same objection urged against Philippine independence lies equally against the independence of the people of this country's metropolis—they cannot govern themselves. And therefore it is plain that this city ought to be invaded and subjugated, and a foreign rule established here at least until the inhabitants shall have become fitted to rule themselves.

However, the people of this city know how to fight and are well able to defend themselves with military weapons of the latest make; and this being so, it is not at all likely that it will be thought necessary anywhere to invade and subdue the people because they are not capable of self-government.
