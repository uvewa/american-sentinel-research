THE last two issues of the SENTINEL have had much to say about the revival of Sunday enforcement, and quite as much is given in this issue on the same subject. All this ought to be interesting news to every lover of American liberty, at least. Such occurrences call upon all persons in the land to make their choice for or against the principles of religious freedom. It is the duty of every person to be prepared for the issue when he meets it, and this can best be done by making the decision now.
