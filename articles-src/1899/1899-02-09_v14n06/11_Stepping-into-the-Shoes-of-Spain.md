"The great powers," says a prominent "expansionist" journal, "are content that the United States shall step into the shoes of Spain, and become responsible for the international relations of the [Philippine] archipelago."

No doubt they are; but should the United States Government itself be content to "step into the shoes of Spain"? Those shoes were not made for a republic; besides being too nearly worn out to be of service to the United States.
