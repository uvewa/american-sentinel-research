Editor Sentinel: The impropriety and unconstitutionality of the position reported, by the Baltimore Daily American, to have been taken by President McKinley, has been well demonstrated in the Sentinel. But there is another point which is worth considering. In the article to which reference is made (dated October 15, 1898) it is asserted that: "The Cuban priests, as in all countries whose population is densely ignorant, exercise complete control over their parishioners." Further on, reference is boldly made to the evil influence "that is in the power of a hostile clergy to exercise." Therefore it is their own admission that the only "dangerous enemies" that the United States Government will meet, if it does meet any such enemies, will be those same "Cuban priests."

Now the priests of the Roman Catholic Church have always claimed to be the only true representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ to this world. Christ was the very embodiment of peace, and the friend of every man in the world, and it is a puzzling question how anyone who represents Christ could in any way become the enemy of any man. The followers of Christ were often accused of treason and of stirring up insurrection. But when these charges were investigated it was always found that the only treason of which they were guilty was that they taught men to worship the one true God, instead of the multitude of false gods which they were in the habit of worshiping; and that, instead of exciting insurrection, they patiently bore whatever came against them.

Not only did they thus, themselves, set an example, but they also carefully taught their followers to do the same. We do not find the Apostle Paul, when he was unjustly held in prison at Phillipi, making trouble for the unjust governor; and when it was intimated to him that for a sum of money he might be set free (Acts 24: 26), we do not see him preferring charges of corruption in order to have the governor removed. In fact, he attended strictly to his own work, which was to represent Christ, to the world, in his own life; and let the Roman Empire run its government to suit itself. By admitting that the United States, if she follows her established course and looks after the political needs of Cuba, leaving the church interests to freely take care of themselves, may build up "a dangerous set of enemies" they have, themselves admitted that the priests are not followers of the apostles, and are not directed by "the wisdom that is from above," which is "first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without wrangling [see margin], and without hypocrisy."

But there need be no trouble, even if the priests have not the Spirit of Christ, which from the above it is evident that they do not have. The pope is the head of the church, and as such, has complete control over the priests, while the priests have "complete control over their parishioners." And is not the pope friendly to the United States? Has he not expressed himself as satisfied with the new order of things? Then the only thing necessary to avoid any trouble in establishing any authority of the "American Government in Cuba," is for the pope to instruct the Cubans, through the priests, to recognize that authority and to make no trouble. And if trouble does arise, or if the United States has to pay this corruption fund to prevent trouble, it would seem that the pope's professions of friendship for the United States, and his declaration of satisfaction with the new order of things, is only pretended and not real.
