DISPATCHES from Europe dated February 1, tell of the discovery of a desperate anarchist plot which was meant to compass the destruction of the entire detective force of the city of Leghorn, Italy, and of certain prominent public officials as well. And this follows close upon the announced intention of the European governments to adopt severer measures than had been previously employed for stamping anarchy out of existence.
