"The thought brought out in our last talk, Aleck, that men might not recognize the operation of the Holy Spirit in the true follower of Christ, is forcibly illustrated in the 12th chapter of Acts."

"So it is, and it illustrates the two warring principles as well; for Herod, his prison and his guards, stand for man-dependence, and Peter, imprisoned for Christ's sake, the company of Christians praying for his release at the home of Mary, represent reliance on God. But Cecil, what made Herod take the course of persecution that he did?"

"It says, 'because he saw it pleased the Jews.'"

"There is another illustration of this principle's weakness. Man-pleasing, man-fearing, and oppression go together. If he had looked only for what would have pleased God, he would have been a free man."

"But Aleck, Peter, James, and others of the church had looked only to please God, and they were killed and imprisoned. How does your principle account for that?" asked Cecil.

"'Four walls do not a prison make?' 'If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed,'" quoted Aleck. "Beside, it was not bondage that could be so easily broken as was Peter's. The prison was to him simply the out-working of divine providence. 'They conquer though they die.'"

"Peter's experience was wonderful. But Aleck, why do we not hear of such experiences to-day?"

"No doubt we shall hear of just such occurrences, when circumstances make it necessary."

"Well Aleck, one might almost covet Peter's place, if he could have such a miraculous deliverance."

"How was it, Cecil? The details of the narrative are dim and disconnected in my mind."

"Herod ordered that Peter should be kept in prison till after Easter. Then he intended bringing him forth for the same kind of trial as had been given to James and Jesus—a trial in which the death-penalty was forecast and predetermined."

"They have just such trials to-day, Cecil. Some of the trials have not even as much semblance of justice as had those trials."

"What do you mean Aleck? Where do they have such trials?"

"Here, my friend; in the enlightened, justice- and liberty-loving land of the supposed free and equal."

"Give me an illustration."

"Not long ago, I heard of the lynching of a colored man, and the burning of another. The trial as to their guilt or innocence was held the day after their death."

"O well, no doubt they suffered their just desserts."

"No Cecil; justice demands that they have an unprejudiced hearing. And beside, such arbitrary, unreasonable action on the part of accusers, menaces the liberty and life of every one else, and make steps for mob law and wholesale murder. But let us not digress. We'll discuss this later. Go on with your story."

"The very night before the trial, when Peter was sleeping between two guards, an angel came in, struck off his chains, bade Peter bind on his sandals and wrap his cloak about him, and led him out. Bars, doors, chains, guards, soldiers, and prison walls made no resistance. While the story is awe-inspiring, it also presents to my mind a humorous side. Think how Herod and his bulwarks were non-plused and out-generated! It does me good to think of it."

"O Cecil, what a deal of human nature there is in us all! God was seeking by this miracle, not simply to out-general Herod and his guards, but to give them evidence of his omnipotence, that haply they might feel after him and find him."

"The evidence he gave them, as far as the record goes, was useless. Herod ordered the guards slain, and went off about his business in apparent unconcern. The very fact that he had the guards slain, denies supernatural intervention, and charges the guards with unfaithfulness or threachery."

"Poor man! 'There are none so blind as those who will not see.' By every effort we make to dodge truth, and escape duty, we step on toward Herod's blindness and cruel selfishness. Well, what's the rest of the story?"

"Aleck, you have a way of making every narrative or idea take on a personal aspect. Since we began these talks I am haunted quite as much as Eugene Field's boy in the poem 'Seein' Things.' However, that thought brings me logically back to Peter; for he thought he was in a dream until he found himself alone. Realizing that he had been set free by an angel, in joy he hurried to the home of Mary, where the brethren had been and still were, praying for his deliverance. Rhoda, a young girl, came to the door; but instead of letting Peter in, she rushed back to tell the people Peter was at the gate. That's just like a girl, for all the world. I've seen girls act just as impulsively and unreasonable. This part of the story struck me as rather comical. The brethren, instead of going to the door, argued that it could not be Peter, but his angel. And yet they had been praying for his deliverance! Did you ever hear of worse inconsistency?"

"Faithless human nature, Aleck. O, how slow we are to really take in the idea that God hears and answers prayer. When the answer comes we are still unbelieving and ungrateful."

"However, Peter was persistent. He pounded away, and finally they let him in. They had substantial evidence that it was really Peter. He rehearsed the story, told them to go and tell the other brethren, and then he hurried out of the place. Aleck, with such a deliverance as he had had, why did he need to leave the place?"

"He was acting wisely in so doing, and in harmony with the Saviour's instruction, 'When they persecute you in city one, flee to another.' Peter's remarkable experience must have strengthened the church."

"It did. Herod died soon after, being eaten of worms, and the next verse says, 'The word of God grew and multiplied.' You see, Cecil, the testimony of history is, that persecution, or prosecution as men would call it, does not hinder the growth of truth. I am looking for the manifestation of real vitality among true Christians, when persecution breaks out against them."

"Aleck, you are forever hinting about persecution. Some time, I hope, you'll explain what you mean. Something that would give me a vital sense of the need of God's protection and help, is just what I am looking for to make me step over the line."

"That something will not long be lacking. But you may prove it by following the rule laid down by Paul, 'Whoever will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.'"
