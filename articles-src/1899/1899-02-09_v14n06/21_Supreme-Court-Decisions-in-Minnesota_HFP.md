The Sunday laws of Minnesota contain a clause prohibiting "servile labor," with a provision "excepting the works of necessity or charity"; followed by this proviso:—

"Provided, however, that keeping open a barber shop on Sunday for the purpose of cutting hair and shaving beards shall not be deemed a work of necessity or charity."

The fine for the violation of the Sunday laws is a sum "not less than one dollar nor more than ten dollars." The Barbers' Union has been most active in securing arrests for violation of the barbers' clause, but the fines assessed were of the lowest amount. Recent efforts have been made to make the law more stringent, and prosecutions more numerous.

It was finally determined by non-union men that they would make a test case. The violator of the law, a barber of Minneapolis, through his attorney, set up the defense that the law was a species of class legislation, and therefore unconstitutional. The lower court decided that the law was not class legislation, and that it was constitutional. The case was carried to the Supreme Court of the State, which affirmed the decision of the lower courts. The decision was handed down by Judge Mitchell, last December. But the defense took an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.

As a matter of fact, if this special feature of the Sunday laws is constitutional, all others are constitutional as well. It was, however, but a few years ago that the Supreme Court of California rendered a decision that the Sunday laws of that State were unconstitutional. Thus we have the Supreme Court of Minnesota in conflict with the Supreme Court of California. The final decision of the highest court of the nation will be waited for with interest; as the decision in this case will establish a precedent for any other case under any other feature of the Sunday laws. If the decision should affirm the constitutionality of this one clause, it would go a long way, in the opinion of the courts, toward establishing the question of the constitutionality of all Sunday laws. But these laws would not be constitutional, even though all the courts in the world should so affirm.

But now comes another decision from that same court; this time in regard to the legality of Sunday contracts. The decision is by Associate Justice Collins, who decides that as the Sunday law forbids "all manner of public selling and offering for sale publicly or property on Sunday, except certain specified articles;" and that as "by the common law judicial proceedings on Sunday were forbidden, any other business could lawfully be transacted."

This is equivalent to saying that it would be perfectly constitutional for barbers to shave men in any way other than publicly. But why draw the line on the publicity of the act? If the act is right as between man and man, if the act does not infringe the right of another, in the very nature of the case it must be constitutional, whether a private or a public act; and so far as all human standards of measurement are concerned, it is not a wrong.
