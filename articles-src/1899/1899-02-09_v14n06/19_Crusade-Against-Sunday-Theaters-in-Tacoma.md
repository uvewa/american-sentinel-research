The W. C. T. U. of Tacoma, Washington, have started a crusade in that city against Sunday theaters, from which much discussion of the subject has followed among the residents, with the arrest of the manager of one of the theaters, on complaint made by a representative of the Union. The law of the State prohibits the opening of theaters on Sundays.

To get evidence against the theatrical managers, two W. C. T. U. women attended some of the Sunday evening plays. One of these plays was "so vile and disgraceful we could hardly bear to stay to the finish," and another was so bad that they left after the first act.

And because such is the character of the exhibitions, the W. C. T. U. of Tacoma demand that the theaters of that city be closed—on Sundays.

The good women of this noble organization doubtless do not mean to sanction and uphold the institution of which they speak in such terms. But have they considered that they are virtually doing just this when they attack the theaters with a Sunday law? The Sunday law forbids the running of the theaters on Sunday; and by that very token it sanctions them on the other six days of the week. And sanctioning them thus, it establishes them on those six days by law. Have the opponents of the Sunday theaters considered this?

Are the purity-loving women of this Christian Temperance Union really willing to endorse and support, six-sevenths of all the time, exhibitions which they themselves characterize as too disgraceful to be endured by decent people?

So long as no law touches the matter, the theater stands simply on its own merits; and if it has no merits to stand on, it is manifestly at a disadvantage because of the opposing sentiment of right-minded people. But when a law is passed prohibiting the theater on Sunday, by that same law it is sanctioned on all other days of the week; from this conclusion logic affords no possible escape. And by observing that law, the theater becomes a law-abiding institution, and as such can claim the protection of the law. And what is this short of its actual establishment by law?

The same argument, of course, applies to the liquor saloon.

It must be admitted, if there is any force in logic, either that the objections raised against the Sunday theater really call for the abolition of the theater on all days, or that the real purpose of such objections is the exaltation of Sunday as a day separated from other days of the week on religious grounds.
