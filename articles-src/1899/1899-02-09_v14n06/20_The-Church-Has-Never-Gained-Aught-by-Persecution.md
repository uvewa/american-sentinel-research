THE CHURCH HAS NEVER GAINED AUGHT BY PERSECUTION. IT MAY COMPel LIP SERVICE, BUT CANNOT DRIVE LOVE AND RESPECT INTO THE HEARTS OF MEN WITH A MAUL. A JUST AND humane policy on the part of the church; more charity and less arrogant dogmatism; a recognition of the right of every sentient creature to his own opinion; a confession of the fact that the wisest theologian is but groping toward the light, and may misinterpret God's message; the absolute elimination of religion from secular affairs; less thunderous pulpiteering and more examples of the true Christian kind, would eliminate atheism from this land, for the spirit of Christ when made manifest in men, appeal to all humanity with irresistible power.—*The Transcript.*
