INTERFERENCE with freedom of conscience under the sanction of law in these days usually takes the form of prosecution for failing to observe the Sabbath of tradition and popular custom. But the spirit which demands that the Sabbath of tradition shall be observed, demands just as strenuously that the seventh-day Sabbath shall not be observed; hence it sometimes happens that an individual is prosecuted for refusing to do on the seventh day that which he would be punished for not refusing to do on the first day.

The same sentiment and means are behind the prosecution in the one case as in the other; and the demand for the sanctification of Sunday is shown to be one in spirit with the demand for the violation of the seventh day.

An illustration of this is reported in the following letter which comes to us from Washington. A young man in that State, an observer of the seventh-day Sabbath, was arrested and fined for refusing to serve as a juror on that day. The letter is from his father. He says:—

"George was drawn on jury for the December term. He notified the judge at once that he could not serve on the Sabbath, taking a noble stand for the truth in open court. He was drawn on a case which extended into the Sabbath. When the court adjourned on Friday he went to the judge again and told him he could not serve further and asked to be excused. The court refused. George came home, was arrested next day, taken back, and fined $50 for contempt; and given till the close of term to settle. Of course, he refused to pay the fine. The court then took a recess of ten days, and the jurymen were instructed to return on the 21st, unless notified to the contrary.

"On the 20th the jury (George included) received notices from the clerk informing them that they need not return, as their services were no longer needed; so of course George did not go; and there the matter rests at present. We do not know how it may come out, but hope for the best.

"We heard a few days ago that the judge said to a friend that unless McLafferty came up soon and settled he should send for him. The matter is being talked of everywhere and public sentiment is very much opposed to the action of the court. We are trusting in the Lord, and shall stand firm for the truth no matter what comes.

"Yours,
"D. McLAFFERTY."
