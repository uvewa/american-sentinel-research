WHILE the war with Spain is over, the war is evidently not yet over in the United States, but is still going on among the various figures of military prominence. The center of contention at the present time is the Embalmed Beef Trust—as it may be called—and an effort is being made to determine whether more American soldiers were killed by this Trust than by the Spanish army.
