BY C. H. KESLAKE.

SABBATH reform work of two kinds is now attracting the attention of the people. These, however, are so opposite in their aim and purpose, and the methods adopted for the carrying out of each are so dissimilar and antagonistic that it does not require a mind of great calibre to see that they cannot both be the work of God under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

Inasmuch as this reform work has in view the keeping of the first day of the week, or Sunday, as the Sabbath, on the one hand; and the keeping of the seventh day, as such, on the other, it is not to be wondered at that some good honest souls should be perplexed for a time as to which day is the Sabbath, and which phase of Sabbath reform is the true one.

Of course there is one infallible guide to which one can always look, and which will always be found speaking with no uncertain sound—the Word of God. From Genesis to Revelation it consistently testifies that there is only one weekly Sabbath for God's people both in time and eternity.

But it is a sad truth that only a very few comparatively have familiarized themselves with the Bible so as to be able with confidence to accept its testimony, though uniform, upon this momentous question.

Apart from the plain scriptural statements as to which day is the Sabbath, one who is at all acquainted with the character of God will be able to judge pretty accurately as to the truth in the matter by the methods that are being followed to bring about the observance of these days respectively.

"God is love." God is the "God of truth: He is the living God; and the King of eternity." Jer. 10:10. (margin.)

Everything therefore that God does must be done in love, "in truth and uprightness." Ps. 11:7, 8.

With regard to the days in question, their advocates respectively claim to base their work of Sabbath reform on the fourth commandment of the Decalogue. Without stopping to observe what the testimony of the commandment itself is, we will note that Christ tells us that the law of which the Sabbath forms a part hangs upon two great commandments. The first and greatest of these commandments is, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." "And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Matt. 22:36–40.

As before stated, "God is love;" therefore "love is of God." From this it follows that these two commandments both find their root—their origin—in "Love." It is therefore absolutely impossible for them to be obeyed without the love of God being in the hearts of those upon whom these obligations devolve.

As the ten commandments hang upon these two greater commandments, it is perfectly plain that with them these ten find their origin in Love, and therefore must themselves be love, and *in love only can be obeyed*. Hence we read that "Love is the fulfilling of the law." Rom. 13:10.

All this being true of God's law as a whole, it must be equally true of each commandment of that law. Therefore there is no such thing as Sabbath-keeping on the part of the one in whose heart the love of God has no place. This is true; and the only way that that love can be obtained is by having it "shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us." Rom. 5:5.

It surely then cannot be hard to see that any Sabbath reform that does not begin with getting the love of God in the heart is not true Sabbath reform.

Nor is this all: As the love of God is shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit, any reform that does not depend upon the Holy Spirit wholly and entirely, cannot be true Sabbath reform. For it is written: "Not by might (army, marg.), nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." Zech. 4:6.

Yet again: As "love is the fulfilling of the law," and "love is of God," in that "God is love," any Sabbath reform that is not wrought in love, and depends upon any power other than love, is not true Sabbath reform. And it might well be questioned that the day whose advocates find it necessary to rely upon any other power than the love of God for its observance, is the Sabbath of the Lord.

That it is true that the advocates of the Sunday Sabbath are courting the aid of a different power than that of the power of love, can easily be verified by an examination of the literature which is being scattered abroad throughout the country; and this very method furnishes strong proof of the true origin of Sunday. Human power being invoked for the preservation of the day, suggests that it has not a particle of divinity—of the character of God—in it. Fancy a *divine* institution depending upon human enactments for its support! Could anything be more incongruous? And to think of the idea of "preserving" the Sabbath! The Sabbath that God instituted needs no preservatives. It is eternal; it never can fail. That which makes God's Sabbath what it is, is his own presence in it. Its very nature is that of love, and "love never failed." 1 Cor. 13:8.

The attempt, therefore, to support the Sabbath by human enactments is not simply irreligious; it is blasphemous. Its success cannot be anything else than the exaltation of man—the "man of sin," too, whose day Sunday is—above all that is called God; and the worshiping of the power so represented instead of God.

This pseudo-Sabbath reform work has been faithfully portrayed in the "sure word of prophecy," and is found in Rev. 13:11–17. This the writer has dwelt upon at length in the articles "The Holy Spirit and Sunday."

That the true Sabbath reform is also a subject of prophecy cannot be doubted. That it would be placed by the side of the other, and in contrast to it, we would naturally expect, and that it is so we shall truly find; and from first to last it will be found that this reform will be carried on, not only without its adherents seeking the aid of earthly powers, but in the face of the bitterest opposition by the powers of earth, and relying only upon the power of God's love—the only true basis of Sabbath reform.
