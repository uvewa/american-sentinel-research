THE following bill has been introduced in the legislature of Oregon, which, as will be seen, is a sweeping measure for the enforcement of Sunday observance:—

"If any person shall keep open any store, barber shop, shop, grocery, ball alley, billiard-room, shooting alley, tippling house for the purpose of labor or traffic, or any place of amusement or any house or building where goods, wares, and merchandise are sold or offered for sale on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday or the Lord's day, such person, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $100; provided, that the above provision shall not apply to the keepers of drug stores, doctor shops, undertakers, livery-stable keepers, hotel keepers, butchers and bakers, and all circumstances of necessity and mercy may be pleaded in defense, which shall be treated as a question of fact for the jury to determine when the offense is tried by a jury."

It is fitting to observe in connection with this and every similar piece of proposed legislation, that it takes a radical departure from God's standard of Sabbath observance, not only in naming a different day to be observed, but in providing an exemption for certain trades, such as liverymen, druggists, butchers, bakers, etc. This is a plain intimation that the legislature knows more about the proper observance of the Lord's day, than God himself knows. And this assumption is inseparable from every instance of Sabbath legislation.
