Editor Sentinel: December 27, 1898, President McKinley in sending a message on instruction to General Otis, in command of American troops in the Philippine Islands, after briefly sketching how America came to assume command there, says:—

"In fulfillment of the rights of sovereignty thus acquired and the responsible obligations of government thus assumed, the actual occupation and administration of the entire group of the Philippine Islands become immediately necessary. . . . It will be the duty of the commander of the forces of occupation to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we [United States] come, not as invaders or conquerors, but as friends [italics ours] to protect the natives in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious rights."

How can a power professedly republican, a government by the people, receive from another power ruled by a king or queen sovereignty without becoming sovereign itself? What difference can there be to the people of the Philippine Islands in one sovereign power ruling over them or another? What significance can there be to their untutored minds in the exchange of flags and troops from Spanish sovereignty to American sovereignty?

It is not clear to the minds of all the American-born citizens what right our Executive has in terming America a sovereign power. Is there anything in the Constitution binding the States to such a compact? If the people of these Islands have risen up in rebellion against the sovereignty of Spain, may we not expect them to continue against this sovereignty, although in words to them said to be administered under the "free flag of the United States"?

As friends! Why, then, this array of battle ships? these trained troops? This is certainly a new kind of friendship. So long as they are submissive all goes well. This new sovereign power speaks clearly to them upon this incidental point: "All persons who, either by active aid or by honest submission, cooperate with the Government of the United States to give effect to these beneficent purposes, will receive the reward of its support and protection. All others will be brought within the lawful rule we have assumed, with firmness [military power] if necessary, but without severity so far as may be possible."

But the natives do not take kindly to these proposals. They are preparing to fight for their freedom against the so-called "free flag" floating over them. Is not that what our forefathers did? Who can blame these men for loving their homes, and questioning the motives of a power ten thousand miles away, of whom they have no knowledge?

But the thing most strange of all is that all this assumption of territory across the Pacific, this assimilation of the possessions of others, should go for "benevolent" work. Then according to this rule it is a benevolent work for England to seize all she can of China, for Russia to get her part, and France "benevolently" to assume her control over all she can get. Here is what the American officers in the Philippines were instructed to keep in mind and endeavor to do:—

"Finally, it should be the earnest and paramount aim of the military administration to win the confidence, respect, and affection of the inhabitants of the Philippines by assuring to them in every possible way that full measure of individual rights and liberties which is the heritage of free peoples, and by proving to them that the mission of the United States is one of benevolent assimilation, substituting the mild sway of justice and right for arbitrary rule."

If these Islands can be "benevolently assimilated" by the United States, what shall hinder the same power from going onto the Continent to which they belong, and there continuing the good work? Let us stop before we begin. This is the safe course recommended to us by our forefathers, and who of us love our country more than did they? They said, "All men are created equal."

Let us call such work by the right name, which Mr. McKinley gave it last spring—"criminal aggression." By forsaking right principles we cannot hope for success. "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," in *their* way, too, belong to the Filipinos as well as to others. If they need reforming, persuasion and education can be resorted to.
