THE gospel proclaims liberty to all men—not liberty to do wrong, for that is but bondage and slavery, from which the gospel delivers; but freedom to do right, freedom to obey God's righteous law. This is the only soul-liberty there is. "I will walk at liberty," says the Psalmist, "for I seek Thy precepts."—*Oriental Watchman.*
