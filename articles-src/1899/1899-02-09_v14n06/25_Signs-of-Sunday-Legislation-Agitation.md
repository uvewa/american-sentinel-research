THE most casual observer of passing events can hardly fail to note the signs of constant widening and deepening of the agitation for Sunday legislation.

THE attempt to secure strict Sunday observance in Montana has met with defeat, temporarily at least, by the postponement of the Sunday bill indefinitely, in the legislature.

A NEW Sunday law is proposed in Illinois, which will prohibit the giving of any entertainment on Sunday of a theatrical, musical, or athletic character in all cities of the State.
