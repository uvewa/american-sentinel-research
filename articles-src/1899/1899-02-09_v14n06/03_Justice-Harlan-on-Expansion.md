THE Chicago Times-Herald quotes Justice Harlan, of the Supreme Court, as "handing down" the following opinion touching the proposed annexation of the Philippines, at a recent church meeting in Washington:—

> "After the Philippines have come into our possession we shall govern them on the same footing as a territory, and when they demonstrate that they are a fit people to be incorporated into this Union they must be admitted. If the course of time shows that they will never be far enough advanced to become part of us we can trade them for some place that will. You must remember that we are going to pay $20,000,000 for the Philippines."

"It will be observed," adds the Herald, "that the speaker is not bothered in the least by constitutional scruples, and that he is concerned chiefly with what is expedient, sensible, and practical. Our right to the islands he believes to be indisputable because it is inherent in a sovereign power that has conquered foreign territory and sealed the conquest with a treaty and a purchase. As he is the oldest member of the United States Supreme Court, which is the ultimate authority on constitutional questions, no little importance attaches to what may be called the professional part of his opinion."

The sentiment that "we can trade" nine or ten millions of human beings if it becomes good commercial policy for "us" to do so, is certainly of "no little importance" when it is held by a prominent member of the highest national court. It would be quite fitting, not to say necessary, that one holding this sentiment should be "not bothered in the least by constitutional scruples."

Regard for the principle of the political equality of all men, which the Constitution embodies, would certainly be fatal to such a sentiment, and the two could not possibly go together in any mind.

It is of "no little importance" that the doctrine of the right of American white men to treat men of an inferior race as property—a doctrine thought to have been buried by the Civil War—should be seen reviving as it is to-day. And it is very suggestive of duty to every lover of the principles of just government.
