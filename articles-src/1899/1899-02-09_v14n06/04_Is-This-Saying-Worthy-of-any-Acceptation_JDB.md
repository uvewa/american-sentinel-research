BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

(Concluded.)

The other great epoch in American history, to which we referred last week, was that which resulted in the abolition of chattel slavery in this country. Very much was said then on the question of the government of others. No two men had more to say, or were listened to with greater interest, than Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglass. They were, for a time at least, the champions and representatives of the opposing principles. Which of these men maintained the principle announced by the attorney-general in the saying, "If we can govern ourselves, by that token we can govern others?"

Lincoln declared: "When the white man governs himself that is self-government; but when he governs himself and also another man, that is more than self-government—that is despotism."

Judge Douglass frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm, paraphrased this by saying, "The white people of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves, but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes!" The implied affirmative is that if the white people of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves, they are good enough "to govern others."

Lincoln replied (and by the way Lincoln was regarded as a good Republican in those days): "Well, I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are, and will continue to be, as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the contrary. What I do say is that no man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent."

Here is Douglass' view of the phrase, "all men are created equal:" "No man can vindicate the character, motives, and conduct of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, except upon the hypothesis that they referred to the white race alone, and not to the Africans, when they declared all men to have been created equal." He then proceeds, like a great many people to-day, to narrow the meaning to Anglo-Saxons; but the view here expressed is certainly narrow enough.

In order that we may get the full force of these utterances as they apply to-day, let us, without changing their principles or spirit a particle, revise them to date:

**Lincoln.**—When the American governs himself, that is self-government (not the token that he is to govern other people): but when he governs himself, and also the Filipino and the Cuban, that is more than self-government—that is despotism (not expansion in the interests of liberty and humanity).

**Douglass.**—The people of America are good enough to govern themselves, but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable Filipinos and Cubans.

Or, as I have heard it expressed in specific language from the pulpit: "Aren't 70,000,000 enlightened people able to take care of a few million half-breeds?"

**Lincoln.**—I doubt not that the people of America are, and will continue to be, as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the contrary. What I do say is that they are not good enough to govern the Filipinos and the Cubans without their consent.

**Douglass.**—No man can vindicate the character, motives, and conduct of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, when they declared all men to have been created equal, except upon the hypothesis that they referred alone to themselves, their posterity, and those to whom their posterity should see fit to extend such privileges, and that they had no reference to such inferior peoples as the Filipinos and Cubans.

There will be little difficulty in locating in these utterances the principle, and even the saying itself, announced by the attorney-general. Have we reached a time when Republican statesmen find the principles of Stephen Douglass and the upholders of slavery better suited to their purposes than those of Abraham Lincoln? Evidently that time has arrived.

The opposition to the policy of expansion by two prominent men of otherwise widely differing political views has seemed to afford a leading daily considerable amusement, and it remarks that "anti-expansion makes strange bed-fellows." That may be true, but there is evidently one thing that it can never equal in this respect: namely, the desire to rule other people because of advantage—because of increase of power and of revenue. Not only does this desire make at one George III., Warren Hastings, and American statesman of to-day; not only does it make at one Stephen A. Douglass, the upholders of slavery, and Republican statesmen of to-day; but it makes at one and unites that great lover of liberty and champion of oppressed peoples—the United States—with that government which was so recently a blot upon the civilization of the nineteenth century, the very embodiment of despotism and tyranny, a government fit only to be wiped off the face of the earth—Spain—in the suppression and subjugation of a people who have struggled for years that they might enjoy some freedom in their own country upon the soil where they were born and where they have spent their lives. It is to be hoped that the contemplation of these "bed-fellows" will afford no amusement.

The man who governs himself will not govern another, because when he governs another he ceases to govern himself. He tramples upon justice by which alone government is possible. He becomes a despot, and those whom he rules are slaves. Such a state of things is not government in any sense; it is anarchy. The despot does not govern himself, but is dominated by the evils of his nature; namely, iniquity, or "lawlessness," which is the very opposite of government. It is evident that government cannot spring from a source where only its opposite exists. So the despot's alleged government of others is not government at all, but is misgovernment, oppression, and tyranny. All this is true whether the despotism be administered by one man or by millions of people.

All history has shown that those people who govern themselves most govern other people least. Those who have had the best control of themselves, have and desire the least control of others. When the Romans were "kings over their own appetites, passions, and inclinations," they governed themselves. Becoming the slaves of these appetites, passions, and inclinations, they established despotic rule throughout the earth. It was the early Romans who possessed the faculty of self-government. This faculty was lost when they got the power to govern others.

When the Romans had pursued the policy of expansion to its utmost limit and were at the very zenith of the power which that policy gave them, it was then that they multiplied laws in order to control themselves, and those who made them were frequently the first to break them; it was then that crimes of every description were open and unrebuked; it was then, in fact, that the Romans were in abject slavery, and were furnishing to the world one of the most awful examples in its history, of the abject condition to which man can be brought when self-control is lost and only the evils of his nature, stimulated by the prince of evil, are given loose rein. This was in fact the worst example in the world's history; for it was then that "the fullness of the time had come," and men were "filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness: full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity: whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them." Rom. 1:29–32.

Even the desire to rule others is a loss of self-government. The prevalence of such a desire throughout the United States to-day is simply a proclamation that that faculty or principle by which alone a republican government can endure is being lost by a large number of people in this country. It would, therefore, have been far more fitting and appropriate in view of the actual condition of things, if the attorney-general had uttered a saying somewhat like this: "If we cannot govern ourselves, by what token are we to govern others?" If absolute self control does not confer the right to dominate others, under and by virtue of what authority is that right claimed when self-control has largely disappeared?
