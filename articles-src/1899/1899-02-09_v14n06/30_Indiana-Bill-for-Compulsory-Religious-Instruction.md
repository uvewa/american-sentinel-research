A BILL has been introduced in the Indiana State Senate which requires "a more thorough preparation of citizenship" on the part of young people, "by giving them a more systematic training and development of their moral and religious faculties." It provides that "all children between the ages of five and fifteen years shall have each Sunday at least one hour's religious instruction at some church, denomination not designated. Those parents who make oath that they do not believe in God or Christianity are to be exempt. If there is not in the neighborhood a church of the denomination which the parents would like to have their children attend, then the parents are to give instruction to the children themselves."

This bill, like all similar pieces of legislation, shows much greater regard for "religious instruction" than it does for truth. Religious instruction is not necessarily truth, and when it is not truth an individual is better off without it than with it. Legislation, of course, cannot settle what the truth is in religion; it can at best only blindly aim at the truth, with the certainty of missing it in the great majority of cases. The bill is useful only as illustrating the futility of trying to make people moral by force of law.
