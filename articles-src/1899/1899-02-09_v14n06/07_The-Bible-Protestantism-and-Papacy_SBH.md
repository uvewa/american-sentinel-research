### TRUE PROTESTANTISM IS BIBLICAL.

BY S. B. HORTON.

Touching the principles of Protestantism the church historian Dowling says:—

"The Bible, I say, the Bible only, is the religion of Protestants. Nor is it of any account in the estimation of the genuine Protestant, how early a doctrine originated, if it is not found in the Bible. . . . The consistent and true-hearted Protestant, standing upon this rock—'the Bible and the Bible only,' can admit no doctrine upon the authority of tradition; . . . he who receives a single doctrine upon the mere authority of tradition, let him be called by what name he will, by so doing, steps down from the Protestant rock, passes over the line which separates Protestantism from papacy, and can give no valid reason why he should not receive all the earlier doctrines and ceremonies of Romanism, upon the same authority."

We have learned, moreover, that the protest of April 19, 1529, dealt with not only the question of the sufficiency of Holy Scriptures, but with another and very vital point, that of interpretation; viz., "that each text of the Holy Scriptures ought to be explained by other and clearer texts." Upon these two essential features the protest is in strict accord with the Bible. Note these Scriptures:—

"But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast learned the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works." 2 Tim. 3:14–17. "I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine." 2 Tim. 4:1, 2. "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts; knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation." 2 Peter 1:19, 20.

That these features of true Protestantism, the sufficiency and self-interpreting of Holy Scriptures, are tacitly advocated more or less by Protestant sects, we have but to refer to their published literature composing creeds, confessions, articles of religion, etc. We quote from a few leading denominations.

The Baptist "Articles of Faith," say:—

"We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired, and is a perfect treasure of heavenly instruction; that it has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth without any mixture of error for its matter; that it reveals the principles by which God will judge us; and therefore is, and shall remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and opinions should be tried."

The Methodist Discipline and the Protestant Episcopal Church articles of religion teach alike on the sufficiency of Holy Scriptures, as follows:—

"Art. V., par. 7.—The Holy Scriptures contain all things necessary to salvation; so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man that it should be believed as an article of faith, or be thought necessary to salvation. In the name of the Holy Scriptures we do understand those canonical books of the Old and New Testaments of whose authority was never any doubt in the church."

The Protestant Episcopal Church adds to this fundamental article one on the subject of the authority of the church:—

"Art. XX.—The church hath power to decree rites or ceremonies, and authority in controversies of faith: and yet it is not lawful for the church to ordain anything that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, although the church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ, yet, as it ought not to decree anything against the same, so besides the same ought it not to enforce anything to be believed for necessity of salvation."

The Presbyterian Church expresses itself on the sufficiency and interpretation of Holy Scriptures in this language:—

"Chapter 1, Art. 1.—Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence, do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God, and of his will, which is necessary unto salvation; therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal himself and to declare that (revelation) his will unto the church; and afterwards for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy Scripture to be most necessary," etc.

"Art. IX.—The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture, is the Scripture itself; and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of any scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it may be searched and known by other places that speak more clearly."

The language of these articles of belief concerning the sufficiency of Holy Scriptures and the interpretation thereof needs no interpretation. Each is plain and right to the point, and shows at once that the vital issue as between the traditional teachings of men and that of the divine revelation is at least professedly understood and advocated by these great bodies of Protestantism. In the language of Rev. J. L. Burrows, author of "What Baptists Believe," we suggest a concluding thought on this underlying principle of Protestantism:—

"God has given you, on the one hand, the Bible; and on the other, mind and conscience, and you are untrue to yourself, and to God's Word, if you do not use them in the investigation of truth. We never should hear from a disciple of Christ such utterance as, 'It does not matter what we believe on such subjects,' 'One way is as good as another.' It does matter, or the Lord would not have inspired his apostles to write for our instruction. One way is not as good as another. The only good way is that which God has revealed."

We inquire now, What position is occupied by the papacy with reference to the sufficiency of Holy Scriptures and the interpretation thereof? See the next issue of the SENTINEL.
