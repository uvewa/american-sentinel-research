PRESS dispatches state that "Great plans are being made for a wonderful ceremony in the Vatican, to begin on Christmas day of 1899," in which the pope will be a prominent figure, and which is intended to be the "grandest religious ceremony of the century." The papacy is preparing to make herself a conspicuous figure before the world in connection with the closing of the nineteenth century.
