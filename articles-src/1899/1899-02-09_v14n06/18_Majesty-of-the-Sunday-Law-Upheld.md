### THE WRITER OF AN ANONYMOUS LETTER CAUSES THE ARREST OF A MAN FOR SELLING A SHOESTRING.

"New York Press," January 30.

Not since the day that "Praise" Alden caused the arrest of Mrs. Gale in Salem Town for running with unseemly haste on the Sabbath day has there been a more zealous performance of duty than that of Detective Churchill of the East 126th Street Police Station, who yesterday brought before the bar of Magistrate Crane's Court Alexander Krein of No. 2186 Fifth Ave.

Churchill is a valiant, wide awake officer of the law. . . . So when he received an anonymous letter informing him that the Sunday law was being violated by Alexander Krein it did not take him two hours to make up his mind.

Without assuming any disguise or even arming himself, he went to Krein's little fancy goods shop yesterday and walked in as unconcernedly as though about to pay a social call.

"Good morning," he said, pleasantly, to the proprietor. "Feels like winter, doesn't it?"

"Yes," said Krein, "it is a cold day, sure enough. Wouldn't be surprised if we had a little snow."

Churchill's mind was working with lightning-like rapidity. His keen eye had taken in the contents of the show case at a glance. He noted the inflection of Krein's tone and marked the hidden meaning in the veiled wish for a little snow.

"Have you any shoe laces?" he asked, carelessly.

The great Vidocq himself could not have been more nonchalant. It was an admirable bit of acting.

"Yes," said Krein, "I have shoe laces."

"Let me have a pair," he said, as he threw a nickel on the counter. "Wrap them up, please."

The shoe laces were taken from the case, made into a compact little package and handed over. As the detective grasped them his manner changed. In an instant he was transformed from the innocent purchaser to the agent of the law. "You are my prisoner," he said, with the air of authority that was his alter ego. "Come!"

Krein was arraigned in the Harlem Court, charged with selling a pair of shoestrings on the seventh day of the week, commonly called Sunday. He was discharged.

Churchill was told that he had no right to pay attention to anonymous letters.
