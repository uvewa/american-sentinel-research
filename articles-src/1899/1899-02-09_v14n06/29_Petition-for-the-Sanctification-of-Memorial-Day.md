A MAINE journal says that the largest petition to be presented to the legislature of that State this winter is one for "the better observance of Memorial day." It is introduced by an official of the "Ladies' Aid Society," and has nearly 3,000 signatures. It provides that "Whoever on Memorial day, May 30, wilfully interrupts or disturbs any assembly or procession engaged in the observance of the day, whoever exhibits any show or play, or engages or aids in any horse race, gambling, baseball, or football game, dance, or other sports during said day or evening, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than thirty days, or by fine not exceeding $20, and not less than $15."

Let no one be surprised at an attempt to make Memorial day sacred by law. The sentiment which calls for such legislation is essentially the same as that which demands the legal sanctification of Sunday; and that sentiment, as any person knows, is common enough.
