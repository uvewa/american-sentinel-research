GENERAL MILES, the ranking officer in the army, has insisted on giving publicity to the charge that the American troops while engaged in the late campaign were given "embalmed" beef for rations; that is, canned beef treated with chemicals to preserve it from spoiling, and by that and its stale quality, rendered wholly unfit for food. The charge seems to be pretty well proven by facts that have been coming to light, as also the further statement that the beef trust in Chicago realized a profit on the deal of about $1,000,000. But for his attitude the Sun, of this city, charges General Miles with "downright treachery," and says that he deserves the "universal loathing of his countrymen." Certain it is, however, that publicity in every matter affecting the welfare of the nation, is a proper feature of republican government; and secrecy in such matters harmonizes with governmental despotism. It is not fitting for servants to conceal from the master what is the master's business; and in a republic the only master is the people.
