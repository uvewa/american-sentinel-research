THE expected clash between Americans and the natives in the Philippines has at last taken place, the Filipinos having attacked Manila, but without effect beyond the wounding of a few of the soldiers defending the place. The probable effect of this act will be to lessen opposition to the ratification of the treaty with Spain, and to inaugurate a campaign of conquest on the part of the American forces in the islands.
