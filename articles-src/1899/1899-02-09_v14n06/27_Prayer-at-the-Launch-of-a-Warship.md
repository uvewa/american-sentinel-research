THE cruiser "Albany," purchased by the Government before completion from an English company, was launched recently at Elswick, England. The account states that "Canon Nicholson read Psalm 57 and offered a special prayer, after which he recited the Lord's Prayer, the crowd with uncovered heads joining."

And thus does each nation assume an alliance with the Almighty for the purpose of fighting one another! What could be more absurd, and more deplorable?
