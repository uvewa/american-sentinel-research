When the Sunday laws of a State are invoked against only those violators of Sunday who conscientiously observe the seventh day, it is perfectly plain that the real offense for which these prisoners are prosecuted is not their desecration of Sunday, but their observance of the Sabbath. And it is precisely under such conditions that numerous prosecutions under the Sunday laws have been of late and are yet being conducted in Tennessee, Maryland, and other States of the American Union.
