THE Citizens' Temperance League and Christian Endeavor Society of Elizabeth, N. J., have begun a crusade against the Sunday saloons of that city, by the use of spies to discover and get evidence against all violators of the Sunday law. Public sentiment is to be awakened in favor of the movement by public meetings, at which the clergy will speak in support of the law, and denounce the laxity with which the laws relating to the closing of the saloons and the granting of licenses have been enforced.
