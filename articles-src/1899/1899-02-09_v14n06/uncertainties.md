# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, February 9, 1899 (v14n06)

## General Notes

The OCR source file was clean and generally legible. No significant reading difficulties were encountered.

## Specific Items

### Page 10, "The Church Has Never Gained Aught by Persecution" (article 20)
- **Issue:** The text appears to be set in ALL CAPS in the original, continuing into the next column in mixed case. The transition "A JUST AND humane policy" suggests the all-caps formatting was a display style in the original that ran across a column break.
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved the capitalization as it appears in the OCR (all-caps for first portion, then lowercase continuation), as this appears to reflect the original typographic treatment.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the abrupt capitalization shift is likely a column-break display artifact in the original print.

### Article 24, "The War of Principle — No. 16" — Author initials "F. E. B."
- **Issue:** The initials "F. E. B." at the end of this article do not match any known author in the project's known authors list.
- **Transcribed as:** Author short set to "FEB"; full author name not populated since unknown.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for initials as printed; identity of "F. E. B." is unknown.

### Page 6, "The Bible, Protestantism, and Papacy" — "Ps. 11:7, 8"
- **Issue:** The article cites "Ps. 11:7, 8" in reference to God doing everything "in truth and uprightness." This reference may be imprecise (Ps. 11:7 reads "For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness") — however, per project rules, the citation is preserved exactly as printed.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — text reproduced exactly as printed.

### Article 22, "Seriously Inconsistent" — "Phillipi" spelling
- **Issue:** The author spells "Philippi" as "Phillipi" (double-l). This is preserved exactly as printed per project rules; no [sic] added.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — preserved original spelling.

## Skipped Content
