According to the following from the *Pall Mall Gazette*, and which is reprinted in that thoroughly Catholic paper, the New York *Sun*, a very considerable income for the papal treasury is derived from the sale of papal "titles of nobility," which can be had from any person who is able to hand over the cash equivalent:—

"What the popes can, and do create, are counts of Rome. These nobles are not counts of the papal states, which no longer exist. They are, properly speaking, counts of the Vatican—Counts Palatine, nobles of the palace. The official title, indeed, is 'Count of the Apostolic Palace and of the Court of the Lateran.' The designation comes down from the time when the popes lived at St. John Lateran, and these Comites were, in actual fact, the 'companions' of the pontiff. It is another survival of those distant days that every bishop-assistant at the pontifical throne is created a count when he receives his court nomination. But it is in relation to laymen that these papal distinctions are most interesting. Originally, no doubt, as still is the case in theory, Vatican titles—and the pope grants everything from knighthoods to dukedoms—were conferred as rewards for good and faithful service to the church.

"In such cases it is the custom of the pope to confer these honors *motu proprio et sine pecunia*—without the payment of fees to the Vatican Chancery. But during the present century great numbers of papal titles have been created, and it is quite certain that the vast majority of them have not been accorded *sine pecunia*. The granting of them, indeed, has come to be regarded as a regular and legitimate source of income to the Holy See; and it would appear that it is no longer necessary to be a Roman Catholic or even, for the matter of that, a Christian at all to become a noble of the Apostolic Palace and of the Court of the Lateran. According to the tariff of a foreign 'nobility agent,' which was issued a few years ago, the title of prince could at that time be had for £3,000; a dukedom cost £2,000, while £1,000 would buy a countship, and £800 a barony. We need hardly say that we do not vouch for these figures.

"It has often been denied that the Vatican sells titles; and, technically speaking, it of course does not. The money paid is not in return for the distinction; it passes in the guise of fees for making out and sealing the patent, and so on—fees which even an English peer or baronet has to pay. Nor does the pope stand alone in covering up transactions of this kind under pleasant fictions. Italy and Portugal do the same, to say nothing of the accommodating little republic of Andorra, which recently ennobled an American because he made an allowance of £100 a year to the national library. It is in France that papal titles find their readiest sale, which is not surprising, seeing that they are borne by many Frenchmen of position and real distinction. Indeed, it is almost traditional that every French ambassador to the court of the Vatican should be created a count by the pope, and it is only a few months since the customary distinction was conferred upon M. Poubelle. It would be ill-bred to refuse—almost as impossible, indeed, as it would be for a French president to decline the honorary canonry of St. John Lateran. M. Loubet, like his predecessors, is, indeed, already a canon of the Lateran."
