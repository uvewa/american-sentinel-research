From the following press statement it is made clear how the Government, while bound by obligations imposed both at home and abroad to give no official recognition to the papacy, will disregard the spirit of this obligation while carefully adhering to the letter:—

"WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.—The dispatch from Rome to the Journal this morning announcing that the pope would soon open negotiations with the United States Government, with a view to regulating the position of the Catholics in the Philippines, was read with much interest by officials of the State Department.

"The pope has no diplomatic or political status that is recognized by this Government, and anything that he may do will be considered as the work of 'a distinguished foreigner,' laboring in behalf of a community which he may think needs his services.

"Under the Constitution of the United States this Government could not receive a delegate from the pope clothed with powers to negotiate a treaty or do an act connected with affairs of state. Italy several years ago served notice on this Government that if the temporal power of the pope was recognized she would withdraw her diplomatic agents and sever all relations with the United States.

"Archbishop Ireland, Cardinal Gibbons, or Archbishop Chappelle, who is looking after the interests of the Catholics in Porto Rico and Cuba, may present the views of the pope to the Government, and those views will be respectfully received and careful attention will be given them. If the communication contains anything that may guide or assist this Government in dealing with a troublesome question, the suggestions will be acted upon and the recommendations may be carried out. But in no event can these suggestions be accepted as negotiations.

"If, says the State Department, as a distinguished individual, the pontiff of the Catholic Church can suggest a means through which the followers of Aguinaldo can be brought into submission under a pledge that religious tolerance and the fullest possible measure of human liberty will be given them, this Government will be glad to receive his views.

"It is believed here that if Archbishop Ireland is not in this country to present in person the apostolic views to the President as he has done in the past, Cardinal Gibbons will act as the papal representative.

"It is well known that President McKinley highly esteems the pope and respects his suggestions, and that a proposition from the holy see, while not 'regular' in a diplomatic sense, will, for that reason, go directly to the President and receive immediate and careful attention."
