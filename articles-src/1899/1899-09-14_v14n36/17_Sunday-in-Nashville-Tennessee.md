The question of Sunday closing of saloons has been agitating the city of Nashville somewhat of late. It is a phase of the Sunday question that seems to have periodical appearances, dropping out of sight after having brought forth a number of communications in the papers, calling attention to the open saloons and urging an enforcement of the law. A few orders come from the chief of police to the policemen to see that every saloon door is closed; a few arrests and fines follow, and a general rejoicing at the growing morality of the city. The saloon-keepers seem to know it is only ephemeral, so do not have much to say but pay a fine or two, keep closed as long as there is a policeman stationed at each door, and keep open house when the matter is quiet, which it generally becomes in three or four weeks. At present the matter is rather quiet.
