"New York under Tammany Rule" is the title of an informing article which Frank Moss, counsel for the Mazet Investigating Committee, has written for The Saturday Evening Post, of Philadelphia. After summarizing the notorious methods of Tammany rule, whereby the leaders enrich themselves at the expense of the taxpayer, and run the City of New York as "wide-open" as any Western mining town, Mr. Moss accounts for the helplessness of the law-abiding majority and suggests a means for the overthrow of the Croker régime.

This article is one of a series dealing with the municipal affairs of great American cities. It will appear in The Saturday Evening Post, of September 9.
