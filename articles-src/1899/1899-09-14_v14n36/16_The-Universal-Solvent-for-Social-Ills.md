THE universal solvent for social ills and wrongs is liberty. For liberty is the firstfruit of Christianity and of the law which bids us love our neighbor as ourselves. We must apply the law of equal liberty, granting them just what we grant ourselves, to union men and to scabs; to immigrants and to native-born; to Christians and to Jews; to Caucasians and to Chinese; to white men and to negroes. Liberty is the universal solvent; but how unwilling are Christians to grant it to Jews, native-born to immigrants, white men to yellow and black. Yet there is no other solvent. Anything less means bitter conflict in a developing State.—*N. Y. Independent.*
