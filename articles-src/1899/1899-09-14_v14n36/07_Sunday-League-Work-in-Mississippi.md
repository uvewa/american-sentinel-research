The Sunday-law advocates seem to be making Mississippi their special field of operations at the present time. They have already got their "stakes set" and are getting their ropes ready to "scoop us all in." I am informed by the president of the Sunday League of Columbus, that auxiliary Sunday leagues have been formed in every county of the State, acting under the direction of State officers of the Sunday League of America, an incorporated body having its headquarters at Columbus, Ohio, with general manager's office in Atlanta, Ga. They are planning to work on the legislature of the State to secure a more stringent Sunday law.

"We insist," they say in their Sunday reform leaflets, "that the Sunday labor must be reduced to the minimum of real mercy and necessity."

In enumerating the open foes of their movement, they mention "first, Sabbatizers, a small, compact, conscientious group of mistaken men, who put the Jews' day in the place of the Lord's day." Second, "Indifferentists, who care for none of those things but whose contempt of silence, arrays them against Christ and his day." The third class are those who "plead for personal liberty."

In answer to the question, "By what methods shall we meet these?" they answer:

1. By legal methods . . . we can and should demand that the Sunday laws on the statute books be enforced. We can and should bring our influence as citizens united on the main issue, if possible, to bear upon our legislators and executives. . . . We can and should agitate and petition, petition and agitate—Yes, watch, fight, pray.

2. By reform methods—mass-meetings, organizations, tracts, essays, and books to be scattered broadcast. A half holiday Saturday should be insisted upon as a social vent—a necessity, a preparation for the Sabbath.

3. Church methods—If the Sabbath is lost, the citadel of the church is captured. . . . Every denomination should be a separate fort with guns loaded and manned. In council, congress, conference, convention, synod, assembly, resolutions should be passed."

I have called on two of the ministers of this place and found considerable quantities of Sunday League literature on hand for free distribution. One of the ministers said, "The nation is to be seeded down with them." "This is a Christian nation," said he. "That question has been decided by the judge of the Supreme Court."

So according to this we are to have the spectacle of a "Christian nation" enforcing a religious observance by law upon a conscientious group of men and a liberty-loving people at home, and subjugating the heathen abroad by means of the destructive engines of modern warfare.

Truly this is not the Christianity of the Christ of Calvary, who said, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not;" and who also said to Peter, "Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."

I recently heard an advocate of national religion say, "Better have a bad God than no God." None but Christ of Calvary for me.
