A speech delivered by Emperor William at a gala banquet, at Strassburg, September 5, gave this plain statement of the condition of the church under an alliance with the state:—

"Before all, however, I would impress upon the church dignitaries, who exert such a powerful influence over our people, the duty of striving in their work and of using their personal influence so that regard for the crown and confidence in the government may become ever and ever stronger. For, in these agitated times, when the spirit of unbelief is rampant, the church's only hold is the imperial hand and the escutcheon of the German empire; and I think, if I read the hearts of the Strassburgers aright, that the enthusiastic reception accorded me is in some measure due to the impression made upon the inhabitants of this beautiful old city by the splendid appearance of the armed sons of this country, renewing their confidence that under the shadow of the wings of the German eagle, the Reichsland is secured against all dangers."

Under such an alliance, in America as in Germany, the church would depend upon the state, and her "only hold" would be the "imperial hand and escutcheon" of the state. But the only hold the church needs or ought to have is the arm of Omnipotence.
