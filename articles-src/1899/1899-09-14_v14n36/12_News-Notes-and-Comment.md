A CORRESPONDENT inquires why, if the Sabbath always falls on the seventh day of the week, the day of the resurrection of Christ must not always fall on the first day of the week, since the resurrection day was the day following the Sabbath. This is really a silly question; yet anyone is to be excused for asking it in view of the fact, astounding though it is, that almost throughout Christendom it is actually believed that the first day of the week is always the day of Christ's resurrection.

* * *

The resurrection of Christ was an event which in A. D. 31 took place on the first day of the week. That day was marked by that event; other days are marked by other events. Taking any particular day so marked, how often does that day recur? Does it recur every week? or every year? Anyone who will claim that the occurrence of any event calls for a weekly celebration of that occurrence, will make himself a laughing stock wherever he goes. If you doubt it try it. Go out and advocate that the signing of the Declaration of Independence ought to be celebrated every week, instead of but once a year; for that event marked a day of the week just as truly as did the resurrection of Christ; and every reason for a weekly celebration in the one case will hold good in the other. And so of any other event that may be cited.

* * *

The resurrection of Christ, while necessarily occurring on a day of the week, did not and could not have any relation to the week. It could no more be connected with the week than could the birth of Christ, or the birth of anybody. A weekly birthday is just as sensible an idea as is a weekly Sabbath based on Christ's resurrection. The day of Christ's resurrection recurs once a year, as does the day of one's birth or death; and in a period of seven or eight years will necessarily cover the entire week, falling on each of the seven days successively. And the orthodox world recognizes that the resurrection day is a yearly day, by the yearly celebration of Easter. But as it would not do to have Easter, the day of the resurrection, fall on any other day than Sunday—as in that case the fraud of the whole thing would be too palpable—it is fixed by the church calendar doctors so that it falls always on Sunday; and we have the wonderful spectacle of the (supposed) day of the year on which Christ rose, falling always on the same day of the week! Even the impossible is called in to pay tribute to Sunday!

* * *

It is worth noting further that to the resurrection of Christ the language of the second psalm applies: "Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten thee." See Acts 13:33. So that Jesus Christ, the Christ of to-day, was really begotten on the day of his resurrection, and that day is in the true sense of Scripture, his birthday. So that if Christ can have a weekly birthday, there may be some propriety in a weekly celebration of the day; otherwise there can be none at all.

* * *

AND from all this it is evident that there can be no sensible reason for Sabbath observance other than that assigned by the Creator and Lord of the Sabbath in the fourth commandment: "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work; . . . for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." That made the week; and the seventh day, the Sabbath of the Lord, was necessarily the seventh day of the week.

THE annexation sentiment appears to be fast overshadowing the desire for independence in Cuba. A press correspondent, writing from Havana, says that a few weeks ago it was considered almost treason on the part of a Cuban to say he was in favor of annexation, but now it is said and spoken about by Cubans in clubs, in cafés, in the parks and squares, and on the streets. This is especially noticeable among merchants, brokers, bankers, clerks, and professional men.

* * *

The press is growing pro-annexation very rapidly. About two months ago a paper was started in Porto Principe, devoted entirely and exclusively to the cause of those favoring annexation. Another one comes out in Havana this month, and another in Santiago. These papers are backed by influential persons, and the announced cause for their existence is the education of the people in favor of annexation.

IN this world a fraud and humbug often finds a host of credulous supporters, while a genuine good thing goes begging. Witness the Westinghouse air-brake, which is now to be extensively used in Russia and other countries of Europe, and the "Keely motor." While Westinghouse was trying to borrow money in Philadelphia to get on his feet with his inventions, and meeting with little success, Mr. Keely was getting funds by the hundred thousand out of Philadelphians for his mysterious, intangible, humbug "force."

One result of the labors of Father Chiniquy, the ex-priest, in the cause of Protestantism, is now seen in Canada, where four Catholic priests have lately put themselves in communication with Protestant pastors in Montreal, desiring to be instructed in Protestant doctrine. There is a visible restlessness among the French Catholic clergy. Father Chiniquy's steadfast adherence to the Protestant faith up to his death, says *The Presbyterian Review*, "has evidently made a deep impression. A very different issue was confidently expected."

One Marshall O. Waggoner, of some prominence erstwhile in "freethought" ranks in Ohio, having now renounced his atheistic views and joined a church, *The Truth Seeker* (atheist) comes forward and declares that Mr. Waggoner was never any good anyhow; that he always represented "rampant emotionalism," absence of logic, and "stupidity," was always a braggart, shallow-brained, discourteous, etc. This is what, coming from a religious journal against one who had renounced Christianity, would be called by *The Truth Seeker* an exhibition of religious spite and intolerance. We allude to it only by way of observing that the anti-Christian spirit outside the church is precisely the same that it is when found within it.

The well known English nonconformist clergyman, F. B. Meyer, says with reference to the result of the archbishops' decision against Romanist ceremonies in the Church of England:—

"If the ritualist party does not acquiesce, disestablishment will come inside of a decade. Think of that, and see if you can understand the tremendous issues involved. The ritualists may give in and so save the establishment. Although on the outside, I have some inside sources of information, and I cannot help believing the ritualists will make the best of it and obey. The next three months will tell. Watch affairs for that length of time. The enormous issues involved warrant your thought and attention, even if you are the busiest people on the globe."

Hatred of Mormonism in the South brought about a very unusual spectacle at Johnson Springs, Va., September 4. A man who had murderously assaulted a Mormon elder was on trial for the offense in a regular court of justice, when an armed mob of about two hundred men appeared and took charge of court, sheriffs, and prisoner, released the latter, and compelled the Mormon elder to withdraw the prosecution and promise to leave the country under a threat of lynching. It is seldom that mob rule goes so far as to "hold up" justice in its appointed sanctuary,—the courts of law. The significance of such an incident is altogether on the wrong side.

A good idea of what is at the bottom of England's extraordinary interest in the affairs of the Boer republic, may be had from these two statements made by eminent Englishmen of South Africa. Sir Alfred Milner, when asked what would be his policy regarding the Transvaal, said: "If you saw a solid pile of gold worth five hundred millions sterling over there with 20,000 Boers armed to the teeth sitting upon it, what would you do?" The other statement is this by Mr. Lionel Phillips, a Rand millionaire: "We don't care about the franchise; we want the mines."

German Catholics of Newark (N. J.) diocese, recently, at their fifth annual convention, passed a resolution declaring that in case of war between the United States and Germany, they would enlist under the banner of the former.

Roman Catholic church property in the United States, as is well known, is mostly held in the names of the priests and prelates. In Wisconsin, recently, a supreme court decision declared that property thus held by Archbishop Katzer, of Milwaukee, was subject to taxation. To escape paying the tax, the archbishop transferred all the property to the Consultors of the Diocese, who became an incorporated body. The same course, it is said, is to be followed by the church in Michigan.

The synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, held at Denver, Col., some weeks ago, adopted resolutions calling for such a change in the national Constitution as will make it embody "a clear and explicit acknowledgment of Almighty God as the source of all power, of Jesus Christ as the prince of kings of the earth, and the Bible as the supreme rule in all affairs." The country's financial troubles were declared to be due to the fact that the supreme power of God was not acknowledged in our Constitution.

Pre-EMPTED.—"Found!" cried the explorer as the North Pole hove in sight. "I annex this district in the name of my gracious sovereign." "Too late," murmured a native laconically. "All this district is under the control of the Ice Trust."—*Philadelphia North American.*
