The Outlook, of this city, says:—

"Last week the news reached this country of a renewed attack by the czar's government upon the Lutheran churches in Finland and in the Baltic provinces. The pretext for this attack is that, under the cloak of religion, Lutheran clergy in Finland and Livonia are favoring the spread of Pan-Germanic sentiments. . . . A number of recent conversions from the Russian Orthodox Church to the Protestant faith have inspired a cry of alarm in the clerical and reactionary press. As a result, the Lutheran theological seminaries, which a few years ago had been allowed to be open in St. Petersburg, have now been closed.

"Coincidentally with this, some German and Polish Jews, residents at St. Petersburg, have been ordered to leave that city within thirty days. If the czar has hardened his heart towards Lutherans, Finns, Jews, and Mennonites, the sudden death of his brother seems to have caused some change, for the moment at least, in his attitude towards the Protestants known as the Molokani. This sect is found in far eastern Russia. The organization consists of presbyterial congregations. The Molokani are total abstainers from liquor, and have the reputation of being wonderfully familiar with the Bible. They are extremely reserved in manner. When the czar's brother, the czarowitz, was attacked by hemorrhage while taking a bicycle ride in the Caucasus, a poor Molokani woman found him, helped him to her house, and nursed him during his few remaining hours of life. In recognition of this, the czar has issued a public manifesto, not only thanking the woman for her services, but also offering his grateful acknowledgments to the entire Molokani sect."
