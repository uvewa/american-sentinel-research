To set up a colonial system is to be ready to trade peace for war, to surrender serenity and security for a state of armed anxiety and weakening incertitude. It is to mix up in alien quarrels, which we have deprecated always, and with special emphasis of late, at precisely the time when, by all indications they are about to culminate in the most colossal and destructive war of modern times.

Not long ago at the Lord Mayor's banquet in London, Lord Salisbury declared that the advent of the United States into Old World diplomacy would strengthen England, but his lordship added that he was sorry that in his opinion it did not improve the prospects of peace. The sensitive storm center is in the East, and into the very midst of it we shall be led by this policy.—Chas. A. Towne.
