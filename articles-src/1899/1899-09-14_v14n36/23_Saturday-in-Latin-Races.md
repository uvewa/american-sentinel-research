Saturday in all the Latin races is the Sabbath; indeed, the French Samedi is a corruption of Sabbati dies. As is well known, the early church observed the Sabbath as well as the "Lord's day," and it was not till the end of the fourth or fifth centuries that both Saturday and Sunday ceased to be observed together with strictness as holy days.—*The Examiner* (Baptist).
