The following resolutions passed at a recent convention in Chicago, voicing the sentiment of several millions of American citizens, outweigh in point of truth all the grandiloquent talk that was ever uttered about America's "war of humanity" and benevolent mission to confer liberty and other blessings on a dark-skinned race across the sea:—

"Resolved, That it is the duty of the United States Government to see to it that its citizens are not deprived of life and liberty without due process of law, and we solemnly demand such national and constitutional legislation as shall at least guarantee to American citizens as great protection from mob violence as is given citizens of foreign birth resident here.

"The widespread crime of lynching persons accused of law-breaking is an offense against civilization which demands punishment; and we believe it lies in the power of Congress to provide such repressive legislation as shall prevent justice in America from becoming a byword and a mockery."
