The agitation of the Sunday observance question in England, growing out of the attempt of two London dailies to publish Sunday editions, has called out an article on the subject from a Jesuit, published in the Nineteenth Century. In this the Catholic view of proper Sunday observance is authoritatively stated, thus:—

"It was by public worship in the church, offered to God especially at the parish mass, in the service of early matins, and at afternoon vespers, that the day was to be sanctified. With the discharge of this duty no amusement could be permitted to interfere; but if this were fulfilled the canonists dealt indulgently with all other reasonable employment. . . . The praise of God must occupy the first place, but, that being secured, the church thought next of man's physical and moral well-being—rest of body, peace of soul, and all that makes for charity and good will between class and class."
