"RENDER therefore unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things which are God's." This divine principle of religious liberty as laid down by the Lord is such as distinctly and forever shuts out all thought of a union of Christian principles and politics.

It has been Satan's studied effort to counterfeit God's work. He saw in the theocracy of Israel an admirable plan by which he could cause man to forget God, cause man to deny God, and take the position which he, himself, took in the beginning and which caused his expulsion from the courts of heaven. Behold the man-made theocracy of the papacy, whose head "opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."

This was the desire and purpose of Lucifer in his revolt in heaven. For was it not religious politics? and was it not religious warfare? Was not the question canvassed in heaven before the angels could take sides and vote upon the question of Lucifer's humility or arrogance? Lucifer's desire was to occupy a position which by nature he was unqualified to fill, and with covetous heart he became vain in his imaginations, and said, "I will ascend into heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High." These were some of the planks of the platform of the first religious party, and afford a lesson in religious politics.

As the angels departed from the principles of religious freedom and sacrificed principle, they lost their estate—lost the respect of all loyal intelligences of the universe of God; and in the great day of God, he will mete to them judgment commensurate with their deeds.

The papacy followed along this line, being a man-made theocracy, a combination of religion with the state. The papacy is the complete representation of the result of men's endeavors to unite religion and the state, to mix religion and politics. This is what grew out of dabbling in politics on the part of the representatives of Christ, and the spirit of it was the spirit of the father of religion in politics,—the spirit of Lucifer contending for the supremacy in heaven.

From its very nature politics can only conduce to strife; it always did and always will. Human agencies are not divine; and as divinity is not back of the alliance of religion with politics, nothing but strife will come of it. When the church enters the arena of politics, she will of necessity partake of the spirit of politics, and there will be contention and strife until the finish. Lucifer contended until cast out; so likewise will it be with all who contend against God. The political spirit in the church is foreign to the spirit of Christ; it never made converts to God, and it never will. It always made hypocrites and infidels, and it always will. It caused war in heaven at the beginning; it caused bloodshed on earth, and always will. It was antichristian in the beginning; it was antichristian in the papacy, as history plainly shows; and it is antichristian to-day.

Those who would unite politics with religion and form a new theocracy, partake of this spirit; and in the "National Reform" movement of to-day can be seen the intolerant spirit of the predecessors of these false teachers. In this religio-political movement can be seen the kindling fires of persecution. Already we see those who for their faith are ready to sacrifice home, liberty, and even life, if necessary, to hold up the banner of Prince Immanuel.
