The determination of the church of Rome to govern in temporal as well as in spiritual matters is no less pronounced to-day than it was a century ago. Evidence of this is seen on all sides, but especially in France, Italy and the several South American countries. Wherever an attempt has been made to restrict the priests to the exercise of their sacerdotal functions, the "Holy Mother Church" has become an enemy of the government and a fomenter of revolution. In France she is to-day the ally of the royalists, in Italy the advocate of republican principles, while in Ecuador she threatens to close the churches altogether unless the restrictive laws against the ecclesiastics, recently passed by the Congress, are repealed.

In all these countries the people, although there are many grievances to be righted, seem to be loyal to the government. In Ecuador this loyalty has enabled the government to suppress two formidable insurrections instigated by the clericals and their partisans. What the effect will be if the priests carry out their threat of closing the churches it is difficult to predict. Up to the present time they have been unable to intimidate the government, although they have caused some dissensions and official resignations. It is patent, however, that the people are becoming growingly dissatisfied with priestly domination in temporal concerns, the recent prediction of the archbishop of Durango, Mexico, to the contrary notwithstanding. One thing is certain: the power of Rome in temporal affairs in all Latin countries is waning.
