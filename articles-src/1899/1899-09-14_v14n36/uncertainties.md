## Article Splitting Decisions

### "Lessons from the Past" (08)
- **Issue:** Dateline "Argentine Republic." at end — treated as location of the contributor (John M'Carthy), not a separate element.
- **Decision:** Retained in body of article as the contributor's location. Author listed as explicit attribution via "BY JOHN M'CARTHY." byline.

### "Religious Persecution of the Finns" (15)
- **Issue:** Opening sentence in OCR reads: "THE case of the Finnish people, who are now being made the victims of religious by intolerance the Russian Greek Church" — word order appears garbled ("religious by intolerance"). This is likely an OCR artifact from a bracket or introductory note in the original.
- **Second pass:** The OCR shows square brackets around the opening clause: `[THE case of the Finnish people... as follows:—]`. This appears to be an editorial introduction in the original, set apart typographically.
- **Decision:** Preserved in transcription with brackets as found. The rest of the article is a reprint from The Examiner (Baptist) as stated in the introductory clause.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the garbled word order "religious by intolerance" may be an OCR error for "religious intolerance by"; preserved as-is since the bracket context suggests this was an editorial note in the original.

### News, Notes and Comment (12)
- **Issue:** The section uses alternating bullet separators: `* * *` and `• • •`. Both appear in the OCR and have been preserved.
- **Decision:** Combined into a single article file as is standard for this recurring section.

### Short Quotations (articles 09, 16, 22, 23, 24, 27)
- **Decision:** Each standalone attributed quotation was given its own file per the instruction that every article gets its own file. These are brief but substantive items.

### Author "R. S. Owen" (article 07)
- **Issue:** Author initials "RSO" not in the known authors list.
- **Decision:** Created new initials RSO for R. S. Owen; flagged for addition to known authors list.

### Author "H. S. Peters" (article 10)
- **Issue:** Author initials "HSP" not in the known authors list.
- **Decision:** Created new initials HSP for H. S. Peters; flagged for addition to known authors list.

### Author "L. A. Hansen" (article 17)
- **Issue:** Author initials "LAH" not in the known authors list.
- **Decision:** Created new initials LAH for L. A. Hansen; flagged for addition to known authors list.

### Author "John M'Carthy" (article 08)
- **Issue:** Author initials "JMC" not in the known authors list. Note the apostrophe in "M'Carthy" (Irish form of McCarthy).
- **Decision:** Preserved "M'Carthy" spelling exactly as printed. Created new initials JMC; flagged for addition to known authors list.

### "Papal Titles for Sale" attribution (article 13)
- **Issue:** The article is introduced as being from the *Pall Mall Gazette* reprinted in the New York *Sun*. The Sentinel is reprinting from the Sun's reprint.
- **Decision:** Used `original_publication: "Pall Mall Gazette"` as the ultimate source since that is named in the text. Editorial framing belongs to the Sentinel.

### "Thomas Jefferson" quote (article 22)
- **Issue:** This appears as a standalone attributed quotation without a titled heading in the original. A descriptive title was created.
- **Decision:** Treated as a reprint with `original_publication: "Thomas Jefferson"` since it is a direct quotation attributed to Jefferson, not a Sentinel editorial note.

### "Chas. A. Towne" quote (article 27)
- **Issue:** This appears as a standalone attributed quotation on page 12 without a titled heading in the original. The quotation is signed "—Chas. A. Towne."
- **Decision:** Treated as a reprint with `original_publication: "Chas. A. Towne"`. A descriptive title was created.

### Editorial attribution (articles 01 and 26)
- **Issue:** The opening editorial notes (p. 1) and the editorial column (p. 16) are unsigned but are consistent with ATJ editorial style for this period.
- **Decision:** Both filed as `attribution: "editorial"` per standard practice. No author field added.
