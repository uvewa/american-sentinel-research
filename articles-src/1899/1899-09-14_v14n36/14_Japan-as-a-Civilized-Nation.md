On the 17th of July last, Japan was formally admitted to the family of civilized nations. A Berlin paper, commenting on the occurrence, says: "Europe has never before admitted a 'heathen' nation to equality, and it is no use trying to hide the fact that Japan would never have been admitted 'into the family' if she had not developed such uncommon energy. Her position has been gained by her own efforts."

And the most conspicuous feature of Japan's "uncommon energy" is represented in her present efficiency as a military power. It is but a few years since Japan astonished the world by a successful attack upon the giant empire of China, executed with a skill worthy of the most efficient commanders in any country, and with a ready use of the most efficient military weapons. And Japan has ever since been pushing rapidly to the front as a military power. A Canadian journal, *The Times*, says on this point:—

"Japan has now a navy afloat and in preparation for early launching that places it among the leading naval powers of the globe, and the quality of the Japanese as fighting men was well tested in the late war with China; they are bold and dashing fighters, fine tacticians, good gunners."

With all this in view, an alliance with Japan has been counted as an advantage not to be overlooked by any one of the civilized powers. English journals have been very outspoken upon this point, and it is not considered a safe thing to shut English ports against the Japanese, as they are shut against China. "China's feebleness and ignorance," says the London, Ontario, *Advertiser*, "merely happen to spare us the unpleasant consequences that might arise if we treated a more sensitive and powerful nation in the same way."

Japan is treated like a civilized nation because she has become a powerful nation. Japan is not a Christian nation, even in profession; yet she is now recognized as on an equality with any civilized nation of the earth. It is not Christianity, or a profession of it, that wins her this respect from civilization; it is force.

Power—fighting power—is respected and even reverenced in the civilized world to-day. It is the possession of this that puts a people on an equality with those of civilized lands; that makes them reckoned as civilized in the world. Modern civilization and fighting ability are expressions altogether too nearly synonymous in meaning.
