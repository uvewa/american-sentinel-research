## Article: "A Dreadful Harvest." (11_A-Dreadful-Harvest.md)

- **Issue:** The article ends abruptly mid-sentence: "And so his"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Context:** This is an extract reprinted from the Signs of the Times. The OCR source ends at this point (bottom of a page with illustrations). The original continuation was likely cut off by a page-layout image block or the extract itself was printed incompletely in the issue.
- **Transcribed as:** Reproduced the text exactly as it appears in the OCR source, including the incomplete final sentence.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for text transcribed; LOW for completeness — the article is clearly cut off.
- **Reason:** Two image placeholders appear immediately after the truncated sentence in the OCR source, suggesting the remainder was below or behind an illustration block that the OCR did not capture, or the printed extract itself ended there with a continued-on-next-issue reference that is not visible.

## Article: "Not the Spirit of St. Paul." (28_Not-the-Spirit-of-St-Paul.md)

- **Issue:** The article appears to have a missing portion bridging pages 10 and 11. On page 10 (OCR), the text ends: "It seems as though the spirit of these ministerial gatherings is far removed from that of Paul, who said" — and then the article continues on page 11 with what appears to be mid-sentence: "Peter, Paul, and others of their time, but not a single funny thing appears..."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — confirmed the gap exists in the OCR source between pages 10 and 11.
- **Transcribed as:** Both fragments joined as they appear, preserving the evident lacuna. The text between "who said" and "Peter, Paul" is missing from the OCR; likely a column or portion of text between the two page scans was not captured.
- **Confidence:** LOW for completeness of this article; the passage as it stands is syntactically incomplete.
- **Reason:** The OCR likely missed a portion of text that appeared at the bottom of page 10 or top of page 11 — possibly the quote from Paul (e.g., "I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ...") which would complete the sentence "who said [quote]" before continuing with "Peter, Paul, and others..."

## Attribution: "Political Christianity" (08_Political-Christianity.md)

- **Issue:** The article is credited "BY ROYAL HUBBELL" and is dateline "Canon City, Col." — Royal Hubbell is not in the known authors list. Author initials "RH" assigned.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit in the original.

---

## Attribution: "Faith vs. Force" (09_Faith-vs-Force.md)

- **Issue:** The article is credited "BY H. F. PHELPS" — not in the known authors list. Author initials "HFP" assigned.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit in the original.

## Article: "The Philippine Policy in the Light of the Golden Rule." (30_The-Philippine-Policy-in-the-Light-of-the-Golden-Rule.md)

- **Issue:** Three separate items follow the main Carl Schurz extract on the same page with no `---` divider in the OCR: (1) the French Jesuit conspiracies dispatch, (2) the Sunday-observing missionaries in Central Africa note, and (3) the Pension Commissioner Evans note. These appear to be distinct editorial short items grouped on the same page.
- **Transcribed as:** Included all three in the same file since they followed without a clear separator after the main Schurz article block.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the grouping may be somewhat arbitrary; ideally the French dispatch, the missionary note, and the pensions note would each be their own file, but the OCR source presents them without dividers on the same page as the Schurz reprint.
