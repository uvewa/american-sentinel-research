Greatly as the peace of the world is endangered by the standing armies of the various nations, each country is in greater danger from its own military force than is any other. The Catholic Times truly says: "There are few thinking men in Europe to-day who hesitate to acknowledge that the growth of armed forces is becoming a serious menace to the permanence of civil and religious liberty." More nations have fallen before their own armies than before the armies of their outside enemies.—London Present Truth.
