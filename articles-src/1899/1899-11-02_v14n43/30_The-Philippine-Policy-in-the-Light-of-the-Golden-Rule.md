*From address by Carl Schurz, at Chicago Anti-Imperialist Convention.*

Imagine that in our revolutionary times France, being at war with England, had brought to this country a fleet and an army, and had, without any definite compact to that effect, co-operated as an ally with our revolutionary forces, permitting all the while the Americans to believe that she did this without any mercenary motive, and that, in case of victory, the American colonies would be free and independent. Imagine then that, after the British surrender at Yorktown, the King of France had extorted from the British King a treaty ceding, for a consideration of $20,000,000, the sovereignty over the American colonies to France, and that thereupon the King of France had coolly notified the Continental Congress and General Washington that they had to give up their idea of national independence and to surrender unconditionally to the sovereignty of France, wherefor the French King promised them "benevolent assimilation."

Imagine, further, that upon the protest of the Americans that Great Britain, having lost everything in the colonies except New York City and a few other little posts, had no sovereignty to cede, the French King answered that he had bought the Americans at $5 a head, and that if they refused to submit he would give them benevolent assimilation in the shape of bullets. Can there be any doubt that the Continental Congress and General Washington would have retorted that no matter what the French King might have bought, Great Britain had no sovereignty left to sell; that least of all the Americans would permit themselves to be sold; that the French, in so treating their American allies after such high sounding professions of friendship and generosity, were a lot of mean, treacherous, contemptible hypocrites, and that the Americans would rather die than submit to such wolves in sheep's clothing.

And will any patriotic American now deny that, whatever quibbles of international law about possible cessions of a lost sovereignty might be invented, such conduct of the French would have been simply a shame, and the Americans of that time would have eternally disgraced themselves if they had failed to resist unto death? How, then, can the same patriotic American demand that the Filipinos should surrender and accept American sovereignty under circumstances exactly parallel? And that parallel will not be shaken by any learned international law technicalities, which do not touch the moral element of the subject.

The imperialist organs and orators are chorusing the declaration that "the President is just as much bound to quell an insurrection or rebellion in Luzon as in Massachusetts or Pennsylvania." How can there be a "rebellion" where there are neither citizens nor subjects? How can there be an "insurrection" where there is no allegiance? The people of Massachusetts acknowledge citizenship in and allegiance to the United States. They are living under laws which they helped to make. They pay taxes which they helped to vote and of which they receive the benefit. The flag is their flag. The army is their army. Can the same be truly said of the Filipinos, who have a government and flag and allegiance of their own, and who have never ratified nor recognized their sale by Spain?—N. Y. World.

A cable dispatch dated at Paris, October 22, gives information that the French government has recognized the necessity of taking energetic measures against Jesuit conspiracies:—

"M. Millerand, Minister of Commerce, and M. Baudin, Minister of Public Works, the Socialist members of the Cabinet, made speeches at Ivry to-day, in which they declared that the government was determined to proceed energetically to enforce the laws against religious congregations, especially the Jesuits. M. Baudin was particularly violent in his denunciations of the congregations, declaring that they were at the bottom of the Royalist conspiracy and that they were a veritable danger to the maintenance of the republic."

SUNDAY-OBSERVING missionaries in Central Africa, writes a missionary from that district, a Seventh-day Baptist, "have never let the natives know that Sunday is the first day. They all teach that it is the seventh day; hence they are all on pins and needles as to what course I shall take."

And this is a plain confession on their part that they know very well that the seventh day is the Sabbath of Scripture, and that these simple-minded natives, guided by Scripture statements on the subject, would never think of keeping the first day of the week.

PENSION COMMISSIONER EVANS says that his bureau has on file 20,000 applications for pensions arising from the Spanish war,—a number which implies that more than half the total American forces engaged in that brief campaign were killed, wounded, or disabled. This of course is a palpable fraud.
