Satan has always tried to subvert, and pervert the works and purposes of God. The power and the wisdom through which Satan does his hellish work is all from God. But he perverts that power and wisdom from their original purpose. Ever since the entry of sin into this world, man has proved himself to be a successful agent of Satan in carrying out his perverted ideas.

This success has been manifest through all the ages in the perversion of God's power in man, as he has dominated his fellowman in matters of conscience. The first instance of this kind was at the very gates of Eden. It was over a question of the observance of a religious institution, too. And murder was the result of this first attempt of one man in the domination of the will of another man. Indeed, murder is in the very spirit of domination. For when one man attempts to dominate the will of another, he can only become enraged at his defeat, and he soon becomes like a fiend incarnate.

When man sinned, he was driven from the bright realities of Eden into the realm of shadows. Until the coming of the Deliverer, man must deal with types and shadows. The first dispute over questions of religion, and the first attempt to dominate the conscience, was between two brothers. The question involved obedience or disobedience to God: "Without the shedding of blood, is no remission." They were to offer the firstlings of the flock, thus showing their faith in the promised Saviour. They were also to bring of the first fruits of the earth as a thank-offering to God.

Abel obeyed God. But Cain, filled with the spirit of infidelity, though admonished by his brother of the importance of obedience to the exact command of God, expressed no penitence for sin in his gift.

Abel acknowledged his guilt, and came in faith. Cain came in his own merits. The offering of Abel was an act of faith. The offering of Cain was that of legalism,—depending upon his works. His was a legal religion, and he appealed to the gospel of force. And appealing to the gospel of force, he followed it to its ultimatum,—the murder of the man of faith.

Thus faith and force have always been at opposites. It was always so, and always will be so. Those who have faith are content with the gospel of persuasion. Those who have not faith always appeal to the gospel of force. And appealing to force they always follow it to its ultimatum. And those who now appeal to force will form no exception, but will follow on to the point of imposing the death penalty upon dissenters. Murder is in the gospel of force.
