[THE following which is spoken by an English exchange with reference to what is seen in England, is just as true of the like occasions in the United States:—]

This is the season of religious congresses. The "Free Church Council" was held not long since, then followed the Baptist Association, and now the Church Congress has just closed. One does not need to read the reports of these gatherings, but only to glance over them, to be most painfully impressed. Thickly sprinkled through the stenographic reports appear the words, "laughter," "loud laughter," "prolonged laughter," "applause," "cheers," etc., besides occasional mention of hisses or groans.

It seems as though the spirit of these ministerial gatherings is far removed from that of Paul, who said Peter, Paul, and others of their time, but not a single funny thing appears, nor was there any laughter on the part of those who listened. The painful impression is made that the prevailing type of Christianity nowadays is vastly different from that of Christ and the apostles. Either such serious themes are not handled, or else their seriousness does not weigh very heavily on speakers and hearers.
