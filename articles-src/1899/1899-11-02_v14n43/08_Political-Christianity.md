The North Dakota Sunday School Association stands committed to the folly of political Christianity, by this resolution, adopted at its tenth annual convention, last May, as recently reported in the AMERICAN SENTINEL:—

"Resolved, That we indorse the action of the National Reform Association in their efforts to secure an amendment to our national Constitution, acknowledging Christ as King of Nations and the Bible as the supreme law, thus securing to us, on an undeniable legal basis, all the Christian features of our government."

If Christ is king of Nations, he is king of this nation; therefore this country is Christ's kingdom. In this country, every voter is a king; but John 3:3 says: "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." God's kingdom is Christ's kingdom. Then if the United States is God's kingdom, we have the queer combination of millions of unconverted voters, or Republican kings, who have never seen their own country.

But Romans 14: 17 says: "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." And Ephesians 5: 5: "For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolator, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."

Are there any such people heirs in the United States? If so, can the United States be God's kingdom? Luke 17: 21 also declares: "Neither shall they say lo, here! or lo, there! for behold the kingdom of God is within you."

Then if the kingdom of God is within each man's heart, why make national laws to try to govern that secret kingdom already ruled by God and conscience.

To enforce such laws the state must use force, and the dungeon; while Christ says: (John 18: 36, 37) "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence. Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king."

"But now is my kingdom not from hence." Here is where these National Reformers make a fatal mistake.

Now Christ is not reigning over all the kingdoms of the world, and he will not reign over them until the time of the prophecy (Rev. 11: 15): "And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever."

But, be it known that this great event will not be brought about by act of Parliament, or of Congress, or even by popish mandate.

Canon City, Col.
