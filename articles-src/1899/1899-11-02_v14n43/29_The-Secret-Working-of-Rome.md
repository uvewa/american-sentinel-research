A paper read at the Alliance of Reformed Churches in Washington, by Samuel Smith, member of Parliament, throws much light on the ritualistic controversy now agitating Great Britain, and which some fancy will result in the disestablishment of the Anglican Church. It presents an interesting and instructive picture of the secret workings of Rome, which Rome practises in every country where Protestantism has gained much power; and to successfully oppose which only the Word of God has proved effective. The substance of this paper is as follows:

"The question that eclipses all others in the religious world of Great Britain and her colonies is the enormous growth of sacerdotalism in the Anglican Church. It affects not only the British colonies, but also the United States; indeed, wherever the English language is spoken; and it is closely connected with the enormous efforts which the Church of Rome is making to regain her hold on the Anglo-Saxon race. The evangelical and sacerdotal conceptions of Christianity cannot harmonize. They are radically opposed. Salvation by faith in Christ is not reconcilable with salvation by priests and sacraments. These two conceptions are now in deadly antagonism in the Anglican Church.

"This Romanizing movement has been spread largely by secret societies in the Anglican Church. These have now been fully disclosed to the world in the remarkable book, 'The Secret History of the Oxford Movement,' by Walter Walsh. Some of these societies are the Holy Cross, the Guild of All Souls, the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament, besides the great public society, the English Church Union. These contain seven or eight thousand clergy. They all teach high priestly doctrines, some of them almost every doctrine of the Church of Rome, including the mass and confessional, the invocation of the saints and of the Virgin Mary, Purgatory, and the seven sacraments.

"Among the means used to propagate these doctrines theological colleges have been chief. Most of the colleges now belong to the Ritualist party, and in most of these the confessional is insisted upon.

"Doctrines are taught which differ little from those of the Church of Rome. Elementary schools are also largely used. More than half the children of England are educated in Church of England schools, which are practically under the control of the parish priests. Then at confirmation a large proportion of the youth of England passes through the hands of the clergy, and many of them use this opportunity for inculcating extreme High Church doctrines, even insisting upon going to confession, in some cases without the knowledge of their parents. Sisterhoods and convents have played a great part in this work, for women have come under the power of these Ritualist priests through the confessional to an amazing extent. Catechisms and manuals are also circulated largely, and many of them teach such doctrines as the necessity of priestly absolution for the forgiveness of sins. I will quote one specimen from the catechism published by the League of the Holy Cross for young children:

"It is to the priest only that the child must acknowledge his sins if he desires that God should forgive him. Do you know why? It is because God, when on earth, gave to his priests and to them alone the divine power of forgiving sins. Go to the priest, who is the doctor of your soul, and who cures you in the name of God. I have known poor children who concealed their sins in confession for years; they were very unhappy; were tortured with remorse, and if they had died in that state they would certainly have gone to the everlasting fires of hell.

"I have examined several of these catechisms and have found these doctrines contained in most of them. They all teach that the priest is a kind of miracle worker; that he receives at ordination supernatural powers.

"As to the teaching regarding what they call the Holy Eucharist—they never use the scriptural term, 'the Lord's Supper'—I quote as follows from one of these catechisms for children:

"When the priest begins the prayer that which is on the altar is bread and wine; when the priest ends the prayer, that which is on the altar is Christ's body and blood; it is Jesus; it is God. Who does this? The priest acting for Jesus in the power of the Holy Ghost. How does he do it? I cannot tell you. He does not know himself how he does it, but it is done. It is a work of God, and no one knows how God works. If you were to ask the great St. Michael, he could not tell you. If you were to ask the blessed Mary, she could not tell you. It is God's own secret, a knowledge which belongs to him and to no one else. We go to the altar and kneel down and the priest comes to us with the blessed sacrament. We receive that which looks like bread and which tastes like bread; we receive that which looks like wine and which tastes like wine; but that which we receive is the body and blood of Christ. It is Jesus himself; it is ALMIGHTY GOD."

"Indeed, there is an absolute contradiction between evangelical and sacerdotal religion. No compromise between the two systems is possible. The attempt to combine them both in the English Prayer Book has an enfeebling effect upon the mind. It leads to casuistry and is the parent of a whole crop of shifts and evasions. The origin of this difficulty was the compromise in the time of Elizabeth between the Protestant and Catholic elements in England. The Reformation was arrested in its natural development at the instance of the sovereign. To please the Protestants the articles were drawn up in a strongly Calvinistic and evangelical sense, but the liturgy contains considerable remains of Roman Catholic doctrine. Hence there have always been two parties in the national church, each trying to overturn the other.

"During last century and the earlier part of this one the Protestant element was supreme, but since the rise of the Oxford movement the sacerdotal element has rapidly developed and has now gained the supremacy. It is as strong now among the clergy as in the days of Archbishop Laud, but it has at last produced a strong revolt among the Protestant laity of the Anglican Church very similar to what took place in the time of the Long Parliament.

"It is impossible to keep this question out of Parliament in consequence of the state of the church being so closely connected with the government. The bishops and the high officers of the church are appointed by the government of the day, and the government is responsible to Parliament, and practically the Anglican laity have no control over the clergy except through Parliament, as they have no synods or self-governing courts. Therefore it is that strong debates have taken place in Parliament the last year or two and will probably be repeated, and the effect of all this is very educating upon the nation.

"Sooner or later the Catholic and Protestant elements must separate, for they are divided by an impassable gulf, and probably a good number of the extreme Ritualists will go over to Rome. Several hundred of the clergy have gone there already.

"Rome regards this movement with great interest. Cardinal Vaughan recently said of the Ritualists:—

"They are doing our work much better than we ourselves could do it; they are sowing the seed, while we, with folded hands, are standing by waiting to reap the harvest."

"A Roman Catholic priest, writing from Manchester, says:—

"At this hour five thousand Church of England clergymen are preaching from as many Protestant pulpits the Catholic faith to catholicizing congregations much more effectually, with less suspicion and more acceptance than we can ever hope to do. We could desire no better preparation for joining the Catholic Church than the Ritualist preparatory school, and the fact that from them we have secured the majority of our converts strengthens us in our view of it."

"It must be a matter of rejoicing to Romanism to hear Lord Halifax, the president of the English Church Union, which contains 4,000 clergy and 30 bishops, mostly colonial, saying in one of his addresses:—

"We are convinced that there is nothing whatever in the authoritative documents of the English Church which, apart from the traditional glosses of a practical Protestantism, contains anything essentially irreconcilable with the doctrines of the Church of Rome."

"The archbishops and the bishops are at last alarmed at the public agitation upon this question, and are feebly trying to arrest the movement; they are beginning to dread disestablishment. The two archbishops have formed a court to try cases of Ritualism, although they have no legal power to act in this manner. They have condemned the use of incense and processional lights in churches, but these are mere straws on the surface, and I much doubt whether they will deal with the roots of this movement. They are too much afraid of quarreling with the great High Church party.

"The evil is, indeed, too deep to be removed by cauterizing the surface. The Catholic ideas of the unity of the church and of its apostolic descent have taken strong hold of many devout and cultivated men. Men imbued with reverence for the past, such as Gladstone was, are powerfully impressed by this conception of Catholic unity and continuity. Then large numbers of women have been brought under priestly power through the confessional, and they are training up their children in these sacerdotal views. It is undoubted that a long and arduous struggle is before us. What the end of it will be no one can prophesy."
