Some statements derogatory to the Catholic friars in the Philippines have recently been made by General Funston, who has gained fame in the Philippine campaign. Replying to these, Archbishop Chappelle, of New Orleans, says in vindication of the friars:—

"Whatever the natives are or have they owe to the friars. By them they were lifted out of savagery and brought under the blessed and refining influences of Christianity. By them they were educated, not only in the schools, but in the fields and the workshops were taught by them the very industries which are now the source of their prosperity."

And yet, as the archbishop says in the same connection, "every priest (with the exception of a few natives) in the island of Luzon, outside of the walled city of Manila, is a prisoner of the insurgents;" and "For the past eighteen months . . . more than three hundred and fifty friars have been undergoing unheard-of tortures in insurgent dungeons."

Putting the two statements together, it appears that the natives of Luzon have been "lifted out of savagery and brought under the blessed and refining influences of Christianity" to such an extent that for the past eighteen months they have been subjecting the friars to "unheard-of tortures" in the dungeons where they are kept prisoners; and "whatever the natives are or have they owe to the friars." Verify, then, the friars are reaping only that which they have sown.

This statement of the case by the archbishop is entirely plausible, but we fail to see how it vindicates the friars.
