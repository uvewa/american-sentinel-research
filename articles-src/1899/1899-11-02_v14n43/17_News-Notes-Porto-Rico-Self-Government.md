The military governor of Porto Rico, Gen. G. W. Davis, has made an adverse report to the Government on the question of the fitness of the Porto Ricans for political freedom. Summed up, it amounts to the statement that "The natives of Porto Rico are not now and never will be capable of self government."

If this is true of Porto Rico, how much less than this can be true of Cuba, inhabited by the same classes of people, and subjected for centuries to the same political and social conditions? Evidently this report will not do anything to hasten the political freedom of Cuba.
