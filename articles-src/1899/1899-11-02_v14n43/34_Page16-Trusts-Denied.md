A PROMINENT capitalist and politician who is making speeches to win votes for his party, has declared himself upon the trust question in the short but comprehensive statement, "There are no trusts." Very blind indeed have all the people been in thinking the contrary! We imagine the people who have felt the grasp of the trust will not readily be convinced of its non-existence.
