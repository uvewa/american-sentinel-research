Countess von Krockow, of Dresden, in N. Y. "Independent."

If the American republic ever meant anything historically, it meant a protest against Europe. Its Declaration of Independence was a looking backward over European conditions and a summing up of all the experience thus won. It corresponded politically to Luther's Theses; just as the one was a renunciation of Catholicism, so was the other a renunciation and defiance of imperialism. Over 100 years it has endured.

Europe has not changed essentially meanwhile. It has forms of liberty; but the substantial reality is still militarism, or government by authority and the might of the strongest. So if Europe be unchanged, why should America relinquish her avocation of protestation by turning round and becoming like her? Alas, it is all for the possession of some far-away islands, and for the sake of smoothing the path for some traders to grow rich! Oh, madness, I say, madness! They are doing they know not what; giving up their birthright for a mess of pottage; surrendering their grand attitude of protest, wherein they commanded the respect of the powerful and the adoration of the idealists of the world, to scramble with the effete old nations for land! For land, although they already possess so much. They repudiate their Declaration in spirit and in word for a strip of rich land!

The fact seems incredible. But it has its parallel. The whole Anglo-Saxon race, if the truth be mentioned, is forsaking spiritual vantage ground. The wave of reaction that is upheaving the Yankee from his Plymouth rock of protest against government by authority is pressing Englishmen off the pure, bleak hights of evangelicalism toward the lowlands of sumptuous, imperious ritualism. Loud is the boasting that goes on about the progress of the Anglo-Saxon. "We hear, brethren, but we do not see."
