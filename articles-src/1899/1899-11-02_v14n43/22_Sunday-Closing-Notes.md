SEVENTEEN saloonkeepers at West Hammond, Ill., were arrested recently for selling liquor on Sunday.

ALL through Rhode Island, it is reported, the police are particularly active in suppressing Sunday opening of the saloons.

DRY GOODS merchants, real estate dealers and other business men in Minneapolis, Minn., are urging the Mayor to enforce the law for Sunday closing.

THE Indiana appellate court has held that a contract for sending a telegram on Sunday is illegal unless it comes within the definition of "work of charity or necessity," also that the company is not even liable for damages for failure to deliver humane messages, unless notified of the exceptional circumstances.

A SUNDAY CLOSING movement has been started in White Plains, N. Y., the particular object of controversy being the post-office. The agitation started, it is said with a request to the Postmaster-General at Washington that the White Plains post-office be kept open Sundays. The church people are opposing this request, and Protestants and Catholics find in this a point where they can stand together. And this is one characteristic of the Sunday closing movement,—it brings Protestants and Catholics together, but does not bring the Catholics any nearer to Protestantism.
