A CLERGYMAN of Boothbay Harbor, Me., comes out in print with the statement that "Sunday fishing doesn't pay." We do not know what fishermen find to-day in this respect, but we know one occasion anciently on which it paid unusually well, as narrated in John 21; that is, if it be true, as our Sunday-observing friends assert, that Christ after his resurrection always met with his disciples on the first day of the week.
