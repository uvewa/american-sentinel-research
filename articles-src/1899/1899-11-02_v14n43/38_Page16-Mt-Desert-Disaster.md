ADVOCATES of compulsory Sunday observance are saying that the recent disaster at Mt. Desert, Me., which occurred on Sunday, was due to the desecration of that day by the excursion which led up to the accident. The courts, however, found that certain parties concerned in the affair were guilty of criminal negligence; and no doubt the latter would have been well pleased if the court and the general public had taken the view that the accident was caused by the desecration of Sunday, which would have absolved them from blame. We have noticed that where there is a reckless disregard of natural laws an accident is likely to occur on any day of the week, and we do not see how the Mt. Desert pier, which collapsed, could be expected to hold up a larger crowd on a Sunday than it would sustain on Monday.
