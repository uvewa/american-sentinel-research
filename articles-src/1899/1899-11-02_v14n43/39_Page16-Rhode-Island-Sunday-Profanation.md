THE ORGAN OF THE NEW ENGLAND Sabbath Protective League says that "one uppermost question in morals to day in Rhode Island is whether Sunday profanation, as seen in bicycle races and baseball games, shall be tolerated in that State." Would it not be well to reflect that God tolerates these things, which if they are immoral are a much greater wrong against him than against any man; and if God, who is supremely upright and just, tolerates that which wrongs him, cannot men who are sinners themselves tolerate the same thing? They can if they have the same spirit that actuates God. Then again, it is a question among the people whether Sunday desecration is immoral or not; it represents a religious controversy; and when was the State of Rhode Island authorized and empowered to decide religious controversies? And what does the assumption of such authority represent but popery?
