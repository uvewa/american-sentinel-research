### PASSAIC BARBER THREATENS TO GET EVEN BY STOPPING TROLLEY CARS ON SUNDAY.

PATERSON, N. J., October 24.—A new phase of the Sunday-closing war, which has been conducted for several weeks by the barbers of this county, has just developed in Passaic. Barber Joseph Zimmerman, an old man, refused to close on Sunday. He was arrested under the old blue laws and fined $5.98 yesterday by a justice of the peace.

"My family will starve," he declared as he left the court. "I cannot pay the fine and must go to jail." A constable was sent after Zimmerman and found that his family was really in a state of destitution. Zimmerman has not yet been rearrested. He declares that if he is to be interfered with in earning his living he will use the same blue laws for retaliation.

"How about ball games, bicycle races, saloons, and trolley cars?" asked the barber. "Do I do as much harm as they do? If I cannot shave in Passaic on Sunday no trolley cars will run in Passaic on Sunday."—N. Y. Sun.
