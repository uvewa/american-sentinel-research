ENGLAND has demanded that these men [the Uitlanders of the Transvaal] shall be admitted to citizenship. She presents the extraordinary spectacle of a nation insisting upon the expatriation of her own subjects and their absorption by a foreign country. It is a spectacle so grotesque, so palpably intended to mask a treacherous and wicked purpose that it amounts to an affront to the intelligence of the civilized world.—Washington Post.
