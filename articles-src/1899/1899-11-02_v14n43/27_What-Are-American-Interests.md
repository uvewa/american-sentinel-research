New York "World," October 26.

A DISPATCH from Washington yesterday said that the Administration has caused it to be made known in Europe that "American interests are too remote from the Transvaal conflict to justify any interference with the course of events."

What are "American interests?" Do they relate to trade alone? When the "course of events" threatens the extinction of two sister republics, after a bloody conflict that already "staggers humanity," have the United States no interest in it? Have we no interest in freedom?

Such was not the view of Daniel Webster when he spoke the sentiment of the nation in sympathy with the struggle of Greece for liberty. Such was not the feeling of the American people when they welcomed Kossuth. Such was not the determination of the country which forced President McKinley to deliver Cuba from the oppression of Spain.

Have we "no interest" in peace or in arbitration? Was the treaty of Washington a landmark, or a "dodge?" Was The Hague Peace Conference a piece of hypocrisy? Are "American interests" really covered by a dollar-mark?
