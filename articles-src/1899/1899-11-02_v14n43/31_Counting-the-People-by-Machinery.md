### FACTS ABOUT EACH PERSON WILL BE TABULATED FOR THE CENSUS BY ELECTRICITY.

Our first census, made in 1795, showed the population of the United States to be five million, and the count cost Uncle Sam, who was comparatively poor then, one cent for each person. It is estimated that the twelfth census, to be made in June, 1900, will show that our people number seventy-five million, and that the item of clerk hire, in the Census Bureau alone, will exceed five million dollars. Clifford Howard, writing of "How the Next Census Will Be Taken," in the November Ladies' Home Journal, says that "although the work of enumeration will be completed by the first of July, it will probably be two or even three months later before the last of the schedules are received at the Census Office; for not only must they all be first examined by the supervisors, but in many cases they will probably require revision because of some error or informality. The actual counting of the people will not be done until the schedules are turned into the Census Office. The enumerators simply gather the facts, and the office force in Washington does the counting and the compiling, which is done by electricity. In one hundred days all the facts relating to seventy-five million people will be tabulated."
