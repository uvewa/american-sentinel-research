The following instructive incident is told by the Rev. Peter MacQueen, who has lately returned from the Philippines:—

"I was on the dock at Manila when the first colored regiment landed, and talked with some of the negro soldiers. With one young man I engaged in conversation, and he at once told me that it was his firm determination not to kill or wound any Filipinos that he could help. He said: 'Dese hyar folks iz jes' der same as our kullud folks was befo' de war. I doan believe in fightin' dese poor critters. I'se goin' to do my duty as a soldier and shoot when I'se tole, but I ain' goin' to aim, you bet, unless to save my own hide.' Just then the lieutenant ordered 'Company F, fall in,' and my colored friend lifted his heavy knapsack and shouldered his gun. As he went away thus burdened down with the appurtenances of the civilized soldier I heard him remark to one of his comrades, 'Dis hyar white man's burden ain all it's cracked up to be.'"
