With the approach of the date for the convening of Congress, a widespread agitation is being raised, chiefly by religious organizations, against allowing Congressman-elect B. H. Roberts, the Utah polygamist, to take a seat in the national legislature. The Utah law against polygamy is also being more rigidly enforced, and several Mormons of high standing in the church, including President Snow, have been prosecuted under it.
