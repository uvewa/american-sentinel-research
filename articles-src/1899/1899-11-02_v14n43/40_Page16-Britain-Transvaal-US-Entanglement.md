It is generally understood that Great Britain is proceeding in her war against the Transvaal and Orange Free State, without the sympathy of the rest of Europe; this being due not to European love of republics or of justice, but to general European jealousy and dislike of Great Britain. Russia, France, and Germany are supposed to stand foremost in opposing British extention in South Africa, and it is surmised that these three powers may initiate a move, in which the rest of the continent would join, to restrain England from her designs. And it is understood also that the United States is the friend of Great Britain in the present controversy, and that a virtual agreement at least exists between them, under which the moral support of this Government will be given to England against the rest of Europe. But will England not demand in case of emergency, something more than mere moral support? And is the United States prepared to pursue the pathway of foreign conquest without something more than the moral support of Great Britain? Is it not apparent that this country is already getting dangerously entangled in Old World politics?
