At the session of the Universalist conference in Boston, Oct. 25, the following resolution was moved by Rev. Dr. Powers, of New York:—

"Resolved, That we believe that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed."

The report states that the resolution was received with "laughter and applause"; and possibly it was the intent of its author to provoke a demonstration of this kind. But even if designed as a joke, the fact that such a joke can have point at this time is serious enough. And it is probable that no joke was intended. Certainly it is no joke for those who are fighting and giving up property and life in the Asiatic islands to maintain these identical privileges for themselves and their children.
