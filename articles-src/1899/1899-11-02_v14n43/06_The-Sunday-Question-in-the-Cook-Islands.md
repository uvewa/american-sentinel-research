[The following interesting statement on this subject is sent us by a missionary of the Seventh-day Adventists.]

A NEW phase of the Sunday question has recently been presented in the Cook Islands—that of changing Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week. Owing to the fact that the early missionaries did not take into consideration the difference in time, the people were taught to observe the Sabbath on Saturday and call it Sunday.

About two years ago the question of changing the day was sprung upon parliament. Our laborers located at Raratonga at that time prepared a protest, which was placed before the parliament and the British Resident, and the question was thrown out. It was then openly reported that at the next meeting of parliament such a bill would be introduced.

Last January the following notice appeared in some of the papers:—

"As Raratonga, or, rather, the Cook Island Group, advances, there are many old laws that are being found not now applicable, and many customs of the past that have to be put aside to meet the necessities of the present. Among the latter is the observance of Sunday. As every one knows, owing to an error of the early missionaries, no allowance was made for difference of time when coming here, hence we have been keeping Saturday as Sunday. This is proving very confusing, and to vessels annoying and expensive. We prohibit them from working on the proper Sunday, and force them to work on their Sunday. To the Union Steamship Company this is extra expense, apart from delay, as by the Steamers' Union the company are forced to pay additional to their crews when working Sunday. However, we are glad to hear this is likely to be altered, as a bill is to be brought before parliament next session to have the correct day kept as Sunday, and we learn that the British Resident favors this step."

The natives generally are displeased with this new innovation, fearing a plague in consequence. They say that when the change was made in Tahiti about forty years ago, it was followed by an epidemic of sickness. At Samoa it was followed by a similar plague. They fear the displeasure of God expressed in the same manner. But they are being taught through the pulpit and press that it is the proper thing to do, and a petition has been circulated among them urging it.

Our workers published a little tract upon the question involved, and distributed about 1,000 copies in the principal islands of the group. They also made personal visits to the members of parliament, furnishing them with proper reading matter on the issue. But at the session of that body held August 7, the proposed change was made, to go into effect next Christmas. The penalty for working on Sunday is not to exceed ten shillings—$2.50—and not more than three days' hard labor on the road.

Our brethren are still distributing literature, which is eagerly received by the natives. Popular prejudice has been on the side of the true Sabbath, the Bible being accepted as the only standard by which all things should be tested. Many of the people say they will not adopt the change, forsaking the Lord to follow the pope. It remains to be seen how many will be true.
