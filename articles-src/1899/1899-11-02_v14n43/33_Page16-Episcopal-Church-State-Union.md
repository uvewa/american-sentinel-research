At a recent missionary council in St. Louis some Episcopal clergymen spoke in favor of an American union of church and state, after the English model. A secular journal makes note of the fact, and observes that they "did not designate which church," which was on their part "an important omission," as "there are several religious bodies in the United States, all claiming to be the only true church."
