"Springfield (Mass.) Republican."

THE power of the Roman Catholic Church is to be invoked to aid President McKinley in conquering the Filipinos. This is the statement made by Archbishop Chappelle, papal legate to the Philippines, after his conference with the President Saturday. He said for publication: "I am convinced that the President intends to deal fairly by the people of the Philippines and honestly with the Roman Catholic Church. I shall leave for Manila during the latter part of next month, and shall do all I can to bring about peace between this country and the Filipinos." Here is the programme, as set forth in a Washington dispatch:—

"Archbishop Chappelle will prove to the Filipino priests that opposition to the Government of the United States is unwise if that opposition grows from a fear that the rights of the church are not to be respected and that the Government of the American Republic is opposed to the religion which dominates the islands. Armed with full authority from this Government to present the case from the standpoint of the church, the President believes the visit of the archbishop will be fruitful of good results, and that soon after he arrives there will be a change in the sentiments of the mass of the people. The archbishop, accompanied by the best wishes of the President and the blessings of the pope, is expected to remove much of the opposition of the revolutionists and to impress upon the people of the Philippines the fact that loyalty to the United States is not incompatible with devotion to the church, which is so highly respected in the United States."

So much for that side of the case. The other point of view appears in an address made at the meeting of a Presbyterian synod in Erie, Pa., Saturday, by Rev. J. S. Hunter, the chaplain who served with the 10th Pennsylvania volunteers in the island of Luzon. Said Chaplain Hunter:—

"There are three causes for the insurrection. One is the mismanagement of affairs by General Otis; another is the misconduct of American troops (I wish to refute the charges of desecration of Filipino churches, however) and the third is the absolute incompatibility of our Government with their customs and traditions. When our soldiers took Manila Spain surrendered, but the dominant power in the island did not, and it is still in force. The archbishop is the supreme power in Manila, and Dr. Brown says he fears that General Otis is under his control. The church don't want religious liberty, and all its weight will be thrown against the Government that promotes religious freedom. Our gospel is needed there."

Here is something like an irreconcilable conflict. The archbishop and the Presbyterian minister represent the two sides of the religious question with which the United States Government proposes to deal, and the archbishop is to go to Manila backed by the President.
