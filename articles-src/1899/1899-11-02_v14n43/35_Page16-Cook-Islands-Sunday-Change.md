NOTICE how, as told on another page, the English authorities have decided to overturn the customs and belief of the inhabitants of the Cook Islands, fixed by the practises of a life time, in order that Sunday may be established there as the Sabbath in place of the seventh day. They would think this altogether too much to do for the sake of getting back to the observance of the true Creation Sabbath; but it is not too much to do for Sunday.
