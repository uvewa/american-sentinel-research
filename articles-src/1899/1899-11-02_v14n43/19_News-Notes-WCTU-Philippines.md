The National W. C. T. U. at their late convention in Seattle, Washington, went on record as emphatically opposed to the policy of foreign conquest now being pursued by the Government. They said:—

We deeply deplore the attitude taken by our nation with respect to the Philippine Islands, and, since governments can derive their just powers only from the consent of the governed, we protest against the policy which would compel a foreign people to submit to the rule of the United States, and against a war through which the Administration is striving to enforce its policy."

Other resolutions were passed protesting against "the manifestly forced and unjust interpretation of the anti-canteen law as rendered by Attorney-General Griggs of the United States, upheld by ex-Secretary of War Alger," and against the seating in Congress of the polygamist, B. H. Roberts.
