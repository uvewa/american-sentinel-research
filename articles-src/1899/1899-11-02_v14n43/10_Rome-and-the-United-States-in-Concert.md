The following paragraphs from an instructive article on "Religious Liberty in the Philippines," which the Rev. N. H. Harriman, president of a Protestant missionary society, contributes to *The Independent*, show how Rome and the Government are acting in concert for the restoration of Catholic supremacy in the islands:—

"Protestants should begin at once, in earnest, and our military authorities should enforce the principle of religious equality, not hinder it. The military governor has it in his power to place insuperable obstacles in the way of missionaries. This has of late been done, under the pretext of military expediency. Even President Schurmann, of the Civil Commission, was hoodwinked into asserting that missionaries were hampering the military authorities; this was a sly move to keep missionaries out until Otis and the Archbishop have preempted the ground and got matters arranged. If any doubt the charity of this remark, let him read to the end."

"When Spanish priests, with the cunning Archbishop at their head, made complaints that missionaries were doing wrong by distributing Testaments and tracts to the natives, a real American, true to national traditions and unbiased by his religion, would have told them to go about their business and would have read them a lecture upon religious liberty and the rights of American citizens in the Philippines. Instead of that, the governor-general sent for the Rev. B. C. Randall, agent for the British and Foreign Bible Society, and weakly advised him not to sell any more Protestant literature at present. In Cebu, the military governor sent for the writer, and peremptorily ordered him not to sell any more tracts and Testaments, and was made to confess that his reason for this extraordinary order was that the Spanish priests were 'complaining,' and the Spanish local paper was criticising. These instances will sufficiently illustrate the point that the military difficulty is no myth."

"During the first months after the occupation, the Spanish clergy were becomingly modest; indeed, their power was effectually broken. Many left the islands, as did also the friars and nuns, and the rest gave evidence that they regarded themselves as dispossessed of further power. When our missionaries arrived on the field, the natives were open to free approach, and hungry to hear. Agent Randall found it a most hopeful field. In a few weeks he sold not less than ten thousand copies of his literature, and with others disposed of a full edition of the work translated by the converted priest of whom mention has been made, who ten years ago was poisoned in the Hotel de l'Orient; this was a treatise on the Gospel, the instrument of his conversion, and he translated it into Pagasinan, spoken in Northern Luzon. This was the situation in March, and on into April."

"In April the reaction set in, while the writer was there. The priests, under the mistaken diplomacy of the governor, began to take heart. Scurrilous pamphlets were circulated among the natives, having for their object not only to poison their minds against missionaries, but against all Americans. Some of these were vile slanders against American womanhood, with other things of similar character. Presently the Spanish priests were known to be 'laboring with' those of their people who were in the habit of visiting the mission home, and others whom our missionaries had talked with. Then a more openly hostile attitude was assumed, as General Otis encouraged the priests and made a friend of the Archbishop. Then it was that an official prohibition was put upon the sale of all Protestant tracts and Testaments."

"As further illustration of the effects of politics, priestcraft and incompetent and biased militarism, note the following straws: Catholic chaplains are being sent to the islands in disproportionate numbers, some leaving the posts to which they are assigned in this country, 'post chaplains,' and spending their time largely in Manila. Is this 'military diplomacy?'"

"Father McKinnon, the chaplain of the First California Regiment, was early appointed 'Superintendent of Schools and Cemeteries' in Manila. Under him the school system is being revised, English is being taught, Catholic teachers are being brought from this country, and the priests come into the schools and bless the children, laying their hands on their heads. Does 'military diplomacy' demand that the school system of the islands be Catholic? Is this the way that future American citizens are to be made? After Father McKinnon's appointment Father McQuade was sent out; but he spent more time in Manila than with his regiment. Why do they flock to Manila?"

"It is time for the Government at Washington to investigate a common rumor, that seemed to be well known, to this effect: The newspaper organ of the Archbishop became so openly abusive of all that was American, that its editor, who, of course, was the visible proprietor, was arrested and court-martialed. His sentence was seven years in Bilibid Prison, a fine of $5,000, and confiscation of his whole plant. Otis reviewed the court martial and fined him $250, and remitted all the rest, saying: 'This will be sufficient lesson for him.' The 'lesson' to the offending prelate must have been that he could henceforth do about as he liked."

"There is in Manila, in official circles, a well-defined rumor, amounting to almost a confident assertion, that the Archbishop of Manila is receiving from the public treasury the sum of $12,000 a year salary. This rumor should be investigated, and the responsibility located. If it is true, and is sanctioned by Government, Americans ought to protest."
