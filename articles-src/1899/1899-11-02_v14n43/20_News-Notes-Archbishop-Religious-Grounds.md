Archbishop Chappelle, as reported by the press, says that America should keep the Philippines. "They should be ours," he says, "on moral, legal, commercial, sociological and religious grounds."

"On religious grounds!" The United States should take and hold the Philippines, the religion of which is Roman Catholic, for religious as well as for commercial and other reasons!

What are these "religious grounds?" Are they comprised in the Roman Catholic assumption that "This is a Catholic Christian nation," which gives ground for the further assumption that smaller Catholic territories ought to be gathered into its fold?

"On religious grounds" means the spread of religion; and spoken by a Catholic archbishop, the phrase means the spread of the Catholic religion. So the archbishop has said that the United States Government ought to do a great and arduous work for the spread of the Catholic religion; and no doubt this is exactly what he thinks.

The people of the United States are, the great majority of them, Protestants. Upon what conceivable religious grounds can they see that the United States ought to absorb several millions of Roman Catholics?

But even though the Philippines were peopled with Protestants, there would still be no religious grounds upon which the United States could properly base any action for annexing the islands. "Religious grounds" are not grounds that the civil authority can consider in any way. That is the Protestant and American principle which applies in this case.
