# Uncertainties — v14n02, January 12, 1899

## Article 06 (Preparing an Amendment to the Law of God)
- **Location:** Opening word of second paragraph
- **Transcribed as:** "Lovo"
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "Lovo" but this is almost certainly an OCR error for "Love" — the sentence reads "Lovo should pause the erring hand of man..." The word "Love" makes clear contextual and grammatical sense.
- **Confidence:** LOW — transcribed verbatim from OCR as "Lovo" pending review against original scan. This is very likely "Love."
- **Recommendation:** Verify against original scan and correct to "Love" if confirmed.

## Article 12 ("Solely for Humanity.")
- **Location:** Closing portion of article, Theodore S. Woolsey quotation
- **Note:** The article by ATJ appears to continue with a lengthy quotation attributed to "Theodore S. Woolsey, Professor of International Law at Yale University." This quotation about "spread-eagleism" follows ATJ's closing with "A. T. J." in the OCR. It is possible the Woolsey quotation is a separate item or a continuation of the "Solely for Humanity" article placed by ATJ before his initials. The OCR shows ATJ's initials appearing at the end of the sentence "you can not fool all the people all the time," followed immediately by the Woolsey quotation. The Woolsey excerpt may be an editorial addition presented as follow-up context within the same article, which is the interpretation adopted here.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — grouped with article 12 as ATJ likely appended it. Verify against original layout.

## Attribution Notes
- **Mrs. L. D. Avery-Stuttle:** Initials "LDAS" are non-standard. This author is known from previous issues of the series "Studies in French History." Her full name appears at the article's end as "MRS. L. D. AVERY-STUTTLE."
- **T. E. Bowen / TEB:** Known author from previous issues (1893 additional authors list includes TEB=T. E. Bowen). Attributed here as explicit based on "BY T. E. BOWEN." byline.

## Page 1 Short Notes
- The short aphorisms on page 1 are treated as individual editorial items. Their boundaries are clear from the original OCR layout (each is a distinct paragraph). No uncertainty about boundaries.

## "Solely for Humanity" — Woolsey placement
- The Woolsey quotation (about "spread-eagleism") appears in the OCR immediately after ATJ's initials on p. 3-4. It is included in article 12 as it flows contextually from ATJ's argument, but it may have been intended as a separate note. The original page layout would resolve this definitively.
