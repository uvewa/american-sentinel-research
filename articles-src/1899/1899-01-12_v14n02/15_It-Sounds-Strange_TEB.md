One thinks nothing of reading about the nations of Europe threatening one another, and telling one another they must do this and that, and not do so and so. For years they have been wrangling over the territory on their side of the world until the world has come to look at that as a matter of fact; but to read such utterances as the following, from the once peaceful government of the United States, certainly sounds strange:—

"Formal Protest Made. Uncle Sam Objects to French Extension of China. Washington, Dec. 24.—Instructions were sent by the State Department yesterday to Minister Conger, at Peking, to protest in the name of the United States against the granting by the Chinese Government to the Government of France of an extension of the French extra territory or foreign settlement at Shanghai."

One brief year ago such a protest by the United States would have been considered very much out of place, even by Americans. But since the acquisition of the Philippines, our once free Republic, has become involved in all the disputes of the Kings of the East; for she has herself assumed to be one. And now she feels at liberty to dictate to those nations what they shall or shall not do.

This means that she stands ready to see that her suggestions are carried out; that instead of war being an almost unthought-of event as it was only a year ago and prior to that, we stand where at any moment our Government (and this means the people, and therefore means you) shall be plunged into the horrors of a foreign war, not with an old decaying power, but with nations drilled and more thoroughly equipped than is this nation.

To a class, inspired with this new infatuation of expansion, such threats smack of courage and valor; but to the true friends of the Republic, those who must pay the taxes and place carefully on almost everything war revenue stamps, such meddling with foreign affairs, such ticklings of the war spirit, such playings into the Eastern vortex of nations, do not smack of true courage, but of a braggadocio that some day may meet humiliating reverses, which may cause somebody to stop and think long enough to entertain the conviction that our Republic has entered upon the wrong road in its national career. True patriotism might not be an improper name for such thinking and acting just now.
