*G. T. B. Gillmore, in Chicago "Times-Herald."*

"Crying, Peace, peace! when there is no peace." Jer. 8:11.

MAD moon-struck Man still mews and moans and maunders
Of times when wars and conflicts all shall cease,
As with unheeding step he further wanders
From paths of Peace.

Rude Russia's ruler rools his roving iris
O'er martial hosts from Kara's Sea to Greece,
The while he murmurs soft, "My chief desire is
Perpetual Peace."

Proud Prussia's puppet pranks his person petty
In martial garb, o'erhung with pure white fleece,
And deigns to honor thus the Holy City,
Proclaiming "Peace."

Big brutal Britain, braggart bravo brazen,
Proclaims her sons the Deity's police,
And thirty thousand "niggers" end their days in
The "Paths of Peace."

The screaming scribbler scrabbles, scrawls, and screeches,
"To —— with Peace! These massacres must cease!"
"Let us have war (and Cuba)," he beseeches,
"For sake of Peace."

A mammoth mound of molding marcid matter,
The moon-eyed Mongol's empire nears decease;
While hungry nations grab, with snarl and blatter,
And call it Peace!

With puling pansophy the preacher plans on—
But population still demands release.
Each man will want the space his neighbor stands on,
And where is Peace?

While whortling World whirls whizzing thro' the whereness,
And hungry human parasites increase,
Their cry will ever ring, in horrid bareness,
"To —— with Peace!"
