The demand for extra copies of the SENTINEL, of almost every issue, has been so great, that we have decided to print each week a sufficient number to meet if possible all calls for them. Last week's, and the present issue, are excellent for missionary purposes, and our friends should see to it that every lawyer and judge in their respective localities be supplied with these two numbers, which contain the important article from the pen of ex-Judge Arthur. These will be sold at the rate of one cent per copy. Wrappers directed and mailed from this office at a cent and a quarter per copy.
