Some idea of the natural tendency of the expansion policy to keep on expanding indefinitely, may be gathered from the following editorial in the Minneapolis Tribune, of December 10, last. It appears under the heading, "Do We Want Venezuela?" but the question might appropriately have been, Do we want the western hemisphere, and as much more of the earth as we can get? The Tribune says:

"A New York gentleman who recently returned from Venezuela says he was surprised to find a strong sentiment among prominent Venezuelans in favor of annexation to the United States, and that if this country wanted that South American republic, it would have no difficulty, in the present state of feeling existing there, to bring about annexation. He adds: 'With the ownership of Porto Rico, it may be found necessary after a while for us to take in the countries bordering on the Caribbean Sea. This is all the more worthy of serious consideration when we reflect upon the longing with which European powers regard the countries of South America. Germany plans for future domination in Southern Brazil; Italy already has strong colonies in the Argentine, while Great Britain has made Chili next to a commercial dependency. In view of all these things, it will not do to say the time will never come when the United States will disdain the idea of pushing the Stars and Stripes further southward.'

"An examination of the map will show that Venezuela faces Porto Rico and possesses a fine coast looking northward towards the United States. It is one of the finest of the South American countries, both in its surface and resources, and in the character of its people. Under American auspices its development would be rapid and it would be the source of untold wealth. From the base furnished by Porto Rico, it would be within easy communication with the United States, and its possession would tend to the building up of an important ocean marine trading to southern waters.

"If the people of Venezuela want to come into the United States and would be content to remain for a probationary period of say 25 years in the territorial condition, the annexation would be mutually advantageous. Within that period the emigration from the United States to Venezuela and the establishment of American enterprises there would so thoroughly Americanize the country that it could safely be admitted to statehood with a restricted suffrage, something like that which is proposed for Hawaii.

"If the policy of expansion is adopted, the way to expand is to expand. Ultimately the United States must control both American continents. Venezuela would be an important stepping-stone to the rest of South America."
