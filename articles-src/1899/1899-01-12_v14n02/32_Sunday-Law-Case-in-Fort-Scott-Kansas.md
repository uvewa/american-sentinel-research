A CORRESPONDENT in Fort Scott, Kansas, informs us that a decision on the Sunday law of that State is pending in the courts there, in the case of a barber arrested for following his trade on Sunday. Until recently the barber shops did business on Sundays without molestation; but finally one barber who wanted the patronage of people who advocated Sunday closing, gave notice that he would prosecute all barbers keeping open thereafter on Sundays; and all the shops were closed, with one exception. The prosecution, we are informed, would not risk this case before either of Fort Scott's justices of the peace, knowing they would decide the proceedings to be unconstitutional; so the case was taken to the district court, and is expected, in case of an adverse decision, to be taken to the Supreme Court of the State.
