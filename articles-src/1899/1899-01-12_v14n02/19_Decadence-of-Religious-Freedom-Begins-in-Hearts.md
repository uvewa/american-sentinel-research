THE decadence of religious freedom begins always in the hearts of individuals. If the principles of liberty are not cherished by individual citizens, they will not be respected in the laws and practices of the nation. There can be no question but that a new impulse from beneath is moving upon all hearts unfortified by the love of right, to sweep away every principle of freedom from the earth. On the other hand, the author of liberty is sending new power and light to every heart that is open to receive it. You must respond to the movings of the one spirit or the other; from this there is no escape. If you are an idle spectator now, you will be an actor in the drama sooner or later; but every day's delay lessens your chances for stepping in upon the right side of the controversy.
