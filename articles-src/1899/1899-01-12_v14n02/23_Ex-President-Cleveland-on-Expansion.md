To a press representative, recently, ex-President Cleveland gave his views on the subject of annexing the Philippines. We commend them to all expansionists, not excepting the clergy:

"I do not care to repeat my views concerning the prevailing epidemic of imperialism and territorial expansion.

"Assuming, however, that my ideas on the subject are antiquated and unsuited to these progressive days, it is a matter of surprise to me that the refusal of certain natives of our new possessions to acquiesce in the beneficence of subjecting them to our control and management should in the least disturb our expansionists.

"This phase of the situation ought not to have been unanticipated, nor the incidents naturally growing out of it overlooked.

"The remedy is obvious and simple. The misguided inhabitants of our annexed territory who prefer something different from the plan for their control which we propose or who oppose our designs in their behalf should be slaughtered.

"The killing of natives has been a feature of expansion since expansion began, and our imperialistic enthusiasm should not be checked by the prospective necessity of destroying a few thousand or a few hundred thousand Filipinos.

"This should only be regarded as one stage in a transcendentally great movement, a mere incident in its progress.

"Of course some unprepared souls would then be lost before we had the opportunity of Christianizing them, but surely those of our clergymen who have done so much to encourage expansion could manage that difficulty."
