WHILE events are so rapidly occurring which mark the decadence of free government in the land that was thought to be its lasting home, do not imagine that you can afford to stand in the position of a mere spectator. The Almighty is not giving a show for any person's amusement. The interests of all persons are involved in the contest of opposing principles of freedom and despotism. Every successive event is a new call to individual action. To be wise you must be able to discern the signs of the times, and to recognize and understand the call of duty.
