The State of Montana is agitated by a movement to secure a Sunday-closing law. Petitions are being circulated for signatures, to be presented to the legislature, and an address "To the business men and women of Montana," has been prepared, signed by forty business firms in the State, setting forth "some reasons" why such a law should be had. No doubt a strong pressure will be brought to bear on the legislature to secure the law, and it is not unlikely that the legislature may accede to the demand.

The present Sunday law of Montana prohibits only the keeping upon on Sunday of "any play house, theater, dance house, hurdy-gurdy house, prize ring, or race grounds," and "any house or other habitation wherein any game of chance is played," or "any banking game at cards." It is now proposed to include honest and useful employment in the various lines of business enterprise, with these occupations of a distinctly immoral nature.

The address makes a number of statements setting forth the advantages of a weekly day of rest, which are proper enough as an argument for a voluntary observance of the day, but fail entirely to prove the necessity or propriety of a rest enforced by law. An effort is made to show the necessity of an enforced Sunday, in the following statement:

"The business men in numerous towns of our State, realizing the advantages of a seventh day of rest, have already tried to secure it for themselves by means of local agreements to close all competing businesses. In some places this plan has succeeded fairly well for a little while; but, sooner or later, some one generally breaks the agreement, which usually leads all the rest to open their doors on the rest day, let they lose their trade. Thus the majority are forced to submit to a life of drudgery because one or two disregard the agreement that otherwise would have secured to them all, the liberty of rest and social enjoyment with their families. Hence we need a State law with penalties adequate to insure to us our rights in this matter, with no fear of loss to us by untrue competitors who do not keep a local agreement."

The trouble with this statement is that it leaves out of consideration a most important fact touching this very point of a weekly rest, which has existed ever since the creation of man; and that is, that God himself has provided a weekly day of rest for all men, and that day is the seventh day of the week. "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

The business men therefore who have "realized the advantages of a seventh day of rest," and all others as well, have no need to try to secure it for themselves, since God has already provided it; and more, they have no business to select another day than that one which he has provided. And especially have they no business to force that other day, or any day, upon other people who are amenable to God's requirements in common with themselves.

God designed the Sabbath day to be kept by an individual whether he lost trade by doing so or not. There are sacrifices in the Christian life; but an individual is not to be deterred from obedience to God's requirement by fear of the consequences. He is to leave all consequences in the hands of God, and believe that God is amply able to take care of them. That is the very essence of Christian faith.

The individual who is not willing to obey God without being guaranteed against temporal loss in doing so, thereby declares that he has no faith, and that his profession of Christianity—if he makes one—is a sham.

God's Sabbath law covers the whole field of a weekly rest for every individual on the earth; and there is no room for further legislation in the matter. Any such legislation by man is an intrusion into the sphere of individual duty towards God; for every individual is to-day in duty bound by that precept which commands rest upon "the seventh day." Such legislation therefore can be productive only of evil.

Man made laws for Sabbath observance have always been productive of evil, and of that only. History furnishes convincing testimony upon this point.
