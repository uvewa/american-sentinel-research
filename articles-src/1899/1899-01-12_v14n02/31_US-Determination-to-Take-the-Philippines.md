The United States is determined to take possession of the entire group of the Philippines, because of its victory over Spain at Manila; although Spain, as is well known, did not have any hold at all upon a large part of the territory which the islands comprise. In pursuance of this determination the President has issued a proclamation to the Filipinos, telling them that the mission of the American army and navy to their shores is a purely benevolent one, and is for their "greatest good."

"It will be the duty of the commander of the forces of occupation," says the proclamation, "to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come, not as invaders or conquerors, but as friends, to protect the natives in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious rights."

And if any of "the natives" should be so unreasonable as not to want to be protected on their lands by a foreign power with a big army and navy, then they are to bear in mind that "all persons who, either by active aid or by honest submission, cooperate with the Government of the United States to give effect to these beneficent purposes, will receive the reward of its support and protection;" but "all others will be brought within the lawful rule we have assumed, with firmness if need be [italics ours], but without severity so far as may be possible."

Of course, if the Filipinos are so foolish as not to see the beneficence of the Government's mission—if they have no sense of how nice it is to be told what to do and how to do it by a nation so great and strong as the American Republic, they will have no excuse. They will show themselves to be incorrigible, and people upon whom no sympathy should be wasted. For are they not all familiar with American history, and do they not know that the great power which has come to them is a free republican government? Have they not read the Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution, and do they not know that the American Government is founded on the principles these documents set forth, and strictly adheres to them in all its practice? And have they not, moreover, heard the thunder of Dewey's guns in Manila Bay, and seen the remains of the Spanish fleet which got in Dewey's way, as he sailed in that May morning on his mission of benevolence? In view of all this, and more that we might mention, what possible excuse can the Filipinos have for refusing to want to be governed by the great American nation across the sea? Who will say that they ought not, in case of such refusal, to be treated "with firmness," until they are convinced of the benevolent intentions of the superior power?

Certainly the world ought to be convinced, by this time, that the war with Spain was undertaken "solely for humanity." And yet the world only scoffs at the idea.
