Speech delivered by Judge Arthur, late of the Supreme Court of Washington, at a trial for violation of the Sunday law, at Centerville, Md.

*(Concluded.)*

In dealing with this subject the courts should keep steadily in mind as a limitation upon their authority, that fundamental maxim of both the common and civil law, viz., that "That rule of conduct is to be deemed binding which religion dictates."

Mr. Broom in his work on Legal Maxims, citing from the classics of the law, says: "It may, however, safely be affirmed that, if ever the laws of God and man are at variance, the former are to be obeyed in derogation of the latter: that the law of God is under all circumstances superior in obligation to that of man: and that consequently, if any general custom were opposed to the divine law, or, if any statute were passed directly contrary thereto, such a custom or such an act would be void." Also, "Neither are positive laws, even in matters seemingly indifferent, any further binding than they are agreeable with the laws of God and Nature." This last quotation from Fonblangue's Equity is particularly applicable to this class of cases; for the claim is made and strenuously argued that it is a matter of indifference which day of the week is observed as the Sabbath, so it is one of the seven. We do not want to be understood as admitting this proposition, but on the contrary, insist that the seventh and last day of the week, and no other, is the Sabbath of the Bible beyond any possibility of successful contradiction. But for the sake of the argument, admitting that it is a matter of indifference, we have the high legal authority last cited to sustain the contention that even in that case positive laws relating to that subject are binding only so far as they are agreeable to the law of God. What is the divine law in any given case is not wholly the province of the court to decide. Personal conscientious conviction being the chief essentials of religious faith and practice, it necessarily follows that each person for himself or herself must be largely and chiefly the judge of what is the divine law of binding force in each individual case, governed in the matter of practice by the principles heretofore laid down. But we find that this just and universally-recognized maxim of both the common and civil law and the principles which underlie it did not originate with either of them, but antedates both by many centuries.

It is always a safe rule to go to the sacred Scriptures for the verification of a principle whether in the domain of the law or any other field of human thought and action, for if true it will surely there be found exemplified. All true principles of law are of divine origin, and when their application becomes necessary in the course of human affairs God does not leave us in ignorance of them, but as a just God, reveals them to us by precepts and examples, to be found in his Holy Word, if we but make the search with an earnest desire to be enlightened.

If, therefore, the principles we contend for are sound and true, we may turn to the Bible in the full expectation of finding, there, their true source; nor shall we be disappointed. We have but to look into the Book of Daniel, the prophet of God and great prime minister, first of the kingdom of Babylon, and afterwards of that of the Medes and Persians erected upon its ruins, to find the principles of law contended for exemplified in both phases of its application: in one phase, in the case of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and in the other phase, in the case of Daniel himself.

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego as joint rulers over the Province of Babylon occupied the highest place in the kingdom a subject could attain, except the office of vicegerent, then filled by Daniel. Though highly honored by Nebuchadnezzar as officers of the law, high in authority, and it being their duty to see the laws of the realm faithfully executed, yet they absolutely refused, at the command of the king, to bow down to the golden image which he had caused to be set up to be worshiped, though they had every reason to believe that punishment sure and swift by the way of death in a fiery furnace would certainly follow. They considered it of little moment what the dire consequences might be to themselves, so long as the principle was maintained that no human law must be obeyed when in derogation of the divine law.

Daniel, the companion of their youth and their associate in earthly honors, escaped this trial of his faith because of his exalted position within the gates near the throne as the king's visible representative and vicegerent. His day of trial, however, was near at hand. The mighty kingdom of Babylon was to perish, and from its crumbling ruins was to rise the still mightier kingdom of the Medes and Persians; and with it arose Daniel, again, to a position of the highest trust and honor as prime minister of Darius the king. And though himself the chief officer of the law, he recognized the principle and observed its practice in continuing to pray to the living God in direct disobedience of the king's edict, and when he knew, too, that unless there was direct interposition of divine power in his behalf, condign punishment would certainly be meted out to him.

The ultimate result of these attempts to enforce the civil law was not to substantiate its absolute supremacy, as might have been expected, but on the contrary, to establish this maxim as a recognized principle of the law of both kingdoms, that it was only supreme when not in derogation of the divine law. We have in these two cases a forcible illustration, in the one of an attempt by civil enactment to enforce the performance of a certain act of religious rite or worship, and in the other an attempt to suppress an act of worship which was being performed in accordance with the dictates of the individual conscience. No distinction is made between the two classes of cases, nor can there be any, each being equally binding upon the conscience.

Under our peculiar system of constitutional government, jurists have attempted to draw a distinction between these two classes of cases, claiming that possibly the first named class might come within the scope and protecting force of the constitutional inhibition, while the latter did not. Such contention is illogical, and cannot be sustained upon any recognized legal principle, either divine or human; for as we have just seen, such distinction is repudiated by the examples taken from the revealed Word of God; and the right of the legislative body to enact laws on that or any other subject is based upon natural law,—which emanates from God,—and not upon any authority delegated by a written constitution, the work of human hands and brains. For it must be remembered, that the power of the State legislature is supreme, except where curtailed by the Constitution; differing in that respect from the Federal Congress which possesses only such powers as are delegated by the States in the Federal Constitution, and has no rights under natural laws, except such as necessarily flow from such delegated authority.

Every law that has ever been enacted by any state legislature on this subject of Sunday observance was conceived in a religious atmosphere, and I fear born in the spirit of religious persecution and bigotry; for no matter how we may seek to disguise the fact under the specious plea of legislation of a civil and not of a religious character, such laws have been invariably called into action by the prevailing religious sentiment of this country as a most potent engine of religious persecution. We honor the prosecution in this case for having thrown off all disguise and taken the position that the question involved is the decision of a religious and not a civil controversy.

This admission of the prosecution is a step in advance of the courts, and in the right direction, and if the judges will only be as honest with themselves and endorse it, it will serve to open the eyes of the law-making power to the true spirit and intent of all this class of legislation; and awaken them to a sense of their duty to sweep from the statute books all such laws which can be prostituted to the purposes of religious persecution by the prevailing religious sentiment of any given community. It has been argued that this abuse of these laws for the purposes of religious persecution, is a mere incident of their administration and at times necessarily attending their proper enforcement. If that is true, and they are capable of being so misused, does not that fact furnish a still greater reason why they should not be permitted longer to remain on the statute books as a dangerous menace to the liberties of the people?

Laws should be made for the protection of the weak against the encroachments of the strong, to protect the minority against the oppressions of the majority. This is the aim and purpose of all written constitutions and should be the spirit which permeates all laws, whether based upon a written constitution or not.

The pages of history abound in examples of the terrible persecutions in which the majority of society indulge when unbridled by constitutional restraints of any kind. We have but to turn to the closing scenes of the French Revolution to call to the cheek of humanity the blush of shame and indignation. Is it altogether within the category of impossibilities that these scenes may again be enacted at our very doors under the blighting hand of religious persecution?

Coming again to the cases at bar. As has already been said, the prosecution has thrown off all disguise, and does not claim that this law is of a civil character, but is religious in all essential characteristics, and in its execution necessarily invites the decision of a religious question. The claim is boldly made that this is a Christian community, and the right exists in the civil authorities to enforce the observance of Sunday, claiming it to be the Christian Sabbath, not only vesting them with the right to determine the question of manner and mode of observance, but also to decide the question of which day is the Sabbath of the Lord, regardless of divine law. This is indeed a move backward towards the Blue Laws of the early days of this century, and unless checked, will lead again to the fires of religious persecution being lighted all along the line and burning fiercer than ever, and the horrors of those days will be again repeated in all their harrowing details. It is passing strange that persons of experience, intelligence and learning cannot see the natural drift of such legislation, and of the attempt to enforce it, viewed in the light and lessons of history. God has visited with his wrath in time every people who have indulged in such persecutions. We need but to look at the fair and fertile countries of South and Central America, and then recall their history for more than a century, and see an example of a people sealed with the wrath of God for the sins of religious persecution.

The prosecution contends that punishment of these defendants for doing a little work on Sunday is not the important issue involved in the case, but it is to teach this obscure sect that they must recognize the sanctity of the Christian Sabbath (meaning Sunday) and learn not to profane it and offend the prevailing religious sentiment of the community. It is not even the open defiance of the law from a secular standpoint, upon which the prosecution claims a verdict of guilty, but it is contended the jury should find the defendants guilty, viewed from a religious standpoint, and thereby put the seal of condemnation upon the entire religious sect to which they belong.

I have endeavored, however imperfectly, to discharge my duty to God, society and these defendants, and now leave the case with you. It remains for you to say by your verdict whether you will lend a helping hand to the devastating flood, or whether you will do your part to stem the backward flow of the tide, which threatens to destroy the last vestige of constitutional government, and bury the liberties of the people beneath the ruins beyond all hope of resurrection until the dawning day of the new heaven and the new earth.
