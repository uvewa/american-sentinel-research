THE resolution drawn up by Congress and signed by President McKinley, in April last, declared that "The people of Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free and independent."

THIS was said when Spanish sovereignty was in force in the island—when that was apparently the only thing which stood between the Cuban people and the independence which was declared to be their right. Now that the obstacle of Spanish rule has been removed, it is apparent just how much real freedom and independence for the Cubans this manifesto contained.

ON the first day of January, 1899, Spanish dominion in the island came to an absolute end by the fiat of that power which had declared the independence of the Cubans before the world. The occasion was a momentous one, and the ceremony of the transfer to a new sovereignty was most impressive. It was the occasion on which the independence that had been asserted for the Cubans, and for which they had so long struggled, became—so far as Spain was concerned—a full reality. But what part in this triumphant ceremony was allowed to the Cubans by the conquering power? The extent of Cuba's share in the occasion was indicated by the presence of a few Cuban officers, who came in the capacity of invited guests. No Cuban troops were allowed to be present, and when the Spanish flag came down from over the Havana fortress, no flag of Cuba libre appeared in its place. That flag was conspicuous only by its absence.

IN this way did the United States make good its declaration that "The people of Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free and independent. For if they were free and independent, when this declaration was made, they were certainly so when Spanish sovereignty in Cuba came to an end, and the ceremonies on that occasion must be harmonized with this fact, if the declaration meant anything at all. But harmony between them cannot possibly be established. The ceremonies indicated the sovereignty of the United States as succeeding to that of Spain, and the full subjection of the Cuban people to the new authority.

NATURALLY, the Cubans were not all quite contented over this treatment by a power which had professed to be their friend. It became evident that some of them were "malcontents." Whereupon General Brooke, the American in command, declared his intention of visiting all such with "absolute annihilation." This suggests nothing so much as the regime of the late Spanish General Weyler.

The attitude of the United States on this occasion cannot be justified on the ground that it was solely a triumph of the American arms. During thirteen years out of the last thirty, the Cuban forces have been in arms against Spain, and but for their work in wearing out the forces and exhausting the resources of Spain, it is more than probable that the brief and victorious campaign at Santiago would not be an accomplished fact to-day. The American army was barely able to compel the surrender of the Spanish forces there before being themselves compelled to surrender to the deadly fever, and had Spain been in condition to make a more vigorous defense, the scale might have balanced in her favor. The American forces only struck the final blow, which the Cubans by heroic sacrifice had made possible; and now, to deprive them of participation in the final triumph, after a longer and more heroic struggle for freedom than that by which America achieved her own independence, and force them instead into the attitude of a conquered people, is a proceeding which speaks volumes concerning the amount of freedom and independence which the conquering nation is likely to bestow upon them.

CUBA at the present time presents a fair field for the enterprising speculator, and with a nation of enterprising speculators ready at hand to take advantage of the opportunities it offers, it is easy to foresee the time when the retention of American authority over Cuba will be imperatively demanded for the protection of the interests of American citizens. In view of all these facts, the day when the Cuban people will be actually "free and independent" as the resolution of Congress declared, is certainly not yet in sight.

Owing to the friction between the Vatican and the Italian government, the former was not invited to participate in the czar's peace congress. To manifest his displeasure at this, the pope, it is reported, has refused to allow Archbishop Ireland to be present as the representative of the United States. We hope he will not reconsider his refusal.
