American colonial government, which is to be set up in the territory taken from Spain, will not be a new experiment. For thirty years the territory of Alaska has been practically a United States colony, and from its government one may fairly judge of the character of the government which will prevail in the new colonies, under American rule. It happens that the bishop of the Russian church in Alaska has just retired from his connection with the church in that territory, and has taken the occasion to address to President McKinley an appeal in behalf of his people there, asking relief from the evils they have suffered in consequence of the gross mis-government which has prevailed up to this time. The memorial is a timely production, and gives food for profitable thought to every advocate of "expansion." It reads as follows:

"Mr. President: Called away by the will of the highest ecclesiastical authority in Russia, I am about to leave forever America and my ministry here, and, in wishing all heavenly and earthly blessings to yourself and to the country of which you are at present the representative, I consider it my duty once more to address to you a few words on a subject not unfamiliar to you, owing to former communications from me, in the hope that these words of mine may find their way to your heart and induce you to take action in a cause dear not to me alone but to all Russia.

"Alaska stands in need of radical reform in all directions. This I wrote to you in a former memorial; this I repeat to you now. It is not enough that certain rights were secured to the country in the Treaty of 1867, by which it was ceded to America by the Russian government; those rights should be protected with firmness by the law and the authorities. A limit must be set to the abuses of the various companies, more especially those of the Alaska Commercial Company, which, for over thirty years, has had there the uncontrolled management of affairs, and has reduced the country's hunting and fishing resources to absolute exhaustion, and the population to beggary and semi starvation. A limit must be set to the abuses of officials who, as shown by the experience of many years, are sent there without any discrimination and exclusively on the recommendation of Alaska's unmovable guardian, Sheldon Jackson. And lastly—Alaska must be delivered from that man. By his sectarian propaganda he has introduced dissension, enmity and iniquity where those evils did not before exist. It was the Orthodox Church which brought the light of truth to that country; why then try to drive her out of it by every means, lawful or unlawful?

"In the name of humanity, of justice and freedom—of those very blessings for the sake of which you declared war against Spain—I make these requests. Will you be acting consistently if while waging war for the liberty of Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines for their human rights you ignore all these things at home, in a part of your own country which has been waiting thirty years for the blessings promised to it? And are not we Russians fully entitled to demand of you for Alaska that in the name of which you have taken up arms against Spain? I have been for seven years the head of the Orthodox Church in America—and, Mr. President, I speak not from hearsay, but from my own observation and experience—knowing, besides, the history of past years anything but superficially. Whatever abnormal facts were pointed out to me by government agents—facts which were generally the product of the abnormal conditions in which our clergy are placed—I uncomplainingly corrected. Now, by the grace of God, there is nothing there, I believe, that could be laid to our charge.

"The only thing which may possibly be brought up against us is that we profess the true faith and have not yet divested ourselves of our sympathies for Russia, the land of our own faith. But is that really sufficient ground for blame and persecution? There is no danger whatever in that to American rule in Alaska, as some persons would perhaps have you believe—if only from the reason that our church never meddles with politics, and our clergy never busied itself, either at home or anywhere else, with intrigues of that sort. We should not be placed on one footing with the Jesuits. Our church allows us only to remonstrate with the highest authority on behalf of the oppressed and innocently suffering, which I have done repeatedly in this case, but never allows us to incite citizens to sedition or treason.

"And at this moment it is exclusively from a sense of duty, not from any other feeling, that I, as the late arch-pastor of a country subject to your jurisdiction, Mr. President, address these words to you. I should feel that I had not fulfilled my mission, my duty before God and my flock, were I to leave my post in America without unburdening my heart to you of what oppresses it at this moment.

"And so, Mr. President, be indulgent and gracious to poor, hapless Alaska, and show to the Orthodox Church there the respect to which it is entitled, if not by its whole record in that country, yet at least by Articles 2 and 3 of the Declaration of 1867.

"Calling down the blessing of God upon you and your country, I beg you will receive the assurance of the respect with which I always have regarded and regard your excellency's person, and with which I sign myself,

"Nicholas,

"A Bishop of the Orthodox Church, late of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands."

The American press is full of talk about the trouble the Government is having with the Philippine "rebels." How did the Filipinos earn that title? Spain has no authority over them, and never had any by right; nor has the United States any right in the islands save that of conquest, which is not recognized as any right by the principles of American government. To assume that the Filipinos are rebels because they do not want a foreign power to conquer and rule over them, does not reflect creditably upon the conceptions of justice and liberty which prevail in this reputed "land of the free."
