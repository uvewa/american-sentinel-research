**THE** province of the human "law-maker" is to be a discoverer and not an inventor. He may invent some "moral" laws of his own, but he cannot improve on the moral legislation of the Creator, which covers every possible point of moral relations. As an inventor in the domain of legislation, no man is ever entitled to a patent.

**THE** Creator of all things made the law for all, and therefore all law is just and perfect, and anything not just and perfect is not law. A bad "law" always sets at naught the real law of the point to which it applies; and to obey the one is synonymous with breaking the other.

**THE** only power that man has of himself is the power to do wrong. The power to do right is a higher power, being the power of God. The power to do one righteous act is superior to the power to do all wrong acts.
