## A Valid Reason.

MR. HOMERULE to Mr. Forcerule: My friend, why do you shoot down these poor savages to whom we have come for their benefit?

MR. FORCERULE (looking at some savages he has killed): I told them to submit to my authority, and as they refused, I had to shoot them.

Mr. H. But might you not have left them alone, even though they did not want to be under your authority?

Mr. F. No, indeed; for if I had, they would probably have got to quarreling and might have killed each other!
