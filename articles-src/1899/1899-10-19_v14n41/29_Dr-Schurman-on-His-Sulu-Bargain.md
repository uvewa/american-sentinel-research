## Dr. Schurman on His Sulu Bargain.

*New York "World."*

Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman is president of Cornell University and one of the foremost educators of American youth. Mr. McKinley sent him to the Philippines as president of a peace commission. In yesterday's *World* Dr. Schurman gave us an account of his visit to the polygamous and slave-holding Sultan of Sulu, and of the bargain he made with that potentate in the name of the American people.

He found this little $3,000-a-year Sultan living in a mansion that reminded him of "the old farm-houses of the New England States"—such, for instance, as those in which Wendell Phillips and Garrison and the other slavery-haters were nurtured. But this "New England farm-house" had its polygamous harem, and its master was the holder of human slaves, and with him Dr. Schurman made a treaty binding the United States to tolerate his harem, to sanction his slave-holding, and to pay him and his chiefs for the maintenance of their harems and their droves of slaves these following sums per month:—

| To the Sultan, - $250 | To Dato Puto, - $60 |
| --- | --- |
| To Dato Rajah Muda, 75 | To Dato Amir Haissin, 60 |
| To Dato Attik, - 60 | To Hadji Butu, - 50 |
| To Dato Calbe, - 75 | To Habib Mura, - 40 |
| To Dato Joakanain, 75 | To Serif Saguin, - 15 |

Speaking of the treaty he made, Mr. Schurman says:—

"Since returning to the United States, I have noticed some criticism of the fact that slavery is permitted to continue in the Sulu group."

"Criticism?" Impossible, Dr. Schurman!

Dr. Schurman continues:—

"Surely no one acquainted with the conditions could criticise this!"

Surely not!

Mr. Schurman further says:—

"Slavery is a recognized institution in the Sulus. If we attempted to take it away there is no telling what might happen. Certainly it would be to our disadvantage."

"Disadvantage?" "No telling what might happen?"

Mr. Schurman adds:—

"So long as peace is maintained we will be wise to let well enough alone."

"Well enough?" Is slavery "well enough?" Is polygamy "well enough?"

Again, Mr. Schurman says:—

"We cannot afford to interfere with their religion and their ancient practises so long as they do not conflict with American authority and government in the islands."

"Ancient practises"—of polygamy and slavery! And "under American authority and government!"

Has Dr. Schurman ever heard of the most strenuous war in history, a war which cost this nation billions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives? Has he ever heard that all this treasure, all this torrent of blood, was the price paid, and paid gladly, that these words might be added to the Constitution of the United States?

"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction."
