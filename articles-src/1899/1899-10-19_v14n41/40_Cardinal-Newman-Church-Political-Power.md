Some letters of Cardinal Newman have recently been published, in one of which occurs the following statement:—

"A large society such as the church, is necessarily a political power, and to touch politics is to touch pitch."

Very true; and to touch pitch is to be defiled. The conclusion is obvious. It is not necessary for any Christian nor for any body of Christians to be defiled; that is self-evident. They can and should let politics and all political methods alone.—Present Truth.
