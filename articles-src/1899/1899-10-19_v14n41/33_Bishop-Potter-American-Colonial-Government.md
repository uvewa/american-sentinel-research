## Bishop Potter on American Colonial Government.

At the Protestant Episcopal Church Congress, in St. Paul, Minn., Bishop Potter, of New York City, delivered an address in which he answered the question, Does national expansion imply imperialism? Some of the salient points of his speech appear in the following quotations:—

"Whatever may be improbable, nothing is more entirely possible than that a nation which still preserves the forms of democratic government may in time subordinate them to methods of its administration which sooner or later will bring the substance of imperialism along with them."

"It would seem at least reasonable that the conquering or purchasing republic should inaugurate its relations to its new possessions by some conference with its dominant peoples. But no. Its first word is 'subjection,' its first demand 'surrender,' its first, second, and third conditions are: 'We will recognize nobody; we will treat with nobody; we alone will dictate all the terms. The policy does not work happily.'"

"The new possessions must be rigorously governed. There must be hosts of troops and scores of governors, and the organization of armies and staffs and military courts for nobody knows just how many islands.

"How are these governments to be constituted? How is the chief ruler of the distant republic, in whom, as it happens, there is vested—at any rate for the time being—really despotic power, to attend to all these matters?

"He happens usually, with us, to have a task on hand—that of securing his own re-election—which naturally absorbs a large share of his time; how can he be expected to neglect it for the care of some wretched islands, mainly peopled, as he is told (though unfortunately for him incorrectly), with a lot of ignorant little 'niggers?'

"Or, rather, if he must give those some sort of attention, how can he make their conquest and government a means of strengthening himself with his party, and binding new adherents to a 'great and spontaneous movement' for his re-election? There are a good many people he knows, whose fidelity to the party is purely a commercial question. There are the sugar interest, and the tobacco interest, and the kite-flying interest—by which I mean every conceivable adventurer who stands ready with his particular scheme in the Philippines—only waiting for the opportunity to exploit it.

"And he, and such as he—for that is the most serious aspect of our whole situation—promulgates the policies of a nation."

"The sources from which platforms, candidates and policies emanate are liable to become more and more controlled by those with whom personal interests are the supreme motives and personal gains the supreme ends.

"It is of course conceivable that in the persons of those to whom these distant governments shall be committed we shall find only the highest ideas and only the most incorruptible integrity. But what are the probabilities? What is the likelihood that there more than anywhere else the stream will rise higher than the source?"

"A cardinal principle of 'government of the people, by the people, for the people,' is that the people shall not be treated like children kept in the dark. A sound public opinion, we say, is the great bulwark of a republic, the foundation stone on which its popularity and prosperity must needs rest.

"In this connection the searching of the mails—the proscription of certain publications and the stifling of correspondence—is one of the most intolerable outrages which a free people has ever suffered; and it is significant, most of all, of the development of a tendency which foreshadows that, whether or not we are likely to have imperialism in our distant possessions in form, we already have it at home in fact.

"It is time that, confronted with such possibilities in connection with our new possessions, we ask, Is it worth while? For, at this point, it needs no gift of prophecy, but only a very moderate knowledge of history, to reveal to us the dangers that threaten us. There lies behind us in its pages the story of a great republic which, by its ever expanding conquests, was lifted into the throne of the sovereignty of the civilized world only to find that the tributaries that had made it great were destined, ere long, to be the instrument of its ruin.

"Now then, the thing that destroyed Rome was the loss of her homogeneity. Our strength to-day consists in the triumph of those great civic ideals which are the property alone of Anglo-Saxon civilization. But if we persist in diluting that civilization too largely, the result needs no prophet to forecast.

"We may have territorial expansion and material prosperity, and for a time, it may be, we shall have that possession which, in the mere dream of it, has begun to inflame our people with a strange inebriety—I mean, world-wide supremacy—but in the winning of it we shall have lost every distinguishing characteristic of a free and self-governing people.

"Is it worth while?"
