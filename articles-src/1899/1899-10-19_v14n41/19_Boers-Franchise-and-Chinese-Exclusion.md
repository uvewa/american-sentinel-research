IF imposing restrictions upon the franchise be a valid cause for war against the Boers, what must be said of the action of the United States Government in excluding the Chinese from American citizenship on any terms, and even from setting foot on American soil? The Transvaal has as good a right to exclude the English as this Government has to exclude the Chinese.
