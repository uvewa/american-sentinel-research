# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, October 19, 1899 (v14n41)

## General Notes

The OCR source file was of good overall quality. The following uncertainties were noted:

---

### Page 6, Article "Military Glory and National Honor"

- **Location:** Near the end of the article, page 7 content
- **Issue:** The word "impertously" appears in the Channing quote: "perhaps its well-being impertously demands continued peace."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "impertously" (preserving as printed)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — This appears to be either an archaic spelling or a OCR rendering of "imperiously." Given the instruction to preserve original spelling exactly, it has been transcribed as it appears in the OCR source.
- **Reason:** Could be OCR error for "imperiously" or an archaic/variant spelling. Preserved as-is per accuracy guidelines.

---

### Page 9, Short Items Section

- **Location:** Transition between the "Is War Consistent With Christianity?—No. 3" article and the short editorial notes
- **Issue:** The OCR source shows bullet points (• • •) separating short items. These were treated as distinct editorial notes and split into individual files (files 16-27 and 35-41).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** HIGH — The items are clearly distinct topical notes.

---

### Page 13, "Pointed Paragraphs" Section

- **Location:** The "Pointed Paragraphs" header precedes a series of attributed short items
- **Issue:** Attribution for individual paragraphs — some have source attributions (e.g., "—Baltimore Herald"), others (the glitter of gold item) have no attribution and were treated as editorial.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** HIGH

---

### Article Numbering for Short Page-1 Items

- **Issue:** The opening page of the issue contains a series of short, unnumbered editorial paragraphs separated by asterism (***) rather than horizontal rules (---). These appear before the first titled article and were treated as individual editorial items (files 01-06).
- **Decision:** Each was given its own file per the instruction that every item, no matter how short, gets its own file.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

---

### "impertously" in Channing Quotation

- **Location:** File 13, "Military Glory and National Honor," in the Channing quotation
- **Transcribed as:** "impertously"
- **Likely intended:** "imperiously"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW for this specific word — preserved as found in OCR source; may warrant comparison with original scan or another source of the Channing text.
