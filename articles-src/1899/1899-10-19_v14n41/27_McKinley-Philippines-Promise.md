The Filipinos, said the President in a recent speech, "will not be governed as vassals or serfs or slaves—they will be given a government of liberty, regulated by law, honestly administered without oppressive exaction, taxation without tyranny; justice without bribe, education without distinction of social conditions, freedom of religious worship and protection in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

Then a good many people in the United States will want to go and live in the Philippines. Such paragon government will not be vouchsafed to Americans at home, it is safe to say.
