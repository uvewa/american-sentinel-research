## The Spawn of Imperialism.

"Springfield Republican."

The war in South Africa is the hideous product of the imperialistic system to which Great Britain, by the immense growth of her dominion, seems committed. To be entirely just to the British people in placing the responsibility for this fierce and sanguinary conflict, one should, perhaps, look beyond the wrangling and the covetousness which have been the immediate preface of the war, and regard the forces which have their play in the ebb and flow of the tide of empire.

A great empire may be compared with a giant monopoly, in that as it continues to grow in size it tends to grow less and less tolerant of small competitors that are obstacles to its complete ascendancy. The larger it grows the greater is the internal pressure to hold absolute sway. And, conversely, the greater it is the less can it endure successful opposition by smaller and less powerful rivals. To illustrate: As a railroad company extends its field the extension of itself involves the absorption of more and more branch lines, "feeders," and parallel systems. As the Standard oil monopoly grew in power the impulse to grow still more powerful increased with each new destruction of a competitor. When a perfect monopoly exists, as in the case of the coinage of money or the control of the postal system by the United States Government, it is found necessary to make even the smallest and most insignificant competition a crime punishable by fine and imprisonment. The Government cannot tolerate competition, because of the imperative necessity to maintain its prestige. And so an empire finds, as it increases in size and power, that this same prestige of "paramountcy" tends to inhibit more and more the independence of smaller concerns which border upon its field of operations. The smallest prick—even that of a needle—will cause the largest balloon to collapse in time; and so, in huge empires, the question of "paramountcy" assumes in the minds of the empire's supporters the character of self-defense.

There seems something very absurd in the idea that the British in fighting the small Boer republics of South Africa are acting in self-defense, yet to the British imperialist mind that is evidently what it all amounts to. First, it is a question of "paramountcy" in South Africa, or making sound the monopoly; then it easily becomes a question of defense, since the monopoly balloon must have no pinholes in its huge inflated sides. When the situation appeals to a great government in that light they soon find themselves, like the managers and legal counsel of industrial monopolies or huge corporations, disregarding law and even justice in the effort to maintain and strengthen their grasp. In the case of the Transvaal the British government has not a sound legal basis for interference in that State's domestic affairs. The empire, however, like a growing monopoly, must absorb its small rival by hook or crook in order to remain an empire. With empires, therefore, such as Great Britain's, territorial extension becomes a habit of their natures, and wars, however shocking to the moral sense of individuals, are often the accompaniment of imperial growth.

These wars are the loathsome spawn of imperialism. They often set back civilization rather than forward, because the empire frequently comes in contact with states or races which may be hardy, wholesome growths, or well fitted in their way to be ascendant in their own habitats. But patience is not a characteristic of either monopolies or empires. They must rule at the first opportunity. Opposition must be beaten down if it will not timidly yield. Thus confusion precedes fusion in order that the monopolistic empire may stalk on its way unchallenged.

In South Africa the world now sees an excellent example of an imperialistic war brought on because the monopolizing power could not patiently await fusion without confusion, but must force a collision in order to hasten its undisputed mastery. The slaughter, the destruction, the legacy of hates between two civilized white races which this war will bring must be charged up against imperialism—that imperialism which tries to monopolize the control of all races, however heterogeneous, and all lands, however distant from the seat of the empire's power.

The logical tendency of this imperialism is to strive to make the whole earth subject to one power. Such a tendency must involve gigantic wars between rival monopolizers, wars which must prove destructive to an unprecedented degree.
