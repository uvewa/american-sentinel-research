**MAN** does not exist to direct law; but law exists to direct man. The law existed before man was created.

**MAN** cannot make law. He cannot make a law of nature, and he cannot make a moral law. It would be as easy to make the one as the other. The moral sphere was no more left without law at creation than was the physical sphere. And as man can only discover and apply physical laws, or laws of nature, so also he can but discover and apply the laws of morality. The law of gravitation is no older than the law against murder or any other act destructive of rights.
