# The Issue between England and the Boers.

A GREAT mass meeting of citizens was held in Carnegie Hall, this city, the 11th inst., to express sympathy with the Boers in their struggle for independence. Mayor Van Wyck presided, and in a brief address stated the substance of the events which have led up to the present situation. The facts of this history make plain the hypocrisy of Great Britain in trying to cover up her imperialism by talk about the grievances of the "Uitlanders":

"In the 1815 division of the world, Cape Colony was transferred by Holland to England. They finally, to avoid oppression, trekked one thousand miles in the wilderness from time to time and place to place, until they crossed the River Vaal, into the most sterile part of that continent, known as 'no man's land,' and disowned by the English.

"They were there in search of peace, the right to govern themselves, wrest a living from the ungrateful soil and live under the laws of their own making. This religious, domestic, industrious and agricultural people had to struggle time and time again against the savage, but in the end made the Transvaal blossom.

"In 1854 England, finding nothing in this God-forsaken land worth her consideration, hauled down the British flag, acknowledging the absolute independence of the Boers.

"In the seventies the Kimberley diamond mines were discovered on the edge of the Orange Free State. England claimed them as purchased from a black chief, and the Free State surrendered them.

"On April 12, 1877, England seized the Transvaal and told the Boers to trek it again. But they were so surrounded they could move on no further, so they revolted, and on Dec. 16, 1880, issued a declaration of independence. . . .

"On Jan. 28, 1881, they defeated the English at Laing's Neck, their battle of Saratoga. Feb. 26, 1881, they defeated the English at Majuba Hill, another Yorktown for England.

"On March 21, 1881, a treaty was entered into reserving to England a limited suzerainty. In 1884 another treaty was entered into in which the word suzerainty was dropped and absolute independence was granted, except that the Transvaal agreed not to make treaties with other neighboring countries, except the Orange Free State, without England's coöperation. Once again the Boers were happy.

"In 1885 the gold mines were discovered in the Transvaal, now producing one-third of the gold product of the world. The nomads of the mining camps of the globe hastened to these new fields in such numbers that there were soon three of them to one Boer.

"In the meantime Cecil Rhodes had made one big chartered trust of the Kimberly mines, the most valuable business enterprise of the world, and, desiring to do the same with the Transvaal gold fields, inspired the Jameson invaders in their attempt to overthrow the Dutch Republic. They were defeated, in 1896, at the battle of Doornkoop, their battle of New Orleans.

"Rhodes conceived a new scheme for the control of the Transvaal. The English government demanded the enfranchisement of the miners and the use of the English language in the Volksraad (Congress).

"The refusal to surrender their country to the mining camps is the only cause of war that the history of the present controversy discloses."
