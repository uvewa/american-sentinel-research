While the Administration is bolstering up imperialism by licensing slavery and polygamy and by spending American money to indulge these Oriental savages in concubines, American women are trying to have Roberts unseated because he has two families. The situation is an awkward one for persons who prefer to be consistent. Perhaps Dr. Schurman could suggest a way out.—Buffalo Enquirer.
