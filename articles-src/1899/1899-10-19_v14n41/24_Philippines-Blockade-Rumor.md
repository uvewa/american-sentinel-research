A PAPER which ardently supports the policy of Philippine conquest, makes note of the fact that "There is a rumor that certain European powers are preparing to object to our blockade of the Philippines, and to follow up their objection with a joint note asking how soon we expect the islands to be pacified," and inquires, "If we have not pacified a belt four miles wide in eight months, what sort of answer shall we give to the question?"
