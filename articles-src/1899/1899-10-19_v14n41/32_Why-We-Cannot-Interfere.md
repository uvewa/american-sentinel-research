# Why We Cannot Interfere.

*"Boston Post."*

The real reason is that the United States is engaged in the same business in the Malay Archipelago that Great Britain is engaged in in South Africa. Furthermore, the United States, as we see it, is acting with less provocation than England has received.

In this Mr. McKinley certainly preserves consistency. He cannot put himself in the attitude of deploring the conquest of coveted territory by Great Britain, while engaging this country in a war of conquest for like aggrandizement. He cannot affect horror at the shooting of Boers in South Africa for the purpose of establishing the suzerainty of Great Britain over that republic, while killing Filipinos in Luzon for the purpose of establishing the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines. And, to be consistent, he must not only refuse to offer mediation but must warn the Dutchmen who are preparing to fight for their independence that he will stem to no appeal which may come from them asking the moral support of the American Republic.
