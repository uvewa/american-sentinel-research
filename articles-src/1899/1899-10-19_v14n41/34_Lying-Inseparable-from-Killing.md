"A PROMINENT religious journal," says a religious exchange, "finds fault with the Speaker's Commentary for the following note found in it:—

"'Untruth has been held by all moralists to be justifiable towards a public enemy. Where we have a right to kill, much more have we a right to deceive by stratagem.'

"Why not? If man may set aside the sixth commandment, may he not also ignore the eighth? As a matter of fact, it would be absolutely impossible for any military operations to be 'successful' if the leaders adhered strictly to the truth. Lying is inseparably connected with killing. The error of the commentary lies in the assumption that it is right to kill. As a general thing, the code of 'moralists' is entirely different from that of the Bible. Too much of the 'morality' of this age consists in the justification of one evil because of the existence of another."
