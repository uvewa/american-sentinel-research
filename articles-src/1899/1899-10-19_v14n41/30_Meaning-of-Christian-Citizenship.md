# The Meaning of "Christian Citizenship."

*"Silver Creek Times." (Nebr.)*

RECENTLY in Chicago Rev. F. G. Strickland delivered a lecture under the auspices of the Christian Citizenship League. He said: "We must put our Christianity into practise and vote and work as we pray. The great political parties of to day are tied up with the powers of evil, and we can expect nothing from them. We must cut loose from these parties and establish a political party of our own, its foundation to be the gospel of Christ.

Such talk is revolutionary, tending as it does to the destruction of one of the foundation principles of this Government, namely, the separation of church and state, and in practise would be an evasion of that clause of the Constitution which reads, "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States," for a political party organized on the basis proposed would inevitably require that candidates for office should be members of some orthodox church.

But such a party would also be destructive of Christianity itself if it should ever bid fair to become a majority party, for the reason that in such case graceless and supremely rotten politicians all over the country would make haste to get converted and join that party and it would soon become one of the worst parties that ever existed, and Christianity would be just as bad. Let us hope that the Christian Citizenship League will be of few days and full of trouble if it is to follow the advice of Rev. Strickland.
