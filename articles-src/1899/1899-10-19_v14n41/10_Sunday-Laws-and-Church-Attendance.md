## Sunday Laws and Church Attendance.

Do we need Sunday laws in order that the American workingman may be able to get the physical rest that he needs, and an opportunity which he would gladly improve if he had it, to attend Sunday church services? That we do, is the impression studiously fostered by most of those working for reform in Sunday observance. But a different view is taken by a leading daily paper of this city, which we commend as being in harmony with reason and the testimony of observed facts:

"The Rev. Dr. Hillis, of Plymouth Church, in Brooklyn, explains the disposition to avoid church services on Sunday by attributing it to the 'tremendous pressure of work,' we Americans being 'extremists in all respects.' Why, then, are we not extremists in church going?

"The talk about Americans overworking themselves, however, is nonsense. They work no harder than other people, Frenchmen, Germans, or Englishmen, and they now take more rest from labor than ever before. There are more holidays, the hours of work have been shortened and half of Saturday is a time of rest preparatory to Sunday.

"If people do not go to church as much as formerly their neglect of divine worship is not excusable on the ground that they are now too tired to go, and we are surprised that a Christian minister should suggest it in behalf of the delinquents, for even if it was true that they are worked too hard during the week that would not be a valid excuse for their disregarding a religious duty. The truth, however, is that the very churches which are most crowded on Sundays are those frequented by the hardest workers, so far as physical labor goes.

"Apart from positive illness when people stay away from church it is not because they are too much exhausted to go to divine service, but because they do not care to go. If they are impelled by a lively faith and a strict sense of duty to attend their churches, if they feel that their souls' salvation is made the more secure by such attendance, they do not stay at home on the pretext that they have worked too hard during the week to be able to offer their prayers to God on Sunday. Let there be a revival of religion, such, for instance, as the great awakening in 1857, and there will not be room enough in the Brooklyn churches to hold the throngs anxious for their souls' welfare."
