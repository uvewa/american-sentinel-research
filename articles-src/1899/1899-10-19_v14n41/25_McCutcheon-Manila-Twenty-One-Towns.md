"According to Mr. McCutcheon, the Manila correspondent of the Chicago Record, we have captured and abandoned twenty-one towns, some of them several times each, and in one case six times. Macabebe, the only town whose people were our friends, we took and then deserted, leaving it to be burned by the insurgents."
