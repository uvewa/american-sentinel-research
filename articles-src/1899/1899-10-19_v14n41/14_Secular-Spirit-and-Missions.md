## The Secular Spirit and Missions.

[From "A Great Crisis in the Work of Missions," by A. T. Pierson, D.D., in the World's Harvest Number of the Signs of the Times.]

The prevalence of the secular spirit always, therefore, brings the decay of the spirit of missions. The church, like the individual, has its body and spirit, its links with time and with eternity, and when the temporal is unduly magnified, the eternal is correspondingly belittled. Man not only reflects that toward which he is habitually turned, but he retains the image. The carnal mind is the sensitive mirror which, turned downward, has taken on the image of the earthly; the spiritual mind is the mirror which, turned upward, has received the impression of the heavenly.

Is not church life essentially secular? Wealth, fashion, fame, formalism, culture, caste, polite society, worldly opinion, intellectuality, have crowded out simple worship, self-denial, passion for souls, devoutness of spirit, spirituality, and whole-souled devotion to God. Is not dependence on the material and temporal, devotion to the esthetic in art and architecture, music and dress, far more regnant than the Spirit of God in the practical administration of church life? Devout souls can give but one melancholy answer.

In a worldly church, if the work of missions survives, the spirit of missions is quenched; the body of organization lacks the soul of Holy Ghost inspiration, and the work is carried on in the energy of the flesh.
