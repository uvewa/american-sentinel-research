## The Point of View.

The point of view is a very essential matter in obtaining a correct conception of the thing that is viewed. As a half truth is generally a whole lie, so the point of view which discloses only a half truth about something is one that leads the observer into complete error. This is illustrated in the following which we note in an exchange:—

"Dr. Woolsey recently performed a new sort of operation on an idiot child's skull at Bellevue Hospital, in this city, for the purpose of curing idiocy. The child died, and the doctor said: 'The operation was entirely successful from my point of view. The only trouble was that the child had not sufficient vitality to stand the shock.'

"The only trouble was that the operation killed the child. Now, if Christian Scientists are to be prosecuted for manslaughter whenever a patient dies on their hands, notwithstanding that the patient wants to die that way, and that the healer does nothing to kill him, what shall be done with Dr. Woolsey? We might say of the Christian Science patient that he might have lived had it not been for what the healer didn't do to him. But in the other case the boy would certainly be alive to-day had not it been for what Dr. Woolsey did to him. Custom is a mighty thing and habits of thought are hard to break."
