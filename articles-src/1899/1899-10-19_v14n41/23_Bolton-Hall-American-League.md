BOLTON HALL, a son of the late Rev. Dr. John Hall, of New York City, has announced the formation of a new anti-expansion organization, of which he is the temporary secretary, to be known as "The American League." The objects of the League, as stated by Mr. Hall, are to "curb, if possible, the military spirit and to retain the American spirit, which up to 1898 had guided the people of the United States." The league has an office on Broadway, in this city.
