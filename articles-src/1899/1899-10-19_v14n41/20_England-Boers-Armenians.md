ENGLAND claims that she is forced to make war upon the Boers because their government is unjust and behind the times. A few years ago a government which beyond all doubt was unjust, even rotten, and unprogressive to the last degree, was in addition to all this, engaged in slaughtering Armenian men, women, and children, by the tens of thousands, yet somehow England did not feel called upon to interfere. Allowing that the Boer government is unjust, why is England called upon to subjugate an unjust government in South Africa, and leave unmolested an indescribably worse one nearer home? To see this fine distinction it is necessary to have a glittering gold piece held before the eye.
