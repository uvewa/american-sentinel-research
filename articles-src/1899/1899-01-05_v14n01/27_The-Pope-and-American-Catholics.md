To THE editor of an Italian political journal, Philippe Tonelli, who acts also as correspondent for a New York paper, the pope, in a recent interview, expressed his hope of seeing America "enter entire into the bosom of the Catholic Church," and added, "It is marching into it with rapid strides." Think of that, friends of American liberty! And the pope did not make that statement at random. He had reliable data to back it up; that is certain.
