"Cecil, we must not be too hard upon men who persecute others. Right in connection with Stephen's martyrdom, we have an example of a man who was honestly in the wrong, and who verily believed that he was doing God service in haling men and women to prison."

"I rather think he had his eyes partly opened that day. How could he have looked on the death of Stephen and remained a persecutor?"

"And yet, Cecil, it was not Stephen's death that opened his eyes; for we read that in the great persecution that broke out in Jerusalem, Saul entered into every house to find heretics. It worked good for the cause of truth; for it sent Christ's followers abroad to proclaim his power. The power was made manifest in miracles, in the casting out of devils, in the healing of the sick, and in the great joy among the people. Even this exhibition failed to convince Saul, and breathing out slaughter, he went to the high priest for letters to authorize him to go to Damascus, to hunt out heretics and bring them bound to Jerusalem for punishment."

"That is so, Aleck. How hard it seems for me to truly take in the thought that divine illumination is essential to know and sustain truth."

"Well, let's study Saul's change of mind. It ought to give us great courage; for God is no respecter of persons, and can as marvelously illuminate our darkness as he did Saul's. If a miracle is necessary, we will have a miracle. How was Paul converted?"

"Just before he reached Damascus, a great light shined on him from heaven. He fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying, 'Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?'"

"What a question that was, Cecil. Christ suffers with his followers. In his ministry he had spoken of the poor, the outcast, the stranger, the sick, and the prisoner, and had said, 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me.' But Christ knew Saul's ignorance of this fact. How many who to-day are unkind, uncharitable, or even cruel are as ignorant as he, as to where their cruelty reaches. What answer had Saul for this question?"

"Who art thou, Lord?"

"How pathetic that is! But the darkness was then to be dispelled. The honest questioner will always have the true answer. 'I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest; it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.'"

"It must be hard to be so set against men. I know I have never yet said a sharp word or done an unkind thing to another that has not pierced my own soul. How the grief is accounted for on the ground that it not only wounds the human soul; but pierces the breast of Christ. Sin does become exceeding sinful."

"How did Saul receive this revelation?"

"He trembled, and was astonished, and asked, 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?' That was the first time, I imagine, that he felt his insufficiency or asked anything of divine wisdom."

"God gave him time to realize his weakness. For three days he was sightless. For three days he fasted and prayed. God worked in his soul, as he says, mightily. Human strength was weakness. God connected him to himself, and he who had come to Damascus with credentials from men, was now to be ordained of God to oppose the power he had sought, to be a chosen vessel to reveal Christ to the world! What a change! Cecil, we need the spirit of Stephen. One at least who consented to his death shared the answer to his prayer. Now God would bring him among his people. How did they receive him?"

"Ananias was at first very fearful, so were the other apostles; but God did not leave them to their human and natural conclusions. Saul was not yet ready for the great work for which he was chosen. He had seen a great light, he had realized his sinfulness and weakness; but he had not yet received the Holy Ghost. This was to come to him through the ministry of Ananias. Through him he received his sight and was filled with the Holy Ghost."

"The same change is seen in him then as in the apostles. The people are astonished, dismayed; for Saul the persecutor is Paul the mighty advocate of truth."

"How about his former friends now?"

"They were gone," said Cecil. "In fact it was not long before they took counsel to kill him, and would have accomplished their purpose if the disciples had not planned his rescue in letting him down over the wall in a basket. But Saul had a peculiar experience in suffering. He was cast out by the Jews then, and the followers of Christ would not receive him. He had a dose of his own medicine to take the first thing."

"Surely; for God said he was called not only to believe but to suffer. He said, 'I will show him how great things he must suffer for my sake.'"

"Aleck, this has been a great lesson to me. I realize more and more how much I need the Spirit of Christ. Christ himself prayed for his murderers, as Stephen for his, and yet I am ready to be indignant and even vindictive to those who wrong me or others. The change must come to me that came to the early followers of Christ, or I am none of his."
