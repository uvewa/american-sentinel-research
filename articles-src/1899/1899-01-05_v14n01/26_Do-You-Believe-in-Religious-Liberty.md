Do you believe in religious liberty? Do you believe in religious liberty for others as well as for yourself? Do you prize such liberty enough to make any effort to help preserve it? Do you prize it enough so that it is a matter of interest to you to keep track of the efforts being made in this land for its overthrow? If you can answer these questions in the affirmative, what reason can you give for not being a reader of the AMERICAN SENTINEL during 1899?
