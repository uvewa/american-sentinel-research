# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, January 5, 1899 (v14n01)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from a Mistral OCR file. Overall quality was good. The following uncertainties were noted:

---

## Page 2 (article 03)

- **Location:** "America's Right to the Philippines," paragraph about Cuba
- **Issue:** The OCR shows "op-pressor" and "in-justice" with line-break hyphens. These have been joined as "oppressor" and "injustice" in the transcription.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — standard line-break hyphenation, clearly correct.

---

## Page 10 (article 12)

- **Location:** "The Crime of Sunday Golf," final sentence
- **OCR text:** "the Sunday laws are not calculated either to enforce justice or uphold the dignity of a w itself."
- **Issue:** The phrase "a w itself" appears to be a truncated OCR reading. The word before "itself" is almost certainly "law" — this reads "the dignity of a law itself."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — context makes "law" virtually certain; the "w" is a partial OCR read of "law."
- **Transcribed as:** "the dignity of a law itself"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — context is unambiguous.

---

## Page 11 (article 14)

- **Location:** Header area — "ELLIOTIS HIBERTY / CONG PROPLE"
- **Issue:** These appear to be garbled OCR of a section header or column title (possibly "RELIGIOUS LIBERTY" or similar decorative text). They are not article content and have been omitted from the transcription.
- **Confidence:** HIGH that these are not substantive content; identity of the original text uncertain.

## Author Notes

- **F. E. B.** (Frances E. Bolton) — initials appear at end of "The War of Principle.—No. 13" (page 11). The poem "The Carping Pharisee" (page 4) is attributed "BY FRANCES E. BOLTON" in full. Both assigned author_short "FEB." This author is NOT in the standard known-authors list; flagging as new contributor.
- **C. H. Keslake** — author of "The Holy Spirit and Sunday.—No. 18." Not in the standard known-authors list; flagging as new contributor. Assigned author_short "CHK."

## Structure Notes

- The "NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT" section (pages 8–9) contains two distinct thematic clusters, split into articles 10 and 11: the Congressman Roberts/polygamy/church-state items, and the Archbishop Ireland/peace-congress items.
- The back page (page 16) editorial notes were split into individual articles (16–29), each as its own file, per project guidelines.
- The page 13 "TO OUR PATRONS" block (subscription/remittance instructions) was treated as boilerplate and omitted.
- Book advertisements on pages 13–15 (Looking Unto Jesus, By Land and Sea, The Desire of Ages, Two Republics, Books We Can Recommend) were omitted as advertisements.
