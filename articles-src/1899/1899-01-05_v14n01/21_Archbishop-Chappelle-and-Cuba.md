A PRESS dispatch dated at Washington, December 25, says that it is "the President's desire to see Archbishop Chappelle appointed papal delegate to the island of Cuba. The President was anxious to have the interests of the Catholic Church in Cuba looked after on behalf of the pope by a cleric who would understand American motives and institutions." The President's wish in this matter was communicated to the pope through Archbishop Ireland, and the pope, it is asserted, has acceded to the request. The pope has no official directly accredited to this Government, but this fact seems not to hinder him greatly in conducting negotiations with it.
