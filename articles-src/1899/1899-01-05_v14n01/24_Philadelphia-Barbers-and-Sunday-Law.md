IN Philadelphia recently twelve barbers were arrested and fined for doing business on Sunday, the fine in each case being $4. They were convicted under the old Sunday law of Pennsylvania, which, as the court was reminded by the attorney for the defense, prohibited paid choirs in churches; street railway service on Sundays, etc. The agitation for Sunday enforcement is daily becoming more general, and no "law" is too obsolete or too contrary to modern enlightenment and progress to be overlooked as an instrument for furthering the cause.
