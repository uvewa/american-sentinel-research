CARDINAL GIBBONS, in behalf of the papacy, has petitioned Congress, says a Washington dispatch, asking that the question of the contract school system be reopened, and that "Congress again go over the whole subject of Indian education." To be plain, he simply asks that Congress resume the policy of appropriating public money to support Catholic Indian schools.
