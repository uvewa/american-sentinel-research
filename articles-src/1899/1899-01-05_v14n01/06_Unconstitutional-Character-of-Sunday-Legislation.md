Speech delivered by Judge Arthur, late of the Supreme Court of Washington, at a trial for violation of the Sunday law, at Centerville, Md.

Under the laws of Maryland, you, gentlemen of the jury, are made the judge of both the law and fact in all criminal prosecution; hence in the case at bar it is your duty, first, to determine what is the law, and next, to say by your verdict whether the proven facts bring the defendants within its penalties. I shall claim your attention while briefly presenting the law of the case, incidentally alluding to the facts only where, and in so far, as it may be necessary to carry the argument, leaving their discussion chiefly to my colleague.

If the act complained of has no direct tendency to demoralize society or disturb the good order of the State, or endanger its safety, or infringe upon the laws of morality, or injure another in his natural, civil or religious rights, and is performed in the conscientious discharge of what the individual believes to be some divinely-imposed duty, or in the exercise of some religious rite or ceremony, whether it be the performance of common labor on the first day of the week, or some other manifestation of this religious conscientiousness, it is not a proper subject for legislative interference. I maintain this as a correct statement of a principle of American jurisprudence that will in time, in my judgment, prevail in every state of this Union, if civil and religious liberty are here to find their true exponents.

I am aware the great weight of authority in this country is on the side of the proposition that legislation on the subject of Sunday observance and such like, is not an encroachment upon the constitutional rights of a citizen, but is a proper exercise by the legislature of its general police powers to preserve the health and promote the morals of the general public.

Concede that the legislature has authority under such police power to enact laws restricting the right of a citizen to perform acts of common labor whenever and to whatever extent he wishes, whenever in its judgment such legislation becomes necessary to preserve the health or promote the morals of the community, still it does not follow that if common labor is performed upon the first, or any other day of the week in the discharge of a sacred duty, conscientiously believed to be divinely imposed, and as an exercise of religious faith and worship, that such labor so performed should be comprehended by such enactment. It might come within the purview of such a law, but for its distinctive characteristic of being a religious practice, worship or homage, as variously denominated in the different constitutions of the several states. To plead and show that the work performed is of such a character is a complete answer to any prosecution under this class of laws.

It might be kept in mind, the right of a state legislature to enact laws by virtue of its general police powers does not rest upon delegated authority, but upon its supreme power and authority as the sovereign representative of the people, except in so far as limited by constitutional inhibition. The constitution of Maryland contains just such a constitutional limitation upon the power of the legislature to enact laws of a religious character under the guise and pretext of the exercise of general police powers, having for its sole and only purpose and object the enforced observance of the first day of the week as a religious practice and duty. The thirty-sixth section of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Maryland provides: "That, as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him, all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore, no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practice, unless, under the color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil or religious rights." And while it is not now contended that this provision restricts the authority of the legislature in the exercise of general police powers to enact laws providing stated periods of enforced rest from common labor or the ordinary business affairs of life, it is most strenuously and earnestly insisted that it is intended to be understood as providing whenever such enforced rest or idleness does violence to the religious conscience of a citizen, and interferes with the free exercise of his religious faith and profession in the way of some practice, worship, or otherwise, such laws, to that extent, are inoperative and void, whether the legislature saw fit in accordance with the spirit of the constitution to incorporate in it such exceptions or not.

This provision of the constitution of Maryland was expressly designed to prevent this much-abused power, with its limits undefined and uncertain, from being prostituted to the purpose of religious persecution. The fundamental error of all the adjudicated cases upholding Sunday-observance legislation, is the failure of the courts to appreciate the full force and meaning of this constitutional exception, carved out of the general police powers of the legislature, which power is alone invoked when such laws are enacted.

To the Sabbath-keeper the divine command, "Six days shalt thou labor," is mandatory, and of as much binding force on his conscience as the divine command, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;" to observe both strictly is a religious practice, and an exercise of his religious faith and worship, and it would be just as consistent to say he could be compelled by command of the civil law to labor on the Sabbath in opposition to his religious convictions, as to contend he must refrain from labor on Sunday.

Would it not be an exercise of authority along exactly the same lines, if a law were enacted requiring the Sunday-keeper to do common labor or ordinary business on Sunday against his religious convictions? Will it be contended for one moment that such a law would be constitutional? Where is the distinction between the two classes of cases? in the one you require a person to do something against his religious conscience, and in the other you require him to refrain from doing something equally against his religious conscience. Here is clearly a distinction without a difference. Nor does the constitution leave it either to the legislature or the courts to define or determine what particular acts or class of acts shall constitute religious practices or acts of worship, but itself defines the scope and limit beyond which it must not go. Whether this limit in any given case has been exceeded and the right of the State or any particular individual or class of individuals has been invaded is a question solely for judicial determination, controlled by certain fundamental principles hereafter to be alluded to.

It follows, then, that to bring the act of an individual or class of individuals, performed in the exercise of a religious practice or rite, within the penalties of the law in question, it must be charged and shown that the doing of the act disturbed the public good, peace, or safety of the State, or infringed the laws of morality, or injured the natural, civil or religious rights of another, or as contained in the act itself, was not a work of charity or necessity, none of which was shown or attempted to be shown in the case at bar.
