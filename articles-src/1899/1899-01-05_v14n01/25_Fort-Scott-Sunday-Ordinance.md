AS A result of a war which has been waged against Sunday barbering in Fort Scott, Kans., says the Louisville Evening Post, one of the city aldermen has proposed in the city council for enactment the following ordinance:

"It shall be unlawful for any person within this city to work, act, or be engaged on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a barber, manager of baths, employe in a railway shop, butcher, preacher receiving compensation for his services, baker, saloon man, motorman on a street car, confectioner, news dealer, bootblack, hack or carriage driver for pay, electrician, printer or newspaper editor, proofreader, reporter, or a domestic servant."

It is hardly likely that this proposed ordinance will receive the support of the Fort Scott clergy.
