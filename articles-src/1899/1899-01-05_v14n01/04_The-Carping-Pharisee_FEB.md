BY FRANCES E. BOLTON.

When Jesus was with us, O do ye not ken
That it was not the common-place faction
Of work-a-day women and work-a-day men
That hindered his soul-loving action:
But a carping, dry set of cold Pharisees,
Who thought themselves wonderfully pious,
Who looked on the Saviour with jealousy's eyes,
And measured his life by their bias.

One day as the Master came on through the corn,
His disciples plucked corn grains to eat them,
And the Pharisees drew down their visage in scorn,
And with withering blame stopped to greet them.
"Behold what your followers do on this day,
It is something unquestionably awful;
For to-day is the Sabbath, and we're zealous to say,
That their actions are wholly unlawful."

And the Lord of the Sabbath who made it for man,
Cut straight to the core of their sneering,
And laid out before them God's merciful plan,
That hindered their bold interfering.

For the Sabbath was made for man's good from above,
And his action to this was a witness,
And he said, "If ye knew of God's mercy and love,
Ye'd have never laid blame on the guiltless."

And is the world rid of the cold pharisee?
Or do we still hear the old carping?
There is somebody making a dreadful tee dee
And forever and evermore harping
About what is lawful, and about what is not,
And with eyes cruel-keen in inspection,
All ready to see and to put in the stocks
Any one that he thinks in defection.

Whose day is the Lord's day? we humbly inquire.
To whom must we yield or not yield it?
If men obey not, tread it down in the mire,
Who has given you the order to shield it?
Let God guard his own; you give heed to his law,
Lest there come upon you a disaster,
And for ordering another man's servant, with awe
You hear a rebuke from the Master.

For God from Mount Sinai spake this true word,
"The seventh day thou shalt keep holy;"
But you've changed the true day, and your spirit is stirred
'Gainst those who obey and are lowly.
Your tradition makes void God's commandment, as when
The Saviour said, "Vain is your witness."
Know more of God's mercy and love unto men,
And you'll cease to lay blame on the guiltless.
