ARCHBISHOP IRELAND, it is announced, will represent the United States at the czar's coming peace congress. A New York paper states that "Ever since his induction into office the President has been anxious to testify his appreciation of Archbishop Ireland's Republicanism, which took the form of strong interviews and speeches made during the campaign of 1896." Now the opportunity has come for him to do this, by making him the national representative at this extraordinary international gathering.

THAT this papal prelate took an active part in the political campaign of '96, on the Republican side, is well known; and doubtless he did much to put the President's party under obligation to himself. That is what papal prelates, and prelates of other churches also, go into politics for. They expect to reap a substantial advantage from it for the religious organization which they represent.

IF this appointment is made, it will be an honor paid by this Government to the Catholic Church. There is nothing far-fetched about this conclusion; the truth of it is perfectly plain. Archbishop Ireland cannot represent the United States at the peace conference, simply because he does not represent it here. He represents the papacy, and that only; and so long as he remains a prelate of that church, he can represent nothing else.

CAN any one seriously suppose that the pope would sanction for so important an office as that of archbishop, a man who would place any other interests before those of the church of which the Roman pontiff is the head? Whoever believes that Archbishop Ireland is an American citizen first and a Roman Catholic official second, is ignorant of the first principles upon which the papacy is built.

FIRST, last, and always, an archbishop of the Catholic Church represents that church and works for its advancement. And in so doing he cannot possibly represent or work for a republican government. He cannot possibly do otherwise than work directly against such a government, for the plain reason that the papacy is a system altogether contrary in character to republican government. It is a system embodying principles exactly the opposite of those announced in the Declaration of Independence and the national Constitution. It is a system which embodies a union of church and state, denies the fundamental human right of liberty of conscience, and utterly repudiates the doctrine of "government of the people, by the people, for the people," affirming in its place the doctrine of government of the people by the pope of Rome and his subordinates. It is a system which brought France to the French Revolution, and Spain to the ruin in which she lies to-day. It is a system which aims to subordinate every government to the papacy, to disintegrate every government until the power and authority of government the world over, both civil and spiritual, shall be in the hands of the pope and prelates of Rome.

FOR this system Archbishop Ireland, like every other archbishop, is diligently working. So long as he adheres to the principles of the papacy, he must work for it, for those principles do not admit of anything else. And therefore it is perfectly plain, as stated, that Archbishop Ireland cannot represent the United States Government either at home or abroad; and if in anything he does represent this Government, he does it not in the interests of this Government, but in the interests of the Catholic Church. He will represent nothing where the interests of that church are not the primary consideration.

And therefore, to make this prelate of Rome the representative of the American Republic at the international congress called by the czar, will be to honor the papacy, and in proportion as that is honored to humiliate the Government which stands for civil and religious freedom. Will the American people make no protest to this continued national obeisance to the papacy?
