SEVERAL prominent citizens of Norwalk, Conn., were recently brought into court and fined each $2 and costs, for having broken the Sunday law of that State by indulging in a game of golf.

The Sunday law was put into operation in the cases by a grand juror named Dauchy, who also conducted the prosecution. The defense was conducted by lawyer Kenealy. The spirit of the proceeding appears in the following extract from the account given by the New York Sun. It should be added in explanation that the Sunday law of Connecticut prohibits sport, but allows recreation. The defense, of course, naturally took advantage of this fine distinction to claim that the acts complained of were recreation, which the prosecution was obliged to disprove. We quote:

"Kenealy then delivered an oration on the shamefulness of dragging his clients into court and branding them as criminals, because they had taken a little needed exercise on Sunday. 'It's poor business, too,' he declared. 'Towns with accessible golf links were going to have the call with New York people, and if you drive the golf players out of here they're going to go somewhere else. This job you've done is mighty small business, and it's just to gratify personal spite.'

"His long and able argument clinched lawyer Kenealy's case with the audience, and disturbed the judge somewhat, but it didn't feaze Dauchy a little bit.

"I, as a grand juror, class that golf playing as sport," he declared, in his stiffest dignity. "Playing golf is nothing but playing the game. It's a disgrace to have that game going on when people are going to and from church. I shall have more complaints, whichever way your honor decides, and perhaps we can reach them in some way."

"The grand juror is under a misapprehension about this," said Kenealy. "He supposed a game was going on, whereas these men were only exercising."

"Then chopping wood would be recreation?" asked the judge.

"That's a necessity," interposed Dauchy, "but this thing was sport; I can't see it in any other way."

"I suppose you'd arrest a man for playing marbles or playing the piano on Sunday," remarked Kenealy.

"Yes, that's just what I would," exclaimed Dauchy.

"For riding a bicycle, too?"

"There's nothing in the law about bicycles; otherwise I'd had them all up long ago," answered the grand juror, regretfully. "I've been run down by the blamed things four times."

"The court is of the opinion that these men went there to have sport," decided the judge. "I find them guilty of playing golf on Sunday, which is really sport, and fine them each $2 and costs. I expect it will be taken up and my decision reversed. I hope it will for the good of the town, but playing golf, it seems to me, is sport.'

"The reporter asked Grand Juror Dauchy for his definitions of the two words at issue. Here they are: 'Sport?' Why, you go out and knock balls around—I'm illustrating; that's 'sport.' 'Recreation?' Oh, you lay out in a hammock and smoke your pipe; that's 'recreation.'"

As this case illustrates, the Sunday laws are not calculated either to enforce justice or uphold the dignity of a law itself.
