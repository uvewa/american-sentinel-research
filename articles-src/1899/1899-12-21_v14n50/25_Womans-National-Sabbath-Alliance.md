THE annual meeting of the Woman's National Sabbath Alliance was held recently in the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church of this city, and was well attended. Mrs. D. R. James is president of the Alliance, and several women of social prominence are upon its list of vice-presidents. In its work the alliance is closely identified with the National Reform Association.
