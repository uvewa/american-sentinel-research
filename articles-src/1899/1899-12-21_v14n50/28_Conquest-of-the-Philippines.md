THIS candid statement concerning the conquest of the Philippines is made by the New York Journal of Commerce:

"We appropriated Porto Rico and the Philippines for our own interests. We have pretended nothing else. Civilization is not charity or philanthropy, but it is good for the world; it is even good for people who accept it with reluctance and at the point of the bayonet."
