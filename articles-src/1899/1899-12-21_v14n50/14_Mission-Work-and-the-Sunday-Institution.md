## Mission Work and the Sunday Institution.

Some zealous advocates of Sunday enforcement, it appears, are unalterably opposed to any work, however purely philanthropic it may be, which in any way represents opposition to the Sunday sabbath. In Portland, Me., there has been established recently the "Open Door Mission," for the rescue of the fallen and unfortunate from lives of sin, poverty, or degradation. It is conducted, as such missions are elsewhere, upon undenominational lines. But the people in charge of it are Seventh day Adventists; and this is enough to cause the advocates of Sunday enforcement in Portland, to see in this enterprise something to be opposed and put down if possible. The facts of the case are thus stated by *The Vineyard*, a journal which speaks for the Adventist interests in that State:—

"The following from a Portland paper of recent date will show what spirit the Open Door Mission is awakening in the hearts of some, simply because it is under the direction of a class of people who profess to keep the commandments of God and to have the faith of Jesus:—

"'Next Sunday at 10.30 A. M., the pastor of the Second Advent Church, Congress Place, at the request of the Sabbath Protective League, will speak on "The Christian Sabbath, its necessity, its obligation, the reasons for its present decadence, and the relation of the Open Door Mission to its possible downfall." The questions addressed to H. C. Basney, in The Portland Press, of November 23, and answered by him, will be restated and answered in discourse. The speaker will claim and endeavor to prove that this subject vitally concerns the very existence of Christian civilization. The public are very cordially invited to be present."'

"It would seem," The Vineyard adds, "that the Sunday-sabbath rests on a very insecure foundation when ministers of the gospel are alarmed that a work for the uplifting of fallen humanity will be likely to lead to the possible downfall of that institution."
