Bishop Arnett, of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, has a poor opinion of white chaplains. He has called at the White House to offer the services of negro clergymen as army chaplains in place of those who have sought to escape service in the Philippines. Here is a case of black men offering to carry "the white man's burden."—*Springfield Republican*.
