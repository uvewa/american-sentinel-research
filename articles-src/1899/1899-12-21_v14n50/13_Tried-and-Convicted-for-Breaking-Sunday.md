## Tried and Convicted for Breaking Sunday.

The following letter is sent us by Mr. J. T. Eaton, of Rome, Ga., who, our readers will remember, has been under indictment at that place for having done secular work on Sunday:—

"Rome, Ga., Dec. 15, '99.

"Editor American Sentinel: My case was tried to-day before Judge Reese in the county court. The jury after being out about ten minutes returned a verdict of 'Guilty,' with a recommendation to the court for mercy. Judgment has been suspended for the present.

"My attorney used some scripture in his argument, but the court charged the jury that they were not trying me by the Bible, but by the laws of the State of Georgia.

"Just one witness for the prosecution was examined. He swore that he saw me on the 14th day of May (Sunday) hoeing corn. The officers of the court treated me like a gentleman.

"Thus for the present I am permitted to enjoy freedom.

Yours,

"J. T. Eaton."

Evidently the majority of the people among whom Mr. Eaton lives are kindly disposed toward him and do not wish to see him suffer hardship on account of his religious belief. It is natural that they should feel bound by the law of the State; yet it is to their credit that in refusing to inflict its penalty in this case, they have acted in harmony with the higher law of the Golden Rule. This is a law by which all men, everywhere, are sacredly bound.
