Through the kindness of Mr. Joseph Bradfield, of Washington, D. C., we have received a copy of the text of the Supreme Court decision mentioned last week, with other publications relating to the same.

The first issue of the new volume will contain an article by Mr. Bradfield quoting the decision and pointing out its dangerous character as a departure from the principles laid down by President Madison and others separating church and state in this country.
