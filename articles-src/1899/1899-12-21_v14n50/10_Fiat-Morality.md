It is useless for the legislature to say, "Let there be goodness in the place of evil in this community," by enacting "moral" laws. Fiat morality is a far worse humbug than fiat money. There is One who alone has power to say, "Let there be righteousness in the place of iniquity;" and that One is He who by His word created light in the place of darkness.
