## Sunday and the Trade Unions.

The Sunday closing law is being invoked in New York City, in behalf of certain interests of some of the trade unions. The following from the N. Y. Sun, of December 13, is of interest as showing the motives which often come into play in cases of this kind, and the use made of the law by those who have no reverence for Sunday at all.

Mr. J. P. Hand, an organizing delegate of the Bookbinders' Union, made complaint against John Carey, a foreman in a bookbindery, before a city magistrate, charging him with Sabbath breaking. The Bookbinders' Union, says the Sun, "sometimes objects to Sunday work, and sometimes doesn't, according to circumstances.

"Hand told Magistrate Mayo that he visited General McKibbin's bindery at 11 o'clock last Sunday morning and found five men at work in the gilding department under direction of Carey, whose arrest he subsequently caused. Hand then began to talk very glibly about a fight between his union and General McKibbin some time ago, which he did not want to connect with the case before the court. In conclusion he said that it was necessary that the union should win, because the employers otherwise would be sure to encroach on the rights of their workingmen.

"'All we demand,' he said, 'is that the laboring man gets a day of rest. To ensure it to him, these employers should give work to some of the men that are now walking the streets.'

"'I beg to call your honor's attention to this fact,' interposed John A. Borthwick, who is general manager for McKibbin. 'We have to pay double wages for all Sunday work, and consequently we try to avoid such work in all but extreme cases. We have advertised three times recently for extra men, and we could not get a man.'

"'Our union will give you six men to morrow,' said Hand.

"'Well, that is news, indeed,' replied Borthwick. 'But send them up. We can use every one of them. In the present case,' he added, turning to the magistrate, 'urgent necessity compelled us to order some Sunday work for which the workingmen get $6 a day. We have certain holiday books that must be turned out at once, if they are not to be a dead loss to the publishers. And, let me add, that, at present, there is not a single book-binder who is not doing extra work on Sunday with union men. The very men who make this complaint are doing Sunday work, and I can prove it.' (Italics ours.)

"I shall have to reserve decision in this case until I have looked up the statutes,' said Magistrate Mayo.

"The case was adjourned until to-morrow afternoon. Section 266 of the Penal Code says:—

"All trades, manufactures, agricultural or mechanical employments upon the first day of the week are prohibited, except that when the same are works of necessity they may be performed on that day in their usual and orderly manner so as not to interfere with the repose and religious liberty of the community."
