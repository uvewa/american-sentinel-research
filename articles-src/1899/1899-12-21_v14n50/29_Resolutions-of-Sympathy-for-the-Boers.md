A RESOLUTION of sympathy for the Boers in their struggle for independence was introduced in the Senate of the United States by Senator Mason, of Illinois, and in the House of Representatives the following resolution to the same end was introduced by Congressman Jett, of the same State:

"WHEREAS, the people of the United States are, and have been from the time of gaining their independence, a patriotic and liberty-loving people, and at all times opposed to oppression, and have regarded with sympathy the struggles of other people to free themselves from domination and oppression, therefore, be it

"Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the United States watches with deep and abiding interest the heroic struggle of the people of the South African republic against cruelty and oppression, and it is our desire and hope that they may achieve their independence in the present struggle in which they are engaged."

The passage of these resolutions by Congress at this time would be a heavier blow to Great Britain than the loss of a great battle. But that action is hardly to be anticipated in the face of the rising tide of American sentiment favoring the joining hands with Great Britain and other land-hungry empires for the purpose of staking out the earth.
