## "Blue Law" Revival in Elizabeth, N. J.

### SALOONS, TOBACCO, AND OTHER STORES MUST BE KEPT CLOSED. THIRTY-ONE MINISTERS IN THE CRUSADE.

"New York Journal."

The historic old town of Elizabeth is to-day agitated over a temperance crusade. The clergy of the city are at the head of it. Not a saloon or tavern is open on Sunday, and the tipplers of the town are in dismay. Chief of Police George Tenny, by order of Mayor Mack, issued an edict that every saloon must, at all hazards, be kept closed, as well as confectionary, news, tobacco, butcher, and grocery stores. Bootblacks and newsboys will also come under the watchful eye of the mayor and police. The fight which is being waged against the violators of the Sunday law has found a champion in the Rev. E. B. Cobb, D. D., of the Second Presbyterian Church, who, with the Rev. H. H. Oberly, rector of Christ Church; the Rev. F. S. Simmons, of the Park M. E. Church, and the Rev. Everitt T. Tomlinson, of the Central Baptist Church, signed a call last June for a meeting of the thirty-one clergymen of the city at Mr. Cobb's church. Every one of the ministers responded, and a plan of operation was resolved on.

During the last term of Mayor John C. Rankin, two years ago, the Citizens' League organized, with the avowed purpose of closing up the saloons and incidentally showing up the mayor, charging him with being virtually in league with the offenders and failing to keep his oath of office. The league hired a theater, and a big audience was got together.

When the time came for Mayor Rankin to speak, he demanded to know if any of the assembled throng had ever heard him read his oath of office. There was no response, and it was finally agreed that not one of the agitators had ever seen the oath. The meeting proved a flat failure. "Not so this time," said Mr. Simmons, yesterday. "We know where we stand now, and this fight is going to win. The matter is now in the hands of the mayor, and we look to him to enforce the law. If he does not, then we will go further, even to the Grand Jury and the upper courts."
