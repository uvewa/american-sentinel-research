## General Notes

This issue was split from a Mistral OCR dump. The OCR quality appears good overall, with only a few items noted below.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 12: "An Experience" — Author Name Spelling

- **Location:** Byline "BY A. F. BALLINGER."
- **Issue:** The known author initials list includes AFB = A. F. Ballenger. The OCR renders the name as "BALLINGER" rather than "BALLENGER."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — this is likely an OCR error or variant spelling in the original. The article address (1234 Duncan St. N. E., Washington, D. C.) and content are consistent with A. F. Ballenger's known contributions. The file was named with AFB initials but the name transcribed exactly as printed: "BALLINGER."
- **Transcribed as:** "A. F. BALLINGER" (exactly as in OCR source)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — likely "Ballenger" in the original but transcribed as printed per accuracy rules; reviewer should verify against original PDF.

### Page Reference: "N. Y. San" (Article 36)

- **Location:** Article "Papal Victory in Russia," reference to "The N. Y. San prints a dispatch..."
- **Issue:** "N. Y. San" appears to be an OCR misreading of "N. Y. Sun" (the New York Sun newspaper).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — context makes "Sun" almost certain; "San" is not a known New York newspaper of this era.
- **Transcribed as:** "N. Y. San" (exactly as in OCR source, per accuracy rules)
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "N. Y. Sun" but transcribed as printed; reviewer should verify against original PDF.

### Page Numbers as Running Headers

- **Location:** Throughout (pages 2-16)
- **Issue:** OCR includes page numbers (786, 787, 788, etc.) and running headers ("AMERICAN SENTINEL.") which are artifacts of the printed layout.
- **Decision:** These were not transcribed into article files per project rules.

### Advertisement Pages (Pages 13-15)

- **Location:** Pages 13-15 contain advertisements for "Desire of Ages," "Dainty Presentation Booklets," "Oxford Bible," "A Dainty Gift Book," "Sent on Suspicion," "Natural Food of Man," book pamphlets, and "The Post" fountain pen.
- **Decision:** These advertisement pages were not transcribed as article files per project rules.

### Subscriber Note (Page 7)

- **Location:** "ONE of our subscribers in Iowa writes:— 'I received the 'Post' in due time...' See 'ad' on page 799."
- **Decision:** This is a promotional/advertisement blurb referencing the Post fountain pen advertisement; not transcribed as a separate article.

### "No paper next week" Notice (Page 16)

- **Location:** "New York, December 21, 1899. No paper next week. The next SENTINEL will be issued January 4."
- **Decision:** This is a publication notice rather than substantive editorial content; included in the masthead file context but not created as a separate article file.

### "It is All That I Want in a Bible" (Page 16)

- **Location:** Subscriber testimonial for Premium Bible offer.
- **Decision:** This is advertising/subscription promotional content; not transcribed as an article file.
