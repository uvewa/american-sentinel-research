SINCE The Outlook has been defending the toleration of slavery in the Sulus in plain defiance of the 13th Amendment its attention should be directed to that part of the President's message which relates to the Bates compact with the honored sultan. The President announces that "this agreement is not to be deemed in any way to authorize or give the consent of the United States to the existence of slavery in the Sulu archipelago." The President, therefore, isn't so much of a lawbreaker as The Outlook, since he cannot ignore the 13th Amendment. It follows that The Outlook must now disapprove of the President because he pays some heed to the fundamental law of the land. As for the President's statement that the Bates agreement will not authorize or recognize slavery, it should be said, furthermore, that according to such an interpretation of it, Article X becomes a nullity. That article, to quote the message, "provides that any slave in the archipelago of Jolo shall have the right to purchase freedom by paying to the master the usual market value." For, if slavery is not recognized in the islands, every slave is free and cannot be made to pay a "market price" for his liberty. It would certainly be unlawful and wrong to make any slave buy a freedom that is already his. It is to be hoped that this aspect of the situation will be fully explained to the sultan.—*Springfield Republican*.
