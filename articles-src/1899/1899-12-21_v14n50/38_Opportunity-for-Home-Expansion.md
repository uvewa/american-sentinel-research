# Opportunity for Home Expansion.

In connection with the statements received from time to time showing the enormous price that is being paid for the acquisition of Asiatic island territory already thickly populated, it is interesting to note the extent of the opportunity that still remains for peaceable expansion at home. We quote from the New York World:—

"Mr. Hitchcock, the Secretary of the Interior, reports:—

"First—That the United States still have on this continent 1,562,500 square miles of public lands that have not been taken up for settlement or development—about one third of our total area, a domain greater than that of the Roman Empire at the height of its glory.

"Second—That there are in the United States, on this continent, in the most favorable parts of the temperate zone, 115,625 square miles of arid lands 'which would be highly productive under a proper system of irrigation.' Mr. Hitchcock goes on to say, 'That this area should remain a desert is not in keeping with the progressive spirit of the age. These 115,625 square miles constitute a domain greater than the entire Philippine group, a domain capable of maintaining a population of intelligent white American citizens of not less than 20,000,000.

"Here is a chance for expansion that will cost little money and no lives, that will be an addition to the wealth and the power of the American people. But then there is no 'glory' in that kind of expansion."
