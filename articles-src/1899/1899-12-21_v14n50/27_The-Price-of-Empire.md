THE English people are paying the price of empire, and are finding it exceedingly costly. What they can receive that will compensate for the terrible loss of life and other items of the heavy price that is being exacted from them to-day, must be stated by such as are wise enough to know. But it is plain to all that empire is a costly thing for the common people, and the lesson is not untimely for the people of the United States.

An empire always feels bound to grow and keep on growing, with every opportunity for expansion, legitimate or otherwise. And the common people are expected to furnish the men and the money necessary to this costly process.

At the present time it would seem that the British empire has in this endless process of expansion reached a condition dangerously near the limit of its power of cohesion. It may have to fight its hardest battles to keep from being broken up and obliterated as a world power. The worst effect of its reverses in South Africa, is not the loss directly occasioned to its forces there, or even the prolonging of the war; but the impression of weakness that is conveyed by them to the other nations of Europe. Russia and France will now be much more likely to begin some aggression on Great Britain's African or Asiatic possessions than they were before.
