# Papal Victory in Russia.

PAPAL diplomacy has won a great triumph in Russia. In return for the help of the pope in reconciling Polish Catholics to the czar's government, the pope is to be permitted to establish a special "mission" at St. Petersburg. The N. Y. San prints a dispatch dated at Rome, November 18, which says:—

"The czar of Russia has now taken a final decision, the religious and diplomatic importance of which can be misunderstood by no one; it is to allow the establishment at St. Petersburg of an extraordinary papal mission. The history of this affair is peculiarly interesting. At the beginning of the year the czar understood perfectly how fruitful would be a closer collaboration between Russia and the papacy.

"The national appeasement of Poland, the reaction which a policy of intimacy with Rome would have on the Slav races and on the Balkan peoples, the close connection between ecclesiastical questions and foreign politics, the subordination of former struggles and internal revolutions to a gradual realization of Russia's mission in history, his deep admiration for the pacifying spirit of Leo XIII., the identity of the Roman questions with the aims of the Franco-Russian alliance; all these interests induced the sovereign to cultivate the friendship of the Holy See."
