# Sunday Closing in Paterson, N. J.

## Certain Barbers of that city say that if they must close on Sunday all other business in the city must do likewise.

Upon an answer to the question whether shaving is a necessity or not on Sunday, says *The World*, "may depend the success or failure of the Sunday-closing movement in Paterson. It appears that there is but one decision in any way bearing upon the point. A bath on Sunday has been declared a necessity, and a shave, the barbers who are opposed to the Sunday-closing movement argue, comes under the same rule.

"Recorder Senior, who accepted complaints last week against a dozen barbers, butchers, and grocers, who did business on Sunday, has asked City Counsel Simonton for a written opinion, and the magistrate will be guided by that opinion in disposing of the cases. Those accused will be arraigned before him to-day.

"The barbers, who insist upon their right to modern privileges, have arranged to form a secret organization in the event of an adverse decision and make the repeal of the blue laws speedy by their enforcement. They announce they will tie up on Sunday all kinds of business unless a Sunday shave is declared a public necessity.

"The possibilities involved are far-reaching. No more trolley rides on Sunday, music at the public parks to be silenced until the shave is restored, all worldly employment must cease, swains will be denied the privilege of buying caramels for the evening, and railroads allowed to run but one train through the city.

"With the barbers it is 'seal up the city or shave.'

"The Barbers' Association declines to consider the question whether or not a Sunday shave is a necessity. The opposition insist on keeping open shops, and a number of them were open yesterday.

"Within four weeks the legislature will convene and a fight for the repeal of the blue laws will be begun."
