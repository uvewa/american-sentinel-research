THE New York Sabbath Committee has determined to put a stop to Sunday theaters in this city. This report is given by The Independent, which indorses the organization and its work:—

"The New York Sabbath Committee is undertaking a hard fight in its endeavor to secure the enforcement of the law forbidding Sunday dramatic performances in theaters. One New York theater has been an especially flagrant offender, and last week one of its proprietors was arrested. A warrant was also out for another, State Senator Timothy D. Sullivan, well known as 'Dry Dollar Sullivan,' a barkeeper and local politician. He, however, avoided arrest by going to Hot Springs, Ark. The law is very clear, and the society should have the full support of the community."
