## An Experience.

BY A. F. BALLINGER.

It has been some time since the writer communicated through the AMERICAN SENTINEL with the readers of this ever faithful watchman. Once as a member of its editorial staff I wrote in defense of a free gospel—the religion of Jesus and his apostles unaided and untrammeled by civil law. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts," was often written as a rebuke to those who were seeking municipal might and police power to enforce their convictions of Christian duty on other people.

Since that time I have not lost interest in the gospel principles of complete separation of church and state advocated by the SENTINEL, but I have enjoyed the blessed privilege of experiencing some of the power promised for practical work in gospel lines, to him who will invoke the throne of grace for the Holy Spirit rather than the hand of civil law.

One argument put forth in favor of Sunday laws, and a common complaint entered by prosecuting witnesses against those who have been imprisoned or driven in the chain-gang for doing common farm labor on the first day of the week, after having observed the seventh day according to the commandment, is that such laws are necessary for the protection of Sunday worshipers from disturbance by those who work or play on that day. The following experience had last summer at a camp-meeting in North Dakota will speak for itself in answer to this argument.

A small city park, the only available grove in the community, had been secured from the city authorities, for a site for the camp. Later the authorities, forgetting the time in which the park was promised to the campers, promised it also to the county superintendent of schools for a county school picnic to be held on the same Saturday promised to the camp meeting.

Both the camp-meeting and the picnic advertised their gatherings to be held at the same time on the same bit of shady soil. When the campers arrived the city authorities informed them of the mistake and expressed deep regret, but as it was too late to correct it the city authorities asked whether it would be possible for the camp-meeting and the picnic to dwell together. The camp-meeting managers thought it would and so the authorities, with every apology for their mistake, left, somewhat relieved, to await results. The ministers sought the Lord to be saved from what seemed to all human appearance inevitable disaster to the important interests of the meeting.

Not until Friday night was I made aware of the situation. My first impression was that of consternation, but it was soon dispelled by the assurance that "all things work together for good to them that love God."

Saturday morning broke fair and beautiful. The campers assembled for service. Forgetting all about the picnic, I was drawing the discourse to a close and was just about to make an appeal to sinners to seek the Lord, and especially the young people, many of whom were in the congregation, when suddenly the brass band pealed forth as it led the picnic procession into the park and passed within thirty feet of the tent. Wagons decorated and filled with young women gayly dressed in the interest of the picnic proper or some enterprising business house, passed slowly by. The band played, the girls sang and the boys shouted.

But it had no effect on the meeting, though the audience sat facing the procession. *The Holy Spirit was present.* This tells the story. Sinners, young and old, came forward and knelt in prayer apparently oblivious to their surroundings. The tearful eyes and the subdued sobs in sorrow for sin as they came from the young people, were in striking contrast with the sentiments of the passing procession. All the ministers present recognized the presence of the Spirit in mighty power, and one remarked that he could scarcely refrain from shouting aloud at the sight of the victory which God gave over all diverting influences. All day the picnic remained and did what picnics usually do, within a stone's throw of the audience tent. But the camp-meeting was not disturbed. The young people took no interest in the picnic performances, while a few of those in attendance on the picnic came and took part in the services of the day.

Christ and his apostles never complained to the civil authorities that they were disturbed in the practise or promulgation of their faith by the religious practise of their opponents. He who complains to the civil authorities that he is disturbed in his religious experience by some one whose religious practises do not harmonize with his, thereby advertises that his religion fails to furnish that perfect peace promised to those whose minds are stayed on God. The religion of Jesus Christ lived and preached in the Spirit always has and always will call forth a complaint of disturbance from the devil, but never enters such a complaint itself.

"Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord."
