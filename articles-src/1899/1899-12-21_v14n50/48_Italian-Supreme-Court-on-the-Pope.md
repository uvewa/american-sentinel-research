The supreme court of Italy has given a decision declaring that the pope is not a sovereign, but is subject to all duties and obligations of a civilian, and that he is not entitled to the privilege of inviolability of his mails, such as the representatives of sovereign powers in Rome enjoy. It also disputes the right of the pope to receive deputations, ambassadors, or envoys from the various courts of Europe. It is considered possible that King Humbert may enter a protest against such recognition of the pope as a sovereign by European courts.
