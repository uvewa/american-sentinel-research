"Advice to the Clergy."

"If ministers will remember that they are not in the pulpit to attract audiences, or to entertain those whom they may attract, but are there to convey to those who hear them the power of the gospel 'as it is in Christ Jesus'; in short, if ministers will forget everything but the one purpose that they are to tell the 'good news,' which is the interpretation of the life of this day, so that the Golden Rule may be applied to it as a living principle, they will not need to resort to anything."

The above from the *Indianapolis News*, reprinted in the *Boston Herald*, is so good that we think it deserves wider circulation, and only hope that those to whom it speaks will do as the *News* suggests; that is, to tell the "good news" which is the gospel, and "is the power of God unto salvation." Then "they will not need to resort to anything," not even to the State legislature or either house of Congress for laws to compel men to do by coercion what they have failed to do by and with the gospel.

It is just as certainly a fact as that twice two are four, that when any man or set of men will or do appeal to civil government for aid in religious things, they do by that act confess that the power they possess is inferior to that of civil power; and by that confession they do openly acknowledge that they do not have the gospel of Jesus Christ to aid them,—which is the power of God.

And again: If the ministers did not and would not resort to anything save what the *Indianapolis News* here suggests, there never would have been nor ever would be another Sunday law on earth. For such a thing is contrary to the gospel of Christ and works evil only and that continually.
