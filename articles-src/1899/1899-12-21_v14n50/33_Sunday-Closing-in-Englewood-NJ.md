# Sunday Closing in Englewood, N. J.

A CRUSADE against Sunday opening of ice cream and candy shops is reported from Englewood, N. J. The following appeared in the *New York Journal*, of December 11:—

"Mayor E. A. Brinkerhoff's crusade against the violation of the Sunday blue laws in Englewood, N. J., was continued yesterday in his own peculiar way. He is a fierce opponent of the selling on Sunday of ice cream, soda water, candy, and other such sinful luxuries, but winks indulgently at the noisy but fashionable golf players who spend all of their Sabbath days on the links of the Englewood Golf Club.

"From time immemorial the Englewood young man has treated the Englewood young woman to ice cream and candy in the course of their Sunday walks. In spite of this the criminal record of Englewood is not a startling one. The majority of the young men and young women of Englewood are not members of the golf club, which is an exclusive organization.

"In a burst of virtuous indignation against the Sunday ice cream and soda selling Mayor Brinkerhoff last Sunday caused the arrest of F. W. Bergendahl, the leading caterer of the place. Bergendahl's fellow townsmen evidently did not share the mayor's opinion as to the gravity of the offense, for a jury promptly acquitted the caterer."

Another paper gives this account of the trial and acquittal:—

"The all-important question, 'Shall ice cream be sold in Englewood on Sunday?' has been decided in the affirmative.

"The decision was rendered yesterday by a jury of six representative men, and the town breathes easier. F. W. Bergendahl, dealer in candies and ice cream, had defied the order of Mayor E. A. Brinkerhoff, forbidding the sale of ice cream and candy on Sunday, and was arraigned for trial before Police Justice Dutton.

"The court room was packed.

"R. P. Wortendyke, city counsel, said that the old blue law, dating back to 1789, was due to the Biblical injunction that the Sabbath day should be kept holy. 'Our Sabbaths,' he declared, 'should not be disturbed by the opening of candy and ice cream stores, which are not matters of necessity or charity.'

"Chief Titus, the only witness against Bergendahl, said he had visited the store of Englewood's leading caterer on Sunday, November 26, and seen with his own eyes a box of ice cream sold.

"Ernest Koester, counsel for the defendant, did not put his client on the witness stand. He simply made an address.

"'What is ice cream but frozen milk, anyway?' he said, and there was loud applause. 'And we have shown the law that allows us to sell milk on Sunday. I defy the Penal Code of New Jersey to stop this man from opening his store on Sunday.'

"The crowd again applauded so vigorously that Counsel Wortendyke had to ask Justice Dutton to stop the demonstration. Wortendyke, replying, said that he was surprised at the ignorance of counsel on the other side in saying ice cream was frozen milk. 'Six days is enough for any man to do business,' he declared.

"Justice Dutton charged the jury that under the law of 1893 ice cream wasn't frozen milk. The jury returned a verdict of 'Not guilty' in about ten minutes. It is said that every ice cream store in Englewood will be reopened tomorrow."
