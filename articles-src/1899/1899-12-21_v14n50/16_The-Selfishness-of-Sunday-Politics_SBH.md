## The Selfishness of "Sunday Politics."

BY S. B. HORTON.

That selfishness in undisguised and naked form is at the bottom of persistent efforts made for Sunday laws by Congress, legislatures, and municipalities, is apparent to the mind of any who study the question. Situations and circumstances arise from time to time which justify this allegation. A recent case in Texas is to the point.

A barber in Galveston cut a customer's hair on a recent Sunday and was prosecuted for it on the ground that he violated the statutory law prohibiting Sunday labor. His attorney in demurring to the prosecution contended that a shave or hair cut is a necessity to cleanliness, and that as the higher courts have held bath-houses to be necessities in the exemptions provided by the statutes, his client was not guilty as charged. The court took the case under advisement and subsequently handed down a written opinion sustaining the demurrer, dismissing the prosecution and discharging the defendant. This barber evidently desires to labor on Sunday as well as upon other days, and so far as right in the matter is concerned he enjoys this from higher law and should be protected in his right rather than be deprived of it by legislative enactment.

But here comes a lot of barbers from Houston who, not wishing to work on Sunday, propose to test the constitutionality of the opinion held by the Galveston judge. They will "willingly contribute toward a fund to thoroughly test this case." And yet they admit that the decision may be right. Still "the [some] barbers don't want to work on Sunday." It does not require much mental strain to acknowledge that these barbers have the undoubted right to refrain from work on Sunday.

But why are these Houston barbers so concerned about the judge's decision in the Galveston case? Is it because, forsooth, the health of the Galveston barbers will be impaired if they work too many days? Is it because of a tender regard for their fellow-beings welfare?

Ah, no. They see in this decision the possibility of some one securing the opportunity of adding more pennies to his coffers. Those who do not wish to reap the benefit of such opportunity demand that all others shall either have the same mind on the subject as is theirs, or be compelled to desist from following the mind of opposite tendencies. In other words, "we are the people, and you must not work when we don't work. You must not make money while we are resting." It brings to mind that which is related of a father and son who seeing the great West in the possession of Indians, the one said to the other: "Let us adopt two resolutions; first, resolved, that all this land belongs to the people; second, resolved, that we are the people."

Put the matter as you may, clothe the arguments with all the high-sounding paraphernalia of the language as you may, the conclusion is irresistible that self and selfishness lies at the bottom of proposed Sunday laws.
