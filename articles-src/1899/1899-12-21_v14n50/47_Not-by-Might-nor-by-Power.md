"Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts." This is what the AMERICAN SENTINEL has been saying to the people who have been and are yet calling for legislation to reform society. And this week we print an article showing what we mean by quoting this Scripture text, and that we are not talking impracticable theories. It is the SENTINEL's design not only to talk this text, but to illustrate it; and the article in this issue is only the first of many which it hopes to publish to that end the coming year.
