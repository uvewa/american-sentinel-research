## The Papal Principle.

BY GEO. B. WHEELER.

The subject of the Dudlieian lecture at Harvard, delivered recently in the Fogg Art Museum, by Professor Toy, of the Semitic Department, was "Leo XIII. and the Errors of the Church of Rome." He said:—

"The underlying, coloring doctrine of the infallibility of the church which has been applied by Pope Leo, is where the evil lies. From 1878 to 1890 he issued encyclicals to the following effect: The neglect of the church's authority has resulted in the social evils of socialism and in Masonry, which tries to separate church and state, a condition contrary to divine law. Liberty of worship, speech, and teaching, is impossible, and liberty of conscience also, as real liberty that lies in choosing the good will not then be present.

"'Thus the pope,' he continued, 'claims an authority over the religion and morals of the peoples. But weakness is shown by the fact that the church decides what is to be the final authority.'"

That is the papal principle, the right to use the power of the state to compel every one to conform to what they decide to be right, thereby trampling over the individual right to be his own judge in those things that pertain to his own good, which right lies at the basis of civil and religious liberty.

Sunday laws are the embodiment of the papal principle, as the sentiment that made them, and is now supporting them, claims the right to decide which day is the Sabbath, and to use the power of the state to compel every one to conform to their decision, regardless of their own belief, wishes, or interests. If Sunday laws are right, the papal principle is right, and if that is carried out to its logical conclusion it follows that the religion of the people instead of depending upon what is right, depends upon the ecclesiastical power that has the greatest influence with the state; and as that is subject to change it follows that religion itself becomes a football of contending factions.

It is also a significant fact that the justification of the papal principle in our Sunday laws, by the different States of the Union, is already finding its natural fruitage in a great theocratic movement that is rapidly rising in this country under the names of "National Reform," "Christian Citizenship," etc., and which are combining the religious organizations of the country for the purpose of compelling our national Government to give them power to enforce their decisions of what is right, and what is wrong, in both civil and religious matters, upon everyone. That is the natural outgrowth of the papal principle embodied in our Sunday laws, and is in exact harmony with the statements in the encyclicals issued by the pope; and it means the subverting of the liberties of the nation.

Our Sunday laws therefore instead of being as is claimed for them the foundation upon which the liberties, the civilization, and the welfare of the nation rest, are instead their most dangerous and deadliest foe. Oh, that the nation might be awakened to this fact before it will be too late!
