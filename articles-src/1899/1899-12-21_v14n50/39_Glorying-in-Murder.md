# Glorying in Murder.

New York "World."

The massacre at Elands Laagte cannot be palliated by pleading that the British were so intoxicated with the divine afflatus of the "strenuous life of glory" that they could not bring themselves down to the level of commonplace, everyday life before they had butchered sixty human beings, on their knees, pleading for mercy. Neither can it be excused on the plea that the Boers are brutes, unfit to live. For if that is so, how could Gen. York leave the dying Gen. Symons and the other wounded and dying British to the care of the Boers at Glencoe?

And further, for several days after the massacre, when all the excitement of battle had died out, these British gentlemen sat about the camp writing of the massacre not as of a deed of shame but as a "most excellent pig sticking," a rare bit of sport in which they gloried.

In and by their letters officers and men admit not only the deliberate intent to assassinate but also their thorough approval of their deeds of murder, in defiance of the laws of war as well as of the laws of civilization and humanity.

Thus far the only notice the British Government has taken of this massacre is to order a strict censorship upon the letters from the front. That is, it has in effect indorsed the murder, but mildly rebuked the assassins for indiscreetly boasting of their prowess.

But does not every war furnish many an occasion of just this kind? And is not this terrible thing an indictment of war in general, as much as of the British regiment which perpetrated the deed? We think so.
