IT is proposed in Virginia to call a constitutional convention some time in 1901, for the primary purpose of withdrawing the franchise of citizenship from the negro. In a press statement from Richmond it is reported that a bill "along the line foreshadowed here" will soon be introduced in the legislature. The object of the bill will be to get rid of the "illiterate negro vote," in order to insure "white supremacy."
