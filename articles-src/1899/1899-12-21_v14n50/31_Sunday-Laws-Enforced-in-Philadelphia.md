## Sunday Laws Enforced in Philadelphia.

"New York Journal," Dec. 11.

The Philadelphia Sabbath Association, several days ago, promised that the "blue laws" would be enforced on and after January 7, 1900. Not to be outwitted, the police determined that the enforcement of the law should begin at once—that is to-day.

In certain sections of the city cigar and candy shops were closed to day. In other sections hundreds of shopkeepers who had received no notice to close and who had not even heard of any intention of the Police Department to carry out the "blue laws," kept open, but not an arrest was reported.

It is understood that the purpose of the Police Department is to start the crusade next Sunday, and that it will be directed against localities where Sunday is like an ordinary week day, and where bakers, butchers, grocers and other merchants conduct business openly.
