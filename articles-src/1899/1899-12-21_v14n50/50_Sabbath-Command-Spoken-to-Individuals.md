The command to observe the Sabbath was not spoken to governments, but to individuals. National Sabbath-keeping depends wholly upon individual Sabbath-keeping.

"He that regardeth the day [the Sabbath], regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it." So wrote the Apostle Paul. In either case, the responsibility is to God and not to the man.
