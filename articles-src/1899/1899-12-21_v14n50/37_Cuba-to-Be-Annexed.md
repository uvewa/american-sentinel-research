# Cuba to Be Annexed.

The eventuality of the annexation of Cuba, which at first was but a distant and shadowy possibility, is steadily looming up nearer and clearer upon the horizon of coming events. This, for illustration, is what is now said by Washington correspondents of the New York papers:—

"WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.—Major-General Leonard Wood, U.S.V., was to-day appointed military governor of Cuba. The order making this assignment relieves General Brooke, a major-general in the regular army, both as commander of the division of Cuba and as military governor of the island.

"This move is specifically intended to utilize General Wood's popularity with the Cubans for the purpose of paving the way for the ultimate annexation of the island.

"The incumbency of General Wood, in a word, is the beginning of a Republican programme which has for its aim the assimilation of Cuba. This is the opinion of both Republican and Democratic higher officials and legislators here."

Elections are to be held in the island in April next, by which time the census will have been completed; then a convention of Cuban's representatives will be called, to frame a constitution as a basis of government. Then legislators will be chosen and "it is possible that the question of annexation will be submitted to the inhabitants of Cuba at the same time." So this word from Washington informs us.

The new Cuban government, we are further told, will not in any case be independent; but "will be administratively established with American supervision and authority." And "a year thereafter [if not before] the question of annexation is expected to be answered in the affirmative."
