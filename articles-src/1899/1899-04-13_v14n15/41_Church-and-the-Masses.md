THE Rev. W. E. McLennan, Methodist, says of the problem of "the church and the masses," that "Whereas, in the beginning the moneyed classes were arrayed against Christianity, in these days they are identified with it. The poor cannot distinguish between the church and their taskmasters who support and govern the church. The consequence is that while sixty per cent. of the employer class are connected with the church, only four per cent. of the employed class are found in it."
