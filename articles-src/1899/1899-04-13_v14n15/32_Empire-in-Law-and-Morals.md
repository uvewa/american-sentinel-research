## "Empire" in Law and Morals.

SENATOR HOAR SUMS UP THE CASE AGAINST THE CONQUEST AND DOMINATION OF THE PHILIPINOS.

In reply to a letter from more than one hundred men of eminence in Boston, Senator Hoar said:—

"No man during this whole discussion has successfully challenged and no man will successfully challenge—

"First—The affirmation that under the Constitution of the United States the acquisition of territory or of other property is not a constitutional end but only a means to a constitutional end, and that while the making of new States and providing national defense are constitutional ends, so that we may acquire and hold territory for those purposes, the governing of subject peoples is not a constitutional end, and that there is therefore no constitutional warrant for acquiring and holding territory for that purpose.

"Second—That to leave our own country, to stand on foreign soil, is in violation of the warnings of our fathers and of the Farewell Address of Washington.

"Third—That there was never a tropical colony yet governed with any tolerable success without a system of contract labor.

"Fourth—The trade advantages of the Philippine Islands, if there be any, must be opened alike to all the world, and that our share of them will never begin to pay the cost of subjugating them by war or holding them in subjection in peace.

"Fifth—That the military occupation of these tropical regions must be kept up at an immense cost both to the souls and the bodies of our soldiers.

"Sixth—That the declaration as to Cuba by the President and by Congress applies with stronger force to the case of the Philippine Islands.

"Seventh—That Aguinaldo and his followers, before we began to make war upon them, had conquered their own territory and independence from Spain with the exception of a single city, and were getting ready to establish a free constitution.

"Eighth—That while they are fighting for freedom and independence and the doctrines of our fathers, we are fighting for the principle that one people may control and govern another in spite of its resistance and against its will.

"Ninth—That the language and argument of those who object to this war are, without change, the language and argument of Chatham, of Fox, of Burke, of Barre, of Camden, and of the English and American Whigs, and that the language and argument of those who support it are the language and argument of George III., of Lord North, of Mansfield, of Wedderburn, and of Johnson, and of the English and American Tories.

"The question the American people are now considering and with which they are about to deal is not a question of a day or of a year or of an administration or of a century.

"We have not as yet taken the irrevocable step. Before it is taken let the voice of the whole people be heard."
