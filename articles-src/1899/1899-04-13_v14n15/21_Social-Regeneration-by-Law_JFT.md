## Social Regeneration by Law.

### BY J. F. THOMSON.

Law means repression. Its agent is force. It addresses itself chiefly to acts, leaving the great realm of motives untouched or rather unchanged. Man is to be saved. How? By legal restraints? Nay. Away with the conception that Christianity is a thing that ties us up that we may not hurt ourselves or others. Never let men hope for human regeneration by force of law. Correct morals can never be beaten into men by a policeman's baton. The municipal court, state legislatures, houses of correction, are not the fountains whence the waters of regeneration flow. Law can punish, and fetter, and imprison, but not regenerate. Load the statute books with penal restraints, but only the grace of God can make people honest, pure, and chaste. As well expect to quiet a boiling caldron by skimming it with a spoon as to regenerate society by legal enactments.
