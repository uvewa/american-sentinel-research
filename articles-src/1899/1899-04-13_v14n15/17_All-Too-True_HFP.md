## All Too True.

BY H. F. PHELPS.

The following truthful and pathetic word picture of the inglorious conquest now being waged in the far East, by a nation that has made such high professions and boasts of being a Christian nation, are from the *St. Paul Globe* (St. Paul, Minn.), dated March 29:

> "War at its best has more of pathos than of glory. When it is waged against oppression or when principles of honor are at stake, its triumphs are shadowed by its sacrifices. When the forces of a maturing civilization, great through freedom, are exerted to crush a dawning impulse to liberty, there is little left to war but sadness. For the blood which is being poured out in the trenches at Manila no adequate return is apparent. Men like gallant Colonel Egbert and Lieutenant Krayenbuhl [men from St. Paul] have offered up their lives, and to what purpose? To show that the American soldier is able to die a soldier's death. Such proof was not wanted. Death is too high a price to prove a valor that is not questioned. And if not for this, what then? To force our freedom upon people who have their own ideas of liberty? Freedom against freedom! History has nothing to show in parallel. Men have fought to oppress and have gloried in their triumph, but never before has liberty been offered in volleys. Obedient to his duty, fighting in contravention to every principle of his life and education, the American soldier at Manila is the noblest sacrifice that war's annals can show.

> "It is the pity of it all that is most apparent now. Free blood is cementing bonds that, call them by what name you will, represent in the end only slavery. Why ours to bear this burden? The present policy in the Philippines can be excused only on the ground of selfishness. Yet selfishness has been disclaimed. The war is not one of conquest, the country is told. There is talk of manifest destiny, and the progress of civilization,—catch phrases that mean nothing. The truth is that all this sacrifice of life is to an end that the American people can never indorse and which even its authors are afraid to admit. In the day of reckoning, all evasions will be cleared away and the responsibility, either for a gigantic blunder or for an attempt at aggrandizement, will be fixed. . . . This is the day for only regret, for pity for the Filipino dead in the trenches, for the boy in blue falling in the advance."
