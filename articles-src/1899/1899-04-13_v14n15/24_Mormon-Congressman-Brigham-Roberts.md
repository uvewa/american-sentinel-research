The Rev. T. C. Iliffe, who is in charge of Methodist missions in Utah, is much exercised over the prospective seating of the Mormon Congressman elect, Brigham Roberts, in the national assembly. To do this would, he declares, "be to throw to the winds the millions of dollars expended by the churches in years of missionary efforts in Utah."

Does this mean that the civil government has power to nullify the missionary work of the Christian Church? If this be so, is not a union of church and state a necessity to the success of missionary effort? If this be not the meaning of his words, what do they mean?
