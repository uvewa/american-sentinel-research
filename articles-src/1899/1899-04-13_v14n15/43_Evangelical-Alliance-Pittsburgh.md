NOTE the following, which we take from the Keystone Gleaner (Ph.), of April 6:—

"In the cities of Pittsburg and Allegheny there is a branch organization of the Evangelical Alliance of 180 members, which means that 180 churches have allied themselves together for the accomplishment of the purposes of the Evangelical Alliance. One of these purposes is to secure a better observance of the 'Lord's day.' During the first week of January, under the auspices of this Alliance, 5,000 Christian workers covered the two cities with literature in one day."

Five thousand Christian young people in one place, with mistaken zeal spreading literature to educate the people into the idea of Sunday enforcement. And these covered the cities of Pittsburg and Allegheny—450,000 combined population—in one day! Is it not high time that those who understand the evil that is involved in this movement for Sunday enforcement, be doing something to educate the people in regard to the danger which is threatened to them individually, and to the nation as a whole, by this proposed union of the religious and civil powers?

Who cannot see, from such facts, that the crisis in this controversy is fast approaching?
