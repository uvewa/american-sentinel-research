## Fast-Day Proclamation in New Hampshire.

Governor Rollins of New Hampshire has issued a proclamation for a day of fasting and prayer. In his proclamation he states that the Christian religion is on the decline in the rural communities. This assertion has aroused considerable comment. The paragraph touching on this point is as follows:—

"This custom was inaugurated at a time when all the people of our State placed their trust in the hands of a Supreme Being and believed firmly in the efficacy of prayer. The decline of the Christian religion, particularly in our rural communities, is a marked feature of the times, and steps should be taken to remedy it. No matter what our belief may be in religious matters, every good citizen knows that, when the restraining influences of religion are withdrawn from the community, its decay—moral, mental, and financial—is swift and sure."

We do not question but that religion is on the decline in the rural communities, as it is almost everywhere; and that "steps should be taken to remedy it." But what steps should be taken? and by whom? Is there any remedial power in a fast-day proclamation by the chief executive of a State? These proclamations began before religion declined, and religion has declined in spite of them ever since. If they could not keep religion from declining, we can hardly expect them to revive it after it has declined.

One chief cause of religious declension is formality. Religious formality is the deadly enemy of spiritual life. Formality gets into the Christian church as naturally as thistles and weeds get into the farmer's fields, and is just as hard to keep down. And what could be more essentially formal in religion than a religious proclamation issued by an official of the civil power? What spiritual life is there in the civil power, and how could the civil power be expected to administer religion in anything but a formal way?

All connection between church and state can only promote religious formality and kill out spiritual life. Experimental demonstration of this truth is afforded by every state church.

Religion will decline just in the proportion that it leans upon the power of man. It will be revived just in the proportion that it depends on the power of God. The gospel is the power of God, given to man for salvation from sin; and the more men look to the state for this salvation, the more will religion—the true religion—decline in the earth.
