**Old Advice, but Still Good.**

*"New York Journal."*

SAID Moses more than three thousand years ago, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn." Although Moses lived in primitive times, he knew a good many things that are worth heeding, even now. The Trusts are gathering in tremendous harvests in these days. Their barns are bursting with golden grain. But they would have nothing if it were not for the patient workers that produce the wealth they monopolize. It would be not only good morals, but good policy for them to show a little consideration for the laboring oxen that tread out their corn. They can spare the few grains that fall on the ground. Let them not begrudge the morsels the ox can snatch on his treadmill round. Trifles in the way of decent wages and humane treatment go a good way in the promotion of docility.

And oxen, you know, even tame ones, are strong. They could do a good deal of damage to their Trust exploiters if they were unnecessarily exasperated. Better follow Moses.
