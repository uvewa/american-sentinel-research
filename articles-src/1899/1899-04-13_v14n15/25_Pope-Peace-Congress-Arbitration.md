In connection with the subject of the czar's coming Peace Congress, it is reported that the pope is of the opinion that it would be well to create a permanent Committee of Arbitration as a guarantee of European peace. Russia, it is said, is in favor of the idea; and it is expected that the establishment of such a committee will figure on the program of the Conference.

But the pope will not be in favor of any committee clothed with such power unless the majority of the committee shall be Roman Catholics.

Protestantism is reported to be making progress in Austria to an extent which has aroused the attention of the government. A branch of the Evangelical Alliance in Berlin resolved to provide a fund for promoting evangelical work in Austria, whereupon the Roman Catholics notified the authorities to enforce the law expelling from the country all foreigners implicated in agitations likely to disturb the public order. The law, applying only to foreigners, did not of course meet the purposes of the Romanists, but they employed it as the best instrument they had for combatting the Protestant work. It is a good illustration of the use of law to serve the purposes of religious intolerance. In addition to this, the Protestants are denounced as being guilty of high treason.
