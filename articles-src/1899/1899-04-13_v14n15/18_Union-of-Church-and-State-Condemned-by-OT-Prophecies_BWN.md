## Union of Church and State Condemned by Old Testament Prophecies.

BY B. W. NOEL, M.A.*

> "Thus speaketh the Lord of Hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The Branch; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord." Zech. 6:12, 13. The church is God's building, in which every stone is a living stone, of which every part is the holy dwelling-place of the Spirit; of which no man forms a part who does not hold fast his bold confession of Christ, and his joyful confidence in him to the end. This temple is to be completed by Christ, by his Spirit, and by such means as he alone originates. Unless, therefore, the means employed by the union with the State for the promotion of the welfare of the church are such as have his authority (which they are not), they are contrary to his will, as declared by this prediction.

Of this church there are, further, three things declared by the prophets which condemn the union as now existing in our country.

1. Let us recall a part of the prophetic vision which was presented to Nebuchadnezzar, and which is thus described by Daniel: "Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were, of iron and clay, and break them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them; and, the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth." Dan. 2:34, 35.

The four metals composing the image being declared to be four great successive kingdoms, the prophet Daniel thus expounded the symbolic fact that the stone struck and destroyed the image: "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever."

2. To this church has God thus promised the perpetual aid of his Spirit: "My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and forever." Isa. 59:21. "And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh." Joel 2:28, 30.

3. God has given to this church these further promises: "It shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people [nations] shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." Isa. 2:2, 3. "Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee. For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands." Isa. 55:5, 12. "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted." Isa. 60:1–3,12. "And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing-mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet." Isa. 49:23.

These predictions cannot receive their full accomplishment till the churches be separated from the States throught the world. According to prophecy, the church which was originally cut out from the ungodly mass of the world by divine power without the aid of governments, is to grow into a great mountain and fill the whole earth. It is not to be piled up by human governments, but to grow through divine power. It grows through grace.

According to prophecy, the church is to look for the effusion of the Spirit upon all flesh as the great cause of its ultimate triumph; whatever, therefore, in the churches tends to grieve and to quench the Spirit—whatever makes the churches worldly—whatever leads them to lean upon the arm of flesh rather than of God, tends to prevent the accomplishment of its promised triumphs.

According to prophecy, all nations are to flow to the church of Christ through its spiritual glory and its preaching of the gospel. But the union corrupts it, and impedes the preaching of the gospel; and therefore the union is preventing its extension and triumph.

According to prophecy, kings and their queens, becoming pious, are to promote the progress of religion, as David and Hezekiah, by their personal services. But by the union irreligious governments force their reluctant subjects to support good and bad ministers indiscriminately.

According to prophecy, pious kings and their queens are to be as fathers and mothers to the whole church of Christ within their dominions, but by the union the sovereign is made to rend the church, exalting one part to an unbrotherly superiority, and unjustly depressing and harassing the other.

According to prophecy, pious kings and queens, as simple members of the church of Christ, are to serve it; but by the union an irreligious government binds the churches hand and foot, rules over them with a rod of iron, will allow no self-government, no reformation, no independent discipline, and is their absolute, irresponsible lord.

Thus the prophecies of the Old Testament condemn the union, no less than the history of Christian churches condemns it. These show it to be unscriptural, as this manifests its inexpediency; and both concur in making many earnest and enlightened men wish ardently for its dissolution.
