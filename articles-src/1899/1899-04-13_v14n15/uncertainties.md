## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 31 — "Sunday-Observance Bill in Michigan."

- **Location:** Section 1 of the bill text
- **Issue:** The word "sparrin" appears in the OCR: "wrestling, boxing with or without gloves, sparrin contest." This is almost certainly "sparring" with a dropped 'g' — either an OCR drop or a typo in the original bill text.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "sparrin contest" (preserving the OCR text as-is; the original may have been a typographical error in the bill itself)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "sparring contest" is clearly intended; whether the original printed bill contained this typo is unknown. Preserved as-is per accuracy guidelines.

### Author "B. W. Noel, M.A." (Article 18)

- **Issue:** The byline reads "BY B. W. NOEL, M.A." with a footnote "*Ex-clergyman of the Church of England." The author_short "BWN" is assigned as this author is not in the known-authors list.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit; "M.A." is an academic title, not an additional initial.

### Author "H. F. Phelps" (Article 17)

- **Issue:** "BY H. F. PHELPS." appears as a byline. This author is not in the known-authors list. Assigned author_short "HFP."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### Author "J. F. Thomson" (Article 21)

- **Issue:** "BY J. F. THOMSON." appears as a byline. Not in known-authors list. Assigned author_short "JFT."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### Author "John D. Bradley" (Article 30)

- **Issue:** "JOHN D. BRADLEY." appears at the end of the article. Not in known-authors list. Assigned author_short "JDB."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — attribution is explicit.

### Author "John McCarthy" (Article 20)

- **Issue:** "BY JOHN MCCARTHY." appears as a byline. Not in known-authors list. Assigned author_short "JMC."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit. The dateline "Argentine Republic." at end may indicate location of writing, not authorship.

### Page 16 Editorial Notes

- **Issue:** The page 16 editorial notes begin with all-caps lead words (THE, THERE, AN, NOTE, IF, DO, CRUSH, THE). These are editorial short items typical of the Sentinel's back-page format. Each has been given its own file as per instructions.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — format is consistent with other issues.
