## Sunday-Observance Bill in Michigan.

The following Sunday-observance bill has been reported in the Michigan legislature at Lansing:—

"A BILL

"To prohibit every kind of show, exhibition, or performance, in the nature of amusement, the same being for profit, on the first day of the week commonly called Sunday.

"The people of the State of Michigan enact:

"SECTION 1. That no person shall engage in for gain or profit, any horse racing or baseball playing, or take part in or assist in for gain or profit, the performance of any tragedy, comedy, opera, ballet, farce, negro minstrelsy, negro or other dancing, wrestling, boxing with or without gloves, sparrin contest, trial of strength, or any part or parts therein, or any circus, equestrian or dramatic performance, or exercise, or any performance of jugglers, acrobats, club performance, or rope dancers, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

"SEC. 2. Every person aiding in such exhibition, performance or exercise, by advertisement, posting or otherwise, and every owner or lessee of any garden, building or other room, place or structure, who leases or lets the same for the purpose of any such exhibition, performance or exercise, or who assents to the use of the same, if it be so used shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

"SEC. 3. Besides all other penalties presented by this act, every such exhibition, performance or exercise, shall of itself annul any and all license and licenses which may have been previously obtained by the manager, superintendent, agent, owner or lessee, using or letting such building, garden, room, place or other structure, or consenting to such exhibition, performance or exercise.

"SEC. 4. Any persons who shall violate any of the provisions of this act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars, nor more than one hundred dollars and costs of prosecution or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than sixty days, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court. And in such case, such fine shall not have been paid at the time such imprisonment expires, he, the person serving out such sentence shall be further detained in jail until such fine and costs shall have been fully paid: Provided, That in no case shall the whole term of imprisonment exceed sixty days.

"SEC. 5. All acts or parts of acts conflicting with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed."

Press dispatches of the 5th inst. mention the arrival in Texas of a doctor—C. V. Harris by name—who claimed to be en route from the Philippines to Washington on important business with the War Department. What is important about the matter is his statement that the reports of excellent health among the American troops in and around Manila are false. He says that many soldiers are in such a low state physically that, in despair over their condition, they deliberately expose themselves as targets for the enemy's guns. Some doubt is cast upon his truthfulness in the matter, but statements from other sources at the seat of hostilities do not tend to discredit them.
