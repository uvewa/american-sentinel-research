A GERMAN view of American "expansion" is given in the following from a Berlin journal:—

"The Americans will have a forehead of brass if they celebrate the centenary of Washington's death this year, for they have scattered his principles to the winds, and are annexing one island after another. The English are leading them into a slough."
