## The Pastor Explains It.

The pastor of the Nyack (N. Y.) Reformed Church, who commanded the town president to stop a Sunday parade in honor of returning soldiers, as mentioned in the SENTINEL last week, wishes to make an explanation. He wants it understood that he is not opposed to Sunday parades in honor of returning heroes from the war. In the Nyack *Evening Journal*, he says:—

> "Sir: In explanation of what occurred in the Reformed Church Sabbath evening, permit me to say I had no knowledge or intimation that the soldiers were expected in Nyack that evening, and when the beating of the drums disturbed the religious service, I was naturally indignant, and asked the village president if that was to be allowed on the Lord's day. At this point I had no idea that the soldiers were in town. He answered, 'I don't know.' I said, 'Go out and stop it.' After Mr. Myers left his seat, he said, 'The soldiers are coming home.' Impulsively, and before I comprehended his words, I said, 'I don't care who it is.' This last remark I immediately regretted, and I now acknowledge my error in thus speaking."

We would infer from this that a Sunday parade is all right, provided it is made in honor of a certain class of persons. We fear the explanation will not impress anybody with a sense of the propriety of Sunday enforcement.
