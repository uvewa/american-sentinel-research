Writing on the subject of "What the Beef Scandal Teaches," Gen. G. W. Wingate, President of the National Guard Association, says in the Independent, that the undertaking of supplying the soldiers in Cuba with "refrigerated" beef was "a great blunder," whether the beef was "embalmed" or not. And the most discreditable part of the "blunder," he says, was in the fact that after the "defects" of such beef were fully known to the War Department, "in spite of these facts, a million pounds of that beef was purchased from Armour & Co. alone, and its issue was continued not only in Cuba but in Porto Rico. What is worse than all, after its defects were fully known it was issued as a traveling ration to the fever-racked men on their homeward voyage to this country; men who needed and were entitled to receive the most nourishing food and to whom this indigestible stuff was poison. This," he declares, "should never be forgotten or forgiven by the plain people of the country."

Other interesting statements made by this authority are that "thousands of our soldiers have been made ill, and that hundreds have died in consequence of eating this beef;" also that, as "it is most lamentable to find," the "awful experiences which have made so many homes desolate, and so many of our best young men invalids, have borne no practical fruit. Both the army officials and Congress are like the Bourbons, they 'have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.'"

According to this the Government, in conjunction with the Beef Trust, killed nearly if not quite as many of its own soldiers as were killed by the Spaniards; and the American soldiers may expect, in case of war, to contend with a double enemy on the field of battle.
