The pension list will, it appears, be considerably augmented as one result of the war with Spain. For example, the statement is made on good authority that more than two hundred members of the Eighth Illinois Colored Volunteers mustered out of the service recently, intend to file claims for pensions as compensations for physical disabilities. In one company all but five claim to be disabled. They say their health has been ruined by the tropical malaria, and they are in no condition to resume the positions they held before going to war.
