## "Sovereignty."

*New York "World."*

One fact is made entirely clear by the proclamation of the President's Commission to the Filipinos. Mr. McKinley has, without the authority either of the Constitution or of Congress, not only undertaken the conquest of the islands by war, but has assumed their permanent control and government.

The proclamation asserts our "sovereignty over the Philippine Islands." Sovereignty is supreme power. It is a term of finality. And as if to emphasize this meaning the proclamation again declares that "the supremacy of the United States must and will be enforced throughout every part of the Archipelago."

This is at least explicit. It puts an end to the nauseating cant and unconscionable lying as to the policy of the Administration. It acts as a clarifier of the clouded rhetoric of the President in his Boston speech. It shows the hollowness of his protestations that the future of the Philippines was in "the hands of Congress." It affirms the policy of "forcible annexation" which the President said would be "criminal aggression" in Cuba.

This action is of course revolutionary, and unless the Filipino nature has changed it will have about the same effect in suppressing the insurrection that kerosene has in putting out a fire. But it is at least satisfactory to have a definite policy before the people at last.
