## A Sacrilegious Dog.

Under the above heading the Roman Catholic paper, *El Imparcial*, of Mexico City, published the following item in its issue of March 4, 1899:—

"In the fifth street of Zaragoza lives the Ordenza family, one of whose members, Magdaleno, is very ill and about to die, for which reason the Viaticum was brought to her.

"At the moment in which the priest was about to deposit the host in the mouth of the sick person, a little dog which had always shown the greatest love for Magdaleno, upset the priest, and caught the host in his mouth, and instantly devoured it. The dog was pursued by all present and beaten to death with sticks. By order of the holy church the corpse will be burned."
