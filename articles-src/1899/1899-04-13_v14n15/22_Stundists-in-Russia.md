NEWS, NOTES, AND COMMENT

The oppressiveness of the laws against Stundists in Russia is shown by the two following clauses of an enactment which is still in force: "The children of Stundists are to be taken from their parents and are to be confided to the care of such relatives as belong to the Orthodox Church, and if such are not to be found, then the children are to be given into the care of the Orthodox clergy of the place." "Every Stundist who is found reading the Bible or praying with others will be arrested and without further warning will, by 'administrative measures,' be transported to Siberia, or some other distant part of the empire. Every minister of this sect is to be sentenced to penal servitude in the mines."
