## Notes and Recollections.

### BY JOHN MCCARTHY.

The population of Portugal (including the islands of Madeira and Azores) is about 5,100,000; of this number but five per cent. are able to read and write. In Lisbon the Capital, there are more or less 600,000 inhabitants, 450,000 of which can neither read nor write.

Mexico, which until a few years ago, was under the thumb of Rome, tells a like story; but five per cent. of her population can read or write. Yet the church of Rome boasts of being the pioneer of education.

Some years ago Catholics were prohibited from holding any responsible position in the Canadian parliamentary administration. Nevertheless the papacy had made so much progress in a short period, that in March, 1895, the Canadian government sanctioned the payment from the public treasury of 1,000 gold dollars to the Catholic priests, for the rehearsal of masses for the repose of the soul of Sir John Thompson, former premier of the Dominion of Canada.

A short time ago a colporter was selling Bibles from house to house in a Bolivian city. The priests hearing of this, went to the judge and obtained an order for his arrest. The charge brought against him was, that of selling indecent books. As a result the Bibles were confiscated and publicly burnt, and the colporter released after paying a heavy fine. This is a specimen of papal liberality, in countries where she claims the majority of the inhabitants as her adherents.

The late war is already bearing good fruit. Nations or colonies which were formerly closed to the gospel, are now throwing open their doors for the reception of God's precious truths. Not very long ago the Methodist missionaries were expelled from the Caroline Islands (a Spanish possession). Some time after Minister Taylor, U. S. Minister at Madrid, informed the Spanish government that the governor of the Carolines was willing that the missionaries should return, should the Iberian government consent. After delaying their answer for some time, the latter notified the U. S. Minister on Sept. 18, 1894, that the condition of things (Catholic intolerance) had not changed in the least to warrant the return of the Methodist missionaries.

In January, 1895, six bishops in Italy were granted the Royal Exequator, the which entitled them to receive an official income from the government. The Italian government does not fear the Catholic religion now, for the reason that it is absolutely necessary to have the help of the church to overcome the revolutionary propensities of the inhabitants. "It cannot conquer the turbulence it bred." So says the Catholic Review, of Jan. 26, 1895. Now the secret is out as to how Rome gains ground whichever way things may turn. She teaches the people to refuse obedience to all rulers who are not subject to the spiritual domination of their popes; and the people obeying the mandates of their bishops, rise against the executive authorities, who, fearing a change in the reigning dynasty, accept the papal intervention to quell the storm which Rome herself has originated. Thus the absolute power of the popes is acknowledged, concessions have then to be made to the Santa Sede; and Rome becomes more firmly established than ever.
