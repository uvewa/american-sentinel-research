## Religious Aspect of the Dreyfus Case.

It appears that one effect of the agitation in France over the Dreyfus case, is a reactionary religious impulse which is in the interests of the Catholic Church. French Catholic priests have been prominent on the side of opposition to a revision of the case, and have done their best to give the contest the aspect of a religious controversy; in which, of course, all good people would be expected to be on the side of the church. Even Pope Leo, it is said, has felt constrained to withhold his sanction from the course taken by the priests; but that course must nevertheless be taken as expressing the spirit of the church for which they stand. The appeal to religious prejudice is of course an argument against the justice of the cause in behalf of which it was made.

The following statement of the facts relating to this aspect of the case is made by the Chicago Times-Herald, of March 17:—

"It is a notorious fact that the anti-Dreyfusards have made desperate appeals to religious prejudices. This was natural enough, because the religious partisan is sure to be a person of intense passion, and these intriguing and dubious patriots have counted upon passions of all sorts to help them in their war against justice and reason.

"In their attempt to arouse Christians generally they have tried to fan into new life the dying hatred against the Jews. Every champion of Dreyfus has been pictured as a champion of the Jews. Sympathy for the man has been constrined broadly as sympathy for the race, and sympathy for the race is held to be a heinous crime which admits of no excuse or palliation.

"Such intolerance is completely at variance with the spirit of the age and the principles of a republic. But the logical fallacy of the argument does not prevent its having considerable effect. The method of procedure is, in fact, common to despicable demagogues everywhere, and has been employed many times to obscure real issues and triumph by the confusion.

"With this religious persecution has gone a special catering to Roman Catholic reactionaries: They have been flattered with the assurance that the anti-Jewish agitators have had them always in mind when they have been working for a royalist or imperial regime. Thus poor Dreyfus has been made to appear as an obstruction in the way of the church. The fate of the wretched prisoner in exile upon a distant shore has been said to involve the fate of a powerful hierarchy, whose great influence has been turned against him.

"It is particularly gratifying, therefore, to learn that the pope withholds his approval from the course that has been pursued by too many French priests. It is said that he has expressed his astonishment at the passions that have been aroused over the famous case, adding significantly that France had always been at the head of either civilization or barbarism. The emphasis just now is upon barbarism."

And the spirit of barbarism has had no better representatives in this case than the French Catholic priests.
