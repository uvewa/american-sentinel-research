The proclamation issued by the Government to the Filipinos promises them all kinds of desirable things in government. They will have under American rule "an honest and effective civil service," "a pure, speedy, and effective administration of justice," the fullest protection of civil rights and religious freedom, "a sound, economical basis," for "the collection and application of all taxes and other revenues," public funds "raised justly and collected honestly," and "reforms in all departments of the government" and "all branches of the public service" "will be undertaken without delay and effected conformably with right and justice," and "in a way to satisfy" the "highest sentiments and aspirations of the people."

The American Government appears to have unlimited confidence in itself—far more indeed than is warranted by existing conditions at home. If these promises to the Filipinos are even approximately fulfilled, the Philippines will have the best civil government on the earth.

The Filipinos are not supposed to be familiar with civil affairs in the United States; but if they were would they not reply in the words of the familiar proverb—"Physician, heal thyself?"
