## A Symptom of National Disease.

The New York Press, of the 5th inst. called attention to "The Shame of Senate Elections," under which heading it prints the following:—

"Pennsylvania now has a bribery investigation on hand as the result of an all winter's so far futile effort to elect a senator. In Delaware, her next-door neighbor, public opinion has convicted three Democrats of bribetaking, for votes changed on the last day of that legislature's entirely futile effort to elect a senator. Utah also failed to elect a senator, but not to hold a bribery investigation. In California the bribery investigation began almost with the session itself. There is no senator there, but ample evidence of corruption. Montana varies the routine. She has elected a senator and declared that he was elected honestly. But she holds in her treasury $40,000, in the distribution of which for votes his agents were detected.

"Any observer not thoroughly conversant with American conditions would be justified in arguing from this state of facts that virtue has gone out completely from our political life. In only twelve of the thirty States electing each a senator to the Fifty-sixth Congress have there been real contests for the post. And in six of these, including last year in Ohio, there have been bribery investigations."

The Press then points out that bribery does not figure in elections to the House of Representatives, and affirms that bribery did not influence the vote cast in the last national election; from which it concludes that legislative elections are a failure because they no longer represent the people; but that popular elections are still pure. It favors the abolition of the system controlling the election of senators.

But what about the investigation which is being made by decree of the New York Legislature into the government of New York City, where it is charged that a "corruption fund" of hundreds of thousands of dollars was levied upon the city's disreputable places for political uses in the last election? And what about the charges made by the Sun, of this city, and other papers, of a similar state of corruption, only far worse, existing in Chicago? There can be no doubt that these charges are essentially true; and they certainly touch the people themselves.

It is impossible but that the "shame of senate elections" should affect the people, even if the people are not directly responsible for it. To become familiar with charges of bribery and the various forms of corruption alleged in connection with senatorial elections, by reason of their frequency, must certainly educate the people themselves in corruption. For the old saying is ever true that vice "seen too oft" is first endured and in the end embraced. And this education of the people in political vice is proceeding at an alarming rate.

On the whole it must be said there are more facts than the Press has here alleged which would justify an observer in the belief that virtue has about gone out "from our political life."
