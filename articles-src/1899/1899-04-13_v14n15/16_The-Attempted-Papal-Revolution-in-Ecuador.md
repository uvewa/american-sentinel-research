## The Attempted Papal Revolution in Ecuador.

[The following very interesting description of the present situation in Ecuador, as related to the struggle of the people for emancipation from Rome, is by Bishop Warren, Methodist, published in the N. Y. Christian Advocate, of April 6:—]

"Our historical tradition is—revolution," said the Minister of the Interior of Ecuador in 1888. Most countries are true to their historical traditions; this country is no exception.

Lest it should be supposed that this is an ordinary outbreak following a bombastic pronunciamento, I take pains to say, on the day following the decisive battle of Riobamba, that the movements of to-day in this little equatorial republic are a part of the great tide of worldwide events in the interest of the liberties and rights of man.

The republics of South America achieved their independence of the bloody power of Spain about 1823, the assertion of the Monroe doctrine being a most helpful factor in that achievement. Emancipation from a pretended church, that made Spain so bloody and tyrannous, is proceeding very much more slowly, since emancipation from spiritual bondage is more difficult than from civil and military bondage.

The following document speaks for itself. It marked the culmination of efforts to make the state subsidiary to the church. Quito, where this action was consummated, has always been the ecclesiastical head of the nation, as Guayaquil has been the commercial:—

"PREAMBLE—Considering: 1. That the Third Provincial Council of Quito has by special act consecrated the republic of Ecuador to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, placing it under his protection and patronage.

"2. That the legislature should join in name of the nation in the approval of an act so satisfactory to its sentiments of eminent Catholicity, as it is also the most efficient medium for the conservation of the faith and the realization of progress and welfare of the State; therefore, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies of Ecuador, in congress assembled, decree:

"ARTICLE I. The republic of Ecuador is consecrated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, declaring him its patron and protector.

"ARTICLE II. The feast day of the Sacred Heart of Jesus shall be civic, with assistance of the first class, celebrated in all the cathedrals of the republic with the greatest possible solemnity by the prelates of the dioceses.

"ARTICLE III. In all the cathedrals an altar will be erected dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus for the purpose of heightening the zeal and piety of the diocesans.

"ARTICLE IV. In the face of each of these altars shall be engraved, at the expense of the government, the present decree.

"G. GARCIA MORENO, President."

"Quito, Ecuador, Oct. 8, 1873.

When Garibaldi threatened Rome, Ecuador offered the pope an asylum among the ice-covered, fire-hearted volcanoes of the central Andean chain, if he was driven out of Rome. It must have been too suggestive of purgatory to be attractive. It reminds one that when England and the rest of Europe feared Napoleon's projected descent upon the island across the silver streak of sea, and when a ripple of that fear reached the far-off little Barbadoes, the government sent word to King George IV. not to be afraid, for the Barbadoes were with him to a man, and if Napoleon did drive him out of England he could find asylum and empire in Barbadoes. The Spanish have a variation of the old Greek fable of the gnat and the ox, as follows: A flea on the horn of a heavily burdened ox heard him breathing hard, and magnanimously leaped to the ground.

Some years ago the clergy of Ecuador had a tenth, in kind, of all the products of the country. This being difficult to collect, they commuted it, greatly to their advantage, to a fixed per cent. in cash on all products. If the first was a whip of thongs, the second was a whip of scorpions. Ecuador shared with Peru, Bolivia, and Venezuela the infamy of declaring no marriages legal except those legalized by the priests of the Catholic Church. Having this monopoly of the business, they did not hesitate to charge exorbitant fees. For the poorer classes they were practically prohibitory, with the result that marriages were few, and bastards many—sometimes as many as eighty-five per cent. of the births.

Against every effort at reform the priests opposed themselves, and fomented every revolution against every measure that endangered their craft. In one case the archbishop (whose name I could give were it not better for him and the race that the waters of oblivion should engulf it) marched in full canonicals, the cross in one hand and the sword in the other, at the head of the forces of retrogression.

Lately the present president, Alfaro, came into power. The principal acts of the last legislature were these: (1) Provision for a railroad to Quito, opening the country; (2) the establishment of the gold standard, instead of the contemptible paper and debased silver currency of these benighted countries; and (3) a complete separation of church and state, including a discontinuance of all stipends to the clergy and the church. This was especially necessary because the clergy were flagrantly immoral, because church benefices were used for political preferment and corruption, and because all the power of the church was always at the service of revolution against progress. These last two ends could be easily forwarded because the higher clergy, by constitutional right, had seats of power in the legislative and executive departments.

The present revolution is a revolt against these measures of progress and hope. The church authorities brought volunteers from Colombia on the north and from Peru on the south, with large promises that they have failed to fulfill, as they did in Mexico the promises they made to Maximilian, which induced him to turn back from his way to Europe and safety to defeat and death. If the news received at Guayaquil is correct, the revolution is crushed. In the first onset at Quito, the capital, it seemed about to carry all before it at one rush. Over two hundred refugees sought the protection of our flag at the minister's house. Poverty and wealth were glad to sleep together on the same floor; for victory for the rebels meant confiscation of goods and heads of all they chose to take. But our feet and hearts grew light, with troops and bands and flags in Guayaquil yesterday.

This revolution being put down, other measures of progress will immediately be enacted and put in force. The civil marriage law will legitimize thousands of marriages and tens of thousands of children. Alfaro is a good fighter, but also singularly conciliatory to defeated foes.

Room among the free and progressive governments of the people, by the people, and for the people, for the high Andean republic of Ecuador!
