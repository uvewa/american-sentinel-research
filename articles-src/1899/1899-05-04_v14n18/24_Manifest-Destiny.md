We are told that "destiny" is pushing us on—destiny, the power of which we cannot withstand. Manifest destiny! That cry has played a sinister part in the history of the republic before this. I remember the time when the slave power talked of "extending the area of freedom" over Cuba, meaning, however, to fortify itself in Congress by the acquisition of more slave States, and thus to strengthen the slave power—strengthen the slave power by the pretense of extending the area of freedom, because an irresistible "destiny" demanded it. This was manifest destiny then. When San Domingo was to be purchased from the hands of its treacherous president, ready to sell his country for cash, manifest destiny was invoked again as the irresistible power compelling the completion of the bargain. But in both cases the sound sense and the moral instincts of the people interposed and manifest destiny slunk away. And now once more it is the omnipotence of manifest destiny that appears on the scene, to force us to commit a flagrant breach of our national faith, and to do that which President McKinley himself branded as an act of criminal aggression. Is it more irresistible, more omnipotent, now than it was then? Will it not hide its deceitful head again when the honesty and good sense of the people rise up once more to interpose a veto? Destiny? Why, nothing is destiny that can be prevented or changed by the human will. That deceptive "manifest destiny" cry has more than once been used in our country to cover foul schemes and to dull the national conscience with the plea that it must be accepted as irresistible, and thus that the people yielding to it would be relieved of all responsibility. It is like the plea of moral insanity used by lawyers to excuse theft or murder.—Carl Schurz.
