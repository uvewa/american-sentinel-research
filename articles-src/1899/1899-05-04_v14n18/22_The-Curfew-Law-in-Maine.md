A little tidal wave of "reform" is sweeping over certain communities of Maine, the watery deluge this time taking the form of agitation for curfew laws for the cities. The clergy of Lewiston and Auburn are seeking to secure such a law for these cities.

Bangor was the first town in the State to adopt a curfew law, and it is pronounced by its promoters to be a great success, though it has only been in operation since February 14. The law was supported by persons most influential in religious, social, and educational affairs, and passed with only three negative votes—one alderman and two councilmen.

The law provides that children under sixteen years of age shall not be upon the streets after 9 P.M., from May 1st to October 1st, or 8 P.M. during the other months, unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian; it being desired by the advocates of the law that the term "legal guardian" be interpreted "liberally." It has thus far exiled one hapless youth to the House of Correction for sixty days.

It so happens that the youth of these cities—Lewiston and Auburn—have acquired the habit of frequenting the street-corners in the evening. The clergy, shocked and terrified, proposed to range the curfew-law gun on these juvenile sinners, and in the name of the civil authority give the command, "Disperse, ye rebels."

Now the clergymen should be interested in the dangers which threaten these young lives. But have they considered what will be the feelings of these boys and girls toward them, the representatives of Christianity, as they find themselves forced to retire to their stifling rooms on a hot summer's night, when God's free air would be so refreshing after the day of toil in the sweat-shops and factories? Will these "offenders" be inclined to listen to the preaching of the Word by these men who dictate the nature and extent of their principles?

Again, do not the clergy know that men who attend their churches and contribute handsomely to their support, are in large measure responsible for the conditions of those who labor to produce their wealth—responsible in a degree for the poverty which compels the toiler to dwell in such surroundings that the street corner offers a most desirable change?

Come, brothers, begin at the other end of the line. And not only so, but likewise abandon the policy of force, which at best but ineffectually restrains, and adopt the gospel of love, which effectually constrains.
