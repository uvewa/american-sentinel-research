THE Iowa State Register for March 29, published a long editorial on Sunday labor in Des Moines. It indicates that great stagnation in business has prevailed for a long time in that city; that with the revival of business, certain contractors have continued their work of building on Sunday, for which they have been sharply condemned by local clergymen. The contractors claim that the work is a matter of necessity, and that the men, three sets of them, working eight hours each, are anxious to labor in this way, because they have been without employment for so long; that no one is compelled to work more than six days unless he chooses so to do. The contractors and laborers claim that the Sabbath law requires them to work six days, and that since Sunday is in no sense a sacred day according to the Bible, they do no wrong even if they work seven. It is admitted by all that the workmen thus engaged are in no way disorderly, and that the peace of the city is neither endangered nor disturbed. This incident indicates the general state of public opinion concerning Sunday labor, and the failure of all appeals made by clergymen against such labor on the ground that it is unbiblical or sinful.—*Sabbath Recorder*
