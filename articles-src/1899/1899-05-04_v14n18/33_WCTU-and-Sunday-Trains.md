THE W. C. T. U. of Morris County, N. J., have taken up the matter of the running of Sunday trains on the D. L. & W. Railway, and in a resolution passed on the subject at a recent meeting, set forth that this road "was built in 1836 by those whose desire was to honor and obey the law of God," and that the union most strongly objects "to any lowering of old standards," and does "earnestly protest against this pronounced desecration of the Sabbath."

And yet the law of God plainly says nothing at all about the sinfulness of running trains or doing any other work on the first day of the week.
