The Sentinel quoted some time ago a letter written by the retiring head of the Greek Church in Alaska, directed to the President, calling his attention to existing evils in the administration of government in Alaska under the United States, and praying for redress. The letter was very pertinent to the subject of "expansion" and the acquisition of colonies across the sea, Alaska being virtually in the position of an American colony.

To this letter there is now added the testimony of president David Starr Jordan, of Leland Stanford University, who is a recognized authority on the subject of Alaska and its people. He was appointed by the Government some years ago to visit that territory to investigate the condition of the seal industry, and while there took occasion to observe the condition and habits of the people, and the effect of American government upon the country. The results of his observation, says the Literary Digest, "throw an interesting light on the past colonial methods of our Government." In view of the especial value of this light at the present time, we refer again to this subject of American government in Alaska, giving some extracts from president Jordan's testimony, as printed with accompanying comment in the Literary Digest:

"When the United States bought Alaska from Russia, thirty-one years ago, Alaska had a native population of about 32,000. To-day, says president Jordan, 'starvation is inevitable along the whole line of the southwestern coast. . . . Some time ago it was reported that at Port Etches the native population was already huddled together in the single cellar of an abandoned warehouse, and that other villages to the eastward were scarcely better housed.' These 'reconcentrados' are, according to the United States courts, American citizens.

"President Jordan's description of the slaughter of seal, sea-otter, and salmon, which has been the ruin of Alaska, need not be quoted here. He asserts that the disastrous waste and confusion in that unhappy territory arise from four sources: 'Lack of centralization of power and authority, lack of scientific knowledge, lack of personal and public interest, and the use of offices as political patronage.' 'She is only a colony,' he says, 'or rather a chain of little colonies; and a colony, to Americans as to Spaniards, has been in this case merely a means of revenue, a region to be exploited.'

"The spoils system has not left even this desolate part of our country free from its touch:

"'Finally, the demands of the spoils system have often sent unfit men to Alaska. The duties of these officials are delicate and difficult, requiring special knowledge as well as physical endurance. Considerable experience in the North, also, is necessary for success. When positions of this kind are given as rewards for partisan service, the men receiving them feel themselves underpaid. The political "war-horse," who has borne the brunt of the fray in some great convention, feels himself "shelved" if sent to the North to hunt for salmon-traps, or to look after the interests of half-civilized people, most of whom cannot speak a word of English. A few of these men have been utterly unworthy, intemperate, and immoral; and occasionally one, in his stay in Alaska, earns that "perfect right to be hung" which John Brown assigned to the "border ruffian." On the other hand, a goodly number of these political appointees, in American fashion, have made the best of circumstances, and by dint of native sense and energy have made good their lack of special training. The extension of the classified civil service has raised the grade of these as of other government appointments. The principles of civil service reform are in the highest degree vital in the management of colonies.'

"Laws exist for the regulation of salmon fishing, seal, and otter hunting, for the exclusion of intoxicating liquors, and for the suppression of crime; but the Government has neglected to provide adequately for their enforcement. The salmon company, for example, must arrest and punish itself, or go unpunished, for there is no one else to do it. If a Government inspector arrives, he is dependent on the company for food, shelter, and transportation; and if he wanted to destroy an illegal dam, he would have to borrow the company's boat for the purpose. 'Whisky,' says president Jordan, is 'the greatest curse of the people of Alaska—American, Russian, and native.' 'In 1878, it is said, a schooner loaded with "Florida water" came to the island of St. Lawrence, in Bering Sea, and the people exchanged all their valuables for drink. The result was that in the winter following the great majority died of drunkenness and starvation, and in certain villages not a person was left.' Yet only one conviction for illegal sale of liquors has ever been obtained in Alaska, so far as president Jordan knows, 'and it was understood that this was a test case for the purpose of determining the constitutionality of the law.' All these evils, in president Jordan's view, are primarily due to neglect. He says:—

"'We try to throw the burden of self-government on people so situated that self-government is impossible. We impose on them statutes unfitted to their conditions, and then leave to them the enforcement. Above all, what is everybody's business is nobody's, and what happens in Alaska is generally nobody's business. No concentration of power, no adequate legislation, no sufficient appropriation—on these forms of neglect our failure chiefly rests.'"

There is no theory, no sentiment, about all this; it is a statement of plain facts. And while rhetorical expansionists are telling us what will be under American government in the Philippines, these facts stand as an unimpeachable witness of what is under American government in Alaska.

And in the light of such facts, what intelligent person can be expected to have confidence in the glowing promises of good government by which the imperialist policy is sought to be justified? What is the difference between American duty toward the people of Alaska and American duty toward the Filipinos? If the duty to give a "wise, just, stable, effective, and economical administration of public affairs" has been so utterly neglected by the United States in a territory almost bordering the Union, how will the Government perform that duty in a territory many times more remote?
