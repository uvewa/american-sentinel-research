In view of what "civilization" is now doing in China, the Chinese minister to the United States, Wu Ting Fang, has asked the question: "What is civilization. Does it mean solely the possession of superior force and an ample supply of offensive and defensive weapons?" This question he asked in all seriousness in an address before the Academy of Political and Social Science at Philadelphia.

In answer to this question it may be said that whatever civilization means, it does not prevent the great nations of the earth being supremely selfish, and acting the part of a cannibal towards their weaker fellows. No amount of explanation and reasoning can dispel this impression from the minds of Wu Ting Fang and his countrymen across the sea.
