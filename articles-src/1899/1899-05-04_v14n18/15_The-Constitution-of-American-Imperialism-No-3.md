The Constitution of American Republicanism was an instrument of delegated and limited powers. It was the instrument by which the people established the three departments of government and in which they granted to these three departments certain defined, specified, and limited powers. It was a limit upon power, because its object was to protect the weak against the strong. The organization of the Government into three departments was for the express purpose of making it hard to escape that limitation. Each department was to be a check upon the other should it be inclined to go beyond those limitations and violate the Constitution. It was necessary that it should mean exactly what it said, nothing more and nothing less. Every word, every phrase, was selected with the utmost care, for there must be in it no ambiguous expression to be construed as a warrant for unlawful power. Had its language or its principles been capable of anything else but a literal application the very object of its existence would have been frustrated and it might as well have never been written.

The constitution of American imperialism is an instrument of sovereign and unlimited powers. It exists to "consecrate" and to "stamp legality" upon the acts of arbitrary power. It is therefore an "elastic" document, "the most expansive document ever written by the hand of man." "It is like the tent that Saladin gave to Richard." When justice and human rights are concerned it can fold so small that it can rest in a nutshell! When warrant for unlawful power is desired it can expand so that "whole armies [imperial armies] can recline under its shade. . . . Expansive! Why, it is expansive enough to cover the world, if necessary [in the interests of expansion and imperialism]; and it can contract when the time and the occasion demand contraction" [when the rights of the people are concerned].*

Imperialists make much of their Anglo-Saxon descent, and especially of what they term their marvelous progress during the last century. The doctrine which they proclaim on the eve of the twentieth century was indignantly stamped into the ground by their ancestors seven centuries ago. Suppose King John, a few days after Runnymede, had informed the barons that the instrument in which they had asserted the rights of all the people of England and by which they had prescribed and limited his powers, was the most expansive document ever written by the hand of man! That it was like the tent which Saladin gave to his brother Richard: when it was folded it rested in a nutshell; when it was expanded whole armies could recline under its shade! That it was expansive enough to cover the world, if necessary; and that it could contract when the time and the occasion demanded contraction! That the principles of the Magna Charta were indeed great, but that they were not capable of literal application! How would it have fared with John Lackland in that case? The incidents of Runnymede leave no doubt on that point. There have been English sovereigns since that time who have dared to say as much, but Macaulay says that some of them found in the day of the wrath of the English people that it would have been better for them had they never been born.

"Great men are not always wise," and "men supremely great" who have substituted the abominable doctrine of arbitrary power for the principles of American constitutional government have committed an act of folly that not only astounds all men who value liberty throughout the world, but which exposes them and their country to the scorn and contempt of what some of them have been pleased to term "the cormorants of Europe." Mr. W. T. Stead, who visited Russia and other European countries some months ago, says:—

"It would do certain Americans good if they could see the smile with which the Old-World foreign offices read their lofty expositions of the reasons which compel poor Uncle Sam to pocket the Philippines. The sublime unselfishness of the United States reminds scoffing diplomats of the Old World of the Pharisee who went up into the temple to pray—'and remained to prey,' adds the scoffer—who obstinately refuses to see the sublime acme of altruism in a war which has ended in the seizure of all there was to be had for the taking in Asia and in America."

The Hamburgische Correspondz, while the peace negotiations were in progress, said:—

"The United States are conducting the peace negotiations as they conducted the war. The mask of humanity is being gradually dropped, revealing the brutal hand of strength."

At the same time the Paris Soltiel said:—

"No monarchical government would have dared to conduct itself after the fashion of the Americans, who are forever talking so much of right and liberty. . . . This is the result of the holy war undertaken to insure the independence of the Cubans. What base hypocrisy do these liberals, these democrats, these republicans, show."

The well known French writer, M. de Pressensé, in an article in the Contemporary Review, says:—

"Under the pretext of 'manifest destiny' the great Republic of the western hemisphere is becoming unfaithful to the principles of her founders, to the precedents of her constitutional life, to the traditions which have made her free, glorious, and prosperous. The seductions of imperialism are drawing the United States toward the abyss where all the great democracies of the world have found their end."

These quotations indicate that in the opinion of thinking Europeans, and of even the lackeys of "the powers" themselves, those statesmen who have placed the American Republic "in the front rank of the powers, henceforth to be reckoned with among the very few great nations of the earth," have forsaken the inheritance of the wise for the promotion of fools—have bartered away glory for shame!

In Atlanta, Ga., recently, Judge Broyles, in dismissing the cases of certain individuals brought before him on the charge of improper preaching on the streets, made the following commendable statement to some "orthodox" complainants: "As to the statement made by some of you that there are men in the city who abuse religion by indulging in debate and the like and preach what is not true religion, I think that the believer of any creed has the right to go upon the streets and tell the people what he thinks. A Jew, a Mohammedan, or the worship of any God has as much right to preach what he thinks as any of you, and if one is allowed such liberty I think it should be extended to the other."

*Within the last few weeks a very plain and practical illustration has been given of how such a constitution will operate. At the very time that the Filipinos were being driven from Maloios, their capital, great trusts were being formed in this country at the rate of sometimes a dozen a day, for the purpose of "strangling competition in order to raise prices to the consumer"—in order to prey upon the people, both competitors and consumers. These combinations are known to be dangerous to the public welfare. They are known by everybody to be so many gigantic and irresponsible organizations existing for the purpose of robbing the people in the mass. The routing and slaughtering of the Filipinos on the other side of the earth by authority of the American Government is declared to be constitutional by the exponents of imperialism, because the Constitution "is expansive enough to cover the world, if necessary." But it is not expansive enough to cover trusts. The attorney-general, who said some time ago, that "if we can govern ourselves, by that token we can govern others," declares that the Federal Government has no power under the Constitution to deal with "any combination constituting a restraint and monopoly of trade unless such trade is what is known as interstate or international trade and commerce." Thus, under an "elastic" constitution, the robbers of America may proceed without hindrance while the so-called rebels of the Philippines must be shot. If the sacredness of the Constitution protects robbery upon American soil, why cannot that sacredness protect even the "robbers," "rebels," and "bandits" of the Philippines? Possible the Constitution does not warrant interference with trusts except in the cases mentioned, but it ill becomes those who say so to stretch the Constitution around the world in order to interfere with people who desire to be left alone. If the authorities must keep their hands off the robbers on American soil, why should they not keep their hands off people on the other side of the earth?

†For a full exposition of this doctrine see the speech of Senator Platt, of Connecticut, delivered in the United States Senate Dec. 19, 1898, and reported in the Congressional Record of same date, pp. 321–331. The people have not enumerated in the Constitution all their rights. They have expressly reserved to themselves the right to choose or not to choose a religion, but they have not in express terms reserved the right to choose an occupation in life. They have reserved the right of freedom from slavery or involuntary servitude, but they have not reserved in express terms the right to labor of their own accord. Are they then not sovereign in these things, and does the general government possess "inherent sovereign power" in these matters? Is it true that every right which the people have not named is among the "sovereign rights of the nation upon which there is no limitation, and in regard to which there is no qualification?" Does the Federal Government have the right to enact and enforce every absurd, unjust, and abominable statute that has ever disgraced the laws of any nation ancient or modern, because it has not been prohibited from doing so in definite and express language? The exponents of imperialism say that it has. But the people have spoken differently. They have declared that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people," and that "the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." Neither State sovereignty nor national sovereignty is the doctrine of American government. The Doctrine of the Declaration and the Constitution is the sovereignty of the people, and the Government has no powers whatever, but those affirmatively delegated by the people. And the people do not possess absolute sovereignty. There are some things in which they are not sovereign; some powers which they can not delegate. The power (we mean, of course, just power, not physical power) to interfere with the inalienable rights of men, they cannot delegate, because they do not possess it. James Madison, in writing on sovereignty, said: "The sovereignty of society as vested in and exercisable by the majority, may do anything that could be rightfully done by the unanimous concurrence of the members; the reserved rights of individuals (conscience, for example) in becoming parties to the original compact being beyond the legitimate reach of sovereignty, wherever vested or however viewed." John Quincy Adams said in 1837: "In assuming the attributes of sovereign power, the colourists appealed to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of their intentions, and neither claimed nor conferred authority to do anything but for right. . . . The people who assumed their equal and separate station among the powers of the earth, by the laws of nature's God, by that very act acknowledged themselves bound to the observance of those laws, and could neither exercise nor confer any power inconsistent with them." Charles Sumner said: "This dogma [of illimitable sovereignty] is distinctly discarded in the Declaration, and it is frankly proclaimed that all sovereignty is subordinate to the rule of right." [Italics supplied in these quotations.]

‡The fact that Mr. Denby cites the cases of Americans tried in China and the case of a man who "committed murder off Japan in a ship that flew the American flag," does not help the matter at all. Mr. Denby says that the refusal of the writ of habeas corpus and the denial of the right of trial by jury was constitutional, because "the Constitution contracted to suit the case;" and that "it can contract when the time and the occasion demand contraction." He does not say that there is any place where it can not contract. In fact, he cites these cases for the express purpose of showing that the Constitution may contract at another place from that in which it contracted in these cases. We take it that he means that the Constitution can contract wherever it is, wherever its authority extends, "when the time and the occasion demand contraction." If it is constitutional to refuse the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and to deny the right of trial by jury, how are American citizens upon American soil to secure redress when these rights are denied them? Adherence to the Constitution is all that is required of public servants, and if they do those things that are constitutional, who can call them in question? This is sufficient to show to what desperate lengths it is necessary to go in order to deny to the Filipinos the right of self-government. It requires a complete repudiation of all the fundamental principles of constitutional government. Are the American people ready to surrender these rights that have become fixed in fundamental law only after long centuries of waiting and struggling in order that they may rule the Filipinos?
