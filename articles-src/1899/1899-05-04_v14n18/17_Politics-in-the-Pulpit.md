It may be said that religion has a bearing on every public problem, and this is true, but the moment the pulpit is dragged into partisan politics it loses its sanctity, the priest loses his authority and religion flies out of the window. For the layman, who is perfectly willing to submit to the spiritual guidance of his pastor and to concede that as an expositor of the Bible he has something of a superior character of the prophet, acknowledges in him no superiority as an expounder of politics, is enraged if their views do not coincide, and finally asks the pertinent question why the man should be paid out of his pocket to dope him from the pulpit with political principles that he despises.

Under the circumstances the only safe and the only proper rule for the minister is total abstinence from politics in the church. There should be no exceptions, because once encouraged there will be no end of them. National morals have been read into the tariff and money question, as they are now being read into the Filipino question, and clergymen before this have talked democratic politics to republican auditors or republican politics to democratic auditors upon very slight provocation, and always with the same result—wrangling, dissension and injury to the Christian work. The feeling will not down that it is essentially mischievous and misleading for a man to use the moral prestige of the pulpit, which comes to him solely as a religious teacher, as the sanction for any kind of political partisanship.
