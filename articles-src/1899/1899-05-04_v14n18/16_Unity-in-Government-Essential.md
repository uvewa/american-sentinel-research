Unity in governmental affairs is an absolute necessity. Oneness in aim and purpose lies at the very foundation of all government—even the government of God. Without this governments are unstable, and the happiness of the subject ever in jeopardy.

It was the recognition of this principle that led Jesus Christ to pray that his followers may be one even as he and his Father were one. John 17.

Satan recognizes that this is true concerning his own kingdom. He knows very well that lack of union is as destructive of his government as it would be of God's. And he knows perfectly well that Christ spoke the truth when he said, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand." Matt. 12:25.

From the first, Satan, while fighting against God and trying to overthrow divine government, has been as diligent as finite beings could possibly be in trying to secure unity—oneness, for his own. But he is as certain to fail as God is sure to succeed. And the reason for this is that he lacks unity in himself.

"God is One." There is unity only in God, and it is because of this that God will succeed. Only God can govern another, and he can do this because he is the perfect Master of himself. And yet in governing others he does not do so arbitrarily. He does it through the revelation of the divine principle of government. This principle of government is self-government—government of oneself, for oneself, and by oneself. This is perfect oneness.

Such a government as this can be secured in the individual only by the recognition of the divine principle and the acceptance of divine power, without which the principle could not be worked out. And it is the working out of this principle thus in the redeemed that will make the kingdom of God eternally secure.

In the recognition of this divine principle there is no danger of one's trying to govern another. Only by failing to recognize it could such a thing be. Through eternal ages the time will never come, in the working out of this principle, when a single soul will feel that he is capable of governing another. He will never rise beyond the power of governing himself.

When the Saviour's prayer shall be answered—as it is destined to be—and perfect oneness exists in the whole body of the redeemed, it will be because this oneness exists perfectly in each individual.

It was the recognition of this principle, so far as it could be done by earthly governments, that made the United States different from all the other nations of earth. And Lincoln gave expression to it when he said, "The doctrine of self-government is right—absolutely and eternally right." He was at the time speaking on the question of slavery. But that does not make it any the less true. Again, he said: "When the man governs himself, that is self government; but when he governs himself, and also another man, that is more than self-government—that is despotism." And yet again: "No man is good enough to govern another without that other's consent." And he might have added that no man could consent to such an act without ceasing to be a man—without yielding up his manhood.

No surer evidence can be given that a man is notable to govern himself than that he undertakes to govern another; it is certain that such an individual has lost the power of self-government.

But it is just this kind of government—governing others instead of oneself—of which Satan's government is the exponent. Of that type of government his is the ideal. Yet withal there must be unity in it, or it must ultimately collapse. But not having unity in himself the best he could do in this respect would be to bring about a mere semblance of unity, which can be done only through brute force. This being the best that Satan can do it is only a question of time when his government must collapse under its own weight, and be finally destroyed, with all who are connected with it.
