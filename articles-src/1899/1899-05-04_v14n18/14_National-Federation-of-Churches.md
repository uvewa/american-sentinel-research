THE Literary Digest says: "Steps have been taken by the Federation of Churches and Christian Workers and the Open and Institutional Church League looking to the formation of a national federation of churches and Christian workers. Letters have been sent to pastors, denominational leaders, and the officers of organizations interdenominational or federative in their character asking (1) their judgment as to the need and feasibility of such a federation, and (2) if one is organized whether coöperation may be expected. The secretary of the committee has already received many replies, nearly all favoring the national federation, and in every case promising active coöperation if one is organized."
