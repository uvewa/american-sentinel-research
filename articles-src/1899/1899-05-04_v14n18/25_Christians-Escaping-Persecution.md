Among the minor treasures of history which Egypt is yielding to the spade, is a certificate by which one charged with being a Christian escaped punishment. It is well known that Christians who were persecuted in the third century could escape death by flight, by offering sacrifices to the gods, or by securing a certificate of conformity to the state religion. Such a certificate has been recently brought to light in the Papyrus collection found at Fajjum in Egypt. It runs as follows: "The sacrifice commission of the village of Alexandra Nesos from Aurelius Diogenes. Latabus of the village of Alexandra Nesos, seventy two years old, has a scar on the right eye-brow. I have constantly offered sacrifice to the gods and also now in your presence I have offered sacrifices and libations and tasted of the flesh of the sacrifice, all according to the requirements, and beseech you to certify me accordingly. Farewell. I, Aurelius Diogenes have handed in this writing." Then follows in another handwriting the certificate of the proper official. The whole is dated June 26, 250, A.D.

This illustrates the true nature of a state church, after the Pagan model, and of the grounds on which Christians were condemned. The state prescribed religious forms and faith. If one refused to follow the faith thus made legal, he was punished just as he was if he broke any other legal enactment. Those who still clamor for the remnants of the Pagan State Church, as they appear in our Sunday laws, would need some system of certificates now if the laws were not dead.
