The most probable successor to the office of the speakership in Congress, lately vacated by Mr. Reed, is Congressman Sherman, of New York. There are many candidates for the office, but the *Philadelphia Record* mentions Mr. Sherman as the most likely to gain the place for the reason that he has the support of the Roman Catholics.
