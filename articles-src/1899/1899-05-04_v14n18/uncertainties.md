## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1 — Aphorism Series "CH"
- The "CH" label preceding each aphorism (CH 24, CH 25, etc.) is not fully explained in the issue. It appears to be a continuing series of editorial aphorisms, possibly "Choice Headings" or a similar recurring feature. These are numbered 24 through 32, suggesting they continue from prior issues. Each has been given its own file.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the meaning of "CH" is inferred from context.

### Page 3 — "A Self-Erected Obstacle" (ATJ)
- The article continues across a page break (pages 2–3). The OCR joins the text correctly; joined as continuous paragraphs.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 4 — "The Constitution of American Imperialism.—No. 3" (John D. Bradley)
- This article contains extensive footnotes (marked *, †, ‡) that appear at the bottom of pages but are integral to the text. The OCR duplicated the * footnote text (it appears twice in the OCR output — once on page 4 and once within the article body). The duplicate was removed; the footnote is included once at the end of the article.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the duplication is clearly an OCR artifact from the footnote spanning two pages.

### Page 6 — "Unity in Government Essential" (C. H. Keslake)
- Author "C. H. Keslake" is not in the known authors list. The byline reads "BY C. H. KESLAKE." Initials assigned as CHK.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.

### Page 7 — "Politics in the Pulpit"
- Attributed to Chicago "Times-Herald" as a reprint. The header gives `Chicago "Times-Herald."` — treated as reprint attribution with original_publication: "Chicago Times-Herald".
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 8 — "The Town of Bondage" (Frances E. Bolton)
- Author "Frances E. Bolton" is not in the known authors list. The byline reads "BY FRANCES E. BOLTON." Initials assigned as FEB.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — byline is explicit.
- The story ends with "(Continued in next issue.)" — this is the first installment only.

### Page 9 — "News Notes and Comment"
- This section header appears to span a large editorial section across pages 9–10. The items within are separated by `* * *` in the OCR. Rather than creating one large file, the section has been split into the logical sub-articles it contains (files 21 and the later page 16 notes). The extended "Palmetto, Georgia" commentary runs through all the asterisk-divided paragraphs on pages 9–10 as a single unified editorial argument, so it has been filed as one article (file 21).
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the Palmetto discussion is clearly one continuous editorial argument.

### Page 13 — Boilerplate "TO OUR PATRONS"
- Skipped — subscription/administrative boilerplate.

### Pages 13–16 — Advertisements and Book Listings
- Skipped: "IMPORTANT TRACTS," "LOOKING UNTO JESUS," "Heralds of the Morning," "Desire of Ages," "Grand Trunk Railway System," "ALMOST A MAN," "ALMOST A WOMAN," "CHILD CONFIDENCE REWARDED," "The Signs of the Times," "Christ Our Saviour," "THE DESIRE OF AGES" — all are advertisements and subscription information.

### Page 16 — Short Editorial Notes
- The page 16 editorial notes are a series of short, separate items. Each has been given its own file (files 26–35). The note beginning "We publish this week..." (file 26) appears to be an editorial note about the Town of Bondage series rather than part of that article itself.
- **Confidence:** HIGH
