The following observations on the subject of a state-enforced Sabbath are made by the Jewish Exponent. They are worth noting and remembering:—

"The rough hand of the state injures the delicate structure of faith. It materializes and secularizes it. It provides a form, and men learn to regard the empty form as the entire substance. It is entirely powerless to breathe a spirit into these forms. It imposes these forms upon a people who are steadily growing further and further away from their purpose; with the result that they become an oppressive burden; a hateful and detested constraint, to be burst asunder if at all possible; or, if not, to be evaded and escaped from until lawlessness ceases to be an offense in the eyes of the people.

"The Christian world does not know what is the matter. It complains of Sabbathlessness, of the holiday-making spirit prevalent on the day, of the decrease in church attendance. It turns hither and thither and attaches the blame upon this and that. It endeavors to make the laws more rigorous, or at least to prevent their modification or amelioration in any way in response to public opinion.

"The truth is, the state cannot make a Sabbath; it can but injure its true observance. Israel is in a measure blessed, that it has no state imposed Sabbath. Those who observe the Jewish Sabbath do it out of the fulness of religious conviction, from a due recognition of the sanctifying power of the day, not in accordance with fashion, nor under compulsion from the mailed hand of the secular law. We ask no state assistance, we but claim the right to be unmolested and that the sacrifice demanded of us for maintaining this priceless boon for humanity in all its integrity shall not be too severe. Give us an equal chance, and do not compel us, if we observe our Sabbath, to lose our means of livelihood on another day as well."
