THE *Chicago Record*, speaking of the lynchings in Georgia, says: "It is particularly humiliating to the United States at a time when it is occupying such a conspicuous position before the world as a champion of the oppressed, to have such barbarous, inhuman, and uncivilized outrages taking place at home."

That is very true; for "actions speak louder than words," and the United States cannot complain if the nations of Europe judge it by this rule. At the very time when this nation is putting forth the loftiest professions ever made by any nation in modern times, its vaunted civilization exposes to the world a malignant cancer eating at its very vitals. It is safe to say there is not a nation in all Europe that has any confidence whatever in the professions by which this Government seeks to justify its policy of foreign conquest.
