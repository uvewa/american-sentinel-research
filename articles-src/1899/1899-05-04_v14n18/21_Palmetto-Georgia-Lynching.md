EVENTS which have happened the past week in Palmetto, Ga., have been the subject of talk and newspaper comment throughout the civilized world. We refer to them here only because of the lesson which they teach.

Some weeks ago, at this place, a mob took from jail several negroes accused of stealing, and shot them. The justification of this, as of other "mob law" proceedings against the southern negroes, was that the latter could only be kept within proper bounds by some more powerful deterrent than was provided in legal measures against crime. They must be restrained by the awful object lesson of mob law vengeance.

The negroes of the place were of course enraged; and now the whole country is stirred over the news of a most barbarous assassination of a white man at Palmetto by a negro in his employ, and of the events which followed. The white man was supposed to have been a leader of the mob who shot the negro prisoners.

The negro assassin was pursued, and after some time, was captured; he was charged with and believed to be guilty of a more revolting crime committed in immediate connection with the assassination. With this belief in mind, the fury of the people knew no bounds. The prisoner was brought back to the scene of his crime, and there burned at the stake, meanwhile being subjected to every kind of torture that could readily be applied. Another negro whom the assassin had charged with complicity in his crime, was taken by the same mob, tortured, and hung, although the only direct evidence against him was the word of a man whom the mob considered not fit to die a legal death.

The circumstances attending the death of these negroes are without parallel in the annals of crime; for not only were the most unusual tortures inflicted, but the remains of bone and flesh left by the fire were carried away in pieces by the crowd to be treasured as mementoes; and such ghastly relics were, it is said, put on sale in Atlanta at a good price. Neither of the aboriginal savages of this or other lands, or the more refined savages who managed the Spanish Inquisition, is it recorded that they ever carried the spirit of hatred and revenge to such limits.

All this was done for a reason; and the reason was given in a placard nailed up at the place of execution, which read, "We must protect our white women." Upon this ground the deed was justified by the people.

But what ground of justification is this? What protection do such proceedings afford? When the negroes were taken from prison and shot, that did not protect the community against further violence. On the contrary, it only excited a thirst for revenge which led to a greater crime. And what else could be expected? The spirit of hatred and revenge is always a prompter of crime; and when this spirit is roused, the community is in much greater danger of suffering from crime than it was before. The terrible vengeance meted out by the mob to negro criminals may inspire terror in the negro mind, as it is meant to do; but while this may be done, it is certain that it will also develop a spirit of hatred against those by whom it is done. And this spirit will be manifested in deeds of violence whenever the opportunity is deemed favorable to do so.

This whole matter is one which touches the very foundation principles of government; that is what makes it so serious. It is given out that mob vengeance must be resorted to in this country for protection. That is the meaning of every act of lynching, and there are several hundred cases of lynching in this country every year. That is what the people in many sections of the country are coming to believe.

Protection is the very purpose of civil government. As the Declaration of Independence states, all men have certain rights, and "to preserve these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." But "mob law" is the very opposite of government; it is anarchy. Is anarchy the most efficient preventive of crime? If it is, let it be substituted for the criminal code and the courts of law.

If the mob ever did right in punishing a criminal, Washington, Jefferson, Hancock, Hamilton, and the rest did wrong in founding this Government; for the one is directly contrary to the other. The mob never "takes the law into its hands" without violating the fundamental law of this Government. If mob methods should be generally resorted to, the Government would cease to exist.

A mob execution, therefore, is a direct blow against the Government. Whether meant to be such or not, that is what it is. It is a direct menace to all that which the people enjoy under the Government. It is a destroyer by nature, and not a protector. It is not a watch dog, but a wolf.

Mob rule promotes mob rule, and that only. By the fundamental laws of justice, mob rule is crime. Crime is the setting aside of law, and is therefore anarchy. The negro assassin in Georgia committed a terrible crime. That was anarchy. Then the mob, to cure such anarchy, became anarchists themselves! Crime prevented by crime—anarchy cured by anarchy! As well talk of putting out fire with fire, or of stopping a flood with water. Crime can be checked only by its opposite. Darkness can be driven out only by light. Evil must be overcome with good. That is Scriptural, and it is the truth.

This is not a sectional question, either. The people of Georgia, on the average, are not a whit worse than the people of the North. No one State of the Union can look down upon another from a height of moral preeminence. Northern people who are inclined to think otherwise should remember the draft riots in New York City in 1863. On that occasion, in this representative city of the North, a white mob attacked the negro orphan asylum, and negro babies were thrown to death from the windows and murdered in other ways. The North has no reason to look down upon the South on the ground of regard for law and order and the instincts of humanity. Northern journals admit this truth in discussing the occurrence in Georgia, and one leading daily in this city, after citing facts which reflect similar discredit upon England and Germany, makes the suggestion "that the North, the South, Germany and England, elect delegates to a convention to consider this question: 'Why is it that under certain conditions we are all savages?'" Then it inquires, "How many more millions of years will it take us to become civilized through and through?"

If "under certain conditions" we are all savages, it must be true that "we" are savages by nature. For circumstances do not change nature, but only give nature a greater or less chance to show itself in its true light. A person who is not by nature a savage will not be a savage "under some circumstances" or under any circumstances. And of this class of persons, Jesus Christ is the type and perfect example. He was subjected to every form and degree of provocation, but under no circumstances was he a savage; and his sincere followers will imitate his course. "As He was, so are we in this world."

The admission that "under certain circumstances we are all savages," is an admission that civilization is not a cure for savagery, but only a veneer beneath which it is hidden until "certain circumstances" call it out; that not civilization, but Christianity, draws the line against savagery in the human heart.

A great many rely upon the power of education for a solution of the race problem in the South. But since human depravity is at the bottom of this question, it cannot be that education can furnish the remedy. If it could, man could educate himself out of his natural depravity and become his own saviour. The voice of history is eloquent upon this point. No nation was ever saved by education—by mere learning. Salvation from immorality demands power; and as has often been pointed out, in the sphere of morals knowledge is not power. Egypt was once the seat of the world's civilization and learning; but Egypt became the wickedest nation on the earth, and perished in its own corruption. Then Assyria arose, and Babylon, and Persia, and Greece. These were in turn the centers of civilization, and each in turn fell before other nations and tribes which had not learned so many ways in which to be immoral. And finally Rome arose and ruled the world for hundreds of years; and Roman learning and civilization are made a chief study in the "higher education" of today. But when the rude barbarians poured down from the uncultivated North and swept the Roman empire off the earth, they found, says the historian, a state of moral rottenness at which they blushed.

No, learning, knowledge, is not moral power. The devil himself has more education than any person can hope to gain in this life, but he is the devil still. But "the power of God unto salvation" is in the world, and free to all; and whoever will receive it can be reclaimed from his innate savagery the selfsame hour so thoroughly that he will not be a savage under any circumstances. In this power lies the only hope of the world.
