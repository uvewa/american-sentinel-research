LEADERS of the opposition to Sunday newspapers in London recently made an appeal to the government and asked that legal steps be taken to stop this desecration of "the Sabbath." Whereupon the government leader, Mr. Balfour, replied that "her Majesty's government has no intention of interfering in the matter."

In reply to questions asked by the Industrial Commission sitting at Washington, the chiefs of the leading railroad organizations drew up a report which was recently presented, and in which they expressed themselves in favor of the abolition of Sunday trains.
