"PRIVATE advices from Rome," says a "special" to the Chicago *Times Herald*, indicate the coming appointment of a "cardinal in curia" to represent the United States at the Vatican. Such officials are "important functionaries in the diplomatic intercourse of the Vatican." "It is said," reads the dispatch, "the authorities in Washington have been indirectly approached in the matter," and it is hinted that when Archbishops Ireland and Keene return "something more definite will be available on this point."
