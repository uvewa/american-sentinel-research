THE following instructive item is from the Union Signal, of August 3: "The Filipinos, says Mr. F. R. Roberson, who has recently returned from the Philippines, have a horror of intoxicating beverages, and would not allow the sale of them in their towns. Yet the United States Government permitted its soldiers to get credit at the canteens for an amount equal to one-half of their month's pay before it was due. And Manila was filled with rum shops soon after our men got possession. An American was asked by a cultured native, 'Is this the civilization you bring?' and he could only maintain a humiliated silence."
