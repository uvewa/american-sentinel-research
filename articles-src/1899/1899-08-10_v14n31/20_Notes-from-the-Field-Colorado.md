## Notes from the Field.

### COLORADO.

During the last few weeks the smelter employees throughout the State have been, and are still out on a strike, which has been brought about by nearly all of the smelters going into a trust, and laying down such rules as were considered too oppressive by the workingmen of the Smelters' Union. Both the trust and the union are very determined in their demands upon each other, so much so that the present indications are not very favorable for an early settlement of the difficulty. In Durango and many other towns the families of the strikers are suffering severely. Business is prostrated, and the outlook is a sad one.

"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come." And all this because "men are lovers of their own selves." O, how easily all this trouble could be avoided if men would love God with all the heart, and his neighbor as himself.

G. W. ANGLEBARGER.

Durango, July 30.
