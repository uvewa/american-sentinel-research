"SOME time ago a Catholic priest of Chicago, "Father" Heldmann, announced that he would be a candidate for Congress, provided he could get the consent of his bishop. The New York Journal said that if it was necessary for the priest to get some other person's consent to be a candidate for Congress, he ought not to "run" for the office at all. To this it was replied that the priest's attitude was according to the long standing rules of the church, which could not be altered by the Congress of the United States.

THE Journal's answer was conclusive in the matter, and makes a statement of principle which ought to prevail in American politics, though it seldom does. It said:—

"It is quite true that before the Congress of the United States was heard of a priest of the Roman Catholic Church was bound by certain rules. But it is also true that ever since the Congress of the United States has existed, a man, to be a member of it, must be governed solely by the Constitution of the United States and his own conscience. Consequently, the Congress of the United States is a body of entirely free men, chosen to make laws for an entirely free nation. No man is fit to sit in that Congress who requires the consent of another man to his becoming a candidate."
