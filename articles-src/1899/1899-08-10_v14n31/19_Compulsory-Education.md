## Compulsory Education.

Swoor him who hauls the flag down—on the spot!
Whether in Yukon cold or Luzon hot.
For, we may lower it with dignity,
Not even when it's where it should'nt be;
Up with Old Glory—down with what it means—
Freedom and peace—down with the Philippines!
When wicked Spain oppressed the Tagal land,
The race was noble and its cause was grand,
But what a change, what startling things time does!
Patriots against Spain, they're rebels against us—
Rebels most foul, as rebels always are,
Hating our trusty President—their czar.

He'll give the people local freedom, when
They prove they're fit for slaves, but not till then.
He'll teach them then how caucuses are run,
Conventions bossed and close elections won;
How "slates" are made, indictments quashed,
And how the blackest boodlers are whitewashed—
Till some day they'll become as pure as we,
And show the world a Tagal Tammany.
Misguided Tagals, kneel and sue for quarter,
And then your czar will kindly stop your slaughter.
Slaughter—the word's too harsh—let's call this trifle
Compulsory education with a rifle.
Who heeds the antis and their scornful hooting?
We'll teach the young idea to shoot—by shooting;
Teach it our methods and our enterprises,
And how a Christian nation civilizes;
When rapid firing and the highest priced,
We have more trust in cannon than in Christ.
By trusts our country's fed, and clothed, and shod—
A trust in everything excepting God.
When we betrayed the men who were allies
To make their country an imperial prize
(Our honor silenced and our conscience hushed),
Recording angels wept and Satan blushed.
O, La Fayette, at Yorktown what a chance!
You should have seized America for France.
We'll win the Tagal's love if slaughter'll win it,
If this is method there is madness in it.

—James J. Dooling, in "Boston Transcript."
