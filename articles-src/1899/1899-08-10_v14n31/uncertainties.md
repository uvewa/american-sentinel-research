## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 01: "A Hopeless Idea of 'Reform.'"
- The text on page 1 appears alongside an illustration (img-1.jpeg). The caption/description text and the brief editorial note beneath it were treated as a single article. The second paragraph ("The Creator worked on the first day of the week...") may be a separate standalone note rather than continuation of the illustration caption. Confidence: MEDIUM. Both paragraphs appear on page 1 together without a title break between them, so they are kept as one unit.

### Article 09: "Destiny, The Inexorable Logic of Events, No. 3"
- Attribution: The article is headed "BY JOHN D. BRADLEY." This appears to be a contributed article, not one of the known regular authors. The `attribution: explicit` designation is used since the author name is explicitly stated in the article. No initials are given; full name "John D. Bradley" is used. This author does not appear in the known authors list and no initials file naming is applied — filename uses no author initials suffix since initials are not determinable from the byline format.
- Confidence: HIGH for authorship; the byline is clear.

### Article 18: "Attitude of the Epworth League"
- Attribution: The article is signed "BY J. C. BARTHOLF." This author is not in the known authors list. Attribution marked as `explicit` with full name given. No initials suffix in filename.
- Confidence: HIGH for authorship; the byline is clear.

### Article 20: "Notes from the Field: Colorado"
- Author "G. W. ANGLEBARGER" signed at end. Not in known authors list. Dateline "Durango, July 30" confirms location context, not part of author attribution.
- Confidence: HIGH.

### Article 21: "Notes from the Field: Washington"
- Author "A. G. CHRISTIANSON" signed at end. Not in known authors list.
- Confidence: HIGH.

### Article 22: "Notes from the Field: Arizona"
- Author "J. E. EVANS" signed at end. Not in known authors list.
- The word "page" near end of first paragraph ("through the page") appears to be an OCR error; the original likely reads "through the place" or "throughout the place" or possibly "through the press." Transcribed as found in OCR. Confidence: LOW for this word.

### Article 23: "Notes from the Field: Vermont"
- Author "GRANT ADKINS" signed at end. Not in known authors list.
- Confidence: HIGH.

### Article 24: "Editorial Aphorisms"
- "Bishop Philipps Brooks" — OCR may have rendered the name incorrectly. The well-known bishop is Phillips Brooks (one 'l', no 'ph' combination), but the text reads "Philipps." Transcribed as it appears in the OCR without correction, per project rules. Flagged here for review against original scan.
- Confidence: LOW for this name spelling.

### Page Structure Notes
- Pages 13–15 consist almost entirely of subscription/publication boilerplate, advertisements for Pacific Press books and tracts, and a "Read Next Week's Paper" notice. These have been skipped per instructions (ads, subscription info, boilerplate).
- The "A Card" notice (Foreign Mission Board donation appeal) on page 13 was treated as boilerplate/administrative and skipped.
