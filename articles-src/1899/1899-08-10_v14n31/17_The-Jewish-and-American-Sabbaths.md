## The "Jewish" and "American" Sabbaths.

AN English exchange says that "In America business interests have led many Jews to feel that they cannot lose a day every week, and there are many indications that the same sentiment is growing here." Then it quotes the following from the London Daily Mail:—

"Metropolitan Jewry is at present deeply interested in, and not a little disturbed by, a proposal which has been made to hold services on Sunday for those who cannot attend synagogue on the Sabbath.

"The proposal emanates from West Hampstead, the abode of a large section of Jews of the middle and upper middle classes. Competition and the consequent necessity of constant attention to business, to say nothing of the Jewish interest in the Stock Exchange, it is argued, prevent the majority of the wealthier Israelites from attending the usual Sabbath morning service.

"The organizers of the movement argue that any service is better than none; but that the matter is regarded with some apprehension by the ecclesiastical authorities may be evidenced from the fact that the chief Rabbi recently devoted the whole of his sermon at a London synagogue to strenuously opposing the innovation, which he feared might lead, as it had done in some cases in America and Germany, to the substitution of Sunday for the Jewish Sabbath."

In England and in America the "Jewish Sabbath" is waning, and in America, as we are now often reminded, the "American Sabbath" is on the wane. A like fate is threatening both these institutions, and that they are thus subject to the same weakness suggests that there is a similarity in their nature. And that is really the secret of the situation. There is a "Jewish Sabbath,"—not the "Sabbath of the Lord," which is observed by many Christians, but an institution stamped with the Jewish imprint—and there is an "American Sabbath;" and both are man-made institutions. Being man-made they are like all other things human, subject to decay and final ruin. The same spirit of commercialism is making inroads upon each and threatening both with destruction.

The "Sabbath of the Lord," however, is not man-made; and neither man nor any influence from the world can destroy it. That Sabbath will stand forever. The "Jewish Sabbath" is the Sabbath as the Jews observe it; the "American Sabbath" is the Sabbath as Americans observe it; the "Sabbath of the Lord" is the Sabbath as the Lord observed it and commanded it to be observed; and the difference between the first two and the last is the difference between man and God. The human will fall to the ground; the divine will stand through all ages; and he who is wise will not join himself to an institution that is sooner or later to go down in a wreck.
