"THERE is good reason for believing," says the Rome correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph, "that the pope will shortly make another solemn protest against the position of the Vatican in Italy." The pope feels that he was grossly slighted in being shut out from representation at the Peace Congress, and wants to convince the Powers and the world in general that his exclusion was a great mistake. If the pope is really, as he claims to be, the vicar of the Prince of Peace, he can have no possible use for an army; and to have been represented at the Congress of armed potentates, would only have constituted a visible demonstration that the Prince of Peace and his alleged vicar are strangers to each other.
