A PROMINENT European journal, a representative of which had succeeded in getting an interview with Admiral Dewey in Vienna, published the following answer made by the admiral to the question as to what he expected would develop from the Peace Congress at The Hague:—

"Who is to disarm first? The experiment was tried in the United States, and look what it cost us to get ready in time, and how we had to fear the issue. We now think differently, and are building forty men-of-war. We shall not be taken by surprise and found unprepared again; and it is hard to believe, in view of our terrific exertions, that the other Powers will abandon the advantage of their armaments and give them up."
