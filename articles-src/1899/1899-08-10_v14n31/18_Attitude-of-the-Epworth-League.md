## Attitude of the Epworth League.

### BY J. C. BARTHOLF.

Judging by the utterances of its leaders and the resolutions adopted at the International Epworth League convention, held at Indianapolis, July 20–24, 1899, it is both safe and true to assert that that organization is unqualifiedly committed to the un-American, unpatriotic, and unscriptural doctrine of the union of church and state.

In a lecture delivered by the eminent editor of the New York Christian Advocate, Rev. Dr. J. M. Buckley, the address began with these significant words:—

"In this country church and state are united. It is, therefore, most appropriate that under the flags a representative of the Federal Government should preside."

Another speaker, addressing himself to the topic, "The Obligation of the Citizen to the Church," took occasion in his remarks to define his conception of the proper relation between state and church, thus:—

"Our first suggestion is that the Christian Church has a recognized legal place among American institutions and is from that standpoint entitled to the support of American citizens. Perhaps we occasionally need a fair statement of the relation of church and state in our country. The separation could not be absolute in a sense that would mean separation of the state from religion. Our Government employs in its judiciaries and in inaugurating its officers the Christian oath. It appoints from time to time days of thanksgiving, fasting and prayer. Congress and the army and navy have their regular chaplains paid by the Government. Church property, like school property, is exempt from taxation. Decisions of the courts established beyond question that Christianity is an integral part of the law of our land. The citizen has another obligation to the church aside from his relation to his country. He is bound to support it because of the benefits he and his kind personally receive from it."

If this language is not sufficient to prove that the Epworth League movement is thoroughly committed to the union of church and state, and that it looks to the civil power to enforce the dogmas and behests of the church, then the following resolution on the question of Sunday observance will certainly remove all doubts from every candid mind:—

"Whereas, the encroachments continually made upon the Christian Sabbath by Sunday newspapers, Sunday excursions, and Sunday baseball games, and kindred amusement demand unwearied vigilance by precept, example, and the enactment and the vigorous enforcement of laws on the Sabbath question, we shall continue to oppose the wanton desecration of the Sabbath day."

From the following resolution it is quite evident how Epworth Leaguers hope to aid in bringing about "the enactment and the vigorous enforcement of laws on the Sabbath question":—

"We cordially indorse the good citizenship movement and commend it to young people everywhere. We favor a federation with other young people's societies, both locally and nationally, through suitable executive committees for the promotion of Christian citizenship."

Notwithstanding the general tendency, occasionally a speaker would give utterance to sound views, both from a scriptural and political standpoint, as to the relations that should obtain between the church and the state. A noteworthy illustration of this statement was afforded by the address of Rev. J. M. King, of Philadelphia, who, among other things, said:—

"Let no political or ecclesiastical outcry from whatever source, against religious instruction in the schools, be the means of banishing a high morality from the character of the teaching or from the qualifications of the teacher. The American idea is that the school shall be a civil educator to make good citizens, and good citizens must possess moral character. The schools will inevitably be a reflex of the noble, cultured, moral characters of the men and women in them as instructors. Banish absolutely all sectarianism from the management and teaching of these public schools, and all evidence in the structures used, or in the garb of the teachers that would suggest denominational relationship or hint at the remotest connection of church and state. Let national, state, county, and municipal treasuries be jealously guarded against all attempts for the sectarian division of the sacred funds which they hold for the support of common schools. Let all partisan political control be banished from the management of the schools. Let a solemn, if unrecorded, oath of allegiance to our institutions by every loyal citizen embrace the defense of the American system of free common schools—a defense conducted without malice, without bigotry, without fear, without compromise."

The convention also took very positive ground against the opinion of Attorney-General Griggs, by which the anti-canteen legislation of Congress has been made of no effect. The resolution adopted was as follows:

"The enormity of the liquor business is, if possible, more apparent than ever before. We congratulate the country on the passage of the anti-canteen act which so accurately represents the will of the American people. Its nullification by Attorney-General Griggs is viewed with painful solicitude and ever-increasing indignation, and we hereby pledge Congress our hearty support in maintaining it against the untenable opinions of a subordinate executive officer. We heartily indorse the union of temperance forces sought by the American Anti-saloon League and urge local, State and national cooperation with all enemies of the rum power."

Another question which received not a little attention was that of the proposed unseating of Congressman-elect Brigham H. Roberts, the alleged polygamist of Utah. The resolution adopted by the convention on this subject reads as follows:

"We regard the election of a polygamist to Congress by the State of Utah as an indignity offered to every American citizen and an insult to the sanctity and purity of the Christian home. We protest against the election of Mr. Roberts to the House of Representatives and demand that one whose life is so repugnant to Christian principles shall be expelled from that great law-making body. This convention, representing 2,500,000 members, does also hereby most respectfully and most earnestly call upon every member of the Senate and House of Representatives to use his utmost endeavor and to exhaust all honorable means to secure action by the Fifty-sixth Congress proposing an amendment to the national Constitution and submitting the same to the legislatures of the several States, defining legal marriage to be monogamic and making polygamy under whatsoever guise or pretense a crime against the United States, punishable by the severest penalties, including disfranchisement and disqualification to vote, or to hold any office of honor or emolument under the United States or any State or Territory thereof.

To the imperial policy of the present administration the convention did not commit itself by resolution, though the general tenor of speeches, which in any way had a bearing on this subject, seemed strongly to favor the expansion idea; and the present seemingly cordial relations between the United States and Great Britain were referred to at nearly every meeting, and every such reference was greeted by most liberal applause. It is fair and just to state in conclusion that the present attitude of the Epworth League on present day problems is as follows: in favor of the union of church and state, radical Sunday legislation, the prohibition of the liquor traffic, and modern imperialism; and opposed to polygamy, the seating of Congressman-elect Roberts, and the continuance of the army canteen.
