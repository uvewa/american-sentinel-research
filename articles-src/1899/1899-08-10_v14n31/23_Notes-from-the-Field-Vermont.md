### VERMONT.

BARRIE, July 24.—There was held last evening in this city, in the Hedding Methodist Church, a meeting of the Young Peoples' Society of Christian Endeavor, to consider "the proper observance of the Lord's day" or Sunday. Quite a goodly number were present to participate in the discussion of the matter, especially those who believe that the State should define and enforce Sunday keeping.

The pastor was present, and being a man of brains and influence, of course his suggestions had weight. He took special pains to read the statute of Vermont on Sunday desecration, calling attention to Sections 4315, 4316, of the revised code. In the course of his remarks the pastor said that "it was not legislation that was needed so much as example from the leaders of the cause, as the greatest desecration did not come from the world, but from religious people."

The pastor evidently saw a weakness in the logic of supporting first-day observance by applying Scripture, that had no reference whatever to that day. To explain this weakness he said:

"After the resurrection of Christ the Christian Church changed the day from the seventh to the first day, and by that changed the letter but not the spirit."(!) But the pastor did not tell what church that "Christian Church" was that made the change. No! That would not do. Well, there is one sure thing: if the pastor and his flock accept the change and take that day which was substituted for the God-given day, it shows that there is a harmonious agreement between them and the "Christian Church" that made the "change." And every intelligent student of history and Bible lore knows if they have studied the subject, that it was the papacy that made that "change;" and on that basis and that alone does all Sunday-keeping and religious legislation rest.

All the testimonies given and prayers offered at this meeting conveyed the impression that when the power of the State fell into the hands of that society, religious liberty and freedom of conscience would be things of the past.
