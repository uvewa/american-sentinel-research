### WASHINGTON.

ROCKFORD.—Three weeks ago the pastor of the Presbyterian church in this town preached a Sabbath-sermon. He stated that at their last conference their ministers were requested to preach upon that subject once a year. And now he wished to comply with the request. He preached a straight Sabbath-sermon with the exception of saying Sunday a few times instead of Sabbath. He stated that the Sabbath dated back to creation, was placed in the center of the moral law, and the Sabbath or fourth commandment could not be set aside except the whole law should be abolished.

Further, he said that the Sabbath was the foundation of true religion and of the success of individuals, communities and nations. Then referring to the leading civilized nations in the world, he boldly declared that their success and attainments were solely due to their faithfulness in Sabbath (Sunday) keeping.

Thus we see how the people are being instructed that Sunday-keeping is the salvation of both themselves and the nation.

A. G. CHRISTIANSON.
