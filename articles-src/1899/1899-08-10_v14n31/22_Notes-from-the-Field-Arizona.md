### ARIZONA.

PRISMIX.—During the past winter, just before the legislature assembled, a bill was presented to the people, prepared for the legislature, requesting it to provide for the better observance of Sunday as the Lord's day. Petitions accompanied this bill. A separate bill was presented for closing saloons on Sunday. This was killed in the House, and the other did not receive a hearing. During this time we had distributed tracts upon the subject through the page. The leading paper in the city gave a column to an article I prepared against the bill. This was printed the day before the saloon bill was presented.

About the 1st of April petitions were handed to the different clergymen in the city for the removal of band concerts from the City Hall plaza, on the ground that the petitioners were disturbed. I explained why we could not sign it. Our church is some distance from the square, and our meetings are held on the seventh day, not Sunday. The concerts are still given there. Only one church was anywhere near enough to be disturbed, and I could not see how there could be a disturbance of all the churches.

This is a western town, but still there is a growing sentiment which must soon effectually abridge religious liberty.

J. E. EVANS.
