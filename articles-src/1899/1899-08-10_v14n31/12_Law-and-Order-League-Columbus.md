THE Law and Order League of Columbus, Ohio, have been making a fight to remove from office the director of public safety, because he would not close up a theater in one of the city parks on Sundays. Recently the League gave out a statement that should a successor in this office be appointed, they would not dictate to him, but that a "committee of prominent business men" would be ready to consult with the mayor regarding the choice that he shall make in the matter. If the League can dictate this choice, they will not need to do any dictating afterwards.
