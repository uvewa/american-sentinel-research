BISHOP WARREN, of the M. E. Church, who is in charge of Methodist mission work in South America, in his last report from that field, speaks as follows concerning the progress made by the people there toward the attainments of religious freedom:—

"The thing that constantly impresses one more and more is the emancipation that all thinking people are working out for themselves from the tyranny of an ecclesiastical organization that has held undisputed sway for three hundred years. On the one hand, the follies of the church, the gross superstitions inculcated, the frequent lack of common and necessary morals even in the clergy, and the utter failure to meet the conditions of advance in thought for men, contribute greatly to this result. On the other hand, the great tidal influences that are sweeping the human mind everywhere to-day toward freedom and development, the excellent schools that we have established in these countries, and the preaching of the gospel or power that has efficiency to change lives and dissipate even the darkness of the grave, have still further contributed to this end."

"The opposition of the common people to the papal church in South America has reached such an extent as to obtain the notice of the pope at Rome. About a score of bishops were called to Rome early in May to consult in regard to what should be done. If these bishops had come together and discussed these matters in South America, there would have been a probability of some valuable conclusions being reached, at least much information would have been obtained. But they were called to discuss this question under the predominating influence and stress of the papal power in Rome itself; they were confined to a list of questions drawn up by the pope, and from the report of proceedings, as far as they have been given to the public, I have not seen that the least progress toward a better state of things has been made. Doubtless these bishops will come back impressed by the grandeur of the Romish churches, the magnificence of the millinery, the sensuousness of the ritual of the church; but as for any amelioration of the real difficulties there is little possibility.

"As an indication of the progress made toward freedom of thought and of conscience, it may be mentioned that the conference sent a committee to call upon President Rosas, of the Argentine Republic, asking that the Protestant young men who were called upon for yearly drill in the army should not be obliged to worshipfully kneel at the celebration of the masses before the troops. It was represented to him that the best soldiers are those who obey their consciences and feel that they fight for their country by choice rather than by restraint. The president received us most cordially, promised to give his personal influence for the securing of this exemption, and directed us in regard to the best method of securing the end we had in view. In a short time a decree was published granting perfect freedom of conscience to conscripts in this matter."

"There is a monument in Santiago that bears touching testimony to the fact that the human heart, in spite of wrong teaching, is most tender toward the needy and suffering. During the half century from 1820 to 1874 those who refused or had not the opportunity to die under the auspices of the Romish Church were hauled away like dead dogs to a place given up to criminals of all sorts, and buried without any sign to mark the particular place. In 1874 the whole region was turned into a public park and a beautiful monument was erected, representing a woman dropping a rose upon these unknown graves. The pedestal bore this inscription: 'To the memory of those expatriated from heaven and earth who, on this site, were buried during the half century, 1820-74.' Those who so pity them that are regarded as irrevocably lost ought certainly to manifest a great interest in saving those to whom the free salvation can be fully offered."
