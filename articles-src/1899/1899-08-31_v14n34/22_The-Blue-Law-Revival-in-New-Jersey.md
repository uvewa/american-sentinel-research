PATERSON, N. J., Aug. 20.—This city was disturbed by another blue Sunday to-day. It was the third that the citizens have had to endure since the spasm of virtue struck town. A man couldn't get a shave in this city to-day for any money; he couldn't get a cake of ice if he offered a block of stock in one of the local silk mills for it, and even the butchers and grocers frowned on customers who came to their places during the early morning to lay in supplies.

People walked on the streets for fear that a microscopic examination of the ancient parchments in the City Hall had revealed to the eager searchers some ordinance against running. It is a fact that the city archives are being ransacked for obsolete laws into which the elixir of life may be infused so the privileges of citizens may be curtailed. The city has "got it bad," and the only people who seem to be profiting by it all are the justices of the peace, whose fees are running up on account of the increased demand for old brands of justice.

The first of the Blue Laws to be enforced was dug out by men whose motives were selfish. They are the barbers, the boss barbers, not the journeymen. They wanted to take Sunday off, but didn't see how they could so long as any of their neighbors of the same calling kept open. There are 250 barbers in Paterson, and all but eighty belong to the Barbers' Association. These eighty could not be induced to close up for the benefit of the members of the association, so the latter took the means to bring them to terms that has since converted Paterson from a city of normal license to a Puritanical town.

The Association barbers found a law against keeping barber shops open on Sunday, and they sprang it the following Sunday on unfortunate Antonio Mauro, whose case has already been chronicled in The Sun. Having settled Mauro, the barbers went to Elizabeth and saw a ball game. The saying, "How'd you like to be the ice man?" became among Sunday warblers in Paterson: "How'd you like to be the barber?" Then it was the ice man, who, either from motives of jealousy or a genuine desire to get a rest each Sabbath, sent out an expedition to tunnel the City Hall in search of a law to give them the relief that the barbers had found. They unearthed the law they were after, and shoved it under the mayor's nose, with the result that ice is no longer on sale in Paterson on Sundays.

The police looked out for the interests of the ice men because they had been ordered to do so by the mayor, but the barbers had to go it alone. Five constables were sent out, but there wasn't an arrest, although the constables worked conscientiously to find some shop open and doing business. They didn't even find a barber with a satchel who was going on "a little vacation," so that to-night the barbers say they have succeeded in tying things up, and are satisfied.

There was a rush of the unshorn from this city to Passaic, and the barbers in that town were kept pretty busy. The Patersonites were delighted to find relief so close at hand and expressed themselves freely on the subject, but to their dismay they were informed that after September 17 there would be no Sunday shaves in Passaic.

"And why not?" thundered a citizen o Paterson, who has to have a shave every day.

"Well," said his barber, "those Paterson barbers ain't any better than we are. I guess if they can lay off on Sunday we can, too. Anyway, we're going to do it."

With Passaic shut off there is nothing left for Paterson folks but Newark, and the rumor to-night is that the barbers there are going to follow the example of those here next Sunday. The freeze out of the icemen is not so serious because folks can buy ice on Saturday night to last over Sunday, but they can't lay in shaves.

The next Blue Law that is to be enforced is that against profanity. Believing that the barbers and ice men are working in the cause of religion, instead of for a Sunday of pleasure, some church folks have seized the opportunity to spring the old anti-swearing ordinance on the people, and they will demand of Mayor Hinchcliffe to-morrow that he enforce it. This has caused much comment among the "gents" who frequent street corners and whose vocabularies consist largely of prohibited words.

How far the Blue Law craze is going to go, is problematical. Those who have carefully examined the old statute books say that it can be worked until the city is depopulated, for there are laws unrepealed which make it a crime to walk out on Sunday unless one's destination is church, and others forbidding riding, driving, or whistling on the Sabbath. It is said that there are cranks enough in Paterson to want all the laws enforced.
