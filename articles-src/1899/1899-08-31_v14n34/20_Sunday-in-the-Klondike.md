The Alaska gold fields with their rough population and conditions which invite if not compel the setting aside of many of the customs of civilization, are about the last place in the world where one would look to find examples of the working of Sunday laws; yet even here, according to the following press report, the bad principle of Sunday enforcement is making itself felt. The facts are thus stated by the Journal, of this city:

"Dawson City, A. T., Aug. 4.—Great anger and excitement have been caused here by an order of the civil authorities that in future any miner caught working his claim on the first day of the week will be fined and imprisoned.

"We are determined," says the edict, "that the observance of the Sabbath shall no longer be neglected in this commonwealth. You miners have the whole week to wash up in, and it stands to reason that you only queer the game by working on Sundays.

"'Besides that, the motto of this town has always been, "Live and let live," and we therefore don't see why the honest tradesman who hasn't any claim shouldn't have the best day in the week to do his washing up in. This is no kid! We mean business, and the man that sinneth he shall go to jail."

"Naturally, the population of Dawson is very much exasperated over this sudden spasm of virtue on the part of the authorities, and cannot see that it is any worse, if as bad, to work a claim on the Sabbath as it is to run a saloon or a faro layout on that day.

"There is likely to be trouble over the edict. The local newspaper sums up the situation thus:

"It is not believed that any person will be materially injured or his feelings greatly disfigured by some poor fellow on his claim doing what he has to do on Sunday.

"Neither is it believed that the Author of the ten commandments will again down the world, as per Noah's period of existence, if some laymen happens to haul a load of wood down the hill for his cabin fires or for use in his drift on Monday morning.

"'Suspend this absurd restriction on the creeks, gentlemen! Nobody will be hurt if you do.'"
