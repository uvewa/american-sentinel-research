THE President has issued a proclamation bearing on the question of Cuban independence, which is to be published in Cuba in a short time. It is to the effect that as soon as the Cuban census is completed arrangements will be made for holding local elections in the various provinces of the island, which will constitute the first step in the establishment of a Cuban government. The proclamation is intended to offset the effect of stories circulated in the island affirming that the Government does not intend to fulfill its promise of giving the Cubans independence. Meanwhile a committee of influential men representing the former autonomist party in Havana, are en route to Washington to lay before the President a petition for Cuban annexation.
