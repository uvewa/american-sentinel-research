According to press reports from Havana, it is not probable that American military rule in Cuba will soon come to an end, if respect is paid to the wishes of a certain class of the Cubans, representing prominent business interests in the island. The Chicago Times-Herald reports that,—

"Among twenty two prominent merchants of Havana, including Spaniards, Cubans, Americans, and other various nationalities, who were asked their views, not a single dissenting voice was raised against the continuation of the military government for at least two or three years, until the country had settled down. One merchant said:—

"Remove the Foraker amendment and Cuba will blossom into a wealthy country, capital will flood the island, everything will boom and brigandage will necessarily cease. The only interests which would be served by a change now are those Cubans out of office, who imagine that they could get appointments if a change were made."

"Another merchant and a prominent steamship agent, said: 'For God's sake, give Cuba a rest for at least two years, and a chance to recuperate. Remove the laws preventing capital coming into the island, and then see the result; learn what the people really want as soon as possible, and you will benefit all concerned. The American Government ought to announce a definite policy as regards the island, putting a limit to the time it will hold it, without a vote of the public. The military government should be continued two, three, or five years—the last would be best for Cuba's interests.'

"The other interviews were in a similar strain, showing conclusively that the opinion of the wealthy and business classes favor conservative methods and the continuance for the time being of the military government."
