Do you know any one who is a large fruit consumer who is a drunkard? If you do, I do not. And why?

In conversation with a physician on this subject, he admitted the fact and justifies it with this reason, that the desire among horticulturists for liquor is, comparatively speaking, unknown to those living largely on sub-acid fruit, and that one of the mildest and speediest cures for the liquor appetite is a habitual fruit diet. Another says that the eating of tomatoes with salt by one addicted to alcoholic beverages will soon make liquor as a beverage offensive, undrinkable and ungrateful to the stomach, so much so that it will nauseate when drunk. If so, this is the cheapest remedy yet offered and should supplant the "Keeley cure."
