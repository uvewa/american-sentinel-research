As near an approach to the old-time Puritan Sunday as can be found, probably, in the United States today, is to be met at Ocean Grove, N. J., during the summer months. Ocean Grove is a pleasure resort, and during the summer season has a population of 60,000 or 70,000. But it is under the control of an association of Methodists, and most of the customary features of a summer pleasure resort are conspicuous by their absence. Their loss is, of course, for the most part, the people's gain. The disreputable element of society give the place a wide berth, and this in itself is an attraction to people of the better class.

Of the puritanical features of the place, a writer for the *Evening Post* says:—

"Card-playing and dancing are also proscribed, and the puritanical Sunday is most rigidly enforced. At twelve o'clock on Saturday night the town's gates close."

From that hour until the following midnight no vehicle of any sort, no horseman, no bicyclist, may enter, not even if the traveler be a physician summoned in haste. Railway service is suspended, and on the bridges leading across the lakes to the towns adjoining, guards are stationed to forbid all ingress except for the purpose of attendance upon religious service. No sea-bathing, fishing, or boating is allowed. Participation in any open-air game is punishable by a fine of ten dollars, and the same penalty is the consequence of the sale or delivery of any sort of merchandise, milk and newspapers included.

"Given two occupations, each so peculiarly absorbing as are its devotions and its music, small wonder that Ocean Grove finds neither time nor need for the usual diversions of popular pleasure resorts. Yet the stranger here cannot but feel some sense of bareness, through the entire absence of all evidence of such things. The sad, gray model of modern Jerusalem, exhibited under a somber wooden canopy before the auditorium entrance, the only 'show' that the law allows. Not even a hand- organ man, with his gay-jacketed monkey, is permitted to trifle with the temper of the scene. And if it were not for the two water-front 'pavilions' the beach itself would be left in its natural severity to furnish forth a background worthy of the rest. In the name of harmony, would it had been so!"
