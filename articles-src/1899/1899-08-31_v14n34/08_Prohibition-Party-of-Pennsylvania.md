The Prohibition Party of Pennsylvania has joined itself to the party that is working to remodel the Government from a republic to a theocracy. At its State convention held in Philadelphia last July, it placed the following declaration at the head of its political platform:—

"The Prohibition Party of Pennsylvania in State Convention assembled, acknowledge Almighty God as the rightful and Supreme Ruler of the universe, to whose laws all human enactments should conform."
