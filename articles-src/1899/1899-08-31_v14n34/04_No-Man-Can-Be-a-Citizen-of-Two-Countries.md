No MAN can be a citizen of two countries at the same time; he cannot give allegiance at one time to two different governments. A man cannot be a subject of Great Britain while he is a subject of the United States, or of Germany, etc. But as the difference between two governments of earth is far less than the difference between any earthly government and the government of heaven, much less can any person be at once a citizen of earth and a citizen of heaven. Christ's kingdom is "not of this world."
