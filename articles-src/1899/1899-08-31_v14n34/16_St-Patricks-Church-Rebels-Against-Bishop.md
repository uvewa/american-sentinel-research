ST. PATRICK'S Roman Catholic Church in East St. Louis is in rebellion against their bishop. The latter issued an edict instructing the church to accept "Father" Cluse as their pastor, and the church has refused and defied the bishop to do his worst. The church people have put guards around both church and parsonage, and refuse to allow the obnoxious priest to conduct religious services. The bishop, on finding his authority defied, proceeded to excommunicate all the leaders in the rebellion and, all who assist in any way; by which excommunication these persons, in the event of their dying, will not receive "Christian" burial or be interred in "consecrated" ground. But even this has failed to bring the contumacious ones to terms, and they maintain their guard about the church, under an American and an Irish flag which they have hoisted on a flagpole in the grounds. They demand that they be allowed to have a voice in the selection of their own pastor.

AS THE Catholic religion which these people profess requires that they submit unquestioningly to their superiors in the things pertaining to eternity, it is only consistent that while they profess this religion they should likewise submit in matters temporal. That they have not done so in this instance only illustrates the fact that all men have a natural desire for freedom and independence, which will assert itself at times in spite of all opposing forces.

LOGICALLY, the members of this Catholic Church are bound either to submit to their bishop's authority in temporal appointments, or reject his authority over their spiritual being. He who takes his religion from Rome, might as well take his politics, and everything else, from the same source.
