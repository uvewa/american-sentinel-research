An Alabama journal, the Baldwin Times, is giving some attention to the question of enforcing the Sunday ordinances in its vicinity. An advocate of Sunday enforcement having complained of a shooting match at a nearby resort as a violation of the law, has some important truths on the subject, stated to him through the Times by an advocate of freedom in religious observances. The latter says:—

"The Sabbath is a religious institution, and Brother Reeder should remember that Christ never sought to promote his government by earthly laws, but according to Brother Reeder's method, the meek and lowly followers of the Lord will show their ungodly fellowmen a thing or two by putting them in jail.

"There are a good many people who go to Point Clear on Sunday who do not regard Brother Reeder's Sunday as a holy day. (And, by the way, can the statutes of Alabama make a day holy?) These people may be hauled up in a Balwin county court and fined for violating an Alabama law. That is all well enough. But when it comes to punishing a man for violating a so-called law of God, it seems to me Brother Reeder is getting beyond his authority. There is a time coming when a court will meet which will vindicate the law of God; and all the judges of our earthly courts, and even Brother Reeder, will be defendants, and not prosecutors. 'Judg, not lest ye be judged.'"
