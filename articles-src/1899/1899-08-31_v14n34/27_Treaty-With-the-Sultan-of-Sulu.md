The United States, through the agency of General John C. Bates, has entered into an agreement with the Sultan of Sulu, who rules over a large number of the Southern Philippine Islands, whereby the latter are acknowledged to be under American sovereignty. The conditions of the agreement are, briefly stated, as follows:

"No persecution on account of religion.

"The United States to occupy and control such parts of the Archipelago as public interest demands.

"Any person may purchase land with the Sultan's consent.

"Introduction of firearms prohibited.

"Piracy shall be suppressed with the Sultan's assistance.

"American courts to have jurisdiction, except in cases between natives, the Sultan to deliver up criminals.

"United States to protect the Moros against foreign impositions.

"The Sultan's subsidy, formerly paid by Spain, to be continued by the United States."

By this agreement the United States will pay to the Sultan $4,900 a year, and he will be allowed to maintain his polygamous harem and the system of slavery which has heretofore existed under his rule.

"A press dispatch states that "General Bates took $10,000 when he went to see the Sultan, and doubtless used the money with pacifying results." But if American sovereignty in those islands is to be bought from the native rulers, why was it not bought—or an effort made to buy it—in the island of Luzon? The cost at which American sovereignty is being secured there, even on a precarious footing, is infinitely greater than that which would have been required to secure it on like terms with those of the agreement made with the Mohammedan ruler of Sulu.
