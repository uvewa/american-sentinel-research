In these days when so much is being made of the Anglo Saxon elements in civilization, and emphasis being placed upon the cordial relations existing between Great Britain and the United States, it is interesting to note that a combination has been made between the American China Development Company, which is commonly known as the Chinese syndicate of this country, and the British and Chinese corporation of London. The purpose of the joint syndicate is to obtain contracts, decrees, and concessions in China, and to construct and maintain railroads and other public works. The consolidation of these two concerns constitute a syndicate of the major powerful capitalists in the world. A number of contracts have been secured, among them one for a survey of a railroad line from Hankow to Canton. The negotiations for this contract are now at a critical stage at Peking, the Chinese government having manifested a purpose to declare the agreement null and void. The syndicate has appealed to Great Britain, and the British minister has been instructed to treat the contract as if it were a British contract, and to urge the fulfillment of its terms upon the Chinese government. Our own Government has been appealed to by the Development Company, which is one of the parties to the contract, and instructions have been given to our minister at Peking concerning the matter. It is not unlikely that this case will constitute an entering wedge, and that before another year goes by we may find ourselves embroiled in the Asiatic question.
