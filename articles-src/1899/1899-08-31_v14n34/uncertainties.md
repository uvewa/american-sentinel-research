## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 10: "A Spanish Arraignment of Rome in the Philippines"

- **Author attribution:** The article is signed "BY JOHN M'CARTHY." and closes with "Argentine Republic." — this appears to be the author's location, not a dateline. Attribution treated as explicit. The initials "JMC" are not in the known initials list and this author has not appeared before.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "John M'Carthy" may be "John McCarthy" (OCR rendering of apostrophe in name is unusual but preserved as printed).

### Article 12: "The United States in China"

- **Source attribution:** The reprint source appears as `*N. Y. "Christian Advocate."*` at the top as a heading above the article body, not at the end. Treated as a reprint with `original_publication` set accordingly.

### Article 22: "The 'Blue Law' Revival in New Jersey"

- **Transcribed as:** "a citizen o Paterson" — the word "of" appears to be OCR-garbled ("o" instead of "of"). Preserved as printed in OCR source without correction, as the original print may itself have a typo or OCR drop.
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely "of" in original; flagged but not corrected per transcription rules.

### Article 24: "Japan's New Form of State Religion"

- **Text truncation:** The sentence "The regulations even go so far as to demand detailed information regarding the pastor" ends abruptly without completing the thought. This appears to be a sentence that ran across a column break in the original and was not fully captured by OCR. The next paragraph continues with a new sentence. Preserved as printed.
- **Confidence:** LOW — text likely incomplete at column break; second pass confirms no additional text recoverable from OCR source.

### Article 29: "An International Petition to the Czar"

- **Transcribed as:** "to meet the prince atdjnner" — OCR rendered what is clearly "at dinner" as "atdjnner". Preserved as printed in OCR source.
- **Confidence:** LOW — clearly an OCR artifact for "at dinner"; flagged but not corrected per transcription rules.

### Page 1 short editorial notes (Articles 01–05)

- These five short items appear at the top of page 1 without titles or bylines. They are separated by paragraph spacing only. Each has been given a descriptive title based on its content for file naming purposes. No author attribution is possible; all treated as editorial.

### "News, Notes and Comment" section header (page 8)

- The section header "NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT" is a running section head, not a separate article. The items within it have been split into individual files (articles 15–18 and others in sequence), as each is a distinct editorial note.
