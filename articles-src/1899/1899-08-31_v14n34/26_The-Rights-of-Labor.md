What may be called the rights of labor, have been stated in four sentences, as follows:—

"The right to quit work is as indisputable as the right to work.

'The sufficiency of the reason for quitting is a question which concerns the quitter.

"The right of the other man to step in and take the job is likewise indisputable.

"As long as both of these rights are respected, the striking labor and the superseding labor are equally respectable."

These statements are indisputable; and from them another may be deduced; namely, that it is the duty of the Government to protect alike the man who "strikes" and the man who takes his place.

These rights however are far from being respected by the opposing sides in a labor conflict, in most instances, as is testified by the violence and disorder with which most strikes are attended. But these rights must be respected, if any real advancement is to be made in the direction of establishing industrial peace upon a sound basis.
