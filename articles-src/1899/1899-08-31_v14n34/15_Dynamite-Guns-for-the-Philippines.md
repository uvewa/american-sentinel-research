TWELVE dynamite guns are to be sent immediately to the Philippine Islands to enable the American forces there to cope with the situation. Of these guns it is said that they are the most destructive of any light artillery guns used in modern warfare. "The explosion of a shell from one of these guns is guaranteed to kill everything within a radius of fifty feet. Twelve of them in service on the firing line will be far more deadly than the ordinary field artillery, and ordnance experts who have made a study of the new explosive to be used in them assert that no foe can withstand the effect produced by a battery of such guns."

"BENEVOLENT assimilation" in the Philippines demands the most powerful modern explosive to carry it into effect,—something more destructive than ordinary powder and the projectiles from ordinary guns. But this great Government, in using dynamite upon the half-civilized natives of the Philippines to enforce its will in those islands, will cover itself with something else than glory.

The national political campaign is impending, and something must be done to crush the Filipinos at once, and prevent the war from dragging on during this campaign. The party in power must be able to point to a finished war, instead of being pointed to an unfinished one, if it is to be successful at the polls in 1900. This is no doubt one strong influence that is stirring the Administration to activity over the Philippine question.
