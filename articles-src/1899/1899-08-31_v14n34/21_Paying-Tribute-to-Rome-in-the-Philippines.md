The following statements are printed in the San Francisco Report upon the authority of a man who has recently returned from the Philippines:

"The United States Government is forced to pay for holy water, wafers, and wine. These claims are regularly audited and settled. Of course they do not amount to very much, but they are regularly presented. All of the church property in the Philippines is now the property of this Government. The churches, monasteries, and all that property were built and paid for out of the Spanish treasury. Therefore, when the islands were ceded to this country, the church property belonged to America. In spite of this fact, General Otis pays $1,000 a month for the Malate Monastery and $150 a month rent for the San Sebastian Monastery. They are used for hospitals. Why the Government should be forced to pay rent for its own property is something nobody but General Otis can explain."
