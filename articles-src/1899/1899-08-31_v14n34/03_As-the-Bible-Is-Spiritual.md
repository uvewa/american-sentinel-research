AS THE Bible is spiritual, and as spiritual truth must be spiritually discerned (1 Cor. 2:14), it follows that without a spiritual agency the Bible cannot even be understood by the people, much less enforced upon them as "the supreme law" of the Lord. And as no civil government has any spiritual agency at its command, it is only supreme folly for it to concern itself with the enforcement of Biblical rules of life.
