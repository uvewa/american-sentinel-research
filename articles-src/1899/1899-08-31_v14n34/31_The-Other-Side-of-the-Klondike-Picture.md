The arrival of vessels from Alaska laden with gold, bringing home many gold-hunters who have been successful in their quest, will probably result in inducing many others to try their luck in Alaska. But there are awful stories of distress, poverty, suffering, and death coming out of that enticing land which should act as a deterrent.

The government is now asked, for instance, to send relief vessels to Katzebue Sound, where about one thousand miners are said to be stranded and in great danger of extermination. Twelve hundred people went into the Katzebue country well fitted out for the search for gold, and two hundred succeeded in getting over the snow last winter. Many died en route, and there are nearly one thousand people on the shore of the sound waiting for a chance to come home. No merchant vessels will run to that district this year, and the whalers which call in there for fresh water will not take passengers. Even if the miners had the means of getting home, it is doubtful if they could buy their passage. Many of them have been sick with scurvy, and are going to float down the several streams running into the sound, with the intention of waiting for government help.
