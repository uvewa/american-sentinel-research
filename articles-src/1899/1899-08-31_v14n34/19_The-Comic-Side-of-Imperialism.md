THERE would be less complaint of the dullness of political news if the people would only read the papers more closely.

It is, for instance, not dull but highly entertaining to learn from Mr. Schurman that after wiping out polygamy in Utah we are expected to embrace and protect it in Sulu.

It is more than entertaining to read of the polygamous Sultan gravely insisting on an increase of his pension on the ground that our intervention has increased the cost of keeping a harem!

And is it comic or not, after our sacrifices to put an end to slavery at home, to be told by our commissioner that Filipino slavery is "rather beneficent in form?" Was not our own slave system "rather beneficent" to many of the slaves?

Indeed, the whole Filipino situation would be humorous if it did not involve a frightful waste of money, a frightful waste of life and a violation of the basic principles of our Government.
