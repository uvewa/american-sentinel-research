CONDITIONS arising from race antagonism in the South are growing more serious, and eminent white men of that section are now saying that the negro must go; that only by a separation of the races can the race problem in the South be solved. Ex-senator M. C. Butler, of South Carolina, is quoted thus: "One race must go to the wall; and with the kindest feelings of good will toward the negro, I must side with my own race. Two races cannot live together in peace, on terms of equal civil and political rights; and the sooner we realize that, the better for both races."

And while this Government is talking thus to the negroes at home,—while it is denying to a foreign race on its own shores the blessings of American free government—it is at the same time enforcing submission from a foreign race on a foreign shore, on the plea that it wants to bestow these blessings upon them!

If the Southern negroes, born on American soil and brought up under the influences of American civilization, cannot be "benevolently assimilated" here in America, how can the Government benevolently assimilate eight or ten millions of semi-civilized people who are thousands of miles away? How can it bestow upon the latter the blessings of which it boasts, when it cannot confer them upon an alien people within its own borders?

If the negro can enjoy the blessings of free government at all, why can he not enjoy them here in America? And if he is incapable of enjoying them anywhere, is it certain that the Filipino is not just as incapable and that the awful price being paid to rescue him from misgovernment will not be paid in vain? If it is better for this country and the negro that he should go, how can it be best for this country and the Filipino that the latter should come?

It is not a case of the one class needing more of the civilization of the other, but of both classes needing a personal application of the principles of the gospel. Among lives that exemplify those principles, no "race problem" is ever known.
