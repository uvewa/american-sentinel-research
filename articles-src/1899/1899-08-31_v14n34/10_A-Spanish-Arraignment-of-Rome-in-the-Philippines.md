Who has traveled Spanish South America—the hotbed of Catholicism,—Mexico, Spain, Portugal, etc., and cannot see that those countries are at least one hundred years behind? It is true, that two or three countries in South America, Argentine Republic, Chile, and Uruguay, have of recent years burst the swaddling bands of Romanism, in the which they have been wrapped for the past three or four centuries, and have embraced the more liberal and advanced views of North America and progressive Europe, and what is the result? In the short space of ten years prosperity is manifest on every hand. Railways are laid connecting all the points of importance; shipping has increased 200 per cent.; public schools have augmented 500 per cent.; banks—a sure sign of success—have increased more than 800 per cent. Even the streets proclaim the change from Catholic despotism to civilized liberality. Streets which only ten years ago had pavements five feet higher than the unpaved traffic road, are now on a par with the finest streets of London, Paris, or New York.

But let us take a view of a country which has never allowed Protestant missionaries the privilege of carrying the grand old gospel of Jesus; and see what is its condition: whether it is a credit to the Papacy's long dominion or no. Let us hear the tale, sad and mournful though it may be, from the lips of the Roman Catholic editor of del Neuvo Pais, published in Madrid, Spain. He begins thus:—

"Already the bandage has begun to gall which covered the eyes of many Spaniards, and which hindered them from seeing the true character of the priests of the Philippine Islands. It is now well known that they—the priests—were the prime movers in the rebellion of the indigenous tribes against the rule of Spain; and also of the great calamities that have transpired there to thousands of noble-hearted Spaniards."

Already many who formerly believed in the holiness and patriotism of the Roman Catholic communities, now see clearly how they have been deceived. But instead of permitting our pen to criticize them, we prefer to reproduce an article which appeared in the Ejercito Español, for two reasons: that it may appear unsectarian, and impartial, and also that it may represent the sentiments and ideas of the higher class of society.

Thus says the Ejercito Español (Spanish Army):—

"A foreign telegram has revealed the fact that the Catholic religious orders in the Philippine Islands have sold all their goods and property to a banking syndicate established in Hong Kong.

"This is sufficient to give the fatal blow to the unhappy history of our dominion in the Philippines.

"That is, the good fathers who compose these religious orders have known how to play one of those mystic and wretched games, in the exercise of which they are adepts; and thus to mock at the evils which are weighing upon the country which received and sheltered them.

"There is no need of our approximating the China Sea to acquire the conviction that the said religious orders are not of Spanish origin; neither are they cosmopolitan; they are simply Roman; projectors of their terrestrial goods against wind and tide.

"Spain has been overflooded with religious enterprizes, all realized in the last few years. Madrid, in particular, is enclosed in a chain of stately edifices, built as if to enchant, the which notwithstanding their being inhabited by authorized religious communities, sanctioned by the Spanish government; thinking that the governmental concession of such property is not of sufficient guarantee; they have registered these said properties, as belonging to individuals of foreign nationality; a snare, so anti-patriotic in nature, that we cannot understand how any government could ever consent to same.

"It is sad to know how our misfortunes have to-day placed us at the mercy of the foreigner; but it is much more painful to think of our willingly converting ourselves into vassals of Rome; and that we may tolerate Rampolla, more than we might perhaps tolerate President McKinley.

"Some days past the English and Italian press gave account of the negotiations between the Vatican and the Washington government, to guarantee the continuance of the priests in the Philippine Islands, pretending to deny their nationality as Spaniards, and at the same time offering to the United States the influence of their exaggerated prestige, the which has carried us to an implacable civil war; and to the ruin of our colonial sovereignty.

"Those religious orders which enjoyed the usufruct of the riches of the country; who converted the Indian into a slave, only feigned to become one with the people, so as to be the better equipped to pry into everything. The exalted governmental positions, such as Minister of the Treasury, Administration of Justice, Political Military Governor, Captain-General, Governors of Provinces, and all judges, were but toys in their hands to be removed at their [the priests'] discretion. They had to be consulted as to how the public administration should be administered; until finally they had become such a terrible power, that no authority could exist for a moment that did not walk in accordance with their will.

"The native priests lived in a despicable manner, boasting of wealth and splendor; and this ostentatious display was carried to such a degree as to cause a spirit of jealousy to arise in the hearts of some of the governor-generals. They daily rode in their carriages with vain airs, showing off their beautiful sack-coats and smoking cigars half a yard long. They, too, opposed every alteration in the public order, which had the appearance of being directed against them; and on some occasions they have instigated the assassination of the viceroy, if the latter dared to make the archbishop of the Archipelago his enemy. These, then, by whose ominous domination so many thousands of Spaniards have died, and for whom Spain has suffered so many disasters; when they see Spain conquered, doubting the destiny that awaits them, hurry to place themselves on the safe side.

"The Dominican fathers hunt widely, and since they have adopted such a providence, it proves they do not believe our dominion in the Luzon Isle is very established; still they will not be able to delude the Yankees with their pretended necessary prestige over the consciences of the Indians; and should this be the case, how poorly will they have been repaid for denying their nationality so as to claim Yankee citizenship.

"We are not so sure as to whether these Catholic religious orders have the power to sell to any syndicate that which was acquired by them only by the special grace of the Spanish government.

"There only lacks one thing to fill our bitter cup of shame, that is, that these religious communities, which are known to be powerfully wealthy, should have disposed of all their property to the Hong Kong bank, and should thus come out of the catastrophe with clean hands, saving even to the last cent of their collective fortune. We can tolerate a strange nation sucking the life blood and vitality from the poor, ruined country; but it is unbearable to think that such is being done beneath the cloak of religion."

What a bitter yet veracious arraignment to make against the "Holy Catholic Church"! yet all except the bigot can see how truthful are the accusations. Spain for long centuries has been blinded by paganish dogmas and idolatries; now the Lord is preparing the hearts of the people to hear the gospel.

The day is not far distant when poor, downtrodden Spain must have the eternal truths of God's Word declared unto her. The day has even arrived when a greater effort than ever should be made for all Spanish-speaking countries, so that the benighted, heretofore blinded inhabitants shall hear proclaimed in their own villages, the truth as it is in Jesus.

Those who have never labored in the Hispano-American countries cannot grasp the difficulties that arise in the way of the preacher; still the divine power is omnipotent, and we have that at our constant disposition.

Let us think upon this, pray about it, and see if our hearts are not constrained to help with our time or money the evangelization of these truly dark corners of the earth.

Argentine Republic.
