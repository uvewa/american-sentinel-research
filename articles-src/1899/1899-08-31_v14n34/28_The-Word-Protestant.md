The word Protestant comes from *Protest stans*—"standing for a witness"—that is, a witness for the truth, as well as a witness against error.

Rome sneers at Protestantism as a religion of negation, but it is deeply interesting and significant to notice that the one mark given of the throned souls in glory is a purely negative mark: *Had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.*—Rev. 20:4. Virtually you have here four times over the negative particle.

"Art thou a king?" Pilate asked the Master; Jesus answered: "Thou sayest I am a King. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness for the truth."—John 18:37. This is the true Protestantism, to bear witness for Divine truth against all error that might corrupt it.

The nature of believing witness is clearly seen when we take instead of the Latin *tetis*, the Greek *martus*—a martyr, witnessing even unto death; afterwards crowned with Jesus who gave His life for us. He witnessed to the truth of his teachings with his death on the cross. The testimony of believers stands for the truth, and should be equally a witness against error—standing for the truth and against error.

—*"The Converted Catholic."*
