A press dispatch from Seattle, Wash., says:—

"Japan's new law regulating all faiths and beliefs has gone into effect and much comment has arisen in consequence. A copy of the regulations has been received at the Japanese Consulate here.

"According to it all sects, pagan or Christian, are placed under the absolute control of a local governor. Without his permission even a church cannot be built or meetings held. The regulations even go so far as to demand detailed information regarding the pastor

"Before commencing religious work propagators of a faith must go before the governor with full details. The scheme of faith must be fully explained, church finances accounted for and the personal and religious history of the applicant, preacher and members outlined in writing.

"The order further decrees that all who desire to establish or build a temple, church, preaching or lecture house for religious purposes must apply for permission."
