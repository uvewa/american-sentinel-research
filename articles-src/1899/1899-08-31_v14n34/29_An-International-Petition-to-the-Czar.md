The Emperor of Russia has been approached in the most unprecedented fashion. Emboldened by his peace manifesto, a number of eminent scholars and scientists have asked him to preserve the autonomy of Finland. The address is international, written in English, French, German, Hungarian, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, and Flemish, and signed by citizens from twelve different countries. Its text—the German lies before us—runs as follows:

"The undersigned feel compelled to express their sympathy for the Finnish nation. A people not numerous, but able and of strong character, a people who, despite their rough climate, have raised themselves to a state of growing prosperity and of scientific, artistic, and educational achievements, denoting a wealth of unique civilization—such a people are now threatened with the loss of their individuality, a loss which would rob them of their greatest incentive to continue their able intellectual and economic work. It appears to us our duty to protect against this, a duty so urgent that we waive all differences of nationality. May the destruction of a valuable member of the great family of European nations be prevented. We cannot believe that the ruler who summoned the International Peace Conference will doom an able, loyal people to destruction."

The czar refused to receive the petition. Instead, the oppression of the Finns becomes more rigorous and the last papers published in Finnish have been suppressed. *Politiken*, Copenhagen, thinks this will hardly have the desired effect. It says:—

"The more you rob a vigorous people of their political rights, the more their national feeling is strengthened. If the use of the printing press is prohibited, the pen or the typewriter must be employed. If the mails are closed to such matter, other means of communication will be found. The mouths of the Finns cannot be closed."

As a matter of fact, the resistance of the Finns, though not open, is very determined. The threats of the governor, General Bobrikoff, have failed to procure for Prince Vladimir, the czar's uncle, a pleasant reception. At Abo, where the governor hoped to muster a large number of loyalists, only six persons could be found who accepted an invitation to meet the prince atdjnner. The *Nieuws van den Dag*, Amsterdam, thinks the Finns and their friends should have agitated at the Peace Conference. "It would have been such fun," says the paper. But many people think the foreign petition injudicious.

The *St. James Gazette* says:—

"We wonder whether any one of the more or less distinguished men who signed the English petition to the czar asking him not to be unkind to the Finns imagined for an instant that they would succeed in altering the policy of the Russian empire. Did they think the emperor would say to himself, 'Bless my heart, there must be something in this Finnish case after all, for the author of "Jude the Obscure" says so, and so do the authors of some quite learned books in English. I must see that my ministers change all they have done for the last year or so in this matter'? If they did not think like this, what purpose did they imagine would be served by their interference? We of course entirely share the views of the petitioners, but that does not prevent us also sharing the astonishment that stunned the minister of the imperial household for twenty-four hours when he was approached by a deputation of learned professors in twelve languages, intent on persuading the czar to listen to them instead of his own ministers. No one seemed quite to know what to do with the gentlemen, who were therefore forwarded from one place to another like a lost parcel, till at last they managed to get a civil dismissal from the Minister of the Interior. Of course they got nothing more for their trouble."
