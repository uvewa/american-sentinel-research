STATE SENATOR RAINES, of New York, announces that he will amend his well-known liquor law so as to prohibit the sale of liquor in the "fake" hotels to which his law gave being—and in all other hotels as well—on Sundays. He says it is not a measure aimed at New York City alone, but at saloons throughout the State. "I have never noticed any difference," he is quoted, "between the saloon-keepers there and those in other sections of the State. They are all anxious to make a penny, and they don't seem to care whether it is made on Sunday or on any other day. I will teach these people that there is a God in Israel."

AND Senator Raines and the people on whom he relies for support in this matter do not seem to care whether saloon-keepers "make a penny" or not by their nefarious business, so long as it is not made on Sunday. It is because they thus desecrate Sunday that they must be taught, by legislation, that Senator Raines is a god "in Israel," enthroned in the senate chamber at Albany, and that they must bow to him on Sundays or suffer the penalties of the civil law.
