BY a decision of Attorney-General Van Deventer, of the Department of the Interior, Washington, D. C., Archbishop Ireland has secured title to 20,000 acres of land along the line of the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba railway. The archbishop claimed 34,000 acres, but the settlers on the land were in some cases able to prove a better title thereto than that of the Catholic official; hence will not be molested. Other settlers will contest the archbishop's claim.
