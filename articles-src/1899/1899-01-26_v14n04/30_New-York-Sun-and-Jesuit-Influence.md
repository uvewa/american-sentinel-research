WE do not know that the language which we quote in this issue from the New York Sun, on the meaning of the Declaration of Independence, was written by a Jesuit. But we do know that the papacy has a controlling hand upon the press almost everywhere in this country, and that the sentiments in question are just such as a Jesuit would express.
