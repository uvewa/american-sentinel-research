EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: The proposition to take for the United States the sovereignty of the Philippines temporarily has been put forth by Senator Foraker as the policy of the Administration; and it is sought to secure the ratification of the proposed treaty with Spain in order to secure for us this temporary sovereignty. Cui bono?

Would it not, under the terms of the treaty with Spain, devolve upon us the obligation to secure to the monastic orders of those islands all the property they claim there, without regard to the rightfulness of their claims? And would not we be obliged to stipulate for the security of such claims, in case we should eventually resign the sovereignty to the natives. If we failed to do so would not the United States be bound to reimburse the monks for all monastic property which the native government might confiscate? If the monks were banished, would they not come here, and with the money paid them by this Government in pursuance of its obligation to protect their property in the Philippines, establish monasteries in these States or in Washington itself? Would they not be entitled under the treaty to do that?

I am forced to view the position of the Administration with suspicion—to regard it as a dangerous scheme in the interest of the monastic orders. We have had enough of monastic subtlety. It never brought peace to any nation. It will not bring peace to ours. It would erect a Spanish hell on the ruins of our Republic.

But under the treaty we should be obliged to take the sovereignty of the Philippines either permanently or temporarily. The Constitution does not empower Congress to assume sovereignty permanently, except of territory designed to be admitted into the Union as States. Sound policy forbids us to bring the Philippines into the Union upon such terms. The only rational course left, therefore, is to reject the treaty. Temporary sovereignty would prove only a cloak for fraud and an incitement to revolution at home.

JOSEPH BRADFIELD.
