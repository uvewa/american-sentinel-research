TEN thousand Indians, it is announced, are to march from Vinita, a small town in Indian Territory, to the capital of Mexico, and settle in various localities in that country, where they have already made large purchases of land. The paper making the announcement states that "The main reason for their leaving is alleged mistreatment on the part of the United States."

This is the way savage tribes enjoy self-government under United States authority at home.
