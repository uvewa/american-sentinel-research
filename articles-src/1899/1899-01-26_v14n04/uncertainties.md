## Article-Specific Notes

### Article 01 — "Some of the Glories(?) of American Imperialism."
- The question marks in parentheses — `glories(?)` and `enjoyment(?)` — appear in the original as part of the text, signaling the author's irony. They have been preserved exactly as printed.

### Article 07 — "The Holy Spirit and Sunday. — No. 20."
- Author given as "BY C. H. KESLAKE." This is not in the known authors list. The name is transcribed exactly as it appears in the OCR. No verification against original scan was possible. Confidence: MEDIUM — initials used as CHK.

### Article 08 — "Grave Cause for Alarm."
- Author given as "BY GEO. B. WHEELER." Not in the known authors list. Transcribed exactly as it appears. The initials are not abbreviated in a standard way; no short form added to frontmatter `author_short` field since this author is not in the known list.

### Article 13 — "Temporary Sovereignty in the Philippines."
- Dateline: "Washington, D. C., January 14, 1899." This is a dateline, not the author. Author is "JOSEPH BRADFIELD" as signed at the end. No `author_short` added as this author is not in the known list.

### Article 15 — "American Principles Contrary to the Policy of Expansion."
- This is an extended extract from a Senate speech by Senator Mason of Illinois. The OCR source attributes it clearly with the subheading "*Extracts from Speech in U. S. Senate by Senator Mason, of Illinois.*" Treated as a reprint (speech extract). No `author_short` used for the senator.

### Article 19 — "U.S. Should Not Govern Eastern Hemisphere"
- This is a one-sentence quotation attributed to "Dr. Chas. H. Parkhurst." Treated as a reprint (quoted statement). The attribution source line appears at end: "—Dr. Chas. H. Parkhurst." Preserved in body text.

### Page 16 editorial notes
- The items on page 16 appear as a column of editorial short notes without a collective section heading (unlike the "NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT" section on page 8). Each has been treated as a separate editorial item.
- The note beginning `WE have still a supply of Nos. 1, 2, and 3 on hand...` is a subscription/missionary distribution notice and has been skipped as boilerplate promotional content.
