In the United States Senate Report on the Sunday mails, in 1829, by Hon. Richard M. Johnson, it was said:—

"All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences." *American State Papers, pp. 95, 111.*

History testifies to the truth of this statement, and the fact that this same combination and influence is already beginning to operate upon the political institutions of the country, is certainly a grave cause for alarm. Reform societies and religious organizations are now combining for the purpose of forcing their ideas of reform upon the country, prominent amongst which is the compulsory observance of a religious institution by law,—Sunday-keeping. And not only this, but they declare their purpose to make the will of God to be done in this country, with themselves of course, as the interpreters of his will, which will make them the rulers of the country.

The Reform Bureau in Washington, aided by various religious organizations, which are supporting it, has already begun a campaign to defeat the reëlection of members to Congress for the reason that they do not favor their reforms, the principal one of which instead of being a reform is a measure of absolute intolerance. Their arguments do not commend themselves to the intelligence of the committees before whom they have argued, and for that reason they are trying to force Congressmen to do, by fear of losing their positions, what their arguments fail to do.

We would warn all who value the great principles of liberty and equal rights upon which our Government was founded, to oppose this would-be religious despotism which is already beginning to act upon the political institutions of the country, before it gains sufficient headway to cause the civil power to bend under it.
