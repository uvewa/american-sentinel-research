Notwithstanding that the Pharisees claimed that it was unlawful for Christ to heal upon the Sabbath day, there is perfect harmony in the acts of Christ upon the day with the nature of the day itself.

When the foundation of the earth was laid, and the "morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy," the Sabbath was made for man. The earth and all that was in it was in perfect harmony with Him who had created it. And He had created it all by His word. So far as this earth was concerned, sin was unknown, and throughout all there was peace. The love of God was manifested in all things, and the Sabbath was its sign.

But sin entered, bringing death and woe. All the sickness and disease that ever was, was due to sin. Therefore the perfect salvation brought by Christ in the gospel included the deliverance from disease as well as from sin of all who would accept it. Thus it is said of the redeemed when they shall enter upon their eternal inheritance: "And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity." Isa. 33:24.

This being so, how natural it was for Christ in forgiving sins to also heal the sinner of his physical maladies. And it was done in precisely the same way that the world was created—by the power of his word.

To forgive a soul his sins, to cleanse him from all unrighteousness, is to bring him into harmony with God; and between that soul and God there is peace—rest. Hence Jesus says, 'Come unto me, all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' How appropriate, therefore, it was that Christ should heal on the Sabbath day,—the day of God's rest,—the very rest promised to every sin-sick soul, and obtained in Jesus Christ.

But the real intent of the Sabbath, its beneficence and blessing, were wholly lost sight of by the Jews in the senseless and burdensome requirements which they had heaped upon the Sabbath day.

To set forth the true import of the Sabbath was to do away with the unwarranted traditions of the Pharisees; but this would be (apparently) to belittle their religion in the eyes of the people. But "the Word of God is not bound;" and, says Christ, "every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up."

Instead of yielding their hearts to the truth, and receiving Christ as the Son of God, they steel their hearts against him: and because he heals the sick, as at the pool of Bethesda, on the Sabbath day, they proceed at once to persecute him and seek to slay him. John 5:16.

On another occasion Christ entered the synagogue, wherein was a man with a withered arm. The day was the Sabbath. "And they (the Pharisees) watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day: that they might accuse him." Mark 2:2. Christ knew that they had murder in their hearts toward him; but undaunted he asked, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath day, or to do evil? to save life or to kill? But they held their peace." With this question Christ healed the man.

Determined to bring about the destruction of Christ for his alleged violation of the Sabbath, the Pharisees immediately went forth, and took counsel with the Herodians (up to this time they had hated each other) against him how they might destroy him.

In none of the instances cited above did Christ charge the Pharisees openly with purposing to kill him, although he knew it perfectly well. But in the seventh chapter of John it is recorded that he did this, and reference is made to it here because of the reply that the Pharisees made. Said Christ, "Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?" Verses 19, 20.

Christ is here charged with having a devil. Comparing this with what is recorded in Matthew 12, we can more fully understand its significance. There we learn that Christ had wrought his miracles through the Holy Spirit. And yet the Pharisees in the hardness of their hearts attributed the work of the Holy Spirit to that of Satan. This was the sin against the Holy Ghost. See verses 24, 28, 31.

What had led them to such an awful climax? We answer: their attitude to Christ with reference to the Sabbath. Not that we claim that the miracle wrought by Christ as recorded in Matt. 12:5, and that immediately called forth the charge of the Pharisees, as stated above, was done on the Sabbath. The connection of this terrible charge of the Pharisees with their attitude toward the Sabbath is none the less real; and it was only the logical result of their position concerning the Sabbath in the premises.

As before stated, from the beginning of Christ's ministry, his teachings were at variance with those of the Pharisees; but notwithstanding this, nearly one half of his ministry was past before any open opposition against him was manifested. They were unable during that time to determine where his work would lead. But when they saw what Christ did on the Sabbath day, which was such a flagrant violation of their idea of Sabbath-keeping, they could see that it would be utterly impossible for Christ eventually to stand with them on this point.

Christ being, as they alleged, a Sabbath-breaker, and yet doing that which was, to say the least, superhuman, they could easily come to the conclusion that "this man is not of God," that he has a devil, and through that devil did his wondrous works. And so opposing Christ in the matter of the Sabbath, they could not possibly escape attributing the work of the Holy Spirit in him to that of Satan. Hence we see that the sin against the Holy Spirit is involved in this question of the Sabbath.
