SAMOA, with its continual strife and frequent attempts at revolution, is an illustration of the practical working of the plan of teaching a people self government by holding them under military domination.

It is often asserted as an argument against self-government by semi-civilized races, that the small republics of Central and South America are almost continually in a state of revolution. We reply: Take the papacy out of those countries, and the revolutions and civil strife will vanish with it. Where the papacy is it will either dominate or make trouble.
