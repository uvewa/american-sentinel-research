HISTORY tells us that the name of this little village which formerly rejected our Saviour was En-Gannim, now called by the Arabs "Jenin," and containing a population of about 2,000 souls, of whom the greater part are, to-day, Moslems. Since their rejection of Christ, they have drifted still farther and farther away from the true Light, until midnight darkness now surrounds them.

In the days of Christ the inhabitants of this town were looking for the Messiah, just as were the Jews. The latter had rejected him because he did not appear in the glory and splendor that they had supposed he would assume; and the Samaritans would have none of him because he did not worship in Mount Gerizim; so, on this his last recorded journey in this poor world which he came to redeem with the price of his blood, they too, refused to acknowledge him.

But now, let us consider the conduct of the apostles James and John. To our astonishment we see that gentle, loving disciple, he who leaned upon the breast of his Master, and into whose care that Master shortly afterward committed his beloved mother,—we see him, with his kindly eyes now burning with anger, and his soft voice harsh with rage, ask of his gentle Master whose name was "Love," a strange question:—

"Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias did?" Why did they refer to Elijah?—"O," they reason: "Elijah was a good man, surely we cannot go wrong if we follow his example. Let us in this one instance step aside from our usual methods and practice the gospel of force. Although ordinarily our Master is mild and gentle toward all, though his language has ever been that of love, still this is a notable exception. He is going now, as we believe, down to Jerusalem to be crowned, and to manifest his power. What an excellent opportunity is this for a beginning to be made! We are anxious to make an example of these ungodly Samaritans. Give us the liberty, Lord, bid us!"

Trembling with excitement, and with hands raised high to heaven, awaiting the word of the Master, the impetuous disciples stood before the meek-faced man of Nazareth. What a moment! Little did those hard-hearted Samaritans realize that one brief word from the lips of him whom they had refused to receive would seal their destiny. How they would have trembled had they heard the fearful question fall from the eager lips of the zealous disciples! But had they known the character of Him to whom the question was put, there would have been no need to tremble. But they did not know him; if they had, they would not have refused him entrance. Neither are his own followers acquainted with him; else would this disposition to avenge an insult never have made itself manifest by their savage question.

Listen! The Master speaks. That same voice low and sweet, which a little later bade the impetuous Peter put up his sword into its place, is making reply. Raising his sacred hand toward the men eagerly awaiting permission to call down the vengeance of God upon their enemies, he sadly answers:—

"Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them."

What a rebuke upon any who would so far forget their Master and his teachings, as to think for a moment to employ force in matters of conscience! These Samaritans had insulted the Christ; and so the disciples proposed at once to force an acknowledgment of his supremacy and power. But oh, those blessed hands were never raised to avenge himself or to call down fire upon any. They were never raised to heaven save to bring healing and blessing upon the poor ungrateful sons and daughters of men.

Shall we—you and I, reader—follow his example?
