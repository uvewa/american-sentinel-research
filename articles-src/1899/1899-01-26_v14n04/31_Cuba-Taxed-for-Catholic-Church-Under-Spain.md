ACCORDING to statements made by Rev. Mr. Diaz, recently, before a committee of the U. S. Senate, Cuba was taxed between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000 annually under Spanish rule for the support of the Catholic Church. No wonder Archbishop Ireland and the papal hierarchy in general do not relish the idea of a Cuban republic.
