A "CUBAN-AMERICAN" states in the Sabbath Recorder what he thinks of the "cut and dried" plan of evangelization for the Cuban people proposed by the "Protestant Alliance." He speaks, of course, not only for himself, but for the people among whom he has been raised. He says:—

"Cubans dread the incoming of Protestant sects. They wish, however, to be free from Roman Catholic Church domination, of which they are sick and suspicious. They do not ask the Protestant denominations to settle the matter in any cut-and-dried manner in which they are contemplating it in the United States. They see nothing ahead but future strife in the Church of Christ, to apportion different provinces of Cuba off to this denomination and to that. When provincial boundaries become marked by sectarian bodies, religious and civil wars will commence in earnest, and it will be with Cuba as it was with the cats of Kilkarney.

"The Cubans plead for some one evangelical church on the island. Something similar to the French Evangelical Church; or to what is called Old Catholicism: or, as the Swiss prefer to say, 'Christian Catholic.' Those movements in Europe which have been away from the Roman Catholic Church, while holding to the universal and unifying idea whose aim is biblical, primitive, evangelical, apostolical Christianism is what they will much more heartily accept than the absurd plan of the 'Protestant Alliance.' They recognize that the whole face of Protestantism must be reformed before it will be biblical, and care not for the mistakes of the past to be introduced into the New Cuba.

"Such statements as Dr. Plum and his compeers have made recently, in regard to the 'civil Sabbath' are looked upon with more favor in the United States than in Cuba. Cubans nor Roman Catholics in general will never accept, with any serious well wishes, any body or set of people who insist that 'we must force the blessing of the American Sabbath upon these islands recently come into our possession.' Let me hit the Rev. Dr. Plum right in the pit, together with all those who are trying 'to force' anything on Cuba contrary to clause IV. of the Joint Resolution of Congress, signed by the President and made public to the world; together with attempts to lay hands upon the God-given consciences of the Cubans."

"The plan suggested in my letter to the Judson Memorial Baptist Church for a return to biblical Christianity would much more readily meet an acceptance by Cubans, than to enforce upon them what they do not believe in, the 'American Civil Sabbath.'"
