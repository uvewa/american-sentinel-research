ARE you not filled with a noble scorn for the German nation, which without serious protest allows a man to be jailed for criticising the Kaiser?

Don't you despise a country that tolerates such attacks on liberty? . . . Are you not outraged at such German submission?

You are?

All right. Then what do you suppose a sensible German thinks of a nation where a man is arrested for drinking a glass of beer on Sunday?

What do you suppose the Frenchman thinks of a land that forbids a man with his family to sit and listen to good music and drink whenever he likes?

Don't you think a Chinaman would lean back and laugh until his queue-tip touched the ground at sight of an American arrested for playing golf on one of the seven days?

There are funny things in Germany, kind friends, and in Timbuctoo there are some odd sights. But we still hold the record here with our modern nonsense grafted on to the stupidity of the Puritans.
