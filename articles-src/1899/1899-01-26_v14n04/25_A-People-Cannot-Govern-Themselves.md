THE plea that a people cannot govern themselves is the tyrant's justification of his usurpation of power. Christianity affirms the right and the duty of every man to govern himself; and to say that a people cannot govern themselves is therefore to deny the truth of Christianity. A people who have had little contact with civilization may not be able to govern themselves in the complex fashion of "highly civilized" nations, but their government will be no less self-government because it must needs be simple. Very much that pertains to "advanced" civilization might be dispensed with vastly to the profit of the losers. Even the beasts and birds of the forest have the capacity to govern themselves according to their natures, and are a good deal happier and better off in doing so than when under the control of man.
