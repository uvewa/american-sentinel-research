GENERAL WOOD, commanding the American troops in Cuba, is calling for an army of 50,000 troops. The climate is so unhealthful, he says, that half the men stationed there will be sick, and 50,000 will be needed in order to have enough well men left to constitute an effective force. Query: How many lives of American citizens is it worth while to pay out in holding tropical or semi tropical countries for the sake of national "glory"?
