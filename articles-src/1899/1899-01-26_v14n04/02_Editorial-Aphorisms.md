He who will not stand by the Declaration of Independence, will fall by dependence upon man.

As Jesus Christ never attempted to dictate to Cesar, so must his professed representatives of this day never attempt to be dictators in politics.

Any tyrant is willing that people should be free and happy in the way he himself prescribes.

The despot lives by governing other people: the patriot lives by governing himself.

One nation cannot declare independence for another. Each nation must declare and maintain independence for itself.
