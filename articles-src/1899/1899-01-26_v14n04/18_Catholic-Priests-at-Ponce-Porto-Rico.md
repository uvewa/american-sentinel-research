AN exchange says: "The Roman Catholic priests at Ponce, Porto Rico, have issued a proclamation directing their people not to go near Protestants, nor to receive presents from them, and forbidding them to enter the houses of Protestants. The priests denounce as illegal marriages performed by others than themselves. General Henry, the military commander of the island, has notified the alcalde, or mayor, of Ponce, to inform the priests that they must stop issuing such disquieting proclamations, and that the denouncing of religious denominations will not be tolerated. The alcalde is further instructed to tell the priests that if the action complained of is persisted in, the military will put an end to it."
