WHAT difference does it make to me," some one may ask, "what policy is pursued by the Government in dealing with the Philippines or other islands taken from Spain? What has that to do with American government at home?" This question is answered by American history, and quite recent history, too. There was a time not very far back when the American Government denied the rights of a semi-civilized class in this country, as it is now disposed to deny the rights of a like class under its authority across the sea. That was something which for a long time didn't seem to concern the interests of white men particularly, but a time came when white men saw that it did concern them personally, and that in the most serious way. The principles of free government were denied, and because of it hundreds of thousands of white men in America laid down their lives on the battle-field and in military hospitals and prisons. That was what national repudiation of republican principles meant to American citizens forty years ago; and we may be assured the like thing has no less serious import for American people to-day.
