## National Reform Convention in Boston.

A NATIONAL Reform convention was held in Boston, Mass., November 21, at which the prominent ideas and aims of the organization were discussed, and the animus of this "reform" movement was, set forth. From the Boston Herald we reprint the following notes of the proceedings:—

"At the afternoon session of the National Reform convention in the Bromfield Street M. E. Church, yesterday, the Rev. S. McNaugher, pastor of the First Reformed Presbyterian Church, emphasized 'The Moral Accountability of the Nation.' Citing from the views of Dr. McAllister, he described the National Reform convention as a movement against the secularism which was gradually asserting itself in the political life of the country. We were, he said, going after false gods, and an evidence of this was the probability that, owing to the secular character of our Constitution, Congress would be obliged to seat the avowed polygamist who had been elected to its membership. The speaker went on to argue that, as the nation existed as a moral being, and was an organic and a personal unity, it had its origin in God, and was morally responsible to him.

"The Rev. S. W. Dike, secretary of the National League for the Protection of the Family, next spoke on 'The National Constitution and Divorce.' He said the divorce laws in this country were in the condition in which general laws relating to crime were 100 or 200 years ago in England. For divorce was the legal extinction of the family, effected in order to save the individual happiness of the members of that family. The association represented by the speaker wished an increased sense of the sacredness of marriage, so as to reduce the number of divorces, its view being that, as the worst use to make of a man was to hang him, so the worst use the State could make of a family was to bring it to an end.

"A resolution was passed pledging the meeting, in case Roberts was allowed to take his seat, to put forth every effort to obtain his immediate and unconditional expulsion from Congress.

"The Rev. Charles J. Cameron, pastor of the Fourth Presbyterian Church, South Boston, next spoke on 'The National Constitution and the American Sabbath.' He submitted that it was the Sabbath-keeping nations which enjoyed the greatest liberty, and warned his hearers that if the United States went on disregarding the command to keep the Sabbath holy, the wrath of God would overtake her.

"The Rev. A. H. Plumb, a Congregational clergyman, held that, in view of the parental function of the state, it should assume the attitude of the parent on great questions like keeping the Sabbath and abolishing the liquor traffic.

"The first speaker at the evening session was the Rev. H. H. George, of New York, whose topic was 'The Nation and Religion.' He began by defining the conception of 'nation,' and went on to say that the issue before every nation was whether it should be organized with God or without God. A government must be either re-religious or without religion, and the trouble with our Government was that, while it acknowledged a good many religious rights, it did not recognize God. The principle of our Government was the principle of secularism, yet we are rushing toward Niagara Falls, and will be engulfed if we do not take care. It is usual to suppose that ours is a Government of the people, but it is, the speaker continued, none the less a fact that the people cannot be a source of moral authority. God gave the moral authority of government, and it is the people who distribute that authority. There is no truth in the saying that our Government derives its power from the 'consent of the governed,' and we shall never get right in our affairs until we acknowledge the mistake we have made. (Italics ours.)

"The speaker went on to deny the correctness of the secular theory of government. He held that we could not carry on any of the functions of government without religion; hence the inconsistency of excluding God from the Constitution. (Italics ours.)

"The Rev. Scott F. Hershey, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, Columbus Ave., repeated, for the benefit of the convention, some of the statements he had before made to his congregation regarding Utah and the Mormons. He then considered the case of Roberts, and denounced Mormonism, of which, he said, polygamy was the storm center as 'the worst of our political heresies.'

"The last address was on 'The Nation and the Sunday Newspaper,' by the Rev. William T. McElveen, pastor of the Shawmut Congregational Church. He dwelt on the extent to which the Sunday paper increased the amount of labor which had to be done on the Sabbath, and compared the Sunday newspaper devotee to the 'prodigal who was glad to feed on the husks which the swine did eat.'"
