THE following resolution touching the ballot was passed at the recent convention of the National W. C. T. U.:—

"Whereas God created man in his own image, male and female, and gave them dominion, and therefore, we believe in the equal right of both to hold opinions and to express the same in the home, on the platform, in the pulpit, and at the ballot box.

"As 'persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' we 'are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein we reside,' and 'as no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,' we claim that the exclusion of women from the ballot box in any State is in direct violation of the Constitution of the United States. (See Article XIV., amendment to the Constitution.)"

And from a constitutional point of view, there appears no flaw in this reasoning.
