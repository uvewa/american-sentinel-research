## An Object Lesson for Christians.

BY STEMPLE WHITE.

What an object lesson do the lives of Abraham and Lot present to us. "Their substance was great." Abraham sojourned in "the land of promise," and was not "reckoned among the nations." No doubt he had many advantages and opportunities towards earthly emoluments, for he "was very rich, in cattle, in silver, and in gold;" and moreover delivered to the Egyptians the science of astronomy, in which they afterward became famous. But Abraham kept his eye fixed on the promises of God. "He believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness." Thus he became the "father of the faithful, and was called the "Friend of God."

But Lot did not sojourn in the promised land, and was "reckoned among the nations." He, also, "had flocks and herds, and tents," and after the strife between the herdsmen, with the privilege of choice before him, he chose the well-watered plains of Jordan "and pitched his tent toward Sodom."

He soon became mixed up in the political affairs of Sodom, and got into office; for we find him sitting in the gate of Sodom, which was the place of a judge. But soon because of its great wickedness God decrees that Sodom must be destroyed. The decree is made known to Abraham, and the Friend of God pleads for the saving of the city if there be found within it not fifty, forty, thirty, twenty, but ten righteous persons. Surely, thought Abraham, Lot is safe. But no! the city must go. And why? Lot was in politics and was conformed to the things of Sodom. He had won no converts. As a missionary his life was a failure; and the probationary lives of many professors will be total failures if they continue to be conformed to the things of this world and are reckoned among the nations. For when God smites the nations, those who are joined to the nations will also be smitten. Thus Sodom suffered "the vengeance of eternal fire," and is "set forth for an example" of what the world's final destruction will be. The last we hear of Lot he is dwelling in a cave in a mountain, where he became the father of the Moabites and the Ammonites,—people who ever afterward were the enemies of God. How unlike Abraham!

God says of his people that they "shall dwell alone" and shall "not be reckoned among the nations;" for they are a "peculiar people," "pilgrims and sojourners," whose "citizenship is in heaven." They are "looking for a city," and are not satisfied with earthly rest, because it is polluted.

Will you, Christian reader, believe God, as did Abraham, and have it accounted unto you for righteousness? Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world." Will you believe the Author of Christianity and act upon that belief, not only from the standpoint of "What would Jesus do?" but What did Jesus do? He paid tribute to whom tribute was due, but kept out of politics, refusing the kingship even when they would make him a king "by force." "Go thou and do likewise." "The servant is not greater than his Lord."

The darkest period of the world's history was caused by the church forsaking her lawful spouse and committing "fornication with the kings of the earth." Church-and-state union in the individual was the tiny seed which produced that awful tree that flourished in the Dark Ages. "If the root be holy so are the branches," and vice versa.

"Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"
