## "Not in Politics."

Roman Catholics tell us again and again that the church is not in politics, but all the same the editor of the Catholic Mirror, in its issue of October 14, tells the Roman Catholic people that "the proposition is a business one, pure and simple. You need a Catholic paper for your own information and that of your family; to supply you with news of church and society happenings in which you or yours are interested; to give you tidings which you as a Catholic desire to know of affairs and conditions of the church in foreign parts; to keep you posted with regard to matters of doctrine which may be the subject of general public discussion; and to be informed from a Catholic standpoint at times, from an ethical standpoint always, of what position it is right and just for you to assume on questions of vital public interest and otherwise, which from time to time demand your decision. You need a Catholic paper for these reasons." This tells the story. The Roman Church has not changed; she is yet in politics; and, sad to say, the Protestant churches are following suit.—*Signs of the Times.*
