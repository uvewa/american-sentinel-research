What is termed a "gigantic temperance movement" has been organized and set on foot in Elizabeth, N. J., by the city clergy. Its object, as stated, is "to close all the saloons on Sunday and arrest and fine all violators of the law."

A Sunday-closing ordinance exists in Elizabeth, but it has not heretofore been enforced. Now the mayor has promised to enforce the law. "The pastors and their flocks," it is announced, "are determined not to be beaten in this crusade, as they have in many other attempts, and they declare that they know the mayor's power and that he must exercise it." Only three of the 250 or more saloons in the city are known to close on Sundays.

One pastor said recently that the saloonist is "fast becoming an anarchist." He and his associate pastors should recognize the fact that the saloon itself is an anarchist, an enemy of every good law. And being thus by nature an outlaw, they should also recognize that it can never properly have the sanction of law, not even of a Sunday law. It might as properly be enacted that the black plague should not be admitted at the port of New York on Sundays.
