A DOMINANT characteristic of the time is self-sufficiency. One meets with it everywhere. We look down upon the culture of the last generation. We are so much wiser than our fathers that it is needless to talk of what they said or did. Even over religion affectation has placed a sort of directing goddess. We must bridle our emotions. Fervid speech is no longer conventional. To say nothing prettily is a great achievement. The Bible, itself, needs revision. The prophets are old-fashioned; even the New Testament is antiquated. So we are listening, in lieu of sermons, to lectures on Tennyson, Longfellow, Shakespeare and Count Tolstoy. Well, Isaiah and the prophets can calmly wait; but the opinion of those old-fashioned preachers upon some who claim to be their modern successors would be of absorbing interest.—*The Examiner.*
