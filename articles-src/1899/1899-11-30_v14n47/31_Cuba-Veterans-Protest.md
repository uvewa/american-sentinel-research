A PROPOSAL to change the military government in Cuba to a civil government, still under American rule, has drawn out a strong protest from the Veterans' Association, of Matanzas, which says they have sworn to obtain the independence of Cuba or die in the attempt. A proposed change in the form of government, without a change in the governing authority, has a very suspicious appearance in their view.
