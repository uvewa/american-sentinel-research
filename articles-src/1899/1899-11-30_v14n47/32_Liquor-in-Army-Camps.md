THIS is not a very flattering comment on the alleged national Christianity of this country, which was made by Mrs. Ellis at the W. C. T. U. convention, relating to the effort that was made to enlist the Government against the sale of liquor in the army camps:—

"Dear friends, there was not a man, from the President of these United States down to Mr. Brewster, chairman of the committee on the liquor traffic, that dared touch that measure. The great brewing interest of this country had laid its hand upon the great political forces of this nation and said, 'Don't you touch that thing.' They did not touch it. But the petitions came pouring in by hundreds and thousands, and the great wave of sentiment kept rising, so that General Miles did issue an order."

This illustrates the difficulty of securing reform when the reform has not begun in spirit in the hearts of the people upon whom it depends for success. Legislation is never the true starting-place of successful reform.
