## For Conscience' Sake.

A blind young man was recently expelled from the Blind Asylum in Hobart, Tasmania, because he desired to observe the Sabbath according to the commandment, which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Sectarianism has always been a cruel thing, and it does not seem to get any more Christlike as the ages go by. Human religion nailed Christ to the cross, and kindled fires for the martyrs; God's religion makes the sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain alike on the just and on the unjust.—*Bible Echo.*
