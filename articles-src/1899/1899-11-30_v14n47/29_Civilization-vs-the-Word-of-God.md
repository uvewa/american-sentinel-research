NATURALLY, to a representative of civilization, it appears that the great need of "heathen" and barbarian lands is to be brought into contact with civilization, that the people of such lands may learn its arts and adopt its ideas and customs. Yet this view, strange as it may seem, is contrary to the whole testimony of history.

There is not in all history any record of the uplifting of a people ignorant of the ways of civilization, by contact with merely civilized people. The record in such cases, on the contrary, is that the uncivilized only sank lower after the contact, than they were before. This has been the record in Australia, New Zealand, Africa, the Hawaiian Islands, and other places that might be named.

And there is a simple and potent reason for this result. It is this: the uncivilized races speedily imitate the vices of civilization, but are not able to imitate its virtues. Hence they go rapidly down the decline of physical and moral degradation, arriving in some cases at almost complete extinction.

The uncivilized races of the earth have been uplifted and civilized, it is true, over vast districts, by contact with civilized people,—but with those who came to them with the Bible, as ambassadors of the kingdom of God; not with those who came with rum and with other physical and moral poison. The uplifting and transforming power is not in civilization, but in the Word of God. It is the very power of God.

It is certainly true, therefore, that the attempt to confer civilization on the people of the Philippines, now being made at such fearful cost, must fail as all other such attempts have failed. The conquest of the islands must be a failure, so far as the moral and physical uplifting of the natives is concerned. There, as everywhere else, this result can be secured only by the "power of God unto salvation."
