## They Should Recognize This Also.

In the recent national convention of the W. C. T. U., a report of work done the past year in promoting "Sabbath observance" was read, in which it was said:—

"The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, recognizing the necessity of a holy Sabbath for the highest development, both of the individual and the nation, has put the weight of its influence against everything that has a tendency to destroy the sanctity of the day."

"Recognizing the necessity of a holy Sabbath for the highest development, both of the individual and the nation," is very well; but why should not another thing be recognized, which is as plain as anything else in connection with the Sabbath—why should not the fact be recognized that there is a conflict of opinion respecting the Sabbath day? This is an obvious truth, and one which has an obvious bearing on the question of enforcing Sabbath observance. Nobody has a right to decide, for anyone but himself, which day is the Sabbath; and therefore, while the Sabbath is a necessity to the highest development of character, this affords no ground for the conclusion that the Sabbath ought to be maintained by force of law.
