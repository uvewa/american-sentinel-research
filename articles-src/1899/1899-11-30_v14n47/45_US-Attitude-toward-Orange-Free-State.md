THE attitude of the American Republic towards the Orange Free State, as pointed out on another page, is worthy of note. The United States has a treaty with this South African republic, made as between equals; yet, so far from showing any sympathy with this republic in its struggle for life with Great Britain, the United States has not even made a proclamation of neutrality. Is this because such a proclamation would hamper its friendship for Great Britain?
