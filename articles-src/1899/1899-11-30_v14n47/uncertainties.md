## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 2, Article "A Great Difference"

- **Issue:** The OCR renders the John Adams quotation with "some distant re ion" — this appears to be an OCR artifact where "region" was split or partially garbled. The original text almost certainly reads "region."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "re ion" — preserved exactly as OCR rendered it, since this is what the OCR source shows. The original PDF should be consulted to confirm whether this is "region" in the original.
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error for "region"
- **Reason:** Context clearly demands "region"; the phrase "some distant region" is a well-known Adams quotation.

### Author: M. W. Healey ("The Pope's Attitude")

- **Issue:** "M. W. Healey" is not in the known authors list and no full name lookup is available.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the byline clearly reads "BY M. W. HEALEY."
- **Transcribed as:** "M. W. Healey" with attribution: explicit (byline present)
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the name as printed; uncertain whether this is a regular contributor or one-time correspondent.

### Author: Royal Hubbell ("Stars, Stripes and Cross")

- **Issue:** "Royal Hubbell" is not in the known authors list.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the byline clearly reads "BY ROYAL HUBBELL."
- **Transcribed as:** "Royal Hubbell" with attribution: explicit (byline present)
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the name as printed.

### Author: Stemple White ("An Object Lesson for Christians")

- **Issue:** "Stemple White" is not in the known authors list. The name is unusual; could be "Temple White" with OCR error.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the byline clearly reads "BY STEMPLE WHITE."
- **Transcribed as:** "Stemple White" with attribution: explicit (byline present)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "Stemple" is unusual; original PDF should be consulted to confirm spelling.

### Author: T. E. Bowen ("American Principles Not Out of Date")

- **Issue:** "T. E. BOWEN" appears at the end of the article with dateline "Rome, N. Y." The article is a commentary on a quotation from Ex Senator Edmunds.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** author "T. E. Bowen," author_short "TEB" — consistent with known 1893 author TEB=T. E. Bowen.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### "The Pope's Attitude" — Sub-article structure

- **Issue:** This article contains a newspaper clipping from the Los Angeles Times embedded within it, with its own bold headline "THE POPE'S ATTITUDE." and subheadline "INSURGENTS WILL RECEIVE NO SUPPORT FROM CATHOLIC CHURCH." The entire piece including commentary is by M. W. Healey.
- **Transcribed as:** Single file with the clipping quoted within it.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — this is clearly one article by one author commenting on a news item.

### Page 12, "Resolutions of the Secular Union Congress"

- **Issue:** The article begins mid-sentence implying it may have started on the previous page. Review of OCR shows it begins cleanly: "The twenty-third annual congress..." — this appears to be a complete article.
- **Confidence:** HIGH
