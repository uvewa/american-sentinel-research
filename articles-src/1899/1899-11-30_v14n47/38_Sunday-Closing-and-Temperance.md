## Sunday Closing and Temperance.

**ENGLEWOOD HAS A DRY SUNDAY: BUT, STRANGELY, THERE WERE MORE DRUNKS THAN EVER.**

New York "World," November 20.

YESTERDAY was the dryest Sunday for Englewood in many years, but, strange to say, there were more intoxicated men on the streets than have been seen in many days. Mayor Brinckerhoff instructed the police a few days ago to enforce the Sunday-closing law.

The Englewood residents either filled their cellars on Saturday night or took the trolleys to the city yesterday morning.
