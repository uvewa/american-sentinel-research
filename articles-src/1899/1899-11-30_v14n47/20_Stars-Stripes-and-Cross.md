## Stars, Stripes and Cross.

BY ROYAL HUBBELL.

OVERZEALOUS religionists are clamoring for a cross in the flag. A country's flag represents the glories of war and conquest; great achievements won by shedding of blood of patriots or hired soldiers; fighting for their idea of right, or for money or for fame.

But the cross of Christ represents the shedding of innocent blood for the salvation of men. What common grounds can the cross have with the stars and stripes?

The professional soldier's main idea and hope is personal advancement: Christ's teaching, all the way through his life, was personal abasement. Luke 22:26. "But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger: and he that is chief, as he that doth serve."

The stars and stripes go into every one of our country's battles; and stay in the midst of the din and carnage, as long as there is hope of winning.

Imagine this flag: "Old Glory," blood smeared and bedraggled, but waving over Uncle Sam's troops as they are about to rout a stubborn enemy. Imagine further, the great general riding furiously up to encourage his men to the final victorious rush. He gazes from the struggling flag bearer to the emblem above his head. Intermingled with the stars and stripes is the cross of Christ, from which looks down the sweetly sorrowful face of Jesus, saying:—

"Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Matt. 26:52.

Where would be that victory? Surely, the cross and the flag are not of a kind. They will not mix.
