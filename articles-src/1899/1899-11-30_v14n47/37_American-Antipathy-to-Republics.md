## American Antipathy to Republics.

"Springfield (Mass.) Republican."

PRESIDENT Kruger's refusal to permit United States Consul Macrum to send any more information to the British government concerning the British prisoners at Pretoria seems to make a stir at Washington; it may be asked, however, why any American should be surprised. After Ambassador Choate's recent "iron-clad friendship speech," what could President Kruger think of the situation? Is it notorious that the United States Government is in sympathy with Great Britain. It is openly preached in this country that Americans should sympathize with England as against the Boers, because it is for America's interest to have a friend in the British government—not to mention a return of favors for England's widely-advertised attitude during the Spanish war. Mr. Kruger knows all about it, and that he should mistrust the United States consul at Pretoria as a medium for communication with England is very natural. What has the United States done to prove its neutrality in this war? The Orange Free State, at least, is absolutely an independent sovereign nation with which the United States has a treaty, negotiated as between equals. The Free State is at war with Great Britain, yet the United States Government has not so much as issued a proclamation of neutrality. The unequal struggle of the Dutch farmers of South Africa against the British empire is one of the most thrilling things in history, yet our Government has sunk so low in its fawning upon might and wealth and power that you must read ancient annals to learn that it ever looked kindly upon a weak people battling for its independence against a nation of conquerors.
