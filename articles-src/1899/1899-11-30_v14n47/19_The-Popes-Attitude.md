## "The Pope's Attitude."

BY M. W. HEALEY.

The following clipping is taken from the Los Angeles (Cal.) Times:—

### "THE POPE'S ATTITUDE."

"INSURGENTS WILL RECEIVE NO SUPPORT FROM CATHOLIC CHURCH."

*By direct wire to the "Times."*

"WASHINGTON, Oct. 11.—[Exclusive dispatch.] In support of the pope's attitude toward this country, especially in relation to the Philippines and Cuba, Archbishop Keane said to day:—

"The pope has accepted the result of the war between the United States and Spain, and has determined that the priests in the islands which passed from Spain to America shall support the American Government in all things. He has no sympathy with the insurgents in the islands, and they will receive no support from the church, any more than they would have been encouraged by the priests in their revolution against Spain. On this subject the pope is firm. He still retains affection for America and Americans.

"Archbishop Chappelle has just been made an apostolic delegate to the Philippines, and has announced that the church in those islands must be brought to conform with the American Church in every respect. The church there is to be brought into full sympathy with the church in this country."

The pope is a genuine acrobat in changing his attitude. At the opening of the war between the United States and Spain he was blessing the Spanish arms, but in so mild a way that he could easily, in case of need, express great love for the prosperity of the United States; and, notice, "He still retains affection for America and Americans."

Again: "The pope has accepted the result of the war between the United States and Spain." Since he has every favor shown him by this country it is not at all strange that he "still retains affection for America," though she whipped Spain in spite of his prayers and blessing. It is not very remarkable that he "has accepted the result," seeing he was powerless to help it.

But where can one find more audacious presumption than he is represented with in these words? "He has no sympathy with the insurgents in the islands, and they will receive no support from the church, . . . On this subject the pope is firm." Indeed! What a friend to America to have no sympathy with a revolution which was from the beginning of it a revolution against the intolerable domination of the priests of Rome. For the authority of Spain in Cuba and the Philippines was merely the authority of the church of Rome.

Do these dignitaries of Rome think that the people have no knowledge, no intelligence? The prophet Daniel truly said of him that his "look was more stout than his fellows." Dan. 7:20.

On a par with these statements from Rome, is one I once heard a priest make in a public discourse on the "History of the Church," that "Rome was bitterly persecuted by Martin Luther."

One would think that an intelligent people with facts of history so fresh before them would give no countenance to such statements, and would look with pity if not contempt on parties making them. But it does not seem to be so. Daniel said in chapter 8, verse 25: "And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand." Surely his craftiness prospers; the Government and many people of America seem to think the "friendship" of Rome the one desirable thing, though nothing but her own selfish ends prompts her in all this, and she is ready to change positions, or make any statements to advance them.
