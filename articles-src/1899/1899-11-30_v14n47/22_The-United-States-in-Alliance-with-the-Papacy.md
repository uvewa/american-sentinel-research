## The United States in Alliance with the Papacy.

Leonard Woolsey Bacon, in "The Outlook."

WHEN, in December, 1897, the Spanish government had lost hope of subduing the insurrection [in the Philippines] led by young Aguinaldo, proposals of peace were made by the governor-general, Primo de Rivera, which were considered in the council of the revolutionary government, with the result that on the 14th of that month a formal treaty was concluded between Aguinaldo in behalf of the Philippine insurgents, and Governor-General de Rivera in behalf of Spain.

In this treaty it was conceded by Spain that the chief of the abuses on account of which the insurgents had taken up arms should be abated, foremost of which was that intolerable tyranny of the monastic orders which has ever been the gravamen of the constant discontent and rebellion of the Philippine Islanders. The expulsion of the monastic orders was promised. It was further promised that there should be a general amnesty to all persons charged with rebellion or sedition, and that an indemnity of $800,000 should be paid, half of it at once, the other half in successive installments. On the other hand, it was promised on the part of the insurgents that their army should lay down its arms, and that their principal leaders should leave the islands during the pleasure of the Spanish crown.

The insurgents fulfilled their part of the treaty. They surrendered their arms to the Spanish government, by inventory, and Aguinaldo and those who shared with him the leadership of this successful rebellion retired to Hong Kong with a letter of credit for $400,000 from the Spanish Philippine bank. The payment of that sum was the only part of the stipulated concession that the Spanish government has paid, or has shown any intention of paying.

It is not wholly aside from our present argument to refer to the reasons alleged for the expulsion of the monastic orders from the islands. According to the mutually corroborative testimony of a multitude of witnesses—Spanish, Philippine, Belgian, English, American, Protestant, and Catholic—the tyranny of these corporations has been shocking and intolerable. It would require a volume to contain the details of it. Let any man consult Senate Document No. 62, 55th Congress, 3rd Session, especially at pages 320–328, 374–378, 406, 445–463, 556, 574, 589–590, 603.

If the friars in the Philippines are not guilty of shamelessly corrupt living and of atrocious and inhuman tyranny, then the United States Senate has joined with officials of other countries, including leading statesmen of Spain, and with distinguished travelers both Catholic and Protestant, in giving currency to the most injurious and outrageous calumnies ever inflicted on innocent men. The alleged tyranny has been exercised by these corporations, not by any civil authority or jurisdiction, but by virtue of their alleged ownership of the soil and of whatever grows from it or is built on it. Over whole provinces, the habitable and cultivable lands, with the farm houses, sugar-mills, and villages standing on them, are claimed and held as the property of corporations of aliens having their headquarters at Rome. Thus the despotism wielded by the friars is absolute; in the nature of the case it must continue to be so, as long as the ownership is maintained; it is tantamount to slavery from which the victim can escape only by banishment from home and livelihood.

Against less intolerable abuses of a like sort every country in Europe has revolted, in one way or another, extinguishing the great mortmain tenures in the hands of monastic fraternities, as being irreconcilable with the public welfare. It is against this tyranny, with aggravations such as Europe never knew, that the Philippine people took up arms, and laid them down on the solemn pledge of Spain that the abuse should be abated.

And now comes in the great American Republic, with loud promises of civil and religious liberty, and buys for cash the vicious title of Spain, with a distinct stipulation that the most oppressive of all the Spanish abuses, which Spain had promised to abate, shall be upheld and maintained forever by the arms of America (See Article VIII. of the Treaty of Paris).

Archbishop Chappelle has started for the islands with a commission from the pope and much advice from the President, to attend to "the settlement of questions of church property." He "has come out for the permanent retention of the Philippines. He is in favor of expansion unqualifiedly." The archbishop "will soon become a powerful ally of the Government." Nothing could be more natural. The Government of the United States has already become the powerful ally of the archbishop and of the papal see, and of the Augustinian and other orders, and will co-operate with these orders in maintaining unimpaired their rights of ownership, which involve the total suppression of civil and religious liberty throughout their immense domains.

The limits of this article have not permitted me to add verifying references from point to point, as I would gladly have done. Let me refer to Senate Doc. 62, above-mentioned, passim; corroborative references might be furnished in abundance.
