## Protestant Extension in Austria.

According to official reports from the ecclesiastical authorities in Vienna, the accessions to the Protestant churches during the first six months of the year 1899 were 3,182 to the Lutheran and 264 to the Reformed Church, or a total of 3,446. Of these converts 3,275 came from the Roman Catholic Church, and can fairly be put to the credit of the "Los von Rom" propaganda. On the other hand, during this same half year the Lutheran Church lost 272 members and the Reformed 155, of whom 382 connected themselves with the Roman Catholic Church. This still leaves a plus of nearly 3,000 additions to Protestantism in German Austria for the comparatively short period of six months. In Vienna alone the number of accessions to the Protestant churches was 1,269. These data are furnished by the government itself, which is antagonistic to the Protestant agitation, and can be regarded as reliable.—*The Independent.*
