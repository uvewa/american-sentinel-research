A CARDINAL principle of the movement to unite church and state in this nation, is that the Government does not derive its just powers from the consent of the governed. Notice the flat-footed statement of this principle made by a leading representative of this movement at a National Reform convention recently held in Boston. See p. 747.

That speaker spoke for the church. But at the same time the state in this country is saying the same thing, by the act of extending its authority over a foreign people against their will, and by the arguments put forth to justify the act. The church and the state are coming into harmony upon this point.

But in repudiating the doctrine of government by consent of the governed, in religion, what does the church repudiate? In religion, the doctrine of government by consent of the governed stands for the right of each individual to think and act for himself, independently of the authority of a pope. And this is what was affirmed in the "Protest of the Princes" at Spires. So that in repudiating this doctrine, the church repudiates the "Protest" of the Protestant princes, from which is derived the term "Protestantism."

What this great Protest was, and is, in the religious world, the Declaration of Independence is in the political world. The church has repudiated the one, and the state is repudiating the other. And in this both are ready to join hands.

But Protestantism, in the church and in the state, still stands for the principle of government by consent of the governed.
