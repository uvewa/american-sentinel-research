## Resolutions of the Secular Union Congress.

The twenty-third annual congress of the American Secular Union and Freethought Federation, recently held in this city, gave considerable attention to indications pointing to church-and-state union in this country. All but two of the resolutions adopted by the congress touch upon this subject. Omitting these two, the resolutions read:

"Believing that the greatest evil in our land is the unconstitutional union of church and state, we hereby reaffirm as our political principles The Nine Demands of Liberalism; and

"WHEREAS, Certain of the practises of the various States and of the national Government are contrary to these avowed principles; therefore—

"Resolved, That the urgent necessity of the Union and Federation is to take some practical steps towards enforcing these 'demands,' and resisting further encroachments of the National Reform Association, otherwise known as the God-in-the-Constitution party.

"Resolved, That the duty of all Freethinkers in the State and national elections is to ascertain the views of the various candidates upon these Demands and to use their influence in securing the nomination of those most in sympathy with our principles and purposes, and, afterwards, to support only such at the polls; and we recommend that Liberals in all localities pledge themselves to vote for those who will work for and carry out these Demands after their election.

"Resolved, That the three most important Demands at the present time are those dealing with the Bible in the public schools, the taxation of church property, and Sunday laws.

"Resolved, that we heartily indorse the action of the Chicago superintendent of public schools in forbidding the reading of a certain poem as a part of the exercises in the schools on account of its religious and theistic tendencies.

"Resolved, That we congratulate the Legislature of California upon its action in rejecting the bill presented at its last session exempting church property from taxation.

"Resolved, That we condemn the bigoted persecution of the Seventh-day Adventists by the other Christian denominations, and that we extend sympathies to those who are suffering from such persecutions, and, although rejecting their religious views, we pledge them our aid in working for political justice.

"Resolved, That we recognize the power and influence of the numerous local organizations of Spiritualists, and invite them to act as sentinels to give early warning of attempts to undermine the principles of secular government; and we further bespeak their cooperation in aiding us to promote and make effective our aims as expressed in the Nine Demands.

"Resolved, That we condemn the action of any judge who uses his official position to advance the Christian religion by incorporating into his opinions any statement which may be interpreted as meaning that this nation is a Christian nation.

"Resolved, That we regret the alliance between our present administration and the authorities of the Roman Catholic church in the attempted pacification and government of the Philippine islands, and that we demand that our Constitution shall not be violated by the establishment of religion in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

"Resolved, That we protest against the church laws in our new territory of Porto Rico, and urge Congress to adopt measures to effect the separation of church and state without considering the interest of any ecclesiastical body."
