## American Principles Not Out of Date.

Ex Senator George F. Edmunds, speaking recently of what Congress should do, in adjusting matters in the Philippine Islands, thus bringing the war in that country to an end, gave utterance to the following timely words:

"I think the short question for the Congress and people of the United States is whether the principles upon which our Government was founded, and the principles upon which three-fourths of a century ago we recognized and assisted in setting up the Central and South American republics, are still true ones and ought to be followed. I think it a mistake to suppose that these principles and policies are out of date.

"If the right of self-government were tested by the highest standards, it would be difficult to maintain that even the people of the United States were capable of it, for we all know that in many instances our own self-government goes wrong and does not defend equality and execute justice among men. But no such standard can be applied in this age, as it never has been.

"A standard must be practical, and it does not follow that a people is incapable of self-government because sometimes, and possibly often, it fails to accomplish the ends for which it was established.

"If the Filipinos, therefore, are willing, upon the conditions I have suggested, to have peace and be helped to try their experiment of self-government, and be assisted and protected in doing so, I think Congress ought to make provision to that end.

"The enormous difficulties in continuing them as mere subjects of the United States, or in a condition of territorial citizenship seem to me to make it the plain duty of Congress to try the means I have suggested of letting them try to govern themselves.

"If this can be accomplished, which only can be known when the effort is made, there will be saved thousands of lives of our soldiers and sailors and millions upon millions of expenditure from our Treasury indefinitely prolonged, while every material interest of the United States in respect to trade and commerce and the advancement of civilization will be maintained."
