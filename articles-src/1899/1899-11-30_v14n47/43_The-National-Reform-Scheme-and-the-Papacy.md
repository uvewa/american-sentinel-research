WHEN the Government undertakes to execute the will of God, there must be some authority to say what the will of God is. And that authority must be human; for while the Bible states what is the will of God, the people are not in agreement concerning the meaning of Scripture statements; so that while the Bible, in itself, is authority, there must be another authority to settle the question of what the Bible authority commands. And this new authority must be some man, or set of men. But just this authority is what is claimed by the pope of Rome. What then could the National Reform scheme result in but the establishment of another papacy? And the world does not need another papacy; it could very well dispense with the one it already has.
