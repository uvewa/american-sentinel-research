Press dispatches from Georgia state that in the town of Americus, the pastor and some members of a "Christian Science" church have come into conflict with the law for refusing to be vaccinated. The pastor has been sentenced to thirty days in jail and a fine of $15, and five women have been sentenced to fifteen days and a fine of $3 each. The cases have all been appealed to the higher court.
