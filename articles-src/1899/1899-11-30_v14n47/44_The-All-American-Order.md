WE have heard from the Secretary of the "All American Order," a religio-political organization of Brooklyn, who tells us: "No doubt you are aware that Rome is the cause of our churches being demoralized through the evils that exist in this city. . . I will say in a few words, if you will advocate pure politics, church people attend primaries, put good men up for office and have only two parties, we can clean Rome out of existence in one election."

Our friend is mistaken. We are not aware that "Rome is the cause of our churches being demoralized." If the churches are demoralized, the trouble is internal, not external. All Rome outside of a church will not demoralize that church so long as the principles of Rome are not allowed inside that church. But when the principles of Rome get into the church, there is demoralization speedily. The principles of Rome are summed up in the combination of religion with politics.

And now we are asked to advocate a union of the church with politics, or in other words, that "church people attend the primaries," etc., in order that Rome may be overthrown. Why, good friends, that is the very thing by which Rome was built up in the first place. If the Christian Church had kept out of politics, no papacy would ever have been. And while the church remains in politics, the essence of the papacy must ever be.

We are as anxious as anybody that Rome should go out of existence; but we have no desire to work against any man, whether in politics or out. Our method of fighting Rome is to fight Rome's principles; and we are never more opposed to those principles than when they appear in measures proposed by professedly Protestant people.
