With the idea of promoting good citizenship and good government in the islands taken from Spain, the "National Reform Bureau" at Washington, D. C., will distribute in the islands, it is announced, literature published in the Spanish language, treating on "American Christian institutions," and "especially on the American Sabbath."

The relationship between good citizenship and "the American Sabbath," we may add, is more easily assumed than proved. We know of some American citizens in a Southern State, who, in their zeal for "the American Sabbath," came armed with guns to a church where religious services were being conducted by some who observed a different Sabbath, and fired into the building with intent to kill. That is not our idea of good citizenship or good government.
