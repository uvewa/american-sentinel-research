## The Religious School Question in Japan.

PRESSURE is being brought to bear upon the Japanese government, by the churches in the United States and the missionaries in Japan, to secure the repeal or modification of a decree lately promulgated by the Japanese Minister of Education, as follows:—

"It being essential, from the point of view of educational administration, that general education should be independent of religion, religious instruction must not be given, or religious ceremonies performed at government schools, public schools, or schools whose curricula are regulated by provisions of law, even outside the regular course of instruction."

The matter was considered at a conference of officers of missionary societies held in this city November 9, and the following statement was adopted as expressing the sentiment of the meeting:—

"This conference, composed of officers and members of the missionary agencies of the Baptist, Congregational, Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Reformed churches, would express its complete approval of the resolution adopted by the missionaries in Japan on August 16, in the conference called to consider the question of the relation of the schools supported by these boards to the regulation of the minister of education, forbidding religious worship or instruction in all schools 'whose curricula are regulated by provisions of law.'"

The resolutions here referred to allege that under the existing regulations the liberty of parents touching the education of their children is restricted, although the constitution of the empire grants full religious liberty. They also say:—

"We are here not raising any objections to the Educational Department's making such restrictions for public schools supported by public funds; but we feel that to put these same limitations upon private schools, supported by private funds, works great injustice. We feel even more strongly that these regulations make it impossible for Christian schools to secure the recognition of the government and its accompanying privileges. We are of the conviction that for any Christian school, founded on Christian principles, supported in any measure by the gifts and prayers of Christian people, to exclude in any degree Christianity from its ruling principles, or from its school life, would be disloyalty to our common Lord, and to the churches aiding our schools. We call upon all officers and teachers of Christian schools to take a firm and decided stand upon this matter, not yielding any Christian principle for the sake of securing or maintaining Government privileges."

Just what these "privileges" may be, or what advantage is to be derived by the Christian schools from Government recognition, is not quite clear. The government of Japan is not Christian even in profession and cannot be expected to recognize a Christian school in any way that would mean an indorsement of Christianity; nor would Christianity have anything to gain from the indorsement of a heathen government.

The mission schools are determined to adhere to their Christian principles and teaching, and in this action are strongly indorsed by their home churches in the United States. As Christian institutions, they certainly could not do anything less.
