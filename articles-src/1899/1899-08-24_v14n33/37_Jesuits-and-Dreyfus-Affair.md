THE French police at Rennes in hunting for the assassin of M. Labori, chief counsel for Dreyfus, carefully searched a Jesuit institution on the outskirts of that city, as a place where the fugitive might be expected to have fled. That the Jesuits are leagued with the anti-Semites of France, is a fact well known to the French authorities.

It is generally believed that France is on the verge of a revolution. A pent-up volcano is shaking the foundations of the republic,—a volcano of moral and political depravity. The leading men in public life—high generals in the army, an expression of the republic, and others—appear on the witness stand under one another's accusations as liars, perjurers, forgers, etc.,—men utterly without conscience; while the mob parades through the streets of Paris shouting "Death to the Jews."

What has brought France to such a condition? The answer may be summed up in the words, Jesuitism and Militarism. These two great forces represent the opposition to the French republic. Both are natural enemies of republican government.

And these two evils—militarism and the church in politics—are rapidly on the increase in the United States.
