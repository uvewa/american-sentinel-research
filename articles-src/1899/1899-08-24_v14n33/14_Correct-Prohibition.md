Mr. Howard, a leading prohibitionist of Rochester, has the correct idea of prohibition, even if his notions in regard to the sacredness of Sunday and the temporal kingship of Christ are not so good. At the recent Christian Endeavor Convention he said:—

"The only solution of the side door is no front door.

"The only solution of the Sunday saloon is no Monday saloon.

"The only solution of the saloon problem is no saloon.

"Anything that stops short of that is treason to the country, treason to humanity, and treason to the cross of Christ."

The saloon is bad any day in the week. It is no worse on Sunday than it is on Tuesday or Wednesday, and the sooner all of our temperance workers awake to this fact the better it will be.
