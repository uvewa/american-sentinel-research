What the President in a recent speech called "the blessed mission of liberty and humanity," is made the subject of forcible but not flattering comment by Bishop Thorburn, Methodist, in the Lutheran Observer. Speaking of American civilization as seen in Manila, he said:—

"My visit here has more than ever impressed me with the essential barbarity of war. Every alternate place of business seems to be a liquor shop of some kind, and the soldier has temptation before his eyes whichever way he may turn. It is amazing how slow public rulers in our modern days are in discovering that the surest and most certain way to promote good order in times like these is absolutely to close every place where intoxicating drink is sold. Drunken soldiers meet me everywhere, and it is painful in the extreme to remember that they have come from Christian homes, and that they have been thrust into the very jaws of a temptation from which only strong men can be expected to escape."

Nothing that takes with it the American saloon, can ever go on a "blessed mission of liberty and humanity." That is as certain as that the saloon is a curse in America.
