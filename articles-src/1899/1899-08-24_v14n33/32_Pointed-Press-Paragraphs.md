The follower of Jehovah cannot afford to become a weather vane to point in whatever direction the community may decide.—*Bible Echo.*

In order that Cuba may enjoy the blessings of liberty, it has been found necessary to suppress newspapers which advocate the independence of the island.—*Detroit Evening News.*

We oppose conquest of the Philippines because imperialism means militarism, because militarism means government by force, and because government by force means death of government by consent, the destruction of political and industrial freedom and the obliteration of equality of rights and assassination of democratic institutions.—*Iowa Democratic Platform.*

The boycott is as rude and ineffective in warfare as the Australian boomerang. Certainly it can do much damage; but it is of the kind which counts very little toward the final settlement of a dispute. What chance has the savage with his bow and arrow against the rifle of the modern soldier? When men have nothing better than a boycott to fight with, their cause is lost.—*Christian Register.*

In Kentucky the people are threatening whipping and death to Mormon missionaries and forcibly expelling them from the State. We wax indignant when in some far-off Chinese town our missionaries are treated in that manner, and we send soldiers to punish the criminals. Whether these Mormon missionaries are right or wrong they should have the protection of law. We must depend on the supreme power of light and truth for our protection, not on lawless force.—*N. Y. Independent.*
