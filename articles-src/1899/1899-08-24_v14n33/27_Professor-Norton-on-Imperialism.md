By what right are we murdering the people of the Philippines and devastating their homes? Is it because we paid $20,000,000 for what we could not buy? Did we pay this sum to make the people slaves to our will, or, in the glowing phrase, to compel them to submit to benevolent assimilation?

Yes, we are committing this carnage for the sake of dominion, in order to compel the submission of freemen who owe us no submission, to deprive them of their independence, to enforce moral slavery upon men who have as good a right to freedom as we ourselves.

And their steadfast resistance to our oppression, which deserves the respect of every free man, is called by the hot headed popular hero of our war "an outburst of savagery," and his advice to the nation is "to resolve to back up the President to the full in repressing this outburst of savagery once for all."

And our new Secretary of War follows up these fatuous words with the declaration that from now on the war will be prosecuted with all possible energy. . . . There will be 50,000 men in the Philippines ready for active service at the close of the rainy season, and more will be sent there if necessary.

This is a George III. policy; these are Lord North words; the policy and the words of folly, of tyranny and of failure.

It were better to remember the advice of that great statesman Lord Chatham, who, when in 1775 we were giving that example to the world which the Filipinos are now closely imitating, moved to address His Majesty "to withdraw the troops from Boston, in order to open the way toward a happy settlement of the dangerous troubles in America."

Let the cry rise till it thunders in the ears of the Administration, "Stop this fighting!"

That is the instant need, the first step toward regaining national self-respect. The next may be more difficult—to confess our mistake, to admit that we have done wrong, and to endeavor, so far as may now be possible, to repair it.

We cannot bring the dead to life, we cannot restore the desolated homes, but we can help the Filipinos to establish their independence, and we can afford them support in maintaining it.

Let us charge off the twenty millions paid for the islands as a bad debt; let us charge off also more than double twenty millions which this fighting has already cost us as the price of a bitter but salutary lesson. Let us set an example of national manliness, good sense and magnanimity and of fidelity to the ideal of goodwill among men.

It is a magnificent opportunity to make a real advance in civilization. Shall we seize it nobly, or let it slip from our grasp, to our own lasting shame and unavailing repentance?

On the issue depends the life or the death of the America which has been, which should be, the hope of mankind.—Charles Eliot Norton, of Harvard University, in speech at Ashfield, Mass.
