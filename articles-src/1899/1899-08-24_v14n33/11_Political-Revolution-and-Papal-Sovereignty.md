BY JOHN MCCARTHY.

A SHORT time ago the correspondent in Rome of the great Italian newspaper the Corriere de la Sera, of Milan, one of the most influential papers in Europe, in political circles, said the following with regard to some themes of utmost public importance, which are intimately connected with the Vatican:—

"In a kind of secret consistory, convoked urgently upon the occasion of the bloody uprisings in Italy, which filled with pain the heart of every loyal Italian; the cardinals who are most irreconcilable towards the royal house of Italy, sustained with much circumspection, although with great tenacity, the idea, that it was convenient and just in the highest degree, that the Catholic Church should profit—although with all possible secrecy—by the favorable opportunity that may present itself, for the recovery of all the rights of the Holy See.

"After a very long discussion, these high papal dignitaries resolved that they would neither ordain any bishop, nor sanction the consecration of any priest who should in any way favor the diminution of such lamentable disorders, as has been the lot of Italy recently to witness."

Yet these are the men who claim to be the representatives of the Prince of Peace.

Yes, the policy of Rome is to promote revolutions in the existing governments not favorable to Rome; and when the government finds it cannot quell the spirit of rebellion, it is forced to appeal to the pope to use his influence to subordinate the revolutionists.

Now the pope sees the way to clear off some old scores, so he promises to "intervene," on condition that the government make such and such concessions. The government realizing its incapacity to do otherwise, consents to these conditions; the pope then speaks through the bishops, the bishops through the priests; and immediately the fire of rebellion is extinguished.

This may be denied, but we shall proceed to prove the point. Not very long ago, the German emperor was anxious to pass his famous army bill, but the Catholic party opposed the same, with all the energy in their power. The emperor was determined to carry his project through, and he appealed to the pope to use his influence with the German Catholic party.

The pope saw his chance to utilize this occasion for the benefit of the papacy. The emperor and the Catholic party came to terms. The emperor was able to carry out his plan, but only at the cost of permitting the Jesuits to return to the "fatherland." Thus the work of the great diplomat and statesman Bismarck was undone. And this was only one of numerous other concessions made to the Roman Catholic Church at this very time.

The Catholic religion is above all a political religion. The true Catholic is first a Catholic, then a subject of the civil government. As Catholic the pope is his supreme head. Thus immediately the American and the Catholic interests conflict, such an one is obliged to give his first service to the papacy.

Thus it is that in all Catholic countries we hear of perpetual disorders, uprisings, and revolutions.
