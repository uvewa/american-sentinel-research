THE Roman Catholic archbishop of Bagdad reports wholesale conversions of Nestorians and Armenians in that part of Asia, to the papal religion. In a letter addressed to the pope, published in the London Tablet, the archbishop says:—

"Holy Father, I am happy to be able to offer your holiness the first news of an event which will fill you with joy and for which your holiness will join with us in loudly thanking the divine goodness. The mission which two sons of St. Dominic from Mossul have been carrying on for the last three months in the midst of the Nestorian population, at the price of great fatigues, has won from heaven the most consoling results, which will soon be made known to your holiness by authentic documents.

Fifty thousand Nestorian Christians have given their adhesion to the Catholic faith into the hands of these gallant missionaries, Fathers Rhétoré and de France, of the residence of Van; while in the region near this city, thirty thousand Gregorian Armenians have, thanks to the missionaries, also embraced Catholicism."

The Tablet remarks that this far exceeds the result when Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and 3 000 were added to the believers; which is true enough, in a numerical sense. But the question of church prosperity is not a question of numbers. The more unconverted people there are in the church, the worse it is for the church.

If this report be true, it is not the first instance of wholesale "conversions" in the history of the papal church. Back in the days when Charlemagne and others championed the papal cause at the head of their troops, there were wholesale "conversions" and additions to the Catholic ranks; and before this, when Christian doctrines and institutions were modified and accommodated to the ideas of the heathen whom it was desired to add to the church, there were likewise wholesale "conversions." But what was the result? The church became corrupt, allied herself with the state, persecuted the saints, and gave almost her whole energies to the cause of unrighteousness and untruth.

When a church begins to glory in its numbers, it is near the end of its usefulness in the world.
