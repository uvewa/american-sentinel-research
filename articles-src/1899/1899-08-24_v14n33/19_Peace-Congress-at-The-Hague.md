THE Peace Congress at The Hague were unanimous upon one point in considering the question of mitigating the barbarities of war—they agreed not to drop explosives upon an enemy from balloons. This exception to the general disagreement is explainable in the light of the fact that the feasibility of such a means of attacking an enemy has never yet been demonstrated.
