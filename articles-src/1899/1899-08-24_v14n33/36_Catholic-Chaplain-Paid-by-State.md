A LETTER from Mr. W. J. Morgan, of this State, who holds the office of comptroller, to the Rochester Union and Advertiser, states that "the Rev. O. P. Farren, Roman Catholic clergyman, received $1,200 last year for his services as chaplain" of the State Industrial school. And these "services" were performed under the "Freedom of Worship" bill passed some years ago by the New York legislature, after much discussion, under the provisions of which Roman Catholic priests were to be permitted to hold religious services in certain state institutions, without cost to the State. This was what advocates of the bill said when it was before the legislature; but it turns out that the state now pays such clergymen $1,200 a year, and in addition allows "$5 a month for car fare for the Sisters of Charity."
