When Labori was shot by an assassin in ambush a French army officer exclaimed: "France would be happier if a few more like him should be executed!"

There spoke the military spirit. It stands always and everywhere for brute force, for arbitrary rule, for all the infamies of despotism. It is the enemy of liberty, the willing instrument of oppression, the implacable foe of free government.

In France it has wrought a persecution without a parallel in modern history. To that end it has resorted to forgery, perjury, and the prostitution of the courts of justice themselves. Now that the righteous wrath of the French people insists upon undoing this stupendous wrong, the military spirit smiles even upon assassination as a means of defeating justice in the interest of the shoulder-strapped caste.

Worse still, it threatens the integrity of the Republic. France is to-day fighting for the existence of her free institutions, menaced as they are by the army she maintains to defend them.

The situation is entirely logical. A great standing army, officered by professional soldiers, is instinctively hostile to liberty, jealous of the civil power, antagonistic to everything that tends to restrain brute force or to curb the arbitrary will of commanders.

It has been the happiness of the American people that they have hitherto resolutely resisted the military spirit and refused to permit the maintenance of anything more than a skeleton army in times of peace. They have escaped the dominance of the "man on horseback" by denying him his mount. And yet in every time of need they have brought to bear quite all of military force that has been needed for the defense of the Republic.

Is there anywhere a substantial reason for abandoning this traditional policy under which the country has been so prosperous and so free, and has grown to be so great?
