The war in the Philippines has grown to large dimensions. Secretary Root is planning to increase our army there to 70,000 men. This is twice as large as the army with which we whipped Mexico. There were only about 20,000 of our soldiers actually engaged in the overthrow of Spanish power in Cuba and Porto Rico.

With a war of this size on our hands it is pertinent to inquire what we are fighting for.

It is, to begin with, an irregular and unauthorized war. It was never declared by Congress, in which body the power to declare war is vested by the Constitution. It is strictly Mr. McKinley's war.

Is it to confirm our "sovereignty" over the islands, preparatory to their annexation and government by the United States? No; for the Senate, a part of the treaty-making power, adopted a resolution, declaring—

"That by the ratification of the treaty of peace with Spain it is not intended to incorporate the inhabitants of the Philippines into citizenship of the United States, nor is it intended to permanently annex said islands as an integral part of the territory of the United States."

Are we fighting, then, to suppress internecine war and put down a reign of terror? There is no war in the Philippines except between our soldiers and the natives, who conceive themselves to be fighting for their liberty and independence. There is no terror except such as the splendid valor and deadly effectiveness of our troops have inspired.

Are we fighting to establish a "stable government" in the islands and to insure to their people the blessings of freedom and civilization? Why not give them a chance to govern themselves? Liberty is the best—the only—preparation for liberty. Freedom is the best instructor in the school of self-government. When in the world's history has it ever been necessary to thrust the right to liberty and self-rule upon a people with force and arms? Where do we find a commission for shooting our civilization into 10,000,000 alien people 10,000 miles away?

Is it strange that the American people are asking themselves, with increasing earnestness, "What are we fighting for?"
