One of the strongest arguments for the divine origin of the Bible is afforded by the fact that the Mosaic law commands the admiration of the wisest legislators of modern times. Infidels have referred to the ancient Israelites as little better than barbarians, yet the Israelitish code far surpasses all the legislative systems of the Greeks and Romans, and forms the foundation of all modern civilized jurisprudence. The wisdom of ages has discovered no defect in this ancient code. Said professor Huxley, the agnostic, "There is no code of legislation, ancient or modern, at once so just and so merciful, so tender to the weak and poor, as the Jewish law."

A feature of Mosaic legislation which deserves especial consideration in these days of social unrest is, that under that law such evils as socialists and so-called "reformers" complain of were impossible. Every man was provided with a home and he could not be dispossessed of his inheritance. He could lease his land until the year of jubilee, which occurred every fifty years, or bind himself for a period to servitude, but at the year of jubilee the land would again be his. The only exception to this was that the houses and gardens within the limits of cities and villages could be disposed of absolutely; but the farms and fields could not be sold. No father could dispossess his children of their rights under the Jewish law. We hear a great deal in these days about the advantages of a law which would give to every family a portion of land, but, strange to say, many of the advocates of such a system profess not to believe the Bible, but talk of the "mistakes of Moses" and are apparently ignorant of the fact that the Mosaic law gave to all a homestead, and that under it the people were far more prosperous than any other nation the world has known.
