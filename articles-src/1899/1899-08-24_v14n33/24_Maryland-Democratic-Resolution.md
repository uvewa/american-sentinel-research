THE State Democratic convention of Maryland, assembled August 2, adopted among other resolutions, the following:—

"No deadlier blow can be dealt to American liberty than the suppression, by an abuse of executive power, of the free utterance of American freemen of their sentiments upon matters of public concern affecting the welfare of the people, and we denounce as dangerous and indefensible all efforts to interfere with and abridge this sacred right."

This is a plain reference to the policy of General Otis in the Philippines, in establishing a censorship of the press, which prevented the true state of affairs there from being known in America. If circumstances at Manila and in Cuba are not vastly different from those prevailing now during the next political campaign, that campaign will be the bitterest that has been fought since the Civil War. There is an intensity coming into the strifes that are waged in politics and in society that indicates an approaching climax and a mighty change.
