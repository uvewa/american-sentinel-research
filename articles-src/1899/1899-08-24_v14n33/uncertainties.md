# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, August 24, 1899 (v14n33)

## Article 04: "The Insular Commission's 'Insult.'"

- **Issue:** The word "celbacy" appears in the OCR text (line: "That priests and others who have taken the vow of celbacy may be permitted..."). This appears to be either an OCR error or a period misprint for "celibacy."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the OCR source reads "celbacy."
- **Transcribed as:** "celbacy" (preserved as-is from the OCR; likely a period misprint in the original or OCR error)
- **Confidence:** LOW — cannot verify against original print scan; if the original reads "celibacy," this should be corrected
- **Recommendation:** Verify against the original PDF scan for this issue.

## Article 11: "Political Revolution and Papal Sovereignty."

- **Attribution:** Byline reads "BY JOHN MCCARTHY" with location "Buenos Ayres, Argentina" at the close. This is treated as an explicit contributed piece by John McCarthy, not an American Sentinel reprint. Author initials assigned "JMC" (not a known initials code in the standard list).
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the byline is unambiguous.

## Article 13: "The Peace of Babylon."

- **Attribution:** The piece is labeled "A PARABLE" and attributed at the end to "The Bible Echo, Melbourne, Aus." Treated as a reprint.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

## Article 27: "Professor Norton on Imperialism."

- **Attribution:** The closing line reads "Charles Eliot Norton, of Harvard University, in speech at Ashfield, Mass." This is a speech excerpt, not a periodical reprint. The `original_publication` field describes this as a speech rather than a journal, which is a slight departure from the standard reprint pattern.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — source and speaker clearly identified.

## Page 8 Editorial Notes Structure

- The page 8 items are separated by "• • •" bullet dividers in the OCR. Each has been treated as its own article. Two consecutive items about the Archbishop of Durango (Mexico) and the response to his self-contradiction are presented together in the OCR with a "• • •" between them. These have been consolidated into one article (22) since they form a continuous editorial argument about the same subject.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the editorial structure could support either separation or consolidation.

## General

- Page headers ("AMERICAN SENTINEL.", page numbers, running titles) have been excluded from all article texts as instructed.
- Advertisements (Pacific Press, Signs of the Times, scientific American, book listings) on pages 13-16 have been excluded as boilerplate/advertising material.
- The block quote notation on page 1 (`>`) representing the subscription notice has been treated as part of the masthead, not an article.
