FOLLOWING the example of American journalism, two popular London dailies began in April to issue Sunday editions. This caused a considerable sensation, and the movement inaugurated in opposition was so strong that within two months the Sunday issues were withdrawn.

In the August number of the *Review of Reviews*, Henry S. Lunn, M. D., has an article entitled, "The Defeat of Seven-Day Journalism in London." He tells us how strongly he felt the gravity of the situation, and the part he acted in organizing the National Protest Committee. Here members of Parliament, merchants and manufacturers, priests and bishops, both Protestant and Catholic, united in a formal protest, copies of which were to be sent to all the distinguished people in England. At this point, however, the papers yielded "as a frank concession to the religious feeling of the country."

Mr. Lunn says, "In conclusion, I would point out that the popular movement which I have attempted to describe was not a mere ebullition of Sabbatarian fanaticism. It was based on the scientifically-proved necessity of a weekly break,—a 'truce of God,'—in the wearing toil and nervous strain of modern life."

It is well that they did not attempt to make the Bible a basis for the movement, as that plainly says "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." On that day spiritual rest is enjoined, and in giving it to mankind the Lord never advanced civil or scientific reasons. First-day observance certainly constitutes "a weekly break," and it logically follows that, since the Sabbath of the Lord has been discarded, its true worth and meaning should be lost to view. This "scientific" sabbath is the workmanship of the same power which originated the "truce of God." The latter was introduced in the eleventh century by the Catholic Church, and meant a suspension of private war during church feasts and festivals, and weekly from Thursday night until Monday morning. It placed a check upon contending armies, giving them respite and the opportunity to attend religious services; but practically they rested only that they might enter the struggle of war and bloodshed with renewed vigor.

To call such a transaction a "truce of God" is certainly not honoring the King of heaven; and it is equally so when applied to a man-made "scientifically-proved" day of rest. Paul's instruction to Timothy is also for us: "Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus." "O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: which some professing have erred concerning the faith."
