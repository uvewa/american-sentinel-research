An Englishman, Mr. W. G. Gorman, has made a compilation of "Converts to Rome Since the Tractarian Movement, to May, 1899," a period covering about half a century. His figures show that in this time 446 Anglican clergymen have "gone over" to Rome; of the nobility, 417; army officers, 205; authors, poets, and journalists, 162; legal profession, 129; public officials, 90; medical profession, 60.

Of the converts, 158 have become priests, and 290 "secular clergy." Oxford University has furnished 445 converts, while Cambridge University has furnished only about half as many—213. Trinity College, Dublin; London University, Durham University and King's College, London, have also furnished converts, and a very few have come from four universities in Scotland.
