### A PARABLE.

The Angel of Peace came to Babylon, and behold, all the people were active in discussing certain proposals of peace that had been sent over by a great king of the East.

Then said the angel to a man that stood by, "Hearest thou what the people say?" "Yea," answered the man, "and the thing is good." "Come then," said the angel, "for I would fain see what they do in Babylon."

So they passed on, and came near to a fort where much booming of cannon was heard, with loud trampling of feet and martial music. "What do they here?" said the angel, and the man replied, "This is a place set apart by the king of Babylon, where the soldiers do practise in the service of arms that our country and our possessions may be defended from enemies that would rise up on every side."

From thence they passed on, and came to a school. Now about this time many boys and girls made great riot in their play. And on the one side there was a multitude of boys being exercised in the use of musketry. "What do they here with these children?" said the angel. "Teach them to drill in the soldier's duties that they may become skilful in the use of weapons, and thus prove a defense to our empire," said the man. "And do they this constantly?" said the angel. "Yea, constantly, said the man, 'for our great empire hath much need of defense.'"

Then they turned and passed toward the sunset, and on the way came upon a stately temple, from which there came forth the sound of much music. "What find we here?" inquired the angel; and the man replied, "This is even the holy place of our God of Peace. Enter thou, for many devoted hearts attend here to worship."

So they entered, and from the pulpit there rose up a man who spake many words. And with much eloquence he exhorted his hearers to rejoice in the great prospects of peace; and that no man should offend against the peace of the nation. "But," said the preacher, "if our enemies smite us, or refuse to give homage to great Babylon, we must needs requite them, that our good name be not blasphemed among the nations." Here the angel of peace sighed, and they passed out.

Now it happened that on their way westward they came to a place where there was much noise because of the clanging of hammers, and activity of the workmen. "What do they here?" asked the angel, and the man answered, "These are the royal yards from which the ships of our navy may be replenished. Lo, here many thousands of workmen do constantly exercise themselves in preparing war vessels, and in putting thereon cannon and other weapons of defense."

Then the angel lifted up his eyes, and saw a multitude of ships upon the sea nearby. "Why so many ships, and whence do they sail?" said the angel. The man was glad at the sight and made answer: "These ships, being about fifty million tons burden, go to and fro throughout the whole earth. They engage not in commerce, but carry weapons of defense, and men fully armed, with commission to keep the peace of the seas."

From thence they turned, and passing northward, came in front of a great building from which there issued a marvelous stream of ammunition and weapons wherewith men destroy their fellows. "What do they here?" inquired the angel. "This," said the man, "is our national armory, and arsenal factory, from which we send forth explosive compounds, and arms to all the earth. And if our enemies should rise in rebellion and gainsay our rights, with these things we visit for their iniquities and so put them at peace again."

Here they turned, and passing toward the east through the city, came at last to a place where two roads met. Before them stood an ancient building round which some officers arrayed as soldiers, and with look more stout than their fellows, kept watch.

"Let us enter here and see what they do," said the angel. Then they passed to a room where about four and twenty men sat in council. "What find we here?" said the angel, and the man replied, "Behold, this is the peace conference of Babylon, where they discuss the proposals made by the king of the East."

The angel looked upon the men, and lo, they were of regal bearing, and venerable withal, and each of them carried a sword by his side. Then the angel listened to hear the words, but the ambassadors talked long. Yet the multitude of words brought not peace, for when they were about to come to a settlement, one man rose up and said, "My master receiveth not your proposals for disarmament; seemeth it a light thing to you to give up our arms of defense? Not so! for in these there lies our nation's peace and safety."

Then the angel said unto the man, "These are not men of peace; for lo, they draw nigh to battle among themselves. I seek in vain for peace upon the earth, for it is not. All men are selfish, and peace they know not. Babylon prepares for battle, and the day of slaughter is nigh at hand. See that thou perish not in her destruction!"

The angel sighed, for he saw that the heart of the people of Babylon was set on war, though their lips talked of peace. Then he took farewell of the man and so departed. Yet there were some sons of Belial who contemplated stopping his way; but the angel smote them with blindness and so passed out of Babylon.—*The Bible Echo, Melbourne, Aus.*
