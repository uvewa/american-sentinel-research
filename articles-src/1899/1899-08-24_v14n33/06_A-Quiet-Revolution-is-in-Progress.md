ADDRESSING the readers of *The Defender*, a New England journal for promoting Sunday enforcement, Mr. John F. Cowan, associate editor of the *Christian Endeavor World*, tells what the Endeavor forces are doing to "conserve the Sabbath." "I might tell you," he says, "of the systematic, persistent work being done by some of the State and city unions for the Sabbath. Take one example—California—and multiply that in your minds by one hundred. Through the indefatigable labors of the superintendent of that department of work, scores of special Sabbath observance meetings were held, thousands of pieces of literature distributed, and hundreds of consciences touched."

"One of those quiet revolutions that beats no drum is going on."

Do you realize, reader, that a revolution is quietly going on, which when it is finished will give the support of public sentiment to the laws for Sunday enforcement? There is a great surprise in store for some people who, carelessly thinking that religious liberty is too secure in this land and age to be overthrown, are indifferent to the political and religious movements going on around them.
