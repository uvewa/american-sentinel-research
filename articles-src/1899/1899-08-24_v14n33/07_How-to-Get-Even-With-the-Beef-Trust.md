The beef trust has sharply advanced the price of meat, and a meat packer who is in a position to know the inside facts about the beef trust and its methods, has told the reason why the advance was made. In stating it we quote from a daily of this city:—

"There is no scarcity of cattle, he says, and hogs are selling at the Chicago stock yards at lower prices than they brought a year ago. But the American Meat Trust desires to control the British market and drive out Australian competition. To that end it is selling enormous quantities of meat in England at a loss, and it has decided to make the American people pay the loss. By shipping large quantities of meat to England it creates an appearance of scarcity here, and with that for excuse it has raised prices here from twenty to fifty per cent., so that its dividends may not be impaired by its losses abroad.

"As for the retailers, this packers' representative coolly says, they must protect themselves by advancing retail prices. As for the hungry people, the trust is not concerned about them."

We advise the "hungry people" to let the American Meat Trust keep its meat in its own hands. They will not suffer in the least if they do so, for there are other things than beef and hog to satisfy hunger. With the possible exception of some few invalids, nobody is dependent upon meat for bodily health and strength; while there is no doubt whatever that an individual runs far less risk of sickness by keeping out of his system the poisons that are generated in all animal bodies, to say nothing of such special diseases as tuberculosis, trichinosis, tape worm, etc.
