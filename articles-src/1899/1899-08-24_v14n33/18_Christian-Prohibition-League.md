A "CHRISTIAN Prohibition League" has been organized at Sioux Falls, S. D. Its motto is: "The church solid for prohibition; when the church says go, and votes no, then the saloon will go."—Neal Dow. The membership pledges its political support to a party that shall stand for prohibition in its platform.
