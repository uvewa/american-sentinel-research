The Chicago Times-Herald, in a recent issue, states what is necessary to be done by the Cubans in order to demonstrate, to the United States, their fitness for independence. If this is the view taken by the Government, there will be an occasion for Congress to explain the meaning of their resolution put forth at the beginning of the war, that "The people of Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free and independent." The Times-Herald says:—

"The Cubans must return to the pursuits of peace, and must patiently demonstrate their fitness for self-government. Having used our army and navy at tremendous cost to gain for the Cubans freedom from Spanish oppression, for which they had struggled for years without success, it is not to be expected that the United States would relinquish its control of Cuban affairs until its responsibility, as defined by Congress, shall have been fully discharged.

"The national responsibility in this instance includes the restoration of order, the establishment of a stable government, the development of industry, and the improvement of sanitary conditions to such an extent that the island shall no longer be a menace to the people of the Southern States.

"It may take many years to accomplish these results. In the meantime the Cuban natives who honestly desire independence can bring it more quickly by tilling the soil and by promoting the industrial development of the island than by holding mass meetings. Until the people show their fitness for self-government in this manner the United States will hold tight reins on Cuban affairs."

Affairs in the United States were in a condition bordering on chaos for several years after the close of the Revolutionary War, yet the American people of that day did not wish for or need the rule of a foreign power while order was being restored, and they were demonstrating their fitness for self-government. Give the Cubans a chance to restore order in the island themselves. That will be the quickest and best possible way of determining whether they have ability for self-government or not.

There is only a pretense of necessity for the continuation of American military rule in Cuba. The Cubans are entitled to the same chance to demonstrate their political capacity that Americans themselves had in 1783.
