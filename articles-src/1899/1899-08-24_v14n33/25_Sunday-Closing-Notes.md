All the saloonkeepers in La Salle, Ill., about fifty in number, were arrested on July 17, for Sunday opening.

For the first time in many years the saloons of Marshall, Tex., are closed on Sunday.

The clergy and "city fathers" of Asheville, N. C., are agitating the question of Sunday closing for all business places.

The Supreme Court of the State of Washington has just rendered a decision in which it held that keeping a saloon open on Sunday is a misdemeanor, even though no liquor is sold.

The W. C. T. U. of Wheaton, Ill., has presented a petition to the Golf Club of that place asking that the club house be closed hereafter on Sundays and that Sunday playing be discontinued. The petition was indorsed by vote in meetings of four churches and by two hundred citizens of Wheaton.
