Appreciating the evils of lynch law, Governor Candler, of Georgia, has issued to the people of that State an appeal for a united effort to suppress this baleful species of outlawry in their midst. In this appeal Governor Candler calls attention to truths which justify the most earnest and vigorous efforts toward the end in view; truths which cannot be too widely circulated among the people of this country. He says:—

"The purity of the fair mothers and daughters of Georgia must and shall be preserved, and at the same time the lives and liberties of all of the law-abiding negroes in Georgia must and shall be protected. Arson and burglary and assassination and robbery and rape must stop, and at the same time lynch law must stop. The good of both races and the fair name of the State demand this.

"The ordinary processes of the law are amply sufficient to punish all crimes. Our judges are pure and incorruptible. Our juries are composed of our most intelligent, upright men, who seldom make mistakes. The mob often makes mistakes and the innocent are made to suffer with the guilty. It never knows where to stop, but, after punishing the guilty, drunk with the blood of one victim, it thirsts for the blood of another, and often sacrifices on the altar of vengeance those who are guiltless of any crime.

"We must away with the mob. We must re-enthrone the law. We must restore the altar of reason and tear down the altar that passion has erected. We must do this in the interest of the white men of Georgia and in the interest of the negroes of Georgia, and for the fair name of Georgia, and to protect the virtue of the women of Georgia.

"Lynch law does not stop arson, nor murder, nor robbery, nor rape. This requires the strong power of the statute law, sustained by a healthy vigorous public sentiment.

"I would appeal to all officers of the State, civil and military, urging them to remember that the dignity and the fair name of Georgia are in their keeping. I would appeal to them to remember that they are guardians of the peace and happiness of the people of this State. It is their duty to apprehend and bring to justice all who violate the law, whether it be the negro who commits rape or the white man who kills him for the crime. The grand juries must realize that it is as much their duty to ferret out and return true bills against members of the mob who lynch a murderer as it is to return a true bill against the murderer himself.

"I would appeal especially to the bar to bring that potent influence which the members of the profession exercise in every community, to the aid of law and order, not only by discountenancing mob rule, but by aiding the courts and juries in bringing accused parties to speedy trial. It is the duty of a lawyer to see that his client has a fair and impartial trial, but he should not resort to mere technicalities and pretexts to defeat the ends of justice or even to delay the enforcement of penalties whereby society suffers and the confidence of the people in the ability of the courts to punish crime is destroyed.

"In bringing about this end I would invoke the active, earnest cooperation of all good men, white and black, with the officers of the law in their efforts to prevent crime, suppress mob violence, and bring criminals to justice, and to restore peace and order and tranquility to all of the people of every race, class, and condition."

In considering how far lynch law can be suppressed by an appeal of this nature, it is to be remembered that lynching is not wholly a product of ignorance; it is largely a result of moral degeneration. Knowledge is good; but knowledge is not power unless coupled in the mind with a purpose to put it into practical use. The people must have a desire to do right in the matter more than a desire to gratify hatred and the spirit of revenge, before they are prepared to profit by a knowledge of the proper principles of procedure and the reasons upon which they rest. We trust, however, that Governor Candler's appeal will result in strengthening lawful government in the State of Georgia.
