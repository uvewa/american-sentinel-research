THERE is to be no Parliament of Religions at the Paris Exposition as there was in Chicago. But there will be held a congress for the scientific study of religion, like that in Stockholm two years ago, but larger. It will treat religion purely from a social and historic point of view. The program is as follows: (1) Religions of the uncivilized races, as of America before Columbus; (2) Religions of the extreme Orient; (3) Religions of India, and (4) of Persia; (5) Semitic religions, including Egypt; (6) Religions of Greece and Rome; (7) Germanic, Scandinavian and Slavic religions; (8) Christian religions. The congress will meet the first week of September, 1900.
