FIGHTING the saloon under the banner of Sunday sacredness, is not a prosperous undertaking just now in Terre Haute, Ind. A "special" from that city to the Chicago Times-Herald says:—

"To-day [July 31] for the third time Rev. Fenwick Reed, the Methodist evangelist, and Rev. Mr. Shumaker of Mattox church lost a case in a jury trial, which they had brought against a saloon-keeper for keeping open on Sunday.

"The testimony was direct and unimpeached. The lawyers for the saloon-keeper treated the ministers and the hundred or more women they had brought from the churches in the north end to court with harsh language. The lawyers contended that there is nothing in the Bible about keeping the Sabbath [Sunday] holy, and when the women objected to this they were called Pharisees, etc. Then they hissed, and the lawyers called them geese and old hens. The hissing was redoubled, and the justice of the peace told the women they must stop.

"The jury was out only a few minutes. The Anti-Saloon League has been secretly organizing for some weeks, and has sent a committee to Governor Mount to complain of his police commissioners, but the action of the north end preachers was not inspired by the league."

Let the fight against intemperance be conducted on a purely temperance basis. When religion is brought into the controversy the saloon is strengthened, not weakened. The saloon can get sound arguments against the idea of Sunday sacredness and the necessity of Sunday enforcement; but it can get no sound argument for its existence on the simple ground of the public welfare. Friends of temperance, don't put sound arguments into the mouth of the saloon.
