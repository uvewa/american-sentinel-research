THE archbishop of Durango, Mexico, recently said of the Catholic Church in Catholic American countries: "The Catholic Church in Latin America does not wield the power it formerly did. All the governments there are against it. Despite continuous attacks, however, it has not lost one inch of ground with the people."

The archbishop convicts himself of error; for if the former of his statements be true, the latter cannot be correct. As an exchange observes, "It is obvious—without regard to abundant proofs in our possession—that if every government in Latin America were opposed to the Roman Catholic Church it would be impossible that it should not lose an inch of ground with the people. It must have lost many inches, or those governments never would have changed from not only willing allies but servile subjects of the Roman Catholic Church, into open opponents of the church; or if not open opponents, guarantors of religious freedom."

That all these governments are now opposing the papal church, is a plain matter of current history. The last stronghold of the papacy in Latin America—Ecuador—is throwing off the Roman shackles from the civil government. All these governments realize now that union with the papacy is no source of strength to them,—that the union of church and state does not strengthen the arms of the state, but paralyzes them. And this would be just as true if the church concerned in the union were any other than the Roman Catholic.
