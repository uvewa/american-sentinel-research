IN ROMAN CATHOLIC AUSTRIA the "Evangelical Party" is making a fight for religious liberty, but is meeting with opposition from the courts. A recent court decision against the Evangelicals is being utilized by their papal opponents to compel all children to receive the religious instruction of the church in which their parents were born; in other words, to be educated to become Roman Catholics.
