The Filipino "rebellion" appears to have been at last fully overcome by vigorous efforts that have of late been made by the American forces in Luzon, and this is pointed to by certain papers as a fact which throws ridicule upon the idea that the conquest of the island is not just and right. Such writers plainly show their adherence to the principle that "might makes right;" and the establishment of this principle in a nation marks the beginning of that nation's end.
