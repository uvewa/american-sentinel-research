# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, December 7, 1899 (v14n48)

## Article 17 — "Saving or Losing the Sabbath."
- **Location:** Scripture reference within article body
- **Issue:** The reference "Iss. 58:13, 14" appears in the OCR text. This is almost certainly a scan/OCR error for "Isa. 58:13, 14" (Isaiah).
- **Transcribed as:** "Iss. 58:13, 14" — preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR source.
- **Confidence:** HIGH that this is a scan artifact or OCR misread of "Isa." — but the transcription preserves the source text faithfully. The article itself refers to "My holy day" which matches Isaiah 58:13.

## Article 33 — "Nebraska Supreme Court" note
- **Location:** Near end of the quoted New York Sun item
- **Issue:** The text reads "the Federa Court" — OCR appears to have dropped the trailing "l" from "Federal."
- **Transcribed as:** "Federa Court" — preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR source.
- **Confidence:** HIGH that original reads "Federal Court" — but preserved as-is pending verification against original scan.

## General Notes
- The OCR source file contains image references (img-0.jpeg through img-8.jpeg) for advertisements and decorative elements on pages 13-16. These were advertisements for Pacific Press Publishing Co. books and the Post Fountain Pen, and have been omitted as they are not editorial or article content.
- Page headers (page numbers, running title "AMERICAN SENTINEL.") were not transcribed as article content.
- The "TO OUR PATRONS" section on page 13 and the subscription/address block on page 13 were treated as part of the masthead/publication info and not given separate article files.
- The "Foreign Mission Board" donation notice on page 13 was omitted as a subscription/promotional item, not an article.
