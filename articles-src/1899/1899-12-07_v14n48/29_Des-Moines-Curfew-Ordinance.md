THE city council of Des Moines, Iowa, has passed an ordinance which forbids "persons from walking on the streets after eleven P. M., unless they can show clearly that they are on legitimate errands;" also one imposing "a fine of $5 to $100 for making loud noises or disturbances of any kind." The account fails to state by what principle of free government an adult and sane individual can be bound to disclose his private business to the city after eleven o'clock P. M. It seems to have been overlooked, also, that some people, when they can invoke a law to gain their ends, are very easily "disturbed." A similar ordinance, by the way, was once declared unconstitutional and "dangerous" in California.
