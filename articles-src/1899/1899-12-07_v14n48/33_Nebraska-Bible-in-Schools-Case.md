THIS item is taken from the New York Sun:—

"LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 28.—The Nebraska Supreme Court is to be called upon to determine whether the Bible is a sectarian book within the definition of the State Constitution declaring that the public schools shall be non-sectarian. It is possible the squabble will be carried into the Federa Court.

"The case comes up from Gage County, where a public school teacher insists on reading a chapter from the Bible daily and leading the school in prayer before beginning the day's work. The Catholics and agnostics of the county object to the practise. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction was asked for an opinion and decided in favor of the Bible reading."
