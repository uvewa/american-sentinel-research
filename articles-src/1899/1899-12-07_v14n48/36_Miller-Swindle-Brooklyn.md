One of the most remarkable swindling transactions that has of late come to light was discovered and broken up recently by the city authorities of Brooklyn; the details of which have since filled columns in the New York dailies. The most remarkable thing about the swindle, moreover, was not the ingenuity or "nerve" of its visible head—a man named Miller—but the revelation of the fact that thousands of people in Greater New York and elsewhere were holding to the old delusion of getting "something for nothing," and paying out their money on the strength of it.

They were promised returns of ten, fifteen, or twenty per cent. weekly on the sums they might loan to the "syndicate," and the office of the concern was fairly besieged with throngs of people of all classes anxious to put their money where it would reap these abnormal returns. That the thing could not be honest, any intelligent person might know, and it must be supposed most of these people did know; but they took no trouble about that. "Something for nothing," was the one thought that overshadowed all others—even of regard for the rules of right and justice. The end to their dream of sudden wealth came when "Miller," finding the city authorities getting ready to act in the matter, suddenly disappeared, taking with him a million dollars more or less of the funds of his dupes, and could not be found either by the latter or by the police. It was a rude ending, as such dreams are wont to have.

Out of the discussion of this subject have come the following pertinent observations which are credited to that well-known figure in the business world, Mr. Chauncey Depew. Mr. Depew, it is stated, admitted having said that "all men and women are gamblers," and then proceeded to justify the statement to an interviewer by facts in his own experience:—

"Yes, I did say it, and, what is worse, it was the truth. My mail bears ample evidence of it. Letters are served up to me by the bushel-basketful from gamblers all over the country."

"But you're not running a"—
"No," interrupted the senator promptly; "but if I were I might be the richest man in America. Men, women, and fools send me letters daily asking for lists of the best places to put their money in order to double or treble it in a week. They don't want anything less than 100 per cent. investments, and few of them make the limit for waiting more than a fortnight."

"What kind of investments do they ask for?"

"Oh, they don't care anything about the means," said the doctor, smiling; "the end is the only thing they're interested in. The rest they leave all to me, offering to send on their money."

"And women?"

"Why, the women are worse than the men. They would not be satisfied with something for nothing; they want a whole lot for nothing. The fact that this is an impossibility, however, is a sort of knowledge that nearly always comes late in life, like gray hairs or wrinkles. Like these, however, it occasionally comes prematurely, but never with women. . . ."

"It isn't only in America, however, that this condition exists. It's everywhere. The whole human race are gamblers. They're all looking for something for nothing. The hardest workers among us are constantly on the qui vive for something we can get without having to work for it."

"In America the spirit of gambling amounts to a fever. It is more intense here because there are more instances of quick fortunes and lucky speculations."

"The country boy leaves his father's farm with his clothes in a bandanna, and ten or fifteen years later pops up in a big city with a fortune of millions. A lucky beggar starts in life with a couple of hundred dollars, invests it properly, works hard and finishes a capitalist. It's a terrible example."

[Mr. Depew glanced hopelessly toward his mail basket.]

"The lucky beggar and farmer boys are the cause of it all," he said, sighing. "They insist upon making themselves exceptions to the rule."

"What rule?"

"The rule that you can't win on a gamble. There's nothing in it. You can't get anything you don't work for. I never knew a gambler, a man who depended on luck and risks for his money, to die rich."

It is Christianity alone that offers the individual the opportunity to get something for nothing, with no possibility of failure. But the wealth it offers is that for which few are seeking.
