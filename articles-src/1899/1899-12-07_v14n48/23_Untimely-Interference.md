## "Untimely" Interference.

The predicament in which the man is placed who adheres to the principles of justice, as he conceives them, against the ideas of the majority or of the party in power in a nation, is pointed out by the Springfield Republican:—

"There has been an astonishing amount of 'treason' against the British government by eminent public men since the Boer war began. Mr. Chaplin, of the Cabinet, the other day warmly denounced a speech by Lord Spencer as 'unpatriotic,' because his lordship had seen fit to criticise the government for its Transvaal policy. It must have been this incident that inspired Lord Coleridge, in a speech somewhat later, to outline the desperate position of those who do not approve of the course of a government in leading a country into war. If, during the negotiations prior to war, he said, 'we dare to criticise those who carry them on we are told that we are interfering with the peaceful progress of those negotiations, and that we are thwarting a possible solution of the difficulty. If those negotiations result in war, and we say a word, we are told, "War in now in progress; your duty is if you are a patriot to support the executive." When the war is over and we come forward with our criticisms we shall no doubt be told they are belated.' (Laughter.) Lord Coleridge thus neatly stated the position not only of the opponents of the Transvaal war in England, but of the anti-imperialists in America.

"Before the Filipino war broke out they were told that in criticising the Spanish treaty, or opposing it, they were inviting war; when war came they were told that they could not be patriots unless they kept their criticism to themselves; and after the war they will be told that the incident is closed and there remains nothing to discuss."
