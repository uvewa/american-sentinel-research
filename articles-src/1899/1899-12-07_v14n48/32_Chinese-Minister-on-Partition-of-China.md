WHAT answer is to be made to the Chinese minister, when he says of the proposal that the powers make a treaty defining what to do with China?—

"What, can it be seriously proposed that a document shall be formally drawn up concerning interests in China and China shall not be a party to it? . . . It is as though a party of your neighbors met and agreed how they would occupy your house. One would take the front door, another would select the side doors; others would appropriate certain rooms. And all this without consulting you, the owner of the house."

"It's a great moral question." That's what one darkey said to another when asked in a raid on a hen roost if it were right to steal chickens. Then he added promptly: "Hand down anudder pullet."—Springfield Republican.

The several powerful "darkies" now at work in the Chinese "hen roost" are evidently of the same mind with this one.
