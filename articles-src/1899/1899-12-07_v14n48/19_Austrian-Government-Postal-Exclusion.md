THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT has excluded from the mails a correspondence card prepared by Austrian Protestants, bearing these words:—

"The Roman Catholic Church has poisoned Austria. If we had had the gospel during the past two hundred years we would be the leading people of Germany. Now there is nothing left us except our abilities in music and the Concordat."
