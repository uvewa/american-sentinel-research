THE British government has sent out an official notification that "a state of war" exists in South Africa. As the whole civilized world has known for weeks that severe battles were of almost daily occurrence between the British forces there and the forces of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic, this notification is altogether superfluous as news; yet it appears the nations are diplomatically bound to be ignorant of the most evident facts in such a case until officially notified of them by the government whose interests they particularly concern. International diplomatic law is a curious thing, and not altogether intended to serve the ends of justice.
