## "Higher Criticism" and Natural Rights.

"Philadelphia Journal."

Those who thoughtfully peruse and analyze the editorials being presented nowadays in the leading papers must be impressed with the change of spirit which has come over them in a comparatively short time, even in those professing to be ultra-American and republican.

For over a century we have subscribed to and affirmed each and every proposition of the Declaration of Independence and have accepted them as "self-evident truths." In short, it has been the creed of Americanism, and a test for the patriotism of each citizen. But recently this document, acknowledged to be the grandest ever penned by uninspired mortals, and which next to the Bible has been a light unto the nations of the earth, has become subject to a form of "higher criticism." Eminent public men and prominent newspapers suddenly imposed upon themselves the duty of "interpreting" and "explaining" its "self evident truths;" and like their contemporaries, the "higher(?) critics" of the Bible, when they have finished, what is left of either is not worth as much as the paper they are written upon. And they persist in this despite the fact that both interpret themselves. Shame on the patriotism of any American who finds it necessary to make apologies for the Declaration of Independence.

The fundamental principle, the very corner-stone of the Declaration of Independence, is found in the statement "that all men are created equal." It would be absurd for anyone to contend "that all men are created equal" physically, mentally, or in the social and temporal conditions in which they may chance to be born, nor is this what was meant, because the rest of the sentence tells wherein "all men are created equal." All men are equal because "they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Mark, it does not simply say that all Americans are created equal, but "all men," and this includes man wherever he may be found, whether

"In Greenland's icy mountains,
On India's coral strand,
Or beside Afric's sunny fountains."

And herein is affirmed the Brotherhood of man, as revealed by God the Father, through Jesus the Son.

But our "higher critics" would have us believe that only those men are equal who are "capable of self-government," forgetful of the fact that even the American Indians in their aboriginal state had a crude form of self-government—their chiefs were chosen from among the warriors around the council fire.

The other day a paper professing to be "Philadelphia's leading daily," made the assertion that "the theory that 'governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed' is not of universal application." If that be true, then the Declaration of Independence is founded on a wrong principle. Fortunately the statement is an unadulterated lie. One cannot deny this proposition of the Declaration of Independence without first destroying its basic principle, and then the whole document is easily denied and disproved.

Nor is this proposition a mere "theory" as our daily contemporary terms it, but a living, actual truth and reality, susceptible of proof. It is "to secure these (unalienable) rights" that "governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed," and unless all the rights of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" are fully secured the government is not a just one. Such we find in Russia, Turkey, China, and all absolute monarchies. Even these unjust governments exist by the "consent" or tolerance of the governed, and the strongest of them could not exist in the face of any dissent that was anywhere nearly unanimous.

Because the principle of self-government as set forth in the Declaration of Independence has not yet been universally applied is not proof that "it is not" capable "of universal application." But the application of the principle would necessitate the overthrow of the unjust governments, for "when any form of government becomes destructive of these ends [the securing of man's unalienable rights] it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundations on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness." Sounds revolutionary, does it not? And so it is! But it is in the document. And if ever the teachings of the "higher critics" predominate, our own rights may be so denied that it may some day become necessary to fight the Revolutionary War over again in order to issue anew the Declaration of Independence.

It behooves American citizens not to allow themselves to be led by a subsidized and capitalistic press, but to take time to read and think for themselves, and then be guided by the God-given light of conscience.
