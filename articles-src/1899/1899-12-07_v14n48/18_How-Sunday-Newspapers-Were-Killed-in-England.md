## How Sunday Newspapers Were Killed in England.

In the *Sunday School Times* of November 25, Mr. Henry S. Lunn, M. D., of London, England, tells "How Sunday Newspapers Were Killed in England." Dr. Lunn appears to have been foremost in the opposition to "seven-day journalism" in that country; and he intends shortly to come to America and take the lead in a great crusade that is being planned here, against the Sunday papers.

In the first place, he says, "I wrote to all the bishops of the Anglican church and to the heads of the Nonconformist communions, urging that they should take action immediately to combat this grave innovation." This they did; and "day by day the opposition gained strength, and the papers found themselves confronted by forces which had probably never worked in unison on any previous occasion.

"The bishops in the Upper House of Convocation passed a strong resolution deprecating this journalistic departure. The Nonconformists, represented by my friend, the Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, ex-president of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference, and by the Rev. Dr. Robertson Nicoll, the able editor of the *British Weekly*, were found in alliance with the 'left wing' of the Labor party, headed by that stalwart Radical, Mr. John Burns. The Institute of Journalists also denounced the new movement, and published some remarkable opinions of American journalists, showing the killing pressure under which the pressman in America works, owing to seven-day journalism."

Mr. Lunn withdrew his advertisements from the offending dailies (the *Mail and Telegraph*), and induced some other leading advertisers to do the same. Next he succeeded in organizing a "special committee" of opposition, with the Archbishop of Canterbury as president, and the Bishop of London, Cardinal Vaughan, Rabbi Adler, and other prominent men among its officers. A "special parliamentary committee" was also formed, to wait upon the Home Secretary and if possible induce him to take action in the matter. Of the visit of this delegation he says:—

"I have seldom been present at a more interesting gathering. The Bishop of London expressed the feelings of the Established Church against the movement; Mr. Price Hughes spoke for Nonconformity; Mr. John Burns, for labor; and Mr. Cohen, a well-known member of the Jewish community, for his own co-religionists.

"Mr. Burns's speech was, perhaps, the most interesting of all. He is a well-known agnostic, but he pleaded with passionate energy for the preservation of the Sunday, as a question of supreme value to the workman and his family.

"He poured well-merited scorn on the theory that any other day in the week would be an equivalent for the Sunday, impressing the Home Secretary with the fact that this is the only day in the week on which the father of the family with his wife and children can possibly meet together for that intercourse which is essential to the preservation of family life, on which our national prosperity depends."

Still other measures of opposition were being devised, when suddenly the Mail, not caring to face such opposition, announced that its Sunday issue would cease; and the Telegraph, a few days later, followed suit. The publishers, no doubt, came to the conclusion that a Sunday issue could not under such circumstances be made to pay.

It is worthy of note that the "most interesting" of the speeches made to the Home Secretary was that of John Burns, "a well-known agnostic." People who have opposed the Sunday laws in America as being unchristian and unamerican, have been scornfully classed with atheists by their religious opponents who were pushing forward such measures; but here is an instance where atheists and the friends of Sunday stand together. Sunday adherents do not object to standing with atheists when the latter will speak a word for Sunday rest.

The great trouble with the arguments of Mr. Burns and all the rest against allowing Sunday labor, is that the Almighty has legislated on the subject of Sabbath observance, and that His legislation has never been repeated, and is binding on all men to-day. Sabbath observance is therefore a duty owed to God, and in the sphere of duty toward God the civil authority has no rightful place. That is the sphere of conscience, and the conscience must be free. The inevitable result of civil authority in this sphere is an attempt to force the conscience, and all such attempts only represent religious tyranny and opposition to the purposes of God.
