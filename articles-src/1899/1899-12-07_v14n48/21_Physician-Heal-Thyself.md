## "Physician, Heal Thyself."

The following statements by Professor W. C. Wilkinson, of Chicago University, concerning the decay of Sunday as indicated by Sunday travel, were published nearly fifteen years ago, but are considered worthy of reproduction by *The Defender*, organ of the "Sabbath Protective League" of New England, in view of "the spread of this decay since that date." They make it very plain that the starting place of effective reform in Sunday observance must be within the church, rather than in the outside world:

"I do not now criticise anybody for failure in Sunday observance. I simply point out a fact. I think it is well that the fact should be faced by everybody concerned. And I believe that everybody is concerned. The fact is full of significance. It means nothing less than that the institution of 'Sunday' is fast going. The 'character' of the day is with us largely a mere tradition. The tradition fades daily. It is pale now to a degree.

"I cannot guess how serious the regret really is, and by what proportion of average good Christians shared, at this undeniable decay of Sunday observance. I am quite inclined to think that what regret exists is mostly official, or else a matter of mere tradition and convention. I judge so from the easy conscience with which ministers, for example, use the railroads on Sunday to go to and fro for preaching appointments, and from the apparently unconscious proneness of any chance Christians you may meet, for example, to take the train upon occasion of a Sunday morning from the suburbs to the city for the purpose of hearing a favorite voice sound out from the pulpit the doctrine of the creeds—preaching, it well might happen, on the text, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.' This freedom on the part of a flock is, of course, not to be wondered at. The shepherd himself—that eloquent preacher—will, perhaps, preach the same sermon, on the same text, the evening of the same day, to a congregation forty miles distant, reached, necessarily, at a cost to him of Sunday travel.

"There is no need to accumulate instances. I seriously propose a question: As long as the state of the case is what we all of us perfectly well know it to be respecting Sunday observance among Christians, is it, can it be, useful for us to talk piously against the Sunday newspapers, Sunday excursions, Sunday concerts, Sunday opening of places of amusement? . . . (Italics ours.)

"Sunday observance must be revived among Christians, or the institution is doomed. And the doom is ready even now presently to crack."
