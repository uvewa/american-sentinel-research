The Christian Statesman says, "There can be no Sabbath, for example, with true rest and refreshment for man's whole nature, body, mind, and spirit, without the acknowledgment of the moral obligation of the Sabbath, as such, and the authority of the Sabbath's Lord." In this the Statesman speaks for all those represented in the movement to secure legislation enforcing Sunday rest, of which it has been from the first the leading exponent.

It is perfectly plain, therefore, that the object this movement has in view is a religious one,—that the legislation sought is intended to enforce religion. Of what use would that legislation be otherwise, according to the facts here admitted. The Sunday law is called for to enforce "Sabbath rest;" but "There can be no Sabbath . . . with true rest and refreshment for man's whole nature, body, mind, and spirit, without the acknowledgment of the moral obligation of the Sabbath, as such, and the authority of the Sabbath's Lord." Of what use, then, will the Sunday law be unless it in some way promotes the "acknowledgment of the moral obligation" of Sunday, and "the authority of the Sabbath's Lord?"

The organizations for whom the Statesman speaks in calling for Sunday laws, aim to secure this "true rest" for man's "whole nature" on Sunday, for all the people. That is the only kind of Sunday rest they have in view,—the only kind they think is worth anything; for they are composed, in the main, of deeply-religious people. Why are they working to secure Sunday laws, if such laws are not designed to secure this rest?

The Sabbath rest is a religious rest; that is true. The Sabbath is a religious institution, established by the Creator to serve a religious purpose. The Statesman party recognize this truth, though they adhere to the wrong day. And in calling for Sunday legislation, they confess a purpose to enforce religious rest.
