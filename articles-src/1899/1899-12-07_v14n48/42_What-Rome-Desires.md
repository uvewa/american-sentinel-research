# What Rome Desires.

From certain demands recently made by the clerical party in Spain, and from certain statements recently uttered by the leading Catholic organ of the world, the *Osservatore Romano*, certain desires and aims of the papacy which are of decided interest to all non-Romanists are made too plain to be overlooked or denied. On this point we note the following in *The Outlook*:

"At the recent Catholic Congress at Burgos [Spain], the longing for a restoration of temporal power was unblushingly shown. The prelates there assembled drew up a pronunciamento in which they demanded that no text-books but those approved by the bishops should be used in the universities, and that public instruction throughout the kingdom should be Catholic. They declared that no ecclesiastic should be punished by the ordinary civil courts of justice, and that none should pay taxes. Furthermore, they demanded exemption from military service for all seminarists under twenty-seven years of age, and for all priests; and lastly, they had the assurance to ask that all associations not Catholic should be prohibited.

"The desire for temporal power is shown, not only by the Roman Catholic prelates and journals of Italy, Spain, and France, but even by that official journal of the whole church, the *Osservatore Romano*. This paper, publishing daily official notices from Leo XIII. and his secretaries, papal documents, and important communications on ecclesiastical affairs, has deservedly great weight with all Romanists. It declares that in the present conflict between two 'heretical' powers there is to be no overthrow of Romanism in Manila; in South Africa it sees some chance for the Roman Church. It asks: 'Can it be that this war is providential? Will Protestantism be exhausted by it? Has the period of the great transformation of the world begun, when the church will accomplish a new conversion of the Gentiles? Let us have courage, determination, and faith in God, who is ever the God of armies.'"

If it is true, as this official organ of Leo XIII. and his prelates in Rome declares, that there is to be no overthrow of Romanism in Manila, then there is to be no separation of church and state in Manila; for there is an overthrow of Romanism wherever a long-established union of church and state is broken up. We fear the *Osservatore Romano* knows whereof it speaks upon this point.

The United States is referred to as an "heretical" power, which indeed it is, from the papal point of view. But why does the pope profess so much friendship (as he now does) for this heretical power?

It would be a providential thing in the Roman view if war were to break out between all the Protestant nations and rage until they had devoured each other, and Protestantism had thereby become exhausted.
