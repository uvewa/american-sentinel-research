A CITIZEN of Alabama who has long been particularly prominent as a politician and member of Congress, gave utterance in a recent speech to the following:—

"I favor taking the suffrage entirely away from the negro. I have never felt that the Anglo-Saxon blood can ever be pacified, can ever be satisfied when an inferior race, the most inferior, I am sorry to say, that God ever made, has been lifted up by the tyranny of the Government of the United States and placed on a political equality with yourselves and myself. I am not satisfied or content, nor will I be until this great crime is righted."

AND THE INDEPENDENT, which severely condemns this utterance, remarks that this same man is "correct" in his "position on [favoring] expansion." Quite naturally.
