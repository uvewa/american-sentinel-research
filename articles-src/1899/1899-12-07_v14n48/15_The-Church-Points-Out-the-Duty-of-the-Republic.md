## The Church Points Out the "Duty" of the Republic.

### "SHALL WE TAKE FUHKIEN PROVINCE?"

*"Springfield Republican" (Mass.).*

A MISSIONARY writes a timely article in the last number of the Northwestern Christian Advocate on "America and China's 'Probable Partition.'" His ideas are worth serious consideration, since they are not unlikely to be adopted by the present Government of the United States, in case a partition of the empire seems the order of the day. Mr. Brewster starts with the assumption that China cannot be held together, which is not considered unreasonable by many careful students of the question. "Has America nothing to do in this crisis?" asks the writer. He thinks she has. The logic of his position is clearly stated:

"Aside from the commercial question, we who believe that there is a Providence at work in the lives of nations, as well as of individuals, can hardly fail to see that the events of the memorable year 1898, which made America a world power, instead of merely the leading state of the western hemisphere, put responsibilities upon her in the event of the partition of China that cannot be ignored without national guilt."

From Mr. Brewster's viewpoint, it is plain sailing. If the United States was under moral obligations to establish permanently its power and rule in the Philippines, it would be a national crime not to take the next logical step. As he says at another point in the same article:

"This coast is but 500 miles from the scene of Dewey's victory. One more step and the Pacific will be crossed. It is a step that Providence is urging by every move in the march of events . . . The Stars and Stripes cannot stop in mid-ocean or off the coast of Asia. Their protecting folds must be thrown over a part at least of the long-suffering 'brothers in yellow.'"

The only question remaining is the "slice." Where shall America carve out her section? On this point Mr. Brewster, being personally acquainted with China, may speak perhaps as an expert. Rapidly surveying the coast line of China, already well pre-empted, he lays his missionary finger upon the Fuhkien province, between Chekian on the north and Kuangtung on the south, with the island of Formosa lying off its coast. This "is one of the most valuable parts of the whole empire. France will want it. But England and Germany will certainly object to allowing their traditional national enemy to have more than one-third of the entire coast line, as this additional province would give them." Japan, too, will want it, since Japan already has Formosa, and "Japan knows how valuable this province is, with the enormous output of its great lumber product, and its untold undeveloped mineral wealth of coal, iron, silver, lead, and probably other minerals."

Now it would be a great calamity if Japan should get Fuhkien province. It is very clear that God wishes another disposition to be made. "The Chinese both hate and despise the Japanese. These 20,000,000 of people would not submit to becoming Japanese subjects without a long and bloody struggle. The new regime could never become one that the Chinese would enjoy. It would not tend to develop the people in civilization or morals. The Japanese have a thin veneer of western civilization but scantily covering the heathen morals and spirit. Their rule would be a curse rather than a blessing."

But if the United States should secure Fuhkien province—ah! how different! "Twenty millions of our fellowmen will be saved from long anarchy and misrule under the Japanese, a people not yet ready to assume such a task. The people would readily submit to American rule. It would be welcomed by the great majority." And the writer says this "in spite of the sad Hua-sang massacre" in which the Chinese displayed such love of the western missionaries. Finally, one reads:

"If this province should come under the beneficent rule of America, idolatry would be speedily overthrown. Such triumphs of the cross would be witnessed as the world has seldom if ever seen. The soil is prepared, the church is ready, the people are ready—will Christian America see its opportunity and accept its responsibility in this great crisis, or will it allow these 20,000,000 souls to be handed over to the tender mercies of heathen Japan?"

If the partition of China is inevitable, our imperialist friends now have no alternative save to take those 20,000,000 Chinamen and the Fuhkien province, or some other province, to their bosoms. This missionary advocate of God and five per cent. is simply leading the way. He speaks out what responsible statesmen scarcely dare as yet to hint at.
