The Government proposes to establish non-sectarian public schools in Porto Rico and Cuba; at which several Catholic journals have taken offense and spoken their sentiments in the matter accordingly. Says one:—

"Could a more monstrous wrong, a more outrageous injustice than the imposition of such schools upon Catholic Cuba and Porto Rico be imagined! And what makes the matter all the more shameful is the fact that it is under the instructions and by the orders of the Government of this country that this wrong and this injustice are to be done."

And the Catholic journals which speak thus are published not in South America, but in the United States.
