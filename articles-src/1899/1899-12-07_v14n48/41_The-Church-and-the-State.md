# The Church and the State.

One of the signs telling of the last days is that professed Christians will have "a form of godliness," while "denying the power thereof." 2 Tim. 3:1-5. As illustrating this, note the following spoken by Rev. Cyrus F. Wixon, in an address to the Chautauqua circle of the Trinity-Methodist Church:

"Justice to humanity demands that in order to obliterate a hereditary source of crime the individual must die. . . . I would chloroform these confirmed criminals. . . . In death by chloroform there is no pain, nothing revolting."

The editor of the *New York Journal*, commenting on Wixon's theory, said:

"Thus the Rev. Mr. Wixon, a Christian minister, serving Him who said, 'Thou shalt not kill,' would reform the world by making it a shambles. . . . If the Wixon law were put into effect its author should tag each soul of the 100,000 souls which he would free with an explanatory prayer to this effect: 'We hereby return this poor soul to its Maker as unsatisfactory. We hope that in future He will be pleased to furnish mankind with souls of better quality.'"

Apropos of this the following letter was written to the Journal:

"Editor of the New York Journal:

"The Scriptural reply to Rev. Wixon's unchristian method of exterminating criminals should be the same as the answer Christ made to the Sadducees: 'Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.' If the gospel of Christ has not enough of the power of God in it, when acting in harmony with the Divine will, to transform the veriest wretch, who is a sinner both by hereditary weaknesses and by acquired transgressions, to the image of his Maker, it falls short of its teachings. The power of salvation is exactly what the ministry ought to make known to the laity. If by precept and by example the preacher is not a living exponent of this power, possibly some other calling would be more in consonance with his pretensions."
