## Universalists and Sunday Keeping.

At the Biennial Session of the Universalist General Convention, held in the city of Boston, Oct. 18-25, 1899, the following resolution was unanimously adopted:—

"Resolved, That the Universalist Church in convention assembled records its conviction that the secularization of Sunday is a grave threat to the religious, social and industrial welfare of the country; and expresses its hearty sympathy with the aim and efforts of all those organizations and individuals who are striving to convince the people of the need of safeguarding by care and custom, which is stronger than law, a Sunday which shall give to as many as possible in every community the right to rest and the privilege to worship, both of which are taken away by the increasing attention to business and pleasure."—The Defender.
