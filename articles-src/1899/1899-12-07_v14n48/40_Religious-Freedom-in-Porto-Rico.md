## Religious Freedom in Porto Rico.

A friend in Porto Rico has sent us a copy of a San Juan paper dated November 12, in which appears a letter from a citizen of Guayama, calling attention to the religious intolerance which still prevails there under the papal regime, in the matter of burials in the public cemeteries. It has become necessary, the writer says, to enlarge the cemetery of Guayama, and for this purpose funds are necessary which must be collected from the public. He adds:—

"Nobody is willing to give money for a cemetery, afterwards to be placed under the control of a particular religious denomination which may refuse him interment when dead.

"This intervention, by religious bodies, during the Spanish regime was justified; under the flag of the United States of America, there is no excuse for it. The cemeteries all over the island have been constructed by the respective municipalities; the municipalities pay for the employees that look after the cemeteries, sell the vaults, and pay for the keeping of the grounds. Why then should the Catholic priests have anything to say in the matter? Only for denying the right to be buried there of someone who at the moment of death would not be considered by them a genuine Catholic. They do not care even when the tomb has already been paid for or whether the family has expended a large amount in the building of a costly monument. The dead one is not allowed to occupy the place that the loving folks have selected for him, if he happens to be a Mason, a Protestant, if he died without communion, or was killed in a duel, or if he committed suicide, or if he was excommunicated for not believing in some chapter in the Catholic faith. In fact, there are many reasons by which interment may be refused. We could cite many instances; but what is the use? They are well known all over the island.

"This state of affairs should cease, and can legally be made to cease. The declaration made by General Brooke on taking possession of this island, in the name of the United States of America, states that all laws and customs, not opposed to the fundamental principles of the United States laws, would be respected. Is it not opposed to those laws when an officer not appointed by the American Government, not elected by the people, nor by the municipality, is allowed to control public property, as the Catholic priests do the cemeteries?"

The writer adds that he does "not doubt that the Government will put an end to this nonsense." It certainly will if it carries into effect the principles for which it professes to stand.
