## Saving or Losing the Sabbath.

[A SURE evidence of the human and altogether earthly character of the first-day sabbath, is the fact that its adherents are constantly appealing to human authority and earthly power for its support. With reference to this subject an exchange prints the following:—]

A contributor to the *Christian Guardian* presents, as "a question of vital interest, of prime importance," the problem, "Shall we save or lose our Christian Sabbath?" By "our Christian Sabbath" he means the Sunday institution. The very fact of his concern as to whether it will be saved or lost is evidence that he refers to a man-made institution. There never was, and never can be any question as to the permanence and stability of the Lord's Sabbath. The Lord sanctified the seventh-day Sabbath in the beginning (Gen. 2:2, 3), and has written it in his law (Ex. 20:8-11), as a holy day—"My holy day" (Iss. 58:13, 14). And this law is not to be changed in as much as "one jot or one tittle" while heaven and earth stand (Matt. 5:17-19); moreover it will be a permanent institution in the new earth (Isa. 66:22, 23).

That the Sunday-sabbath, which its adherents are pleased to call "our Christian Sabbath," is not the Lord's Sabbath, nor at all of the Lord, is shown in the entire silence of the Scriptures upon the subject. "Who hath required this at your hands?" Surely not the Lord. Then it must be of man, a work of supererogation. In further support of this position we have the fact that Sunday-sabbath advocates are constantly appealing to human authority for its preservation and enforcement. In the article to which reference has been made we find this urgent statement:—

"Steps should be taken to make and enforce strong representations to parliaments and governments and to bring pressure, connectionally and otherwise, to bear upon them in behalf of Sabbath laws and administration. There should be organizations upon the circuits. Meetings should be held and money raised in the interests of the campaign."

Now the Lord disposes of all man-made institutions, in his own good time, in this way: "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up." Matt. 15:13 All the Sunday-law agitations, and all the Sunday-law persecutions, and all the pleas for human protection of the Sunday institution, merely emphasize the fact that it is "of men," and "it will come to naught" (Acts 5:38, 39); for "every one of us shall give account of himself [not to the civil government, but] to God." Rom. 14:12. When we come into the judgment of God to give account of our Sabbath-keeping, the law of God and not of man will be the standard. "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man." Eccl. 12:13. The one who keeps the commandments of God will have sufficient discernment to understand the limit of his obligation to human law; for the Scripture makes it very plain that "we ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29.

These considerations ought to convince any believer in God's Word where he ought to stand on this "question of vital interest, of prime importance." The Lord will preserve his own Sabbath without human legislation; yea, rather, in spite of it. No one need to worry about losing the Lord's Sabbath; that is fixed forever. The concern of each individual should be, to remember it and observe it—in letter and in spirit. This is the point concerning the Sabbath for which account will have to be rendered to God.
