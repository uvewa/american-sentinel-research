"SUNDAY politics," says The Defender, "will eventually hang itself if rope enough be given it." We hope so. The Defender refers to political electioneering on Sunday; but we refer to the far more prominent form of "Sunday politics" which seeks so persistently to bring Sunday as a Sabbath day up for consideration in Congress and the State legislatures.
