IN a recent speech at Leicester, England, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, in referring to England and the United States, spoke of "the union, the alliance if you please, the understanding, between these two great nations." He said this "is a guarantee of the peace of the world," and in the same connection intimated that the vengeance of the alliance might be felt by the French "if they do not mend their ways." Evidently this "Alliance" is a substantial thing, notwithstanding that much has been said in this country to the contrary.
