## Misapplied Zeal.

*South African "Sentinel."*

SAUL of Tarsus was a most enthusiastic religionist; he was so extremely religious in his way, that he had no place in his heart for the religion of Christ. His zeal prompted him to compel others to do as he did, under severe penalties. But remember this was before he knew Jesus of Nazareth. When he became acquainted with him, as he did on his missionary tour to Damascus, he gave up the worship of himself and his own religion, and accepted the religion of Christ. Never was a more perfect revolution wrought in any man's life, than that which so quickly transformed the chief of sinners to the chief of the apostles. How quickly he lost the spirit of persecution! When he had himself experienced the liberty there is in Christ, he wished that every one might enjoy the same liberty. This liberty he preached; and in none of the writings of the New Testament do we find the principles of religious liberty more clearly set forth than in the teachings of the Apostle Paul.

How any man who reads the Bible, and has become acquainted with its Author can favor a union of religion with politics, is unexplainable. Those who are to-day so anxious to enforce religion, would do well to renew their acquaintance with Christ.
