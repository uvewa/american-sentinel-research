"WITHOUT a civil Sabbath, a religious Sabbath is impossible," says the *Ram's Horn*. Then the "civil Sabbath" must have something to do with religion, and the object of preserving the one must be to save the other.

But the Sabbath commandment says nothing about a "civil" Sabbath, and the Author of that commandment and of the Sabbath says that a religious Sabbath, for any person, depends only upon whether he will turn his own foot away from the Sabbath and will cease doing his own pleasure on "My holy day." Isa. 58:13, 14. And is not that the truth?
