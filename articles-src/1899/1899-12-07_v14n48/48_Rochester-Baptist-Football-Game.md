The pastor of the Second Baptist Church of Rochester, N. Y., does not believe that games ought to be allowed which might draw people away from church services, even on other days than Sunday. There was to be in his church, on Thanksgiving day, a union service of the Baptist churches of the city; and on the other hand, the university located there had arranged with another college for a Thanksgiving-day game of football. There was a clash of religious and secular enterprises, and the aggrieved pastor said to his congregation:—

"I am very sorry that our University of Rochester has advertised for next Thursday forenoon, as a kind of religious service, a football game with another college. I must say positively that I sincerely deplore such a course of action as that. I must also express a hope that not one of you here present will attend the game. If it were to be held in the afternoon, it might not be quite so bad, but the idea of running football contests in rivalry with religious services on that day should be discouraged by the community generally."

This indicates progress; but in what direction?
