# A Soldier's View of It.

*Philippine Correspondence of "Washington Post."*

The benefits to be derived by the United States in conquering this island seem small in comparison to the deaths and hardships endured by the troops. There are no tracts of land to be taken up; there is no opening for the laborer or mechanic. Every available acre of ground is tilled, and in buildings suitable for this climate the native is far superior, for nothing seems impossible to him with a bolo and bamboo. Of course, the moneyed man has great prospects before him in investments, but for the brawn and muscle of America's sons that are enduring the torrid sun and marching through vapors of malaria and typhoid fever, the bright vision ever before them is to have their enlistment of three years end, and if their lives are spared, to once more set foot on the soil of their fathers, and build up shattered and broken down constitutions and obliterate entirely from their minds a place called the Philippine Islands.

THERE are 100,000 people in the Sulu group. There are more than 1,500,000 Tagals. If it be wrong to interfere with slavery and polygamy in the Sulu Islands merely because such action will lead to war, although those institutions are in defiance of American laws, is it not far worse to attempt to deprive the Tagals of the right to self-government, although it is plain that this attempt is far more costly than a movement against the Sulus? This is the very point of the whole matter. It is a point which President Schurman apparently evades or ignores. Yet it is a point which is stirring up a good many Americans to-day. The armies of the United States are being used to conquer the Tagals, while the sultan of Sulu with his Mohammedan empire of slavery and polygamy is officially acknowledged, and he receives pay as an American official.—Boston Advertiser.
