It is a very suggestive article which we print this week from the *Springfield Republican*, in which the church, the state, and "destiny" are linked together in a great "missionary" enterprise. See p. 755. It is worthy of note that a spokesman of the church "speaks out" and advocates in a leading church paper "what responsible statesmen scarcely dare as yet to hint at."
