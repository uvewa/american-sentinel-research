"It is rumored," says the Catholic Mirror, "that the pope will establish an Apostolic Delegation in Berlin, the only capital in Central Europe where the Holy See is not represented. The Prussian government keeps a legation in Rome, and a papal delegation would be equivalent to a legation, but it is likely that an inter-nunciature will rather be established."

And the pope will not rest until he has an accredited representative at the seat of government of every powerful nation in the world.
