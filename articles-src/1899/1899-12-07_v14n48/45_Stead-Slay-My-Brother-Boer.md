Mr. W. T. STEAD, the English journalist, has written and circulated a pamphlet entitled, "Shall I Slay My Brother Boer?" and according to report, "is shocked" at the answers received from the English clergy. "One godly parson replies, 'Yes; and be quick about it.'" But what else could a really "patriotic" clergyman say?
