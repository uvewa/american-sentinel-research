The methods of the Steel Trust in the United States and their effect upon one of the greatest, if not the chief, of the country's industries, are described by a daily of this city as follows:—

"From their monopoly of mines they dig barely enough ore to feed their monopoly of mills. It would be a useless expenditure for any capitalist to start an iron mill in opposition without means of procuring pig iron to keep it going. Such an investment would mean ruin.

"There would be no scarcity of mills and no scarcity of iron production were it not for the control of the iron output by the trust. Active competition would hold prices at their proper level, as well as equalize the supply and demand.

"It is known that the profits of the trust are fully 100 per cent. In six months they have increased the price of Bessemer pig iron from $9.87 to $18.51, and the price of steel billets from $14.93 to $30.10.

"At 100 per cent. profit the limited number of mills allowed by the trust are running twenty-four hours daily.

"There are mountains of almost pure iron ore in Missouri and Arkansas. There are millions of tons of the finest ore in the Superior region. There is a fabulous amount of ore in Cuba, but all of it from Lake Superior to Santiago is controlled by the trust, and in order to maintain prices it is fed to the world's consumers in homeopathic doses, through homeopathic mills.

"It is true that our iron trade has grown enormously since the war with Spain, but it is also true that the ravenous trust, instead of adequately increasing the output of ore and the milling capacity, has kept things going at the old gait at a heavy increase in prices.

"This is the true trust principle—the principle of cornering a commodity and making the public pay for it."
