THE pope expressed to Admiral Dewey's chaplain the hope "that the Philippines will again acquire prosperity under the protection of the United States." Why that word "again"? Were the islands prosperous under Spanish domination? So the pope implies. But the Filipinos hope for a very different kind of prosperity.

THE general testimony of the soldiers who have returned from the Philippines, is that the islands are not worth fighting for; and that under the present management at least, a long and very costly war will be necessary to bring them under American domination. And as the truth that the islands are comparatively worthless comes more clearly into view, it becomes more apparent also that the real object in view in this incursion into Asiatic territory, is a participation in the division of the spoils of the great Asiatic continent. And verily, the spoils of that vast realm will not be peacefully divided among the spoilers.

In an interview with the Catholic chaplain of Admiral Dewey's flagship, the pope manifested great interest in the Philippine situation, and expressed an intention of opening negotiations with the United States Government, with a view to regulating the position of Catholics in the Philippines.

There has been nothing to indicate that the position of Catholics in the Philippines needs regulating, and under American sovereignty Catholics in that country may be sure of enjoying all their rights as they do in the United States. But while the cause for such concern in the Philippines, if there be one, is obscure, one thing is clear; viz., that the pontiff is ready to seize upon any excuse and improve every opportunity for opening negotiations with the United States Government. Gradually but surely the papacy is advancing to a position of official standing with this Republic.
