READ what is said on another page about the work being done in South Carolina to develop public sentiment favorable to the enforcement of Sunday. This is a part of the campaign of education that is being conducted all over the land by the advocates of Sunday laws, and which is fast molding public sentiment into harmony with their ideas. Never before was such a campaign in progress in this land. Never before, therefore, did religious despotism in this form menace the country as it does today. But what is being done to educate the people on the "other side" of this question—the side of truth and justice? What are you doing to this end?—Anything?
