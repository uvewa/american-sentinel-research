An exchange observes: "Some men are well satisfied with the habitations, prospects, and employments that this world affords. But there are those who 'desire a better country.' To such earthly things must occupy a secondary place. 'Strangers and pilgrims' are the names by which God would describe his people while they wait below. It is folly, then, for the Christian to regard this world as his home. Its politics and ambitions are things that change with the day. Oh, that the followers of the Master might learn to look for that which is eternal—the city 'whose builder and maker is God.' "
