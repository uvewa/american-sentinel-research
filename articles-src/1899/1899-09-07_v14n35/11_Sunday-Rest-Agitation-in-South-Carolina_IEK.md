It has been my privilege of late to listen to a lecture given in the interests of Sunday rest, and for the enforcement of Sunday laws.

The lecturer, Edw. Thompson, LL. D., is a leading man in the "Sunday League of America," and is to give, under the auspices of that League, thirty-five lectures in this State. He is a pleasant speaker, a lawyer-preacher, and is of course received with open arms by most of the pastors, and heartily welcomed into their pulpits.

I listened to his lectures at Summerville, S. C., given in the M. E. church, Aug. 29. The weather was somewhat rainy, and so comparatively few were in attendance. He, however, made a fair beginning here, promising a return to complete an organization.

The lecturer began by citing the first general order of George Washington given to the army in '76, requiring a release from Sunday toil; he then ran rapidly over the Constitution of the United States, pointing out that the President is not required to attend to legislation on that day; and that in the call for the assembly of Congress Sunday is recognized, and its recognition has extended out into all the ramifications of our laws. He then drew the conclusion that every man should have the right to keep Sunday guaranteed to him as well as it is to the President.

He cited the conditions in Mexico, where no Sunday laws exist; showing the horrible "profanation" of the day,—how all stores are kept open and the day is given to dancing, shows, horse racing, and bull-fights. Toilers groan there seven days in the week, he said.

So it is in France; even all elections are held, and must be held, on Sunday, whether local or national. Then the spectacles of the theaters and the shows come principally upon that day. He drew a very strong contrast between the citizens of Paris and of London, and inquired whether we should admit all peoples and all such customs to come among us. Shall we, in fine, maintain the Anglo-Saxon Sunday rest?

He gave figures to show that Sunday labor had increased fifty-six per cent. amongst us in the last six years and sought to show that it is uncalled for and moreover will bring ruin to the Republic.

When China stretched a wall along her northern boundary to keep out the foreigners and maintained her antipathy against all foreign customs, she stood firmly for ages; now she totters to her fall. So when Rome maintained distinct Romanism, she stood firmly; but when she admitted all nations and customs, she soon lost all. So if we do not maintain our Anglo Saxon traditions we shall fail.

He showed the Sunday newspaper to be unnecessary and how the two Sunday papers lately started in London could not exist in that city. Sunday trains were likewise shown to be unnecessary, also Sunday mails, and not patronized by the best and busiest men.

He said nothing about the enforcement of Sunday rest by statute law. The League seems to be working in a peculiarly taking way. The fact that Sunday is slipping back into its native holidayism is strongly set forth. The speaker touched upon the law of the fourth commandment of the decalogue, emphasizing with much force, the thought couched in the word, "remember." But the readers of the SENTINEL know that that law has reference to another day to be kept for a different reason than that assigned for first day keeping.

The leaders in this work say little or nothing at first about legal enforcement of the day, but bring in their literature at once to explain this. They have a series of leaflets, four hundred pages of which are given for a dollar, and this purchase also entitles one to a life membership certificate as a member of the League.

This work seems to be moving forward very rapidly in every State. Catholics are ranging themselves with Protestant divines in getting this reading into the homes of the people. They are arranging committees in all churches where even a few will take up the work, and the committees have printed instructions sent them. So all work harmoniously to the one end of saving the Sunday institution.

To those who will pay five dollars for the literature, five certificates are given, to give to whomsoever the donor chooses; and a cyclopedia of instruction containing 687 pages is superadded. They have laid their plans to carry their work into all towns of more than a thousand inhabitants before the century shall close. More than one hundred workers are engaged directly in the work, and a large majority of those who are unacquainted with the real nature of the work will aid them among the clergy and the people.

What will be the ultimate end of the work of these modern agitators of a state religion? None but the student of prophecy now know. The bishops of the times of Cyprian and Augustine wrought no more earnestly for Sunday laws than these men of to-day are doing. But those bishops, by encouraging religious legislation, brought about an age of dark superstition and blood, when to obey God at the expense of disobeying the ruler of the state church, brought down their lives to martyrs' graves. Cruel, indeed, were those times! And shall we resurrect the monster that wrought such evil? Shall we give life to another such religio-political power? Then will we see modern martyrs. Yea, we are seeing them.

This work should be opposed by every possible upright means. I distributed leaflets to the congregation who listened to the above lecture, showing the nature of their work, and shall continue to oppose it in this State.
