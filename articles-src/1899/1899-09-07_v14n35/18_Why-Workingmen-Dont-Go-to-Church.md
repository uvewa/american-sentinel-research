AN Indianapolis pastor, in his anxiety to discover the reason why workingmen don't go to church, disguised himself as a day laborer and went to work at a job of unloading railroad iron. He discovered, the report says, that the workingman was too tired after his day's work to attend church in the evening, but did not solve the problem of his absence from church on Sunday.

This was an unnecessary trouble on the pastor's part so far as obtaining new light on the question was concerned. There are two general causes which operate to keep people away from church. First, there is often something the matter with the church; and second, Christianity is contrary to human nature. The first cause can be removed by those in the church; the second can be removed only by the power of God. It is the business of the pastor and others interested in the salvation of mankind, to see that the church stands in the right attitude before the world; that it is giving the message of God to the world, and not some other message. The fact that workingmen get tired is not one which will account for their refusal of the gospel; for it is the mission of Christ to give rest to the weary, to "undo the heavy burdens," to bring "deliverance to the captives," to set all men free.

And as the power of God to convert the soul is as great to day as ever, there is no escaping the conclusion that the reason the church congregations are not larger is that there is something the matter with the church.
