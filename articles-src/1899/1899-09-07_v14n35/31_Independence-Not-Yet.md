A press dispatch from Washington, D. C., dated the 28th inst., says that the President's proclamation for taking the Cuban census is not to be construed as a promise of speedy independence for the Cubans.

"It was authoritatively stated at the War Department that there was nothing in the proclamation leading to the conclusion that it was the intention of the Government to give immediate independence to Cuba. It is the intention of the Government to follow the census with municipal elections and the inauguration of home rule in those localities where the people are fitted for it, but beyond this the general scheme will not be carried.

"It will be the first of next year before the full results of the census will be known, and those who are in a position to know assert it will be long after that before the President will be willing to turn the government of the island over to the natives and withdraw the American troops and American supervision of the island. It has been intimated that in some quarters that absolute home rule and independence will not be given to Cuba until the trial in the large cities has been given a thorough test."
