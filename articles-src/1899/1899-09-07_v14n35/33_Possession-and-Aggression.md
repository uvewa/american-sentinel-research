In a speech at Pittsburg, on the occasion of the return of Pennsylvania troops from the Philippines, the chief exponent and defender of imperialism said:—

"Until the treaty [with Spain] was ratified we had no authority beyond Manila city, bay and harbor. We then had no other title to defend, no authority beyond that to maintain. Spain was still in possession of the remainder of the Archipelago."

Then what were the insurgents in possession of? As a matter of fact, it is well known that Spain held almost nothing in the island of Luzon beyond the city and harbor of Manila when the fleet of Admiral Dewey entered Manila Bay. With one or two slight exceptions, no Spanish forces have been heard of in the islands excepting those in and around Manila.

The same speaker said that the "first blow was struck by the insurgents," that the latter were the aggressors, etc. Suppose, then, that a European ruler should issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to submit to the rule of his government, to be benevolently assimilated into his empire, and should send here an armed force to enforce it. Would that be construed by Americans as an act of aggression? and would they become the aggressors in resisting it?

Who can answer these questions and justify the national policy in Asia?
