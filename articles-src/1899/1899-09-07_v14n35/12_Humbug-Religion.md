"Some students one day disjointed ten or a dozen bugs of different kinds," says Dr. Munhall, "and then artistically constructed one bug out of parts of all the others. The professor of natural history in the university was old and quite near-sighted. They placed their bug on a table, and, calling him in, said: 'Professor, we have made a most extraordinary find! Here is a bug, the like of which we have never seen or heard about. Can you tell us what it is?'

"The professor, adjusting his glasses, took a look, and then said, 'Young gentlemen, this is a humbug.'

"But now, some professors who claim to be very learned specialists have, from many sources, gathered numerous theories which they declare are wonderful improvements upon the religion of the Bible, and when these theories are adjusted we have the most striking and peculiar creature the world has ever seen. And this creature the professors are trying to palm off on their students as an evolution of the religion of the Bible and a great improvement of the same, and in order to make it popular they call it 'the twentieth century religion.' But I call it humbug."—*Religious Review of Reviews.*
