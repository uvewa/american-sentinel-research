A clergyman of this city, Rev. Dr. Morse, declared in a sermon recently that the Government of this country is in control of modern Judases, who differ from the first Judas only in that they do not go and hang themselves.

This is a republican government, a government of the people. If bad men are in office, it is because the people put them there and allow them to stay there. It is a natural development from the political system, and clearly shows that that system is not the enemy of official corruption or a suitable means for the Government's purification. So long as this purification is sought through politics, the situation will remain as bad or worse than it is now. The people will not put good men in office until they themselves desire a better government, until they themselves are more decidedly opposed to fraud and injustice. And this only means that the people themselves must be made better, that they themselves must be uplifted to a higher moral plane, before a better government can be obtained than now exists. And what can uplift the people? Themselves? No; the uplifting power is not the power of man but the power of God.

Therefore let clergymen who deplore the presence of modern Judases in the seats of political authority, not proclaim that the church must go into politics and "turn the rascals out," but seek with redoubled zeal to draw the people to the great uplifting power of the gospel committed to their hands.
