The policy of imperialism has already isolated the United States among the nations of the world. It has won for this nation the distrust and ill-will of the people in almost every other civilized land. If the United States should be humbled in war, all the world would rejoice over its downfall.

Mr. W. T. Stead, the well-known English journalist, after his recent tour through Europe, told of the "alarm, anger, and disgust" which was universally excited there by the American policy of "benevolent assimilation." And now we are apprised that like sentiments are felt in the matter by the people of South America. That this should be true in a continent filled with republics, is worse than that it should be true among empires and monarchies.

Writing on this subject to the N. Y. Independent, Mr. Samuel P. Craver, D. D. superintendent of the M. E. mission in Paraguay, says:

"The sad spectacle of the greatest republic on earth, the model and hope of all American republics, the propounder and defender of the principle that 'all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed,' now engaged in a war on the other side of the globe to subject an alien people to its dominion—this sad spectacle has done much to curl the lip of scorn and emphasize the epithet of 'hypocrites.' The plea so commonly made in justification of the policy of expansion, that the Philippines are not able to govern themselves, and that we can do much better for them than they can possibly do for themselves, does not have much force in these countries, some of which, when they obtained their independence from Spain, were but little, if any, in advance of the Philippines. They have had their turbulent periods, and still are far from realizing an ideal government, but they have no desire to have the United States take charge of their countries. . . .

"The more intelligent leaders of public opinion in these countries are not ignorant of the gross injustice practised in the United States in our treatment of the negroes, the Chinese and the Indians. The horrible and savage burning of negroes, with the worse than savage fiendishness connected therewith, while the national Government stands helplessly contemplating it and either unwilling or powerless to interfere, is contemplated as a ghastly commentary on the 'humanitarian' warfare being waged against a people fighting for the right to govern themselves. . . .

"Is it, therefore, to be wondered at that the expansion policy of the United States to-day does not excite admiration nor inspire high hopes for the future among South Americans?

"They look upon it with alarm. If the United States have laid aside their traditional policy and propose to enter upon a self-imposed task of policing the world, what guarantee has any South American country that on some fine day the American eagle will not pounce down upon it and annex it, for 'humanitarian' reasons? Consequently everything looking like North American intervention in South American affairs meets with opposition. A few days since a telegram announced that Bolivia had asked, or would ask, the intervention of the United States in her question with Brazil touching boundaries. Immediately the press of Chili sounded a note of energetic protest, and the Bolivian Minister in Chili hastened to deny the report. It was but a straw, but it shows the direction of the wind.

"A few months ago an interview with Mr. Cecil Rhodes, of South Africa, was telegraphed to Buenos Ayres papers. In it he prophesied that before the end of the next century all South America would belong to the United States, and that it is a consummation devoutly to be wished. The leading Buenos Ayres daily, in commenting on the interview, said that of course such statements would be laughed at, or severely censured by the press of the United States, for the idea was too ridiculous to be taken seriously. However, I have not seen any such censure in the American press, but on the contrary many references to Rhodes's idea as an indication of the favor with which our growing power is looked upon by a far-seeing statesman. Already it would seem that the thought of empire has so influenced the public mind that the wild visions of the South African leader are looked upon as not improbable of realization.

"Is the change in the attitude of the vast number of the American people who sustain expansion one that is likely to conduce to an extension of the principles for which we have stood, and to enhance confidence in our profession of faith in popular government and the rights of man?"
