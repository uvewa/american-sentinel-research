A thought frequently entertained was recently expressed by one of the Transvaal officers stating that in the event of war, "God and the Mauser rifle would safeguard their independence." But God does not depend upon the Mauser rifle or any other kind of war instrument. Nor does he intend to carry on his work in any such fashion. When Peter drew his rusty blade to defend Christ, the command was given, "Put up again thy sword into its place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." The same thought is sometimes expressed in the word, "Trust in God, and keep your powder dry." Now the cause that needs the powder of human manufacture is not of God to begin with. If it is necessary for God to protect his people, he will not use either sword or rifle. The angel of God was sent to stand between Jerusalem and the invading army. When the morning came it revealed 185,000 Assyrian warriors dead on the field where there had been no battle. Human beings often lose the protection that Jehovah would give, because, like Peter, they bring in their rusty sword, or their Mauser rifle.
