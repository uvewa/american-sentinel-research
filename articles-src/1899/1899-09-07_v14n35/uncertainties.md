## Specific Items

### Article 06, "The Deceptive Spirit of Politics"
- **Location:** Page 1, continuation onto pages 2–3
- **Issue:** The word "camp—meetings" in the press quotation appears with an em-dash rather than a hyphen. This may be a Mistral OCR artifact for "camp-meetings."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "camp-meetings" (standard hyphenated form)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the em-dash is almost certainly an OCR rendering of a hyphen in the original

### Article 06, "The Deceptive Spirit of Politics"
- **Location:** Page 2 (continued), Dr. Schell's speech
- **Issue:** The phrase "their mission and duty is to day" appears to be split across a column break. The word "to-day" was printed as "to day" with a line break between the two syllables at the column edge.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "to day" (preserved as in OCR, since OCR likely reflects the column break; the original word is "to-day")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the split is a column-break artifact; transcribed as it appeared in OCR

### Article 06, "The Deceptive Spirit of Politics"
- **Location:** Page 3, paragraph beginning "acy, of planning..."
- **Issue:** The word "self-suprem-" at the end of a line on page 2 was hyphenated. The OCR preserved it as "self-supremacy" with the break absorbed, but the original text read "self-suprem-" at line end continuing "acy" on the next line.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "self-supremacy" (joined correctly)
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Article 08, "Peacemakers for the Philippines"
- **Location:** Page 5, Times-Herald quoted passage
- **Issue:** "their would soon be" — appears to be an error in the original (should be "there would soon be"). Preserved as printed without [sic].
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "their would soon be" (preserved exactly as in original)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — this is an original printing error, preserved per transcription rules

### Article 11, "Sunday Rest Agitation in South Carolina"
- **Attribution:** Byline reads "BY I. E. Kimball." — initials IEK not in known authors list.
- **Action:** Created as explicit attribution with author "I. E. Kimball" and author_short "IEK"

### Article 25, "The Spirit of War is the Spirit of Murder"
- **Attribution:** Signed "G. W. ANGLEBARGER. / Longmont, Colo." — initials GWA not in known authors list.
- **Action:** Created as explicit attribution; Longmont, Colo. is dateline/location, not part of name

### Page 16 Editorial Items (Articles 34–39)
- **Issue:** Page 16 contains multiple substantial editorial paragraphs set in a different format (all-caps lead words: "A RELIGIOUS government...", "READ what is said...", "THE liberty to worship...", "THE mere presence...", "THE fact that a revolution...", "THE charge that American soldiers..."). These are distinct editorial items and have been split accordingly.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 7 Item following "Sunday Rest Agitation"
- **Issue:** "Humbug Religion" follows immediately after the I. E. Kimball article. The item quotes Dr. Munhall and cites *Religious Review of Reviews*. This has been treated as an editorial item (the Sentinel introduces and frames the quotation), not a reprint, since the Sentinel provides no source newspaper/publication byline in the "—*Source*" pattern; the citation is internal to the quoted passage.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — could be argued either way; treated as editorial
