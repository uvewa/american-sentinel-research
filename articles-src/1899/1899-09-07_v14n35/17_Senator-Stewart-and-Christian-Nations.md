SENATOR STEWART, of Nevada, says that "Christian nations ought to proscribe France in the interest of civilization;" and that accordingly he will at the coming session of Congress, introduce a resolution withdrawing the United States from participation in the Paris World's Fair. But what would the senator say if France should also "in the interests of civilization," request the United States to withdraw because of its treatment of the negro?

No, Senator Stewart; France is as much a "Christian nation" as is the United States, or for that matter, any other nation on the earth. "Christian civilization" has been tried and found wanting from the moral standpoint. Governmental "Christianity" has never been anything but a failure. The only Christianity that is real is found in the heart and life of the humble believer on Jesus Christ, whether in civilized America or in the uncultured isles of the Southern seas.
