According to reliable reports from the South, a movement has been in progress for several years in portions of Texas and Louisiana, the aim of which is to depopulate that country of the negroes. The methods employed are violence and intimidation, and it is because of this that it is mentioned in the SENTINEL. This is one among many indications which reveal a national departure from the principles of government defined in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. That the nation is rapidly drifting away from these principles, is a fact which should awaken the concern of all Americans.

Taking occasion from two recent outbreaks against the negroes in this district of the South, a writer in the New York Sun discourses at some length on the nature and results of this method of seeking the solution of the southern race problem. We quote from his statements the following:

"NEW ORLEANS, August 23.—The outbreak during the week against the negroes at Orange, Texas, just across the Sabine River from Louisiana, is only a repetition of similar outbreaks that have occurred in the black belt of eastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana during the last few years, and which will make itself felt in the next census. Through all this region, almost as great as New York, the negro is being rapidly driven back and is taking refuge in the larger towns, particularly in New Orleans. This movement to get rid of the negro population, while not systematic or organized, has the support of a majority of the whites. It is partly industrial and partly racial, but its effect is marked—that of getting rid of the negroes.

"During the past week two of these mob outbreaks were reported in nowise related to each other, yet having the same object in view. In Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, a mob of Whitecaps, after shooting into the houses of the negroes and killing one of their leaders, posted notices on all the mills, warning the companies against employing negroes in the sawmills or on the railroads. A postscript announced that the negroes would be allowed to make bricks—most of the companies conduct lumber mill and brick yards side by side—but not in any other industry, in logging, on the lumber railroads or in any of the more lucrative industries, which it was declared should be reserved for the whites.

"The affair at Orange was identical. The town is one of the largest lumber centers of the Southwest, and its mills have employed both white and negro labor. It is asserted that the millmen were displacing white with negro employees, as the latter were cheaper and more easily controlled. There has been much feeling on this subject for some time. Finally it broke out into overt action. Exactly the same course was pursued as in Tangipahoa. Whitecaps rode around the country, fired into a house where a number of negroes were assembled for mutual comfort and protection, and killed one and wounded several others. This was followed by the usual skull and crossbones letters warning the negroes to leave Orange County.

"Although there were no additional acts of violence, the warning letter, accompanied with the one shooting affair, had the desired effect, and since then the negroes have been leaving Orange by the hundreds, selling their property for whatever they could get for it. Most of them were well-to-do and owned their homes. The mill men made an appeal to the governor for troops and the Houston Cavalry were ordered there to preserve the peace. There has been no disturbance since, but the presence of the troops has not reassured the negroes who are moving out, recognizing that the whites do not want them, and that their lives would be very unpleasant if they remained.

"This is the story that has come from a score of counties in Texas and parishes in Louisiana in the last few years and which is rapidly thinning out the negro population southwest of the Mississippi. The black belt which extends from Virginia southward and westward, and runs over into Texas, has been steadily driven back for the last ten years. Every now and then a disturbance is reported in some part of this district. A negro is shot, usually not more than one, and a warning given to the 'bad negroes' to leave. They do so, and probably a good many others, and from that time forward there is a more or less steady negro emigration from that district. The consequence has been that all the coast counties of Texas and Louisiana have been growing steadily whiter by the departure of the negroes and the coming in of whites. Whereas nearly all the parishes of Louisiana west of New Orleans had a majority of negroes ten years ago, they are white to day; and Jefferson, Plaquemines, Assumption, Lafourche, Iberia, St. Martin and St. Landry have changed their majorities from black to white. The negro population which has been at a standstill, is now decreasing. The negroes are shut out of many industries in which they were employed formerly and are now being crowded out of plantation work.

"The consequence of these disturbances and the emigration of the negro from the rural districts is to drive them into the towns, and particularly into New Orleans, where there has been an extraordinarily large increase of blacks. The census will show an increase of from 40 to 50 per cent. in the decade, in spite of the excessive mortality, running up to 36 in a thousand a year. The negro population of New Orleans is not self-perpetuating. With a high mortality and a low birth-rate, the negroes would soon die out but for the newcomers from the rural districts. These are pouring in by the thousands from Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas until the problem promises to be troublesome, and to arouse a strong antagonism to them.

"The race question in the Southwest is generally assuming an industrial form, which is operating unfavorably to the negro, by turning against him the white laboring classes who believe that they are being crowded out of work by negro competition, or that the standard of wages is kept low because of the small pay for which negroes are willing to work. The prevalent feeling in the Southwest, therefore, particularly in those sections where there are manufactures, is that it would be wholly advantageous to get rid of the negro altogether. The result is such demonstrations as those of last week at Orange, Tex., and Tangipahoa, La., which are but two of many similar incidents occurring in all parts of the Southwest. The coming census, therefore, will show a decrease of the negroes in most of the districts, and their congregation in the larger towns and cities, where they are badly congested and live amid bad sanitary and moral conditions."

In many respects the condition of the negro in this country is approximately the old condition of slavery, which cost this nation so much between 1860 and '65. The principle that "all men are created equal" is fast being repudiated in American government, and it is being asserted that inferior races have not the rights which belong by nature to the superior races. When this doctrine shall have become established as regards the races of men, it will be a logical and easy step to the application of the same doctrine to the classes of men; and the doctrine that rights belong only to the higher classes is the foundation of monarchy.

This foundation is now being rapidly laid in the United States.
