A New Orleans judge has decided that a girl in this country is of age at seventeen years, when her choice in a matter is such as will serve the interests of the Catholic Church. The Sun, of this city, gives this statement of the case:—

"New Orleans, August 31.—A curious case, the outgrowing of the Cuban revolution, was decided by Judge St. Paul, of the Civil District Court, this morning. It was a habeas corpus proceeding brought by Mrs. Adelina Prieto, of Cienfuegos, to get her daughter, Maria Teresa, 17 years old, from the Sisters of Mercy. Mrs. Prieto was a refugee from Cuba in the early days of the Cuban war. She brought her family to New Orleans, where she placed Maria Teresa in the Convent of the Sisters of Mercy. She herself returned to Cuba, recovered her property, and became wealthy again. She then sought to recover her daughter, but the girl had become a novice of the order and wanted to become a nun. The question before the court was whether a girl of 17 could decide her own future and abandon home to become a sister four years hence. Judge St. Paul denied the demand of Mrs. Prieto and gave the girl to the guardianship of the sister superior. An appeal was had to the Louisiana Supreme Court."

This is as much as any mother has a right to expect who is foolish enough to place her daughter in a convent.
