As an illustration of this fact, I will cite a case that came under my observation, or, to my knowledge, in Denver a few days ago. A certain young man thirsting for war, a few weeks ago enlisted in the 34th regiment to go to the Philippines. This regiment has been stationed at Ft. Logan, about six or seven miles from Denver. This young man has been practising for a sharp shooter. He with two of his soldier comrades came to Denver to have what they would term a good time. They were going from one saloon to another until after midnight, exhibiting quite a good deal of money in their drinking, etc. Finally a dispute arose between this particular young man and the bartender, about the change; the young man drew his revolver and was about to shoot the bar tender, when others interfered and he was prevented. After he with his companion left the saloon a policeman followed him and asked him to give up his weapon and to consider himself under arrest. He quickly drew his revolver and shot the policeman, killing him. Another policeman took up the chase, and he shot at the young man twice, missing him, when the latter turned and in a flash shot this policeman down, also killing him, and then made his escape and has not been captured yet.

It was reported afterwards, the reason he did not submit to arrest was that he knew he was a "dead shot" and could easily kill the policeman and get away. This will serve to show that the same spirit that will lead a man to prepare to go to war to kill people, will lead him to kill them at home or any place, under provocation; and yet it is a "Christian nation" which is calling men to war and instilling into them this spirit.
