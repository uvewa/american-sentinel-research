THE mere presence of the American flag floating over a body of armed men, does not consecrate the cause in which those men may be enlisted. If the sultan of Turkey should come with a band of assassins under that flag, resistance to him would not be treason to the American Government. If a band of robbers in this country should come flying the American flag and attack the citizens of a town, no principle of loyalty to the United States would oblige those citizens to submit. The question of treason cannot be settled by the mere fact of resistance to a party bearing the flag, or to a policy that party may be carrying out. For as the poet says,—

"Knaves have stolen thee, Old Glory,
For their Babylonian bowers."

Adherence to the Declaration of Independence can never be treason to the United States Government while that Government remains true to its mission among mankind.
