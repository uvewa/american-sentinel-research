The object of law is to protect men in the enjoyment of their rights. It protects men from one another; it guards each one against encroachment by the others. But it can protect no man against himself—against evil in his own heart. It cannot keep him from doing wrong. And therefore human law cannot undertake to prohibit wrong doing, as such. It prohibits the wrong-doing when, and only when, that would invade another's rights. All men have the opportunity to do wrong—they must have it in order to develop character. And they are to be judged, and condemned or justified, not now, but at the end of the world; not here, but at the bar of God, and by the law of God. Any human law, therefore, which prohibits a thing merely because it is wrong, or is deemed so, is contrary to the purpose of God, and can work only evil as long as it exists.
