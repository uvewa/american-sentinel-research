THE fact that a revolution is in progress in San Domingo, recalls the comment oft made in this country upon Latin-American republics, that revolution is their normal state. This is naturally taken as reflecting unfavorably upon the republican form of government. But it should be remembered that in those republics two opposing forces are continually at work, which would produce unrest and revolution under any form of government. Those countries have long been strongholds of the papacy. The desire for freedom, on the one hand, moves the people to throw off the shackles of Rome from the government; and on the other hand, the papal party never rests satisfied with any government which cannot be dominated by the church; and against such governments they are continually plotting revolution. Take away the influence of Rome, and revolution would largely cease.
