When we present the claims of the law of God in the matter of Sabbath keeping, and urge the importance of observing the seventh day "according to the commandment," we are met with the plea that we are not under obligation to keep the law; that the gospel has nothing to do with law; that the Christian religion is enforced by the power of love, etc., etc. But when it comes to Sunday observance, the appeal is based on the authority and power of law, and mere human law at that. The Bureau of Reforms, with headquarters at Washington, together with most of the organizations for special reform purposes, seek to gain their objects through civil law. They have no other suggestion of reform but by the power of civil government. God's standard of reform—his Holy Word—seems to have lost its power for good in the estimation of human law reformers.—*Signs of the Times.*
