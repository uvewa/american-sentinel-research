The President in his speech at Pittsburg accused the Filipinos of "attacking the forces who fought for and secured their freedom."

Is a change of "sovereigns" FREEDOM? Would the American Revolutionists have considered that they had secured their freedom in exchanging the tyranny of George III. for "benevolent assimilation" by their French allies?

If in his proclamations and other dealings with the Filipinos before the trouble began, or even when his hand-tied Peace Commissioners went out to Manila, the President had promised real freedom to the inhabitants, or had suggested even an autonomous government under our protection, there would have been no more war.

But his initial demand, as far back as December 27, was for unconditional submission to our "rights of sovereignty" and acquiescence in our purpose of "benevolent assimilation" through the medium of soldiers and carpetbaggers, under penalty of death or subjugation. And this is his attitude to the present day.

How can a President of the great Republic be blind to the truth that freedom is the same, that liberty is as dear and that self-government is as much a right in the Philippines as in the United States?
