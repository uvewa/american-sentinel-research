Human wisdom is not as wise as it seems to be. The man who invented a perfect method for the culture of the memory forgot his hat. The man who wrote a book instructing mankind "how to live a hundred years" died at thirty-eight. The woman who wrote a book to prove that there is no death has buried two husbands.
