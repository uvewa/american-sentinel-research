A WHOLE column in the New York Sun, of the 28th inst., and almost as much space in other dailies of this city, was devoted to a description of the appearance of "the ghost of St. Ann" to an officer of the Supreme Court named Doyle. He saw it at night in a hallway of his home. Ordinarily, appearances of ghosts are dismissed with a brief mention; but this occasion must be dwelt upon at length because it was the "ghost of St. Ann."

It was identified as St. Ann by the fact that a piece of the true bone of St. Ann's arm was on exhibition in a nearby church. Why the ghost should appear in a private house rather than in the church where her "relic" was exposed, is a question that might be asked, but which evidently was not deemed of importance in determining the identity of the ghost.

The business of relic-showing depends largely on advertising to make it a success; and in the case of this "bone of St. Ann," it would seem that success ought to be assured.
