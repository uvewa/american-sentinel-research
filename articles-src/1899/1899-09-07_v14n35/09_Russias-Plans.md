The Russian Convent and the Greek Church recently erected at great expense in Jerusalem, may be comparatively well known, but the gigantic tower built under Russian auspices is not so well known. This tower is erected on the summit of the Mount of Olives. It is 220 feet high, 24 feet at the base, and 21 feet at the top. It contains a monster bell, weighing 20 tons, together with a peal of seven bells above it. Above this is an electric chamber, connected by wire with some of the monasteries of the Holy Land. It is supposed that the tolling of this bell can be heard at Jafa, Jericho, and Mount Lebanon. The convents and monasteries, it is said, are well supplied with arms, and quantities of land have been purchased around them. The *Prophetic News* suggests that "such activities, especially the tower and its arrangements, must be for some special purpose."

The Bible student naturally connects these things with the great battle of Armageddon, which doubtless will be fought in this vicinity, and in such preparations sees the evidences of the soon-coming conflict. Surely the times are "perilous!"
