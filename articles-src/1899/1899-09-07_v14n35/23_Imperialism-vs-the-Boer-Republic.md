The Journal, of this city, says that it cannot wholly sympathize with the Boers in their struggle against absorption into the British Empire, and gives the following as a justifying reason:—

"But in our age no people can be allowed to live for itself; it must live for mankind; and least of all can a people appropriate for its exclusive use desirable parts of the earth which civilization needs and can use to much better and universal advantage. The Boers have precisely proven that they cannot properly use the splendid natural opportunities with which their land is blessed."

This is a good statement of the imperialist conception of the case. The Boers are farmers; the representatives of "civilization" are gold hunters. The Boers care only for a simple life, while "civilization" demands that men and women lead a very complex sort of existence, such as the possession of much gold and the fashions and follies of a modern Paris can provide.

The civilization of Paris, by the way, is just now being seen at its best.

The Creator expressed his idea of the life that is best for man by placing him in a garden. The imperialistic conception of the same is expressed by Babylon the Great.

In the imperialist view, Adam and Eve, if they were again in Eden and did not dig up the garden in a search for gold, would conclusively demonstrate "that they cannot properly use the splendid natural opportunities with which their land is blessed!"

The greatest trouble with the earth to-day is that it has too much "civilization." The Creator "hath made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions."

But for the desire to worship the golden calf, there would be no war cloud hanging over the Transvaal republic.
