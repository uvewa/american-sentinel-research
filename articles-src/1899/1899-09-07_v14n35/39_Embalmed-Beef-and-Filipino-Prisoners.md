THE charge that American soldiers in Luzon were committing acts of a nature contrary to "civilized warfare," has been vigorously denied by apologists for the war; but it is admitted that at one place five hundred Filipino prisoners were put on a diet of "embalmed beef," as a result of which about half of them died of "beri beri" in a short time.
