There has been formed recently in England an association of Protestants having for its aim the political overthrow of the papacy in Great Britain. It takes the name of the "Imperial Protestant Federation," and publishes the following object:—

"To unite the Colonies and British Dependencies with the United Kingdom in a Federation of Protestants of all classes and Religious Denominations, determined to maintain Protestant supremacy, as opposed to Romish, Sacerdotal, or Infidel Ascendancy, in every branch of the constitution and life of the Empire."

To accomplish this it will work by the following methods:—

"1. To oppose in the Imperial Parliament, and elsewhere, the threefold effort now being made by Roman Catholics (a) to revise the Coronation Oath of the Sovereign, (b) to open the Throne of England again to a Roman Catholic, and (c) to repeal the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement.

"2. In order to secure united Protestant action, it is proposed to form a Central Council to carry out the objects of the Federation, and that each recognized Protestant Society be invited to send one or more representatives thereto, as may be deemed advisable in each case.

"3. To aid any Parliamentary Constituency, or any Elective Body, in returning a Protestant candidate thereto, provided the Council of the Federation are satisfied as to the Protestantism of the candidate; and to oppose the election of any Roman Catholic, Infidel, or Atheist, to Parliament, County Councils, School Boards, Board of Guardians or Vestries.

"4. To limit and curtail by every lawful means the Politico-Religious influence of the Romish Church, and of their allies, the Sacerdotalists of the Church of England, in Parliament and elsewhere.

"5. To obtain a Parliamentary inquiry and subsequent legislative action regarding the Monasteries, Nunneries, and other 'Religious Houses' within the Dominions of the British Crown, with a view to ascertain (inter alia) how far British law is ignored in such Houses and Canon or Papal law substituted therefor.

"6. To oppose in the Imperial and Colonial Parliaments, or elsewhere, any Bill or Measure proposing grants of money in aid of any Romish or Anti-Protestant object.

"7. To enrol Protestants of all classes and of all Evangelical Denominations as members of the Federation on each signing the Declaration, and paying a Life Donation or Annual Subscription.

"8. To cooperate with Protestants throughout the world."

The trouble with this Federation is that while it is Protestant in name, it is papal in spirit; and the papacy cannot be successfully combatted by another organization of like nature.

It is determined "to maintain Protestant supremacy" in the government; but not by maintaining the Protestant principle of separation of religion from the state. For by that principle it could not oppose the election of any man to public office on religious grounds.

The principle which imposes a religious test upon candidates for governmental office, is a papal principle, and is not altered by the fact that some who approve and adopt it call themselves Protestants.

Being guided by this wrong principle, the Federation can make no real progress in opposing Rome. Rome can be successfully opposed only by the principles of Christianity; only as she was opposed by Luther and his fellow reformers. When people try to fight the devil with fire, they only add fuel to the conflagration.
