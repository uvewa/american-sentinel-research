If it takes 40,000 men seven months and $100,000,000 to take possession of 300 square miles of the island of Luzon, how many men, how many months and how much money will it require to take and hold the whole island, consisting of 51,200 square miles, for all time? And after that calculation has been made there is a chance to figure as to the whole area of the Philippine Islands, of about 115,000 square miles. The figures of such a problem may well make the American taxpayer gasp.—*Manchester Union.*
