The closest approach which we have yet made on this side to the British state paper known as the queen's speech is furnished by the altogether remarkable Thanksgiving proclamation of President McKinley. It is a pity that it cannot be subjected to the same criticism and analysis which attend the royal pronouncement.

It is the first time that such a document has been made the vehicle for conveying to the people a glorification of the policy of a partisan administration, or that we have been asked to accept as blessings direct from heaven the consequences of a given political policy as those consequences present themselves to the eye of a President exhausting every means to perpetuate his own and his party's power. . . .

It asks this people to thank God because our national finances have been strengthened, and because those engaged "in maintaining the honor of the flag" have been spared from disaster and disease. Another cause which should bring us to our knees before the Most High, . . . is that the power of the United States is being rapidly established throughout the Eastern archipelago.

This . . . represents such a perversion of the Christian principle from which our practise of setting one day of each year aside for thanksgiving arises as to suggest thoughts of the value of religious and moral hypocrisy as a political agent.

Heaven be thanked, there are manifold blessings for which this people should approach in reverence and thankfulness the Author of all good without offending against every canon of true Christian belief by dragging the sordid concerns of partisan politics into the sanctified domain of religious duty.
