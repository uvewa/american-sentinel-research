GENERAL Joseph Wheeler, who attained great popularity in the late Cuban campaign, writes from the Philippines to a relative in Nashville, Tenn., this statement which bears upon the question of the disposition to be made of church property in those islands:—

"I have now seen much of the country and the people in that part of Luzon for about fifty miles north of Manila. In every town there is a magnificent stone church and a convent or monastery. The insurgents have a great antipathy to the priesthood or friars and they have dismantled many of the churches. The value of the church and monastery of a town seems to be equal in many cases to the value of all the other buildings in the town. The more I talk to the people the more I am convinced that the insurgents are actuated, in a measure, by a spirit of communism, and in their talks, their most serious objection to the church seems to be the fact that ecclesiastical organizations own so much of the property, and one of Aguinaldo's most earnest demands is that the church's property be confiscated."
