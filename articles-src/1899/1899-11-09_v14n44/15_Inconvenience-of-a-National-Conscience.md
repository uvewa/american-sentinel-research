It is always unfortunate for man or nation earnestly wanting something not quite inside the moral pale, to have a conscience. Hence the interior debate going on at the present moment in both the United States and Great Britain regarding the righteousness of their respective "little wars." . . .

Civilization usually "gets for'ard on a powder cart," and strong men take what they want without setting up a parliament of debate within themselves. After they have got a Philippines or a Transvaal, they ask forgiveness, if by chance they hear they are criticised, but they continue to maintain their ground all the same.

The Boer is mostly an unpleasant and boorishly primitive person, a lover of solitude in a world where we are all being jostled; the Tagal is small, ardent, and a die in the last-ditch patriot, which makes his struggle for a Malay ideal of the Declaration of Independence prolonged and bloody. The m——s down Boston way assert, with all the moral rectitude of a group fed high on Emerson's essays, that "right will prevail," and if it doesn't, McKinley should be impeached; but in the end we fully expect to see Uncle Sam sitting in Luzon, master of a thoroughly "licked" archipelago and waving his hand toward China and the Orient as the self-appointed redeemer of the yellow race who shall be given all the blessings of unrestricted commercial intercourse with his well-approved and trusty syndicates. And also in the long run we shall see John Bull surveying a pacified Africa from Pretoria and the Boers scanning the Old Testament for prophecies regarding the ultimate downfall of the oppressor—all the consolation (purely literary), left them.

In both cases the folly of standing on the track when the Anglo-Saxon Limited express train of civilization is under full steam will be made apparent to an awe struck world of the semi-civilized and backward whose destiny it is to be taken by the hand by the passengers on the aforesaid train and led forward to higher and better things.

The world's progress appears to have been achieved by high handed and bold fellows who, after a conquest, slept sound o'nights. One cannot imagine the Romans pricked with conscience nor bitten by remorse after their annexations any more than the Russians are after swallowing Central Asian khanates.

And so we sit here in the American tropics, spectators of the little wars that signalize the onward march of the conquering breed that speaks the language of Rhodes, and goes forward with the machine gun and the spelling book and the common law, a terror to the unprogressive and feeble folk who fitfully struggle, and then sullenly accept their role of second-rate consumers of manufactured goods.
