CAPTAIN LEARY, naval governor of Guam, the largest island of the Ladrone group, has found it necessary to the establishment of his authority in the island, to expel from it all but one of the seven Catholic friars who had practical control of affairs under the Spanish regime. In a report to Washington Captain Leary states that the friars resisted every decree and effort at reform, no matter of what character, and he was forced to adopt heroic measures to establish American authority. Archbishop Chapelle, the Vatican's delegate to the islands, says the World, "is understood to view the action of Captain Leary with great disfavor," and "expressed the opinion that it was an outrage;" as no doubt it was from the Catholic point of view.
