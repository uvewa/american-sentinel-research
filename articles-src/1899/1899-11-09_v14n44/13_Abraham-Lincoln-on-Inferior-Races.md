ABRAHAM LINCOLN said—and the saying cannot be too often repeated these days:—

"These arguments that are made, that the inferior races are to be treated to as much freedom as they are capable of enjoying; that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allow—what are these arguments? They are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world. You will find that all the arguments in favor of kingcraft were of this class: They always bestrode the necks of the people—not that they wanted to do it, but because the people were better off for being ridden."
