SPEAKING of the question whether the "open door" policy of England or the "shut door" policy of Russia is to prevail in China, Mr. William Durban, who has traveled extensively in Asia, says in The Outlook:—

"The English mind is wedded to the doctrine of the 'open door,' and the Russian to that of the 'closed door,' but these doctrines, unfortunately, cannot be carried into practise without interference with the people who happen to live behind the door. England can keep the door open only by controlling those behind it, and Russia can keep it shut only by asserting her paramount claim within the door. Herein lies the world's approaching trouble. Many countries will be drawn into the conflict which is coming."

And for what is the United States now preparing but to be drawn into that conflict?
