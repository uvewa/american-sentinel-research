NEW HAMPSHIRE.

THE MINISTERS' ASSOCIATION, OF THE CITY OF MANCHESTER, ARE WORKING A PLAN TO GET THE MAYOR OF THAT CITY COMMITTED TO RELIGIOUS LEGISLATION BY DECLARING ALL "SACRED CONCEPTS" HELD ON SUNDAY CHARGING AN ADMIT- TANCE "FEE" TO BE A VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE. A PORTION OF A LETTER ADDRESSED BY THEM TO THE MAYOR, IS AS FOLLOWS:—

"The association appreciates your promise to forward us an opinion regarding the legality of Sunday concerts in general wherever an admission fee is charged. It is the opinion of some of us that a concert or any other kind of performance on Sunday which requires an admission fee, is secular; and therefore, prohibited by statute for the reason that the requirement of an admission fee places the performance on the market and stamps it a business enterprise.

"We beg to intimate to your honor that we are anxiously awaiting your promised opinion concerning this matter, hoping it will so manifestly accord with the proper understanding of the statute that it will settle this question decisively."

The pastors were evidently a little nervous over the matter, fearing that the better judgment of his honor the mayor might lead him to decide in harmony with the Bill of Rights of the State of New Hampshire, and thus thwart the plans of the association to make future use of the mayor's precedent. And so they very ingeniously intimate to him how they want him to decide; or, in other words, after asking the mayor's opinion of the law, they suggest to him the proper construction to place upon it; and this because it was the "opinion of some of us" that that was the thing to do.

Let those pastors carry their petition to God and get power from on high to reach wayward souls and no Sunday law will be needed to stop them from attending a "sacred" or any other kind of "concert."
