Few persons fully appreciate how deeply the United States has become involved with Great Britain through the Philippine adventure. No one who has much studied the question doubts that the British government, almost solidly backed by the British press, did everything in its power to induce the Administration to take the Philippine Islands from Spain. This phase of the treaty-making is still shrouded more or less in mystery, yet there is evidence to sustain the view that England took a very active interest in the Paris negotiations.

Months ago it was stated that a member of the American Peace Commission had intimated that strong representations had come from British quarters, urging the United States to take the whole group in order to check Germany's ambitions and prevent "a general European war,"—the menace of war being obviously a bugaboo. . . . Confirming with remarkable detail that information is the article printed in the Washington Evening Star, of last Thursday, the Star being a strong administration and imperialist paper.

The Star's article is headed: "A new foreign policy, this country and England to make common cause in the Orient," and its main purpose is to explain the great strengthening of the American fleet in Asiatic waters. That purpose, says the Star, is not to use the added naval force against the Filipinos, but to "put our hand into the (Chinese) pudding up to the armpit" in case Russia, Germany and France should adopt a policy of aggression in the Orient. Preliminary to explaining this purpose of the large fleet under Admiral Watson, the Star writer naturally found it necessary to refer to and outline the beginnings of this new American policy in the Orient, and in so doing he revealed facts quite in line with the theory of British meddling at Paris. Says the Star writer:—

"When the question came up before the United States whether or not the cession of the Philippines should be demanded of Spain as a condition of peace, and the President was reluctant to have this country assume responsibility for possessions so remote from our shores, influences both in this country and in Great Britain, which were alive to the importance of the situation in China still to be adjusted, were exerted to bring about the acquisition of that group of islands by the United States, so as to secure to us an interest in the Orient which would at once compel and enable us to participate in the adjustment of the 'eastern question' which must inevitably come.

"The men in the Senate most familiar with this matter talked earnestly with the President of the importance of the Philippines to the proper protection of our interests in the Orient, and it is said that the British ambassador had a long conference with the President, during which he pointed out the danger that if we did not take the Philippines, Spain would sell them to Germany, and that a great international war might result from this disturbance of the balance of power in the Orient, and that a failure on our part to hold the islands would be unfriendly to the interests of Great Britain and be an abandonment of all ambition on our part to share in the development of Chinese trade. Prior to this the policy of the President, as imparted to Mr. Day, the head of our commission at Paris then negotiating peace, was to retain possession of but one of the islands as a naval and commercial station."

Having started into the Philippine venture under the influence of Great Britain in part, how does the Administration find itself situated to-day? No one can dispute the fact that, so far as the Philippines are concerned, the Administration is really in the power of England. But for England's naval support of the American programme, Germany, France, Russia, and perhaps Japan, could recognize the Filipino republic to-morrow without fear that the United States could strike back at their combined strength, and such recognition would go far to ruin the Administration's Philippine policy. It is evident that this Administration, so long as it pursues its present Philippine policy, is under bonds to keep and even solicit England's friendship.

The Filipino war is in reality to England's advantage, because while it lasts her support is all the more necessary to America, which means that America must side with England elsewhere in the world. Never before in American history has a United States Government been so completely under the broad thumb of John Bull as to-day.
