THE command to keep the Sabbath is a command to sanctify one day of the week, and cannot therefore be kept by sanctifying two days of the week. Conscience tells an individual that he should sanctify—or set apart—a certain day of the week, by resting from his work, and the law, perchance, says that he must rest on a different day. Either, then, he must disregard the Sabbath command by sanctifying two days of the week, or he must disregard his conscience by sanctifying a day he believes to be the wrong one, or he must disregard the law of the land. Which shall he do?
