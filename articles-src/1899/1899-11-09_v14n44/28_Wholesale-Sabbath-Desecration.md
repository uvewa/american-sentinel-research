"Still," the report continued, "there has never been a year when there has been such wholesale Sabbath desecration as this. The Sunday excursion by rail and boat, bicycle riding for pleasure, the open bar-room, the crowds at the beaches and summer resorts, catering for the Sunday crowd, have brought to America the Continental Sunday, and even many Christian people seem to have forgotten the command, 'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.'"
