It was faith in democracy, in man, and in his destiny which enabled France to face banded Europe and carry its armies from Madrid to Moscow.—Senator Lodge.

Stuff! It was a love of military glory, and the foolish idea that France could conquer the whole earth, which enabled Napoleon to lead a huge French army to its destruction at Moscow. The same foolishness led to the catastrophies of 1870-71 and to the accumulation of a public debt on which the interest is over $200,000,000 a year. As a result of the crazy notions of their superiority to all the other peoples of the world which got into the heads of Frenchmen a hundred years ago, France is to-day a decadent nation, and so will this nation be whenever it submits itself to the guidance of the glory-grabbers who are seeking high office at the hands of the American people.
