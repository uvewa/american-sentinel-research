SPAIN appears to have learned little if anything from her late overthrow, as to the real causes of her weakness. She clings fatuously to the old church-and-state regime by which liberty has so long been repressed and manhood dwarfed within her territory. In her impaired vision the cause of her trouble takes on the appearance of the needed remedy, and seems likely to lead its victim on from bad to worse. We are told by the Paris Journal des Débats, speaking of the situation in Spain, that "The church, therefore, makes the following cardinal demands: Complete independence of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, which means that none of its members under any consideration whatever, shall be judged by secular courts; re-establishment of all clerical privileges; abolition of the legality of marriages not sanctioned by the church; non-interference of the secular authorities with any legacies or grants obtained by the church; prohibition of religious associations to non-Catholics."

This is like a drunkard trying to cure himself of delirium tremens by drinking more whiskey.
