"IN time of peace I am for the Administration when it is right; in time of war I am for the Administration, right or wrong."—Chaplain Mailley, of the First Nebraska Regiment.

"Some one," remarks *The Independent*, "wants to know if this utterance is compatible with Christian ethics." To which that journal answers: "Of course not. The last sentence is utterly, totally, irretrievably wrong. If Mr. Atkinson or the Reverend This or That believes the policy or conduct of war by the Administration to be wrong, he has no business to go to war, and he has no business to help the Administration. That ought to have been settled long ago in the history of this country."
