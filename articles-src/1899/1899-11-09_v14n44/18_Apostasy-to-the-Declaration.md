The time has come in this Republic when a resolution repeating word for word the preamble of the Declaration of Independence cannot be suffered to reach a vote in a religious denominational convention. The Universalists in Boston the other day ran away from such a resolution like mice from a terrier dog. It was "indefinitely postponed." Such incidents indicate an apostasy to the Declaration somewhere, somehow, by some one.—Springfield Republican.
