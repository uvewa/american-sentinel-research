EIGHT Ypsilanti, Mich., saloon-keepers were recently indicted for Sunday opening, and fined $15 each.

THE Lord's Day Alliance of Canada has brought an action against a Toronto restaurant keeper for selling ice cream on Sunday.

THE City Council of Redwood Falls, Minn., has passed an ordinance to remove all screens or other obstructions to the public view in saloons on Sundays.

RECENTLY in Louisville, Ky., three hundred Christian Endeavors, in an enthusiastic union meeting, unanimously resolved to unite with the other religious forces of the city in favor of closing the saloons and places of business on Sunday. The crusade will be a vigorous one.

THE city council of Columbus, O., lately impeached and removed from the office of director of public safety, Joseph W. Dusenberry; largely on account of his connection with the violation of the Sunday laws by the managers of the Olentangy Park Casino, of which he is part owner.
