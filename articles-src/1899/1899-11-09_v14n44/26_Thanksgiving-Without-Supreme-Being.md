The Thanksgiving proclamation issued by the governor of the "Empire State," affirms, as one reason for thanksgiving, that the nation has been performing noble deeds in the "first flush of its manhood," and makes no allusion at all to any higher power; which causes a city daily to observe that "A Thanksgiving proclamation with no reference whatever to a Supreme Being is something of a curiosity." Yet the absence of a tone of humility in some Thanksgiving proclamations this year cannot be accounted altogether strange.
