THE Supreme Court of Georgia, in a decision upon the case of Mr. A. J. Waters, of Gainesville, convicted for working on Sunday, sustained the verdict of the lower court from which the appeal was taken; thus upholding the Sunday law of that State. We learn, however, that a petition for pardon was circulated in Gainesville and liberally indorsed by the citizens; and when this was brought before Governor Candler, the latter promptly granted the pardon. We do not believe the people of the State of Georgia who knew of this case wanted to see Mr. Waters go to the chain-gang for an act in which he was conscientious, and to which objection could be taken only on religious grounds. And while they felt bound to uphold the Sunday law (though it is only justice that can truly bind us), we believe the majority of them view this termination of the case with satisfaction.
