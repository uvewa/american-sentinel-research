In the annual address by the president of the New York State W. C. T. U., Mrs. E. A. Boole, in the State convention at Binghampton, we note the following reference to Sunday closing legislation maintained by the organization:—

"Early in the sessions of the legislature nearly a dozen bills were introduced providing for open saloons on Sunday, Sunday concerts, Sunday baseball, in fact, a wide-open Sunday. Petitions were immediately sent out by our State Corresponding Secretary, and we rejoice that all these bills were defeated."
