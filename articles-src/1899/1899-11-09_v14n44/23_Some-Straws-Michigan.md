MICHIGAN.

ON Wednesday evening, October 18, one hundred persons were confirmed in the Catholic church in Lansing, Mich. Of these it was stated that twenty-five were converts from Protestantism. This is a startling testimony to the fact that when people cease to advance in religious truth, they rapidly retrograde.
