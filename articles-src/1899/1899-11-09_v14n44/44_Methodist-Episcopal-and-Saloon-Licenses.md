The Union Signal says that "If the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church follows the lead of the Rock River Conference it will be about as difficult for a Methodist in good standing to be elected mayor in one of our large cities as for a camel to go through a needle's eye. The Rock River Conference introduced a resolution memorializing the supreme body to make it an offense for a Methodist to grant a license for a saloon. The resolution evoked a long and spirited debate, but was adopted by a large majority."

It will be a good deal better to command as little prospect of election to public office as the camel has of going through a needle's eye, than to become mayor of a city by sanctioning the saloon.
