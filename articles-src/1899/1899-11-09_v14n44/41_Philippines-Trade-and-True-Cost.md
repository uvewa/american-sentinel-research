"Is it not surprising," asks the Ram's Horn, that "if, as the Secretary of War says, 9,999,000 of the suppositious 10,000,000 population of the Philippines are our true and good friends," "they do not show their appreciation of our civilizing administration of their affairs, by purchasing our goods to a greater extent than $404,171 during a whole half year?"

"In other words, while we have been supporting an army in the Philippines for the chief purpose of opening trade (and securing the Roman Catholic Church in its ownership of lands in jeopardy) at a cost of four or five million dollars a month, our enterprising merchants have only been able to sell goods at the rate of $65,000, on which the monthly profit could scarcely be more than $10,000. In other words, while we are making a little over $100,000 a year in our export trade in the Philippines, which is an annual income of about a tenth of a cent for each of our population, we are spending, safely, $50,000,000 a year for the purpose of proving to those obtuse heathen that we are determined to civilize them."

It further appears from the Treasury Report, says the Ram's Horn, that "of the total merchandise shipped there by us in a single month, nearly one fourth of it, measured by money value, consisted of Alcoholic liquors."
