LOUISIANA.

SOME STRAWS.

IN SOME PARTS OF LOUISIANA THE QUESTION OF MORE STRINGENT SUNDAY LEGISLATION AND THE CARRYING OUT OF PRESENT SUNDAY LAWS, IS NOW BEING AGITATED. IN ONE CITY A BAPTIST MINISTER BEWAILED THE FACT THAT CITY IS WITHOUT A SABBATH, AND URGED THAT NO MAN BE VOTED INTO OFFICE WHO WILL NOT PROMISE TO ENFORCE THE SUNDAY LAWS. THIS INDICATES THAT THE GERM SEEDS OF CHURCH AND STATE ALLIANCE CONTINUES TO BE SOWN DURING ELECTION CAMPAIGNS. WHAT WOULD THAT GREAT BAPTIST, ROGER WILLIAMS, SAY OF HIS RELIGIOUS CONFRERES WERE HE AMONG THE LIVING TO DAY? WHAT DID THE AUTHORITY OF CHRISTIANITY SAY WITH REFERENCE TO HIS KINGDOM AND THIS WORLD? "MY KINGDOM IS NOT OF THIS WORLD." IS NOT JESUS CHRIST THE SAME TO-DAY AS YESTERDAY? WHY WILL HIS PROFESSED MINISTERS PERSIST IN MISREPRESENTING HIM IN THEIR RELIGIOUS POLITICAL ESCAPDES?
