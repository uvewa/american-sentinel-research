WHILE the nation is bestowing so much honor on Admiral Dewey, it is interesting by way of contrast to note that the first man who ever became conspicuous in American naval history, John Paul Jones, lies in a grave the location of which the American nation does not even know.

In capturing the British ship "Serapis" with his ship the "Bon Homme Richard," which was in every way inferior to that of his adversary, and which was so much damaged in the fight that it sank down after the engagement, John Paul Jones achieved a much greater feat than did Dewey at Manila,—greater probably than any other mentioned in American naval annals. Yet not only is his grave unknown, but it appears probable that actual dishonor is joined with oblivion over his remains. A leading journal of this city says:—

"The place of his burial cannot now be determined, although a thorough investigation of the records has been made. It was thought that he was buried in Picpus Cemetery, Paris, where the remains of Lafayette lie, but it has been determined positively that such was not the case. A more likely supposition is that advanced by Mr. Henry Vignaud, of the American Embassy at Paris, who investigated the case, that, owing to the custom prevailing at the time of Jones's burial, the remains were deposited in a rented grave for a term of years, and upon the expiration of the lease the bones were thrown into the potter's field."
