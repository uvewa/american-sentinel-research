ALL the Roman Catholic churches in the Milwaukee diocese have been notified to arrange for the incorporation of the parishes, and as soon as they are incorporated and ready to receive property it will be deeded to them by Archbishop Katzer. This is to escape paying taxes on church property held by the archbishop, which by a recent court decision would be necessary. The archbishop held a large amount of property in the name of the church, for which he claimed exemption from taxation. But the Supreme Court of Wisconsin recently declared church property of this nature held by an archbishop was taxable. The Catholic Church, of course, does not mean to pay taxes if it can be avoided; in which respect that church is much like other churches.
