INDIANA.

A MEMBER OF THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH IN INDIANAPOLIS WAS SUBPONDED TO APPEAR ON SATURDAY AS A WITNESS IN A CASE. SHE DECLINED TO GO, BECAUSE SHE OBSERVED THE SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH. THE JUDGE AND THE ATTORNEY SAID, "THE WOMAN MUST COME;" BUT THE MINISTER OF THE CHURCH OF WHICH THIS WITNESS WAS A MEMBER, EXPLAINED TO THE COURT WHY THE SISTER DECLINED TO COME ON THAT DAY. THE CASE WAS PUT OFF, AND A SPECIAL NOTICE WAS SENT HER, THROUGH THE SHERIFF, TO APPEAR THE NEXT SATURDAY. SHE PRAYERFULLY LEFT THE MATTER IN THE LORD'S HANDS, AND THE COURT FINALLY CONCLUDED "TO TRY THE CASE WITHOUT ANY COMPULSION."

O. S. HADLEY.
