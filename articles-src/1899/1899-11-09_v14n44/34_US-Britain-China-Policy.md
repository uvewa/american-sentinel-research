PRESS dispatches state that "a definite understanding has been reached between Great Britain and the United States and China," by which the United States will support Great Britain in her policy in China. This is understood by the governments of Europe, and they will formally request the United States "to select some specific part or portion of China as its base of commerce," to which it is to restrict its efforts to develop trade. "Great Britain," we are further told, "is very desirous that the United States should suggest a desire for a part in and a portion of the Yangtse-kiang Valley," where England's hold "is maintained in face of the opposition of combined Europe."

This news is sufficiently instructive and suggestive, but only what was to be expected in the natural course of events to which the existing national policy has given rise. The United States will make no long stop at the Philippines on its way to the territorial and commercial riches of the Orient; and when it stands on the Asiatic mainland facing "combined Europe," the American people will be told that they are still paying only the costs of "legitimate expansion."
