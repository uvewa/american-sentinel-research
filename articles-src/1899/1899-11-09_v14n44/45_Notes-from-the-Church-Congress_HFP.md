"The Sunday Question" was one of the subjects considered at the Church Congress, held at St. Paul, Minn. As might naturally be expected, the speakers took widely-different views of the subject. The audience was estimated as about 500. Rev. C. Fair, of Omaha, advocated a strict observance of the Sabbath (meaning Sunday) and lamented the disregard of the day. Rev. H. Tatlock urged that if Sunday observance was to be the rule among working men, they should not be enslaved the rest of the week. W. S. Rainsford, D. D., of New York, said that a wise spiritual policy followed by the church would spiritualize the times. But Mr. Warner, D. D., of New Orleans, was the only man that seemed to have noticed the true principle of the thing; and he, of course, declared that there should be no more legislation for Sunday than for any other questions suggested by the Decalogue; and admitted that there was no special sacredness in the day called Sunday. With consistency, therefore, he contended that recreation on Sunday was laudable. He gave a thrust by saying: "That there is a laxity from Puritan methods of Sunday keeping is acknowledged, and by some of us, with great joy. The painful rigidity of a mechanical observance of twenty-four hours is mercifully relaxing."

A notable feature of the occasion was the total absence of any Scripture for Sunday sacredness. One speaker did refer to the sacred Word by saying that "There are two hundred passages in Holy Scripture bearing upon one day in seven as a day of rest and worship," and so turned his remarks as to imply the idea that all these testimonies were in favor of Sunday, which is not the truth, as he must know. He then asked: "Is all this Scripture merely dead history? or is the principle it contains a living issue, a social problem and a high religious duty? What was given in Eden must not be lost in America."

Of course this Scripture is not a dead history. It does contain a principle,—a living principle—and embraces a living issue. It will soon become one of the issues of the times. Let every soul study those Scriptures for himself, as before God.
