A REPORT from South America says that a change in the marriage laws in Bolivia and Ecuador, where Roman Catholic rule has been longest undisturbed, is confidently looked for from the next congress. Up to the present time no marriages in those countries were legal except those performed by the priests; and as the priests would not marry any who were not Catholics, Protestants and other non-Catholics were obliged either to abstain from matrimony, or to place themselves before the public in much the same position that Mr. Roberts, of Utah, now occupies before the American people. The law made them criminals, and the church declared them adulterers; and in this way a very decided stigma was placed upon Protestantism. And this is what the Catholic Church everywhere says of Protestants everywhere.
