The following from the pen of Mr. H. K. Carroll, LL.D., on the subject of "The Religious Question in Porto Rico," which he contributes to *The Independent*, is directly along the line of the principles discussed by the SENTINEL, and should be of interest to its readers. Mr. Carroll was lately United States Special Commissioner to Porto Rico, and the "religious question" to which he refers is that of the readjustment of church affairs in the island consequent upon the transition from Spanish and Roman Catholic rule, to American rule, which in principle is Protestant. Mr. Carroll evidently understands the bearing of American principles of government upon the religious questions which have arisen in Porto Rico, and knows how to present that which those principles demand.

Notice how, as Mr. Carroll narrates, the Catholic officials endeavored to make use of the discrepancies between the American Constitution and the American practise in the United States, to maintain the old order of things in Porto Rico. The Roman priests, for instance, might be maintained at Government expense for a time without compromising the Constitution, since here in the United States the Government indirectly contributes to the churches by allowing church property to go untaxed! This is a discrepancy in American practise, and the Roman Catholics know it, and are ready to make use of it in defense of the whole papal system.

The whole principle of church and state separation for which American free government stands, may be surrendered in one seemingly small thing in American practise; and it is the constant aim of wily Catholic prelates to get the Government, through some seemingly inconsequential act, to surrender the Protestant principle and commit itself to the Catholic principle of church and state union. In Porto Rico the Catholic officials have aimed to save enough of the papal leaven to enable them in time to again leaven the whole lump.

Mr. Carroll says:—

"The passing of the interests of the Roman Catholic Church in Porto Rico from Spanish into American ecclesiastical hands will make the solution of the religious problems before us much less difficult. Fortunately our Government is neither Catholic nor Protestant, and has no entangling alliances with either the one or the other. Its course is clearly marked out for it by the Constitution. The church must be disestablished, not because it is Catholic, but simply because it is a church. The priests must find other than public means of support, not because they are priests, but because they are ministers of religion, which must pay its own bills, whether in the United States or in Porto Rico. The administrator of that diocese (the Spanish bishop, next in rank to the governor-general, having gone to Spain when evacuation took place) understood perfectly that the connection of state and church must cease, as contrary to American ideas and principles, and pleaded simply that support for the priests might be provided temporarily, until the transition could be made to the voluntary basis. He said the congregations had never been accustomed to contribute to the church, and the priests ought not to be compelled to leave or starve, and the influence of the church was greatly needed to conserve the morals of the people. Monsignor Perpiña argued that this might be done without compromising the Constitution of the United States, for our Government does contribute indirectly to the support of churches by allowing their property to remain untaxed. His zeal for his church was perfectly natural and perfectly proper. But the church was disestablished the moment American occupation was complete, without the issuing of any definite order. It seemed to be taken quite as a matter of course that payments to the church from the Insular Treasury should cease immediately, and cease they did, and that, too, without protest from the people against it. They were evidently ready for the change, because they understood it was according to the American plan, and they were quite anxious to become Americans and accept American institutions.

"General Brooke's first order as governor-general did not name the church; but in declaring that the existing system of laws would be retained in so far as it was not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, it virtually disestablished the church and nullified all those laws which give it exclusive privileges. The Insular Advisory Commission has brought upon itself the criticisms of the Catholic press of this country for proposing that priests and nuns be allowed to marry. It had in mind, doubtless, the provision of the civil code in the chapter on marriage, which prohibits priests and *religious* from marrying. The prohibition was a natural one under a Catholic government. The marriage of such persons would be a scandal to all good Catholics, and no government representing both church and state could tolerate it. It would bring reproach upon the state as well as upon the church. Under our system celibacy is simply a matter of church regulation. Ecclesiastical authorities can enforce it or not, as they see fit; but our Government can make no law commanding either obedience or disobedience to it. That provision of the Spanish code is, therefore, really of no effect; neither is that other provision, changed by General Henry, requiring all Catholics to be married according to the ecclesiastical form. No one can be debarred from civil marriage in Porto Rico by reason of any church connection, vocation or regulation.

"These and other religious questions are settling themselves without act of Congress or formal military order. Doubtless, in good time, measures will be taken for the revision of the codes, to bring them into harmony with American principles. But there are some important problems involving property which are not quite so easy of settlement. The cemeteries and the churches are claimed both by the church and the municipalities. How can decisions be reached which will serve the cause of both law and equity?

"The church does not claim any property right in the cemeteries. They were purchased and built, maintained and administered, by the municipalities, to which the right of title is conceded. But the church claims control over burials in these cemeteries, or at least in the consecrated portions. It bases its claims on these facts: 1. The cemeteries were intended for Catholic burials; 2, they were consecrated for that sole purpose by the ceremonies of the church; 3, the church has always, through its priests, indicated what bodies were entitled to ecclesiastical burial; 4, the municipalities have always acquiesced in this arrangement; 5; non Catholics have never with the consent of the church been buried in consecrated ground, but always outside the walls in the unconsecrated portion. The argument from these facts is, in essence, that immemorial usage constitutes a right; that what the church is called upon to consecrate it has the right to guard against desecration; that it would not have consecrated the cemeteries on any other condition.

"It must be admitted, I think, that this makes out a strong case. Let us see what considerations may be advanced upon the other side. This condition of things arose under a government under which church and state were combined. The governor general was Patronato Real, and the bishop had second place in rank in the civil administration. Municipalities were constrained to allow the participation of the church in control of burials, because of the legal position of the church. I do not say that it was necessary to put pressure on the municipalities. It was natural and customary and according to the fitness of things to have the cemeteries consecrated. But the municipalities were not at liberty to do otherwise. Now church and state are to be kept separate. What is the right of the state, and what is the right of the church, under the new conditions? If the Gordian knot cannot be united, shall it be cut?"

"The cemetery is not only the place where those who die may be buried, but where they must be buried. Persons may or may not use the church while they live. They can exercise choice and stay away from it, if they prefer; but there is no choice as to burial. That is compulsory. Here is a cemetery created and maintained at the expense of all taxpayers in the district. It is admitted that the title is invested in the municipality. Can it be lawful to refuse burial to any inhabitant, simply because the parish priest will not certify that he is entitled to ecclesiastical sepulture? General Henry was satisfied that the claim of the church was good, and issued an order instructing municipalities to allow the priest to indicate those entitled to burial in consecrated ground. He also obliged the municipalities to keep the cemeteries in proper condition. This would seem to be contrary to the principle of our Constitution. If the cemeteries are civil property, should the church be allowed to intervene and forbid some to be buried within their walls? If the church, on the other hand, has the right of control over burials, over, in fact, the only use which a cemetery can have, ought it not to provide for its maintenance? In answering these questions the peculiar circumstances must be fully considered. I am not sure as to the right answer. The city receives all the burial rents and returns, which are sufficient to keep the grounds in condition. But I am doubtful of the expediency of dual control.

"A former governor-general gave permission to bury a Protestant in the cemetery at Ponce. The church opposed it, but its obstruction was overcome by force and the burial accomplished. In many cemeteries after American occupation, the rule was released, and all bodies accompanied by the usual certificate from the municipal judge were received. A few municipalities took action, opening their cemeteries to all. There are, in some cases, separate grounds for the burial of non-Catholics; but they are commonly outside the walls and are unsightly and ineligible places. Freethinkers, Protestants, Jews and those Catholics who die without the rites of the church are shut out of the cemeteries by virtue of General Henry's order; other places must be provided for them. Thus families may be separated.

Catholic conscience ought not to be forced. Neither should a minority, however small, be deprived of a civil right. It ought to be possible to arrange a *modus vivenda* (not for the dead who make no trouble) by which Catholics and non-Catholics shall have equal burial in municipal grounds. The graves of Catholics can be consecrated; as in the case of the Sherman family, some of whom were Catholics and some not, yet they lie peacefully side by side, with no right denied and no conscience forced. . . .

"The question of church property will have to be considered in another article."
