A DISPATCH from this Iowa city, dated October 29, says: "For the first time in years the saloon business was absolutely closed up over Sunday to-day. Under the old prohibition regime the liquor resorts ran constantly, either surreptitiously or with the authorities' connivance. When the mulct law went into effect they were at first permitted to run only Sunday forenoons. Soon the same liberty was permitted for the rest of the day.

"A month or two ago the Sioux City Ministerial Association protested vigorously against the condition. It was not expected their action would receive much attention, but last week, to every one's surprise, the Local Retail Liquor Dealers' Association adopted resolutions asking the enforcement of the law and pledging the members to aid the police in carrying out the work. The administration granted the request, and to-day drinks were to be had only at the local clubs.

"The regulation is also being enforced against pharmacies, and for a day, at least, the town has been almost entirely dry."

The Sioux City Ministerial Association and the Local Retail Liquor Dealers' Association, it will be noticed, stand on common ground in the matter of Sunday closing. But is this fact complimentary to either the Ministerial Association or to Sunday?
