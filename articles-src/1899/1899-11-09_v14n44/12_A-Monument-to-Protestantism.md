It is interesting and gratifying to know that enough of the spirit of Protestantism is left in the leading Protestant bodies of the world to carry out the project described in the following which we quote from The Independent:—

"A few years since a movement was started in Germany to erect at Speyer (Spires), on the Rhine, a memorial to the famous protest of the German deputies and princes presented to Charles V. in 1529 at the Diet in that city, from which the name Protestants has come. As all the Protestant denominations of every form are interested in it, it was decided to have the memorial take the form of a church. A site and plans have been selected, and the building has already progressed to the height of the roof. The style is Gothic and the material a hard, yellowish gray sandstone. There will be a hexagonal tower 300 feet high, the ground floor of which is to be a memorial hall, 35 feet in diameter and 60 feet high, with a statue of Luther surrounded by the six protesting princes, while the arms of the fourteen protesting cities will be represented on the walls. Over the entrance to the church there will be a fresco representing the delivery of the protest. The Protestant princes of Europe have given windows and the German church choirs are donating the organ. It is expected that the church will seat 1,400 people, and that its acoustic properties will be excellent. The entire cost will be about $500,000, and in order that American Christians may bear their share, Dr. Beyschlag is here to represent the case and receive subscriptions."

But far better than this would it be to perpetuate the memory of the famous Protest by continuing to repeat it and practise its principles wherever the opposite principles are put forward throughout the world.
