# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, November 9, 1899 (v14n44)

## General Notes

The OCR source for this issue was produced by Mistral OCR from scanned pages. The overall quality is good. The following specific issues were noted.

---

## Page 7, "Some Straws: Louisiana"

- **Issue:** The text is in ALL CAPS throughout, which is the OCR's rendering of the original print. The word "CONCEPTS" in the New Hampshire item appears to be "CONCERTS" (the Ministers' Association was concerned about "sacred concerts" on Sunday). The OCR reads "SACRED CONCEPTS" but context makes clear this should be "SACRED CONCERTS."
- **Transcribed as:** "SACRED CONCEPTS" — preserving the OCR text exactly as a faithful transcription of what the OCR produced. However, the intended word is almost certainly "CONCERTS."
- **Confidence:** LOW — "CONCEPTS" is almost certainly an OCR error for "CONCERTS."
- **Note:** The New Hampshire item (file 20) contains this text: 'DECLARING ALL "SACRED CONCEPTS" HELD ON SUNDAY' — this should likely read "SACRED CONCERTS."

## Page 7, Louisiana "Some Straws" item

- **Issue:** The word "ESCAPDES" at the end of the Louisiana item appears to be an OCR rendering of "ESCAPADES."
- **Transcribed as:** "ESCAPDES" — preserving the OCR text exactly.
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "ESCAPADES."

## Page 4, "Inconvenience of a National Conscience"

- **Issue:** The OCR renders "m——s" in the phrase "The m——s down Boston way." This appears to be a dash-obscured word in the original print (likely "mugwumps" or similar political term, self-censored in the original).
- **Transcribed as:** "m——s" — preserving exactly as it appears.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — this appears to be a deliberate dash-censoring in the original, not an OCR error.

## Page 6, "American Principles Applied in Porto Rico"

- **Issue:** The phrase *modus vivenda* appears in the Carroll quote. The standard Latin phrase is *modus vivendi*. This may be a typo in the original or in the OCR.
- **Transcribed as:** "*modus vivenda*" — preserving exactly as OCR renders it.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — could be original typographical error or OCR misread of "vivendi."
