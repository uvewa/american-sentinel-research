IT is proposed to prepare and present to Congress, before the close of the year, a petition signed by as many names as can be secured in a vigorous canvass throughout the country, to read as follows:—

"PATRIOT'S PLEDGE

"TO DEFEND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AT THE POLLS.

"We, the undersigned voters, pledge ourselves to each other and to the American people to subordinate all other political issues, in 1900, to preservation of the free popular government founded by Washington and saved by Lincoln; to oppose at all costs the degradation of this democratic republic into a military empire; and to cast our ballots in favor of only such party platform and candidates as shall be thoroughly loyal to the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the equal rights of all mankind."
