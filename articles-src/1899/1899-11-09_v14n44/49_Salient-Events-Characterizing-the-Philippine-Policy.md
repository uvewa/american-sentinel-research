1. In April, 1898, the United States began war with Spain for the avowed purpose of liberating the people of Cuba. Congress passed a resolution declaring that "the people of Cuba are and of right ought to be, free and independent."

2. When Commodore Dewey was ordered to Manila, with his ships of war, the American consul general at Singapore informed the State Department at Washington that he had conferred with General Aguinaldo, who was then at Singapore, as to securing the co-operation of the Philippine insurgents in fighting the Spanish forces; also that he had telegraphed to Commodore Dewey that Aguinaldo was willing to come to Hong Kong (where Dewey was stationed with his fleet) to arrange with the latter for "general co-operation, if desired;" to which Dewey had replied, "Tell Aguinaldo come soon as possible."

3. Aguinaldo came to Hong Kong, the conference was held, Dewey sailed to attack the Spanish fleet in Manila harbor, and Aguinaldo was taken to Manila on an American ship of war.

4. The Philippine forces under Aguinaldo were supplied with arms by Commodore Dewey, and co-operated with the American forces in the capture of Manila.

5. The Filipino junta at Hong Kong, moved by this conference with Aguinaldo held at the request of United States officers, issued a proclamation to their people in Luzon which said: "Compatriots, divine Providence is about to place independence within our reach. The Americans, not from any mercenary motives, but for the sake of humanity, have considered it opportune to extend their protecting mantle to our beloved country. Where you see the American flag flying, assemble in mass. They are our redeemers."

6. July 5, 1898, Brigadier-General Thomas Anderson, then in command of the United States troops, wrote to Aguinaldo: "General, I have the honor to inform you that the United States of America, whose land forces I have the honor to command in this vicinity, being at war with the kingdom of Spain, has entire sympathy and most friendly sentiments for the native people of the Philippine Islands. For these reasons I desire to have the most amicable relations with you, and to have you and your people co-operate with us in military operations against the Spanish forces."

7. Immediately after the capture of Manila, the Filipino forces were ordered by the American commander to withdraw from the city and its suburbs. A request from Aguinaldo for an interview with General Merritt was refused; and the Filipino representatives were rigidly excluded at Washington and at Paris from any participation in the making of the treaty with Spain.

8. At this time there was established a Filipino government at Malolos, which controlled the territory of Luzon outside of the city and suburbs of Manila. This government was admitted by an American official who went to Malolos to have a well-organized and ably-conducted executive, and a popular assembly, or congress, which would compare favorably with the parliament of Japan.

9. December 21, 1898, President McKinley issued his "benevolent assimilation" proclamation, by which the American commander at Manila was directed to extend the military government of the United States over the entire Philippine archipelago, subduing by force of arms any who might resist. This was before the treaty with Spain had become valid by ratification in the American Senate.

10. Early in February, 1899, several Filipino soldiers entered the American lines, for what purpose is not known. An American sentry fired upon them and killed one of them. The Filipino outposts returned the fire, and a general engagement ensued between the opposing lines of the two armies. At this time many Filipino officers, including Aguinaldo's private secretary, were in Manila at the theaters and cafés.

11. The following day Aguinaldo sent an officer under a flag of truce to General Otis, to declare that the fighting had been unauthorized by the Filipino leader, that he desired it stopped, and that to this end he proposed the establishment of a neutral zone between the two armies. This proposition General Otis curtly refused, and gave Aguinaldo no alternative but to continue to fight or surrender. Since that date the fighting has been going on almost daily, with repeated overtures by the Filipinos for peace, and continued refusal by the United States to accept any terms short of full and unconditional surrender.
