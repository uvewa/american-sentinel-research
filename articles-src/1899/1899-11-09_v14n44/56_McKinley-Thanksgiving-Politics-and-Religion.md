THE *St. Paul Globe* (Minn.) complains (see p. 694) that the President in his Thanksgiving proclamation has mixed his politics with religion. It is evident that he has; but is this anything strange? As President of the United States, Mr. McKinley is purely a *political* figure. And when, as such, he issues a *religious* proclamation, what is to be expected but that in it politics and religion will get mixed together? And of course the President cannot be blamed for putting his own politics in, in preference to the politics of others.
