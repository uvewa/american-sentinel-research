"We believe," says the *Ram's Horn*, "in respecting the minority's rights, but not their delusions." But every man has a right to believe in a delusion. Every denomination regards some things in the beliefs of other denominations as delusions; will they therefore say that these others have no right to believe such things, and that in these beliefs they are not to be treated with respect? The Inquisition, before putting its victims to death, tried earnestly to impress upon their minds that they were guilty of entertaining awful delusions.
