WE have received a copy of the *Blue Ridge Baptist*, which claims to be the "only paper of its character published in Southwest Virginia." Among some "distinctive Baptist marks" to which it calls attention we note these two:—

"1. The Bible is the sole and sufficient rule in all matters of religion—to the exclusion of human tradition."

• • •

If the Baptist holds to this principle, what course must it be expected to pursue in view of the fact that the Bible declares the seventh day to be the Sabbath, sets the Sabbath law in the bosom of the unchangeable Decalogue, nowhere says that any other day is the Sabbath, and that tradition alone does assert that Sunday ought to be kept as a sacred day?

"2. God has given to every man the right to interpret Scripture for himself, and therefore man is responsible to God and God alone for his faith and practise."

Yes; God has given every man the right to interpret Scripture for himself; but this is not saying that it is right for any man to do this. And plainly, it is not right; for no man is qualified to be an interpreter of Scripture, and a man can only involve himself in error when he attempts to do it. If a man is to have a human interpretation of Scripture, he might as well take that which has been furnished by the popes and the church councils and "fathers." But he does not want his own or any other human interpretation. He does not want any "private interpretation," which every human interpretation of Scripture must. He wants an interpretation by God's interpreter—the Holy Spirit. Only such an interpretation is authoritative and safe. And this he can have through the gift of the Holy Spirit, upon terms which are too plainly set forth to be missed by any Bible reader.
