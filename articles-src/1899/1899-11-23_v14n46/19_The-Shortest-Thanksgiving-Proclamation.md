The Thanksgiving proclamation issued for this year by the governor of Kentucky, is heralded in the press as the shortest proclamation of the kind on record. It reads:—

"November 30, 1899, is hereby designated and recommended as a day of thanksgiving and prayer.
"WM. O. BRADLEY, Governor."

Governor Bradley evidently does think that the occasion of a Thanksgiving-day proclamation is one in which an official of the civil government should try to make a display in a religious capacity; for which opinion he may well be pardoned by all believers in American principles of government.

As regards the brevity of the proclamation, however, it may be remarked that the one formulated by President Thomas Jefferson was shorter than this by three lines.
