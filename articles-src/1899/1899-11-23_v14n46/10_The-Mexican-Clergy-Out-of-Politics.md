In Mexico it has been found necessary for the welfare of the State to put the clergy out of politics. On this point Vice-President Moriscal of Mexico says in The Independent:—

"Though Mexico is Roman Catholic in every fibre, she has firmly and determinedly put the clergy out of politics and kept them out. That caused the most severe of all her struggles for independence. Its magnitude may be guessed when I say that previous to 1860 a great part of the cities of Mexico consisted of churches, convents and other ecclesiastical structures, many of which have been converted into libraries, stores, warehouses, factories, or applied to other useful purposes. Previous to the triumph of the Liberals the Archbishop of Mexico received $130,000 per annum, and could absolutely make and unmake governments at his pleasure. The Spanish high priests rolled in wealth, while the native parish priests, who did the real work of the church, were in the depths of poverty.

"When the Liberals triumphed they passed the laws of reform which divided church and state, and they confiscated all church property, so that even the houses of worship are now the property of the Government. They also confined religious ceremonies to edifices, and forbade special religious instruction in the public schools.

"During the Spanish domination the Roman Catholic religion was the only one tolerated in the country, but later the Constitution established freedom of worship and Protestant missionaries entered the field. The Protestants claim that they are making great gains and that they have now about 30,000 communicants, but thoughtful Mexicans believe that they are deceived by people who seek them for the loaves and fishes. Practically the country is as Catholic as it ever was. But this does not constitute the danger to liberty that it once did. Even the most devout Catholics seem to have accepted the reforms in good faith, and the influence of the Pop has been strongly exercised for peace, reconciliation and the healing of past differences. This has naturally strengthened the church as well as the Government."

The clergy in politics, as appears from this statement, was a condition which worked against the independence of Mexico. That being so in Mexico, why will not the like thing be true in the United States? The Mexican clergy are Roman Catholic; but are the Catholic clergy, in politics, worse than other clergy in politics? The church in politics, to rule there to the extent of her power, means danger to the state, no matter what church it may be. Going into politics was the very thing which developed the papacy out of the early Christian church; and the like steps by any church to-day, can have only a like result; for whatever denomination it may be, the principle of the proceeding is the same; and the nature of an act is determined not by the name given it, but by the principle it embodies. An act may thus be Protestant in name, but papal in principle; and there are Protestant churches, which, from having gone into politics, have become papal in everything but name.

From the experience of Mexico the lesson may and should be learned that when the clergy go into politics, there is no free progress and prosperity for the state until, after a terrible struggle, the clergy are put out of politics and measures are taken to keep them out.

Let no one imagine that any good can come to this country from participation in its politics by any church, of any name or profession whatsoever.
