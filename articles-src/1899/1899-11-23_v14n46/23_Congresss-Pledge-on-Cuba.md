CONGRESS'S pledge was to leave Cuba to its inhabitants as soon as it was "pacified." Cuba is already "pacified," according to the unanimous testimony of the army officers stationed there. If, by the time of holding the national political conventions next summer, Cuba is still ruled by the United States Government, there will exist presumptive evidence that the Government has no intention of ever letting go.—*Springfield Republican.*
