CHRISTIAN Endeavorers of Mount Vernon, N. Y., have begun a crusade against the illegal selling of liquor. Much liquor, it appears, has been sold on Sundays, and the Endeavor societies are determined that such sales must stop. Their antagonism to liquor selling is certainly proper and laudable; but in a statement of the methods by which they are proceeding, we note this:—

"It is said that members of the societies took snap shots of prominent men who slipped in the side doors of saloons on Sunday."

WHILE the statement follows that this report could not be verified, it is not doubted that the Endeavorers are doing detective work to discover violations of the law, which work must of course be done on Sundays.

But where is the proper place for an Endeavorer, believing in the sacredness of Sunday as being the "Christian Sabbath," to be on that day? Is it consistent for any such to be out with their cameras taking snapshots around the corner of the saloon, or in other ways doing detective work to run down law-breakers? Is that a proper way to observe the Christian Sabbath? Is it proper for them to transgress the divine law, in order to apprehend transgressors of the laws of man? Is this proper from the standpoint of their religious belief?

Would it not be more consistent, and altogether better, for Christians to oppose the vice of intemperance with those spiritual weapons of warfare designed for Christians, and which "are mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds?"
