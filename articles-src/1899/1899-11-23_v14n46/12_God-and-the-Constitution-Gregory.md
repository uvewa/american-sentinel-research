"God and the Constitution" was the theme of a discourse by Rev. T. B. Gregory, in the Grand Opera House at Chicago, recently, in which the speaker contrasted the false and the true conceptions of what is needed in this regard:—

"The first Monday in December approaches, and the National Reform people are at their old work of trying to get the Almighty recognized in the Constitution. It is much ado about nothing. There is something that does need recognition, and that is honesty of thought and speech and deed; justice, which shall give every man his due and the rightful fruits of his toil, and love, which makes us brothers and leaves no place in the world for trusts or tramps, for millionaires or paupers. The best way to put God into the Constitution is to put good will into human hearts and righteousness into human consciences, so that the brotherhood, so long talked of, shall become a living, beautiful reality. Not by hypocritical prating about God, but by the conscientious practise of the noblest human virtues shall we dignify our Constitution and ennoble our country."
