We are told by the orthodox clergy who are agitating to put "God in the Constitution," that the majority of people in this country are "Christians," and that these demand God in the Constitution in the interest of good government. As the majority rules in our form of government, then the evils in our Government are made and sustained by "Christians."

And if the majority of the people of this country are not "Christians," it is treason to Republican institutions for these God-in-the-Constitution advocates to ask that laws shall be enacted putting their sectarian god in the Constitution, for that would be ruling by the fiat of tyranny, and not by majority rule.—*The Universal Republic.*
