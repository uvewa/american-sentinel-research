A LEADING New England journal notes that—

"Army chaplains who have been ordered to the Philippines are making great efforts to avoid the service. The Washington correspondent of the *New York Times* tells of Chaplain J. S. Seibold, now stationed at Fort Canby, Wash., who has produced records proving that he was born in 1835 instead of 1838, which was the year of his birth as he had it originally entered on the books of the war department. He thus claims to be old enough to retire. Another chaplain has also succeeded in having the order revoked, and a third is making a strong attempt to reach that end. Only one army chaplain has applied for duty in the islands, and he is a Roman Catholic priest.

"But there can be no insuperable difficulties raised on this score. The war department should draft some of the preachers outside the army who have been so warmly talking of our Christian duty to conquer and kill. There is Rev. Dr. —— of Philadelphia, now of Cambridge, we believe, who would shoot the gospel into the Filipinos. He might be ordered to try his hand at it personally. And there are many others—some of them nearer home."
