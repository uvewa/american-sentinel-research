ASTRONOMERS and others interested in phenomena of the heavens made great preparations to observe a marvelous meteoric display which it was predicted would occur on or about the 17th of this month; and, of course, they have been disappointed. The expectation was based upon the theory that every thirty-three years the earth in its course through space encounters a great mass of "meteoric dust" which also is journeying through space, and the particles of which, rushing at enormous speed through the earth's atmosphere, are ignited by the friction and so present a trail of fire across the sky. It is remembered that on the night of November 13, 1833, there was a meteoric "shower" witnessed in this hemisphere, of such awful magnitude and grandeur as to impress observers with the idea that they were beholding the end of the world. Thirty-three years later, in 1866, an unusual display of meteors was observed by astronomers and others, which however bore no comparison with the great "shower" of 1833. The two displays, however, were classed together by exponents of astronomical science, and accordingly another display was predicted for the year 1899. And this time not as much has been observed by the star gazer as was seen in 1866.

Various reasons, of course, are put forth to account for the failure. One astronomer says the meteors have been in some way deflected from the earth's path; another says the shower is not due yet for another year. But no explanation is forthcoming that appears to be anything more substantial than guess-work. The expected display has failed, and that is all that can be said of it, from the standpoint of "science."

There is, however, another way of accounting for this failure, which takes into consideration the extraordinary character of the display of 1833, upon which all calculations in the matter are based. That great display was a fulfillment of Scripture—a sign of the approaching end of the world (Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:25; Luke 21:25; Rev. 6:13). This explanation of the phenomenon of November, 1833, has been, of course, scoffingly received by the world, and the worldly-wise have had an interest ever since in proving that the "falling stars" of 1833 were not a sign of the end, but only a phenomenon fixed by natural laws, in obedience to which it would recur at certain intervals. And had any such display been observed since that time, atheists and others who do not relish the idea of the end of the world would certainly have seized upon it as an event confirming their own views and demonstrating the falsity of Scripture and the folly of the "prophets." Such an event, to constitute a sign, must stand out alone as something of which never before or since was there the like. And He who gave that great display for a sign, does not mean that its evidence, as such, shall be destroyed.

It is a fact that the star "shower" of 1833 did impress people most forcibly with the idea of the end of the world. To the awe-struck beholder this came naturally as the first thought, and everywhere among eye witnesses there was general fright and consternation. That great event, undoubtedly one of the grandest sights ever witnessed since time began, has been treasured by Bible students as a prophetic waymark which they have passed upon the stream of Time, telling of the approaching end of the long journey. And unless they are mistaken, it may safely be said that astronomers and all others will look in vain for any meteoric display recalling the great one of 1833, or which will warrant the taking of any unusual pains to behold.
