*"Present Truth." (London, Eng.)*

The infallibility of the Pope of Rome is claimed by Monsignor Vaughan partly from the following texts: "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Matt. 28:20. "I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot recive." John 16:16, 17. When He, the Spirit of truth is come, He will guide you into all truth." John 16:13. "He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you." John 14:26.

But all these things were spoken to all the disciples—to all believers, the church as a whole. There is no room for a pope of any kind, for the Holy Spirit is Christ's Representative, and He is sent to the whole church, and to each individual impartially. The humblest believer is therefore far better qualified to declare the truth than the Pope of Rome is, for each believer has all the advantages that the Pope can possibly have, with this additional advantage, that he does not profess to be pope. Self-exaltation shuts away the revelation of the Holy Spirit. Christ is meek and lowly in heart, and the truth of God is revaled unto babes. Matt. 11:25, 29. "If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine." John 7:17.
