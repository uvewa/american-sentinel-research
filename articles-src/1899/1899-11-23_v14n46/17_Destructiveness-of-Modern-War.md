The author of a book on modern war, M. Bloch, has pointed out in the same the increased destructiveness of the latest devices for killing men in battle over those formerly employed; which appears to be already demonstrated by accounts of the loss of life in the South African war. On the point of the deadly effectiveness of shell fire to day M. Bloch says:—

"In 1870 an ordinary shell when it burst broke into from 19 to 30 pieces. To-day it bursts into 240. Shrapnel fire in 1870 only scattered 37 death dealing missiles. Now it scatters 340. A bomb weighing about 70 pounds thirty years ago would have burst into 42 fragments. To-day, when it is charged with peroxilene, it breaks up into 1,200 pieces, each of which is hurled with much greater velocity than the larger lumps which were scattered by a gunpowder explosion."
