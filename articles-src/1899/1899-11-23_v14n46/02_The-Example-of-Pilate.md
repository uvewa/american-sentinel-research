PEOPLE say they have to work on the Sabbath; they will lose their position if they do not work that day, because their employers want them to work. So they are obliged (they say) to disobey the command of God.

It ought to be instructive to these persons to read the closing chapter or two in Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, and consider how Pontius Pilate was really obliged to crucify Jesus Christ. He had to do it or lose his position; and, of course, he had to keep his position, did he not? If this is necessary now, why was it not so then?

The Jews stood ready to accuse Pilate of being an enemy of Caesar and a traitor to the Roman government; so that Pilate was likely not only to lose his position, but his head as well! Surely, then, Pilate was justified in breaking the command of God, if ever such an act could be justified. He tried to persuade himself thus, and brought water and washed his hands before the Jews, to clear himself in the matter. But did he clear himself?

Pilate was warned of God not to yield to his fears and commit the act which was urged upon him by considerations of his personal welfare. But he disregarded the warning, telling himself that he had to do it.

Friends, don't follow the example of Pilate. Pilate made a terrible mistake.
