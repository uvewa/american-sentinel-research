A WHITE PLAINS (N. Y.) dispatch of recent date gives the following in relation to Sunday "rowdyism" in a neighboring town:—

"A complaint having been made to Sheriff Malloy against Sunday football playing and rowdyism in the town of Elmsford, midway between Tarrytown and White Plains, steps were taken to day to abate the nuisance. At 3 o'clock this afternoon Under-sheriff Jarvis with some thirty deputies made a descent upon the Ledger House in Helmsford, where the Marion Football Team of Irvington and the Sylvan Football Eleven of New York City were. He found fifty boys between nine and eighteen years old drinking beer and playing the slot machines. William L. Ward, the proprietor, was ordered to clear the house and close it up at once. The posse then moved to the football grounds, where at least 600 persons were awaiting the game. There were many girls present, ranging in age from thirteen to twenty. The arrival of the deputies was greeted with jeers. The deputies drove the crowd from the grounds. It was long after sundown before the deputies rid themselves of the throng."

With reference to the foregoing one may pertinently inquire: (1) Is rowdyism a thing to be stopped, because (in any case) it occurs on Sunday? and (2) If there were no law favoring idleness on Sunday, would there be the rowdyism on that day that there often is?
