The United States, in advancing its military authority across the Pacific, found it convenient if not necessary to accept the military support of Great Britain. The English view of the case is that Britain's support was necessary; that the position of the United States as a sovereign power in Asia cannot be maintained without it; and that for this England is entitled to "material" compensation.

The United States, in accepting Britain's aid, did not fix the price to be paid for the same; and now the latter power is making demands greater than the former is disposed to give. The following from the N. Y. Sun states the situation:—

"As for the British demand that Pyramid Harbor or some other Alaskan seaport shall be made over as a free gift to Canada in advance of the proposed arbitration, we are at a loss to know what consideration England can offer for such a sacrifice. What obligation we may have incurred to England at the outset of the war with Spain has been, by this time, discharged. Since the conclusion of the modus vivendi, which, it was supposed, would quiet the Canadian clamor about Alaska for at least a year, we have rendered services of vital importance to Great Britain.

"By our announcement that we were resolved to maintain the 'open-door' policy in China, by the orders given to strengthen greatly our fleet in the Far East, and by the intimation that our South American squadron would be sent to the southeast coast of Africa, we indicated with all the clearness possible on the part of an American Executive, which does not possess the power of declaring war, that, in the event of the formation of a Continental coalition against England, the moral, and if need be, the material, influence of the United States would be arrayed on England's side."

It is evident that Great Britain does not allow that American obligation to her has been discharged, or that the attitude of friendship displayed by the United States in the face of a prospective European coalition against Great Britain, is all that the latter has a right to ask. And it is a bad time to fix the price of anything after the goods have been delivered and accepted.
