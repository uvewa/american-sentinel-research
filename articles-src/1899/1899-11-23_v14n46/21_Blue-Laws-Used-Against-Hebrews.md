### THREE CARPENTERS AT ANSONIA FINED FOR WORKING ON SUNDAY.

*New York "Sun."*

ANSONIA, Conn., Nov. 13.—Three Hebrew carpenters from New Haven who are building a dwelling for Charles Leebjesky, in this city, were complained of to the police on Sunday for disturbing the neighborhood by working on the new house. They were arrested, and this morning before Judge Bryant in the City Court they pleaded their own cases. They had intended to plead that having abstained from work on Saturday they had a right to work on Sunday, but after consultation with their friends they abandoned this plan and said that they were engaged in a work of mercy. They were putting up the rafters, and as a strong gale was blowing down the river on the bank of which the house stands, they were afraid the rafters would blow over into the street and injure passers-by. Carpenters testified that nothing less than a tornado would blow over the rafters and the court fined the men $1 and costs each. This is the first time the old Puritan Sabbath law has ever been enforced here.
