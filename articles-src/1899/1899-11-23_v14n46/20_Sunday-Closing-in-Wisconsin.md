"SABBATH" OBSERVANCE SOCIETY TO BEGIN ACTIVE MOVEMENT AT HOSHKOSH.

*Chicago "Times-Herald."*

OSHKOSH, Wis., Nov. 5.—A convention that bids fair to stir up things in this city before the winter is over will open here a week from to-morrow. It is the annual gathering of the State Sabbath-Observance Society. It will last three days and will be attended by about one hundred people.

The real purpose of the convention is the establishment of a local Sabbath-observance society, which, as soon as it gets in working order, will inaugurate a "Sunday-closing campaign." At present saloons and places of amusement are open on Sunday, though conducted in a quiet manner. The society will attempt to close them all up and enforce the Sunday-observance laws to the letter.

A similar movement was started four years ago. A detective was hired and several prosecutions brought, but the juries refused to believe the detective, and acquittal followed in every case. Still, there was a good deal of bitterness developed then and probably will be now.
