[The rise of state religion, in the countries professing Christianity, began with a repudiation of the authority of God, which was repudiated by a repudiation of his Sabbath. Upon this subject we note the following in the Sabbath Recorder:—]

When men began to cast the Sabbath and the law of God aside, they naturally sought for something to take their place; for men must have some standard of authority in matters of religion. Gradually a number of annual or occasional festivals were transferred from the paganism which still held the greater part of the people. The sun-god was at this time a great favorite in the Roman Empire, and at the opening of the fourth century the Emperor Constantine the Great was a special devotee of this god, Apollo. Under the law of the empire, the emperor was Pontifex Maximus—that is, Great High Priest. As such, it was his duty to appoint all festivals and religious holidays. The day of the sun had already become associated with the resurrection of Christ, and in 321 A. D. the emperor made the first Sunday law. It was wholly pagan as to its language and spirit, and there was no reference in it to anything Christian, or to the "venerable day of the sun" as being in any way a Christian institution.

Neither did the pleas that were put forth in favor of observing Sunday in commemoration of the resurrection of Christ make any claims to Biblical authority. The prominence given to the sun's day by the civil law, and the stigma placed upon the Sabbath as being only Jewish, gave great advantage to the Sunday in the struggle for popularity with the masses who came into the church from among the heathen. The civil law was exalted as the standard of authority for Sunday, and the Sabbath was left without authority as fast as the growth of the pagan influence could destroy it.

But a still more powerful change was going on in the development of the idea of the "Catholic Church," whose authority was made to be supreme in matters specifically religious. The idea of Christianity as the universal religion rested upon an important truth. But the embodiment of that truth in a state church was a serious perversion of the truth. Nevertheless the spirit of the time, and the prevalent pagan conception that religion should be controlled by the civil authority, made it practically impossible to escape the new standard of "church authority," backed by the empire, after the Bible had been deposed from its rightful place.

Thus it came to pass that the legalized religion was, in time, the accepted religion. And as this must find embodiment in an organization, the establishment of the papacy was an inevitable result of that first step which declared the law of God void, and so made it a necessity that other standards should be erected and enforced. The time of this development which culminated in the full establishment of the papal church is properly designated, in general, as from the middle of the second to the middle of the fifth century.

It is not possible to fix upon a definite date for the beginning nor for the culmination of a movement which was a gradual evolution, and the result of a long series of influences. Still it may be said without fear of successful contradiction, that the germ of the whole movement which produced the Roman Catholic, or papal church, was involved in the denial of the fundamental truth of the supreme authority of the Bible in matters of religious faith and practise.

In this apostatizing movement the Sabbath was a prominent point of attack, because it represented God so fully, and challenged the false claims of the church-authority theory as no other command of the Decalogue did or could. The history of the "Dark Ages," during which the papal power was practically supreme, repeats and emphasizes the fact that the Bible and the Sabbath shared the same fortunes as to regard and authority. They were both cast out, or subordinated wholly to the authority of the church. But antinomianism and no-Sabbathism underlaid the entire movement.
