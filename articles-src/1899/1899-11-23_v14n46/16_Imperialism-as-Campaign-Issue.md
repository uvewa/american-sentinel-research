There is much dispute in this country over the question whether imperialism, as a policy of the Government, really exists or not. Whichever view one may take, it is a fact beyond any dispute that imperialism has been made a campaign issue in the recent elections and bids fair to become a leading issue in the greater campaign of 1900. This, for a myth, would be a remarkable record. It may also be noted, as bearing on the question, that the Government, under the influence of something, has become intimately friendly with an empire, and has turned its back upon two republics which are struggling for their lives in South Africa.
