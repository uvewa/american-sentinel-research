BY THOMAS ROBERT WILLIAMSON.

"God and my right," the kings of a land
Inscribe these words above their throne,
Making proud claim secure to stand
Chosen of God to rule, alone.
"Dieu et mon droit."

His right, the king's, and as he permits
Rights may be held by those below.
His right divine, enthroned he sits,
And all obey, he wills it so.
"Dieu et mon droit."

Man and his right, the right of each man,
Of soul to feel, of mind to know,
Of hand to act, this better plan
Has come in later days I trow.
"Dieu et mon droit."

And the phrase fits as well as of old
Dieu et mon droit, God and my right,
My right divine to have and hold
My native, free, God-given birthright.
"Dieu et mon droit."

My right to work and my right to play,
My right to worship as I will;
To live my life, my night, my day,
Low-born and poor, I cry out still,
"Dieu et mon droit."

Shall king, or state, or a church? presume
To rob me of this gift of God?
Must my heart quail, my knee assume
A slavish pose at man's proud nod?
"Dieu et mon droit."

God and your right, toiling fellow-man,
We'll cry together toward God's throne.
We need the same, God's equal plan
That makes us brothers and Christ's own.
"God and our right."

And if oppressed let us lift no sword;
Just trust that One on whom we call.
Our right's divine, and God the Lord
Is our defense, our hope, our all.
"Dieu et mon droit."

There's a state, a king, a land of fame;
Soon shall I call their freedom mine.
Tyrannic force shall sink in flame,
And love's sweet bond shall ever join
"Dieu et mon droit."

Oakland, Cal.
