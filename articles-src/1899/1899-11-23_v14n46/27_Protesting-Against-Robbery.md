Writing of "Some Claims of Christian Missions in China," in the N. Y. Christian Advocate, the Rev. George B. Smyth says:—

"The history of the last three years in China has been one of momentous changes, political, industrial, and educational. The Japanese war showed China to be a vast agglomeration of people held together by no strong central government, and ready to fall to pieces whenever the Western Powers were ready to strike the necessary blows. Some blows have been struck, and the disintegrating process has begun. On the north Russia has stripped her of her fairest possession, Manchuria; Germany is in practical possession of Shantung; England has a mortgage on the valley of the Yangtse; France is waiting for Kwanghsi and Kwangtung; Italy has her eye on Chekiang; and the only remaining seaboard province, Fookien, the scene of the most successful Christian work in the empire, is claimed by Japan.

"To the people of China all this shows the Western Powers to be simply armed robbers, who are determined to despoil them of their territory, and whom it is impossible to resist. The conduct of the so called Christian Powers has been in direct opposition to the teaching of their religion, and the best of the people turn away from a fath which is powerless to restrain from unrighteousness the nations which profess it. It is easy for the West to talk of its benevolent purposes and its civilizing mission; to the people concerned the process is mere robbery.

"Christian missions are therefore needed in China as a witness to the righteousness of Christianity, a protest against the outrages perpetrated in its name."

But how can the Christian missionaries effectively protest against these outrages committed by the "Christian nations," when they remain identified with those very governments themselves? When Christian missionaries go before the heathen not as representatives of a government which in the name of Christianity perpetrates outrages upon those for whom they labor, but only of the government of heaven, then will Christianity cease to be identified with hypocrisy and injustice in the heathen view, and then will Christian missionary effort be freed from an incubus under which it is hopelessly handicapped in heathen fields.
