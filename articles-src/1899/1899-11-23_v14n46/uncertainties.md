# Uncertainties — v14n46 (November 23, 1899)

## Poem "Dieu Et Mon Droit" by Thomas Robert Williamson

- **Location:** Page 3, stanza 8, line 2
- **Issue:** OCR shows "Just trust that One*on whom iwe call." — asterisk before "on" and "iwe" appear to be OCR artifacts
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Just trust that One on whom we call."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — "iwe" is clearly an OCR artifact for "we"; asterisk is a scan artifact; the line reads perfectly with correction
- **Reason:** Context and meter confirm "we" is correct; the asterisk appears in OCR but is not a real character in original

## Page 10, "The Mexican Clergy Out of Politics"

- **Location:** Page 5, Vice-President Moriscal quote, near end
- **Issue:** OCR reads "the influence of the Pop has been strongly exercised" — likely "Pope" with final "e" cut off by column edge or scan artifact
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "the influence of the Pop has been strongly exercised" (preserved as OCR rendered it; likely "Pope")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "Pop" for "Pope" is almost certainly an OCR truncation error, but preserving OCR reading; a reviewer with access to original should confirm
- **Reason:** Context makes "Pope" the obvious intent, but without original scan access cannot confirm

## Page 13, "Protesting Against Robbery"

- **Location:** Page 13, Rev. Smyth quote
- **Issue:** OCR reads "the best of the people turn away from a fath which is powerless" — "fath" appears to be OCR error for "faith"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "a fath which is powerless" (preserved as OCR rendered it)
- **Confidence:** HIGH that "faith" is intended — but preserving OCR reading; reviewer with original should confirm
- **Reason:** "fath" is an obvious OCR truncation or scan artifact for "faith"; context confirms

## Page 13, "The Truth about Infallibility"

- **Location:** John 16:16-17 citation
- **Issue:** OCR reads "cannot recive" — misspelling of "receive" present in OCR
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "cannot recive" (preserved as OCR rendered it)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — could be original typo in the newspaper, or OCR error; preserved as found

## Poem attribution — "Oakland, Cal."

- **Location:** Page 3, after poem by Thomas Robert Williamson
- **Issue:** "Oakland, Cal." follows the poem as a dateline/location. This is the author's location, not a separate item.
- **Decision:** Included as part of the poem file as the author's location notation.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

## Page 16 "Back Page Notes" — "Thomas B. Reed" note

- **Location:** Page 16
- **Issue:** OCR reads "Ex-speaker Thomas B. Reed, now a lawyer of this city" — "Ex-speaker" is hyphenated in the original
- **Transcribed as:** "Ex-speaker Thomas B. Reed"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — preserved as rendered

## News Notes section header

- **Issue:** The "NEWS NOTES AND COMMENT" section on page 8 contains multiple distinct items separated by asterisk rows (* * *). Each distinct topical unit was split into its own file (articles 14–19 in this issue).
- **Decision:** Split into individual articles per project instructions. The section heading itself was not given a separate file as it is just a department header.
