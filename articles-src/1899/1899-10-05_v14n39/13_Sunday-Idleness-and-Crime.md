The idea that the civil government ought also to be religious, never has to go further than to Scotland to find facts for an illustration. Recently the city council of Glasgow, by a vote of forty-eight to twelve, denied a petition presented by several labor unions, the University faculty, and even some leading clergymen, asking for the opening of the People's Palace, with its art gallery, on Sunday. The account states that "Dr. John Hunter, of Trinity Congregational Church, presented the petition. He represented that drunkenness and licentiousness were more rife on Sunday than on other days, and largely so because of compulsory inactivity and idleness. Sunday should meet every need of our higher nature, and bring opportunity for quiet and elevating recreation, as well as for meditation and worship. This larger view of the best use of the day for physical and intellectual as well as moral and spiritual needs must not, he said, be confounded with its desecration. Similar arguments were used by other ministers supporting him; but the Presbyteries of the Established, Free, and United churches, together with other religious bodies, made common cause in opposition, and carried the day."

It is just as true in America as in Scotland that "drunkenness and licentiousness"—and mischief in other forms—will be more rife on Sunday than on other days because of compulsory idleness. If a person will not occupy himself religiously on Sunday—and no law can make him do that—for the sake of all that is good let him be occupied in honest work or innocent recreation.

The prosperity of a country depends, not on the abundance of its revenues, nor on the strength of its fortifications, nor on the beauty of its public buildings; but it consists in the number of its cultivated citizens, in its men of education, enlightenment and character. Here are to be found its true interests, its chief strength, its real power.—Martin Luther.
