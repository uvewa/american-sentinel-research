Because of the test through which Admiral Dewey passed so successfully in Manila bay, on May 1 of last year, the American people have accorded him an unprecedented welcome home, and in so doing have imposed upon him the greatest test of all; for any man that can receive such homage and flattery as has been tendered him, without having his head completely turned and falling into the snare which pride sets for every finite mortal, is a most extraordinary man among his fellows. We sincerely hope that Admiral Dewey may again prove to be equal to the occasion, and may escape the harm which his well-meaning but unthinking friends have sought to do to him.
