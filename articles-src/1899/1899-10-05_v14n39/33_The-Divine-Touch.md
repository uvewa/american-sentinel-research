Perhaps the most expressive feature in the work and life of Jesus Christ was the fact that "he touched men." He did not harangue the masses or endeavor to rule the government. He met individuals in their need, and touched them. His work was a work of personal interest. He sought the individual. He talked to Nicodemus by night, and to the woman at Jacob's well. He called Zaccheus down from the tree, and Peter from his fishing boat. He sought to comfort Martha, of Bethany, and finally whispered the promise of life to a man awaiting death on the cross. If you would work as he worked, take personal interest enough in men to touch them in their need.—Ex.
