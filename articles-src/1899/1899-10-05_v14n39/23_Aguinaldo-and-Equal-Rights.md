The advocates of an imperial policy for this nation never tire of instituting comparisons between the Filipino leader, Aguinaldo, and the revered "first American," George Washington; much to the disadvantage, of course, of the former. Having settled the point that Aguinaldo is in no way worthy of comparison with Washington, they assume that no question can remain of the superior rights of Washington and his followers over those of Aguinaldo and his followers, and the case for imperialism is proved.

But thereby they expose the fatal weakness of their cause, judged from the standpoint of American principles of government. For under those principles, no question is raised regarding the mental and moral qualifications of one man in comparison with another, or of one set of men in comparison with another set. With those principles there is no respect of persons; but it is expressly declared that "all men are created equal" in the matter of natural rights. And nothing could more plainly show the unamerican character of the plea made in behalf of imperialism than the fact that it assumes that men have not equal rights because they have not equal intelligence and capabilities.

That Aguinaldo can not be compared with Washington, is true enough. But this has nothing at all to do with the question. The distinctively American doctrine is that all men have equal rights in spite of any and all inequalities between them. The poor ignorant negro slave toiling for his white master in the South, could not be compared with Washington; but the United States fought a most dreadful civil war to establish the doctrine that that poor slave had equal rights with the white man; and that doctrine, having been established at such a fearful cost to the nation, ought to be respected and maintained in this land to day.

The doctrine that all men have equal rights is a divine necessity. If it were not true, the gospel itself would not be true; and to deny one is to deny the other. Upon no other basis than that of the truth of this doctrine could the gospel work be carried on. For the gospel requires each man to believe for himself, to work out his own salvation, to give account of himself before God; and to do this he must be independent. If it could be right that a man should be the property of his fellow-man, subject to the will of his owner, God could not rightfully hold that man responsible for not exercising a will of his own for the salvation of his soul. God could not rightfully require a man to stand independently of all others in the day of Judgment, if he were not rightfully independent before that day.

It is true that the doctrine of equal rights has been but little recognized in the history of the world, and that the work of the gospel has proceeded in the earth under the most despotic forms of government. And it is true that the gospel forbids men to rise in rebellion against the government. But this is required in recognition of the power and supremacy of God, and not in recognition of the justice of the government. The gospel counsels all men to live in peace, but never sanctions governmental injustice. It has been proclaimed to the people living under monarchical government, but has never admitted the truth of the claims made by monarchs, such as that "the king can do no wrong," and that the subjects of the king were bound to obey him in all things. But always, it has affirmed the truth that men are by right free and independent, not only in theory, but by requiring every man to act in harmony with it. It has required men always to disobey any command, backed up by no matter how much of human authority which conflicted with the right. And in thus disobeying the commands of human governments, Christians have affirmed, the truth of what the Declaration of Independence says, that "all men are created equal," and "are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." They have proclaimed this to be true, and that the institutions of despotism existed not because they were right, but only because of divine tolerance.
