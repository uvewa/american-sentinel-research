It has been pointed out in previous issues of the SENTINEL that imperialism is against Christianity; that it is contrary to Christianity in principle, and against it in practise as illustrated by the situation in the Philippine Islands. We do not, however, depend upon anti-imperialist sources for a statement of the religious significance of the national imperialist policy. This was made by Dr. Lyman Abbott, who is both an ardent "expansionist" and a "representative Christian," at the late International Congregational Council in Boston. Dr. Abbott put the gospel behind imperialism as the proper order to be followed in the work of evangelizing the world; stating that gospel mission work, going before the sword of imperialism in foreign lands, has been practically a failure. The significance of his words lies not in the fact that Dr. Abbott personally holds such views, but in the fact that, as the leading representative of the war-indorsing clergy of the land, he spoke for them and laid down the line upon which the issue for or against imperialism is to be fought out in the forum of the church.

The gist and meaning of Mr. Abbott's speech are well set forth in the following which we quote from the Springfield Republican (Mass.) of September 24:—

"It is fortunate for the discussion of our burning and all-important Philippine problem that one of its most ardent advocates, Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott, has been given a full opportunity to show what the essence of our policy is, and how far he, as a representative Christian, is ready to go in its support. The address of Dr. Abbott before the International Congregational Council Friday forenoon was an affirmation of the superiority of law in the development of mankind, compared with the force of the Christian spirit. The address ought to be published verbatim and read thoughtfully by every clergyman and layman who sympathizes with the McKinley policy of conquest.

"The practical repudiation of Christian missions as a pioneer force in civilization is formally and flatly made a part of Dr. Abbott's creed. He said that missions 'may save some individual lives, and will emancipate some fragments of some tribes, but as far as the illumination of Africa is concerned the mission stations are like glow-worms in the midnight darkness of a great meadow. If Africa is to be redeemed, first must go the law and after that the gospel.' A little further on he said, in so many words, that he put law before the gospel as the means of the world's redemption, and said that the authority of the law must be established before an effort is made to give the gospel. His argument was supported by the illustration of England's course, and he favored military conquest of inferior nations as a preliminary to giving them the gospel.

"It will be recalled by all those who have heard the arguments of such teachers as the late Julius H. Seelye, and who are familiar with the present argument for Christian missions, that the fundamental argument for missions as against other civilizing forces is that they alone can pave the way to civilization on the right basis, and that there is no civilizing efficacy in trade or in the contact of heathenism with civilization, apart from the latter's Christian influence. But Dr. Abbott has in public and with emphatic formality, declared that the present missionary policy is a failure, and he holds up to ridicule what has been done by the American board and other missionary bodies in Africa for over half a century. By the same standard, the missions in China and all other parts of the world are a failure. Yet the American board has heard, year after year, for seventy five years, reports from the front which have encouraged them to labor on, struggling for larger rewards. Only last year it was proved how wonderfully successful our missions had been, especially in China, and already it is said by the officials that this last year has resulted in more progress than in any previous year in the history of the board.

"But, according to Dr. Abbott, these are all baseless and the work is in the wrong direction. First of all should come the military conquest of Africa, China, and the other heathen parts of the world. Force should be used, and after that has prevailed, then the gospel of love should be preached to the people whom the armies were killing just before. He justified war in his apotheosis of law. 'The army is a necessary means of enforcing obedience to law,' he said, and his whole argument was in defense of the predominance of force until force shall have conquered the world, and then it will be ample time to preach about divine love.

"Dr. Abbott had the support of a material part of his audience. Certainly, also, he did not have the support of another material part. Neither side can claim the majority, though Dr. Abbott doubtless received the louder demonstrations of approval. But Dr. MacKennal, in his clear and forceful presentation of the case against war, did not round out his sentences so as to command applause as Dr. Abbott did, and the audience was not provoked to applaud as by Dr. Abbott. But the fundamental positions of these men ought to be carefully considered. Dr. Abbott deftly wove a plea for the enforcement of law, and, having established principles regarding the enforcement of police regulations with which there would be general agreement, befogged the issue by applying those principles to all peoples who are inferior in military strength to some nation which might see fit to make war upon them. His theory would amply justify Russia in enforcing her despotism upon a people as free as the Swiss. It puts upon the strong nation the obligation to conquer the weak, and the strong one is always to be judge of the need of the conquest for the benefit of humanity, and there is no recognition whatever of any rights of property, life or liberty on the part of the weaker nation. If the Boers stand in the way of the Cape-to-Cairo railroad, then the Boers must be crushed. If the Filipinos do not have as good a government as the United States—no matter how perfect may be the order which now reigns in Luzon under Tagal rule, and no matter how hopeful may be the future if they are given the opportunity to rise,—they must be slaughtered until they yield.

"Dr. Abbott's argument repudiates entirely the spirit of Christianity. He would abolish all missionary effort until military conquest has been completed, and he would insist upon the doctrine of might makes right, provided the might is exercised by a man who says that he wants to promote civilization. But almost every conqueror says that.

"It is well for the imperialists that Dr. Abbott has made his deliverance, and the two sides may well fight out the discussion on the line he laid down, for imperialism comes to that, though some do not admit it. But he sees it and admits it, and now it is to be hoped that there will be clearer thinking among his followers. Imperialism rests upon force and disregard of the rights of man and of the progress of Christianity. If the Congregational Council has done no other good to the public, it has more sharply defined the principles which are involved in this tremendous contest."
