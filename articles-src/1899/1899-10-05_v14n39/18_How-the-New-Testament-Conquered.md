A ROMAN CATHOLIC priest in a village near Morlax, France, warned his flock that he had power to give absolution to any of them who might be guilty of theft, lying, or any other sin; but if any of them were guilty of reading the New Testament, he could not absolve them.

In the audience was a young man who, from his violent conduct, was the terror of the village, even his parents having to defend themselves against their son. This young man, hearing the priest's statement, said to himself: "I have committed all the sins the priest has mentioned, yet he will give me absolution for all, if I do not read the book. What kind of a book can this be? I am going to get one and read it."

When we went to the colporter, the man, knowing his character, at first refused, thinking he was only jesting; but when he saw that he was in earnest and explained his reasons, he gave him one.

A few days afterward his mother said: "How is it that Jean is so quiet and sober lately? He is never drunk, and retires to his own room after dinner."

The father replied, "I don't know, but I will follow him."

The next day, going quietly to the door of his son's room, he found him intently reading a book.

He returned and told the mother, "He is in his room reading some book; I believe it is a New Testament."

She replied, "If that is all the harm the New Testament is doing, ask him to come and read it to us. Perhaps we shall get some good from it."

He came and did so. God blessed the reading to the father, mother, and lastly to himself.

The mother sent to the missionary, saying: "I will take the furniture out of one of my rooms and place chairs in it. If you will come and read the Word of God to the neighbors, and tell them, though the priest refuses to give them absolution, God has forgiven us, and will also forgive them."

The missionary did so, and God blessed the telling of the old, old story to many souls.

Some time after this the mayor sent for the missionary, and said, "I don't know how it is, but when the Bible went into that house it was the pest of the village, but now it is the paradise of the place."

This proves that the Word of God is still "quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." Heb. 4:12.
