IN spite of all the barriers that modern sanitary science could erect across its path, the "plague" has made a steady march around the earth from India to South America, touching Egypt, Portugal, and other countries on the way. A writer who has studied the matter points out that the plague is deceptive in its working, beginning with a few cases of a mild type in the city attacked, then apparently dying out, only to reappear later with increased intensity and virulence, defying efforts which would be sufficient to check other epidemics. First it is confined to the "natives" living in unsanitary quarters of the city; but ere long it begins to number Europeans and people in sanitary districts among its victims. Such a hold has it now secured on the great city of Bombay, that medical experts declare the city is doomed, and the scourge will not die out until it finds no more victims on which to feed.
