THE "hero of Manila" was made the center of a most tremendous demonstration of honor in this city on the last two days of the month. And this furnishes occasion for observing that worldly honor is a peculiar thing; in that, while it seems to be intended as a favor, it is really given without any regard whatever for the welfare of the recipient. For what mortal can, with safety to himself, be set on a pinnacle of fame and deluged with flattery by his fellowmen? What injury is worse than that which vanity inflicts, what fall greater than that which pride precedes? And the world knows this, but what cares the world about it? Let the victim face the danger and take the consequences, is its decision. And since worldly honor is not given to serve the interests of its recipient, is there really any other than a selfish motive actuating the ones who bestow it?
