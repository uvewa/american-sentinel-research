THE Protestant Episcopal Diocesan convention, which was in session in this city the 28th inst., resolved "That we view with sorrow and fear the wide decay in the observance of the Lord's day and the other sacred times and seasons of the Christian year." This is the first time we have heard any concern expressed over the "other sacred times and seasons" of the year, and these might well have been more clearly defined in the report. When a "Protestant" church begins to feel so much regard for the "sacred times and seasons of the Christian year," it is getting on to the ground occupied by the Church of Rome, and for the preservation of the "sacred times and seasons" may well copy from the practises of that church by which "sacred times and seasons" were first instituted. The only sacred time known to Christianity is the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week.

The attention of the convention might profitably have been called to the fact that the only Sabbath observance which is decaying is that which is backed up by the laws of the States. That which has no aid from the civil power—the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath—is not decaying, but is steadily on the increase.
