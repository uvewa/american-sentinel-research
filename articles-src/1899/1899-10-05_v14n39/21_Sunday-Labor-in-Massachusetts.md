Touching the subject of the outcry raised by some would-be reformers over the prevalence of Sunday labor, it is stated on good authority that "out of 1,100,000 in Massachusetts engaged in gainful occupations, only 37,000 are employed on Sundays. This does not include those in domestic service, but does include 18,000 persons employed on railroads and steamboats. The remaining 19,000 are employed in hotels, restaurants, and other miscellaneous industries. There is no increase of Sunday labor, except in the business of transportation."
