The trouble about the Church of England religion, the Roman Catholic religion, the Mohammedan religion, and others, is, that they are machine-system religions, soulless, sordid, formal. Such religious systems are first-rate for "business," and for bossing politics and manipulating government. Machine religion, a religion of forms, is one that doesn't require its votaries to burden themselves seriously with piety or restraint. The bosses (priests) attend to all that, vicariously. Such machine is a valuable adjunct to business and money getting.—Washington Chronicle.
