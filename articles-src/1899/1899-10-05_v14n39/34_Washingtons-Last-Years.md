*IDEALLY HAPPY WERE THE GREAT STATESMAN AND HIS WIFE AT MOUNT VERNON.*

At the time of his retirement to Mount Vernon, after the expiration of his term as President, "the tall figure of Washington was only slightly bent, and he was still supposed to weigh upward of two hundred pounds," writes William Perrine, in "The Last Years of Washington's Life," in the October Ladies' Home Journal. "Excepting his gray hair and his false teeth, and some trouble in hearing, there was little of the usual appearance of age in his muscular person, his gait and his strong, pock-marked face. He was affable and merry with his best friends, but while he had the true hospitality of a Southern gentleman in inviting every visitor from a distance to his table or to a bed over night, his politeness was generally formal. Yet if he particularly enjoyed the conversation of a guest he would pay him the compliment of listening to him until after nine o'clock, or even of lighting him with the candle to a bedroom for the night. Mrs. Washington at this time was a healthy, pleasant and unostentatious little woman, still showing traces of good looks and with seldom any other thought than of playing respectably her rôle of mistress of the house of a country gentleman, of caring for the negroes, or of amusing herself with her knitting. She had great pride in her receipt for making 'cherry bounce,' and on a midsummer day she cut out thirty-two pairs of breeches for the men working on the farm. She had said that she and the General felt like children just released from school when he left the Presidency, and she told of her satisfaction in settling down again to the 'duties of an old-fashioned Virginia housekeeper, steady as a clock, busy as a bee, and cheerful as a cricket.'"
