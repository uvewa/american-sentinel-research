A MASS meeting to protest against Sunday work was held in Duluth, Minn., September 24, in the First Methodist Church; about five hundred people being in attendance. The striking feature of the occasion was that it represented a combination of the clergymen and trade unions to work for Sunday enforcement. This has been a marked feature of the Sunday-enforcement movement in Pennsylvania the past year; but is as yet comparatively a new thing in the Sunday movement. It is, as we have before observed, a feature of great significance.

The movement in Duluth originated in a desire to stop Sunday work on the city docks. The president of the "trades assembly" was the first speaker. He said the labor organizations are against Sunday labor, and advocated the enforcement of strict Sunday laws as the only solution of the Sunday labor problem. The necessity of Sunday observance was urged by some from the standpoint of the interests of organized labor, and by others from the standpoint of religious obligation; both which reasons were combined as the basis of resolutions which were adopted.

Somehow the meeting overlooked the very important truth that, Sabbath observance being a duty toward God, as plainly specified in the moral law, its enforcement must be left to those agencies which are ordained to secure obedience to God, and hence can not properly be enforced by any human authority and power.
