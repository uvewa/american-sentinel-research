To a reporter for the Washington Post, Senator Mason, of Illinois, said recently that he would continue in Congress his opposition to the Philippine war, and added:—

"People make a great mistake when they say that I am against expansion. I am not. But expansion by purchase or any other honorable means is one thing; expansion by force is another. I do not believe that there was any necessity for this war upon the Filipinos. I believe that if we had adopted a resolution in Congress, assuring those people as we assured the Cubans that we had no selfish designs upon them, we never would have met with any opposition in the Philippines. The fact is that we have given the Filipinos every reason to distrust us, and they are fighting for their own liberty.

"Talk about hauling down our flag! Will not our flag come down in Cuba? Certainly it will, if we are true to our promises. And the day that it comes down will be the biggest day in our history, because it will show that we are a great, unselfish nation, devoted to the eternal principles of right and honesty. If the Cubans want to be annexed later that is another question. Why can not we deal with the Filipinos in the same way?"
