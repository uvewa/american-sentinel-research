As no one can keep a command of God without faith, and Sabbath-keeping is a command of God, no one can keep the Sabbath without faith; and therefore all the resolutions that can be passed by trades unions, or legislation enacted, on the subject of Sabbath observance, can not promote such observance in the least.
