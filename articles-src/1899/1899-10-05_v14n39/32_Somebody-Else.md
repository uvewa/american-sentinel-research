The little opposition member in our family rose from prayers the other morning with the exclamation, "Papa, I had to open my eyes four times at prayers to see if Ruthie had her eyes shut."

Child life is not the only sphere where the doings of "somebody else" cause trouble. Grown-up children frequently permit Satan to put them on his private detective list. Thus the good that they would do is marred by watching for the inconsistencies of others. God has not made you the sin-bearer of the world, nor yet of your brother. "Every man must give an account of himself to God." When we begin measuring the life of another it means that we neglect our own. Christ's message is, "What is that to thee; follow thou me." God is well able to look after the "somebody else" without our selfish interference.—Bible Echo.
