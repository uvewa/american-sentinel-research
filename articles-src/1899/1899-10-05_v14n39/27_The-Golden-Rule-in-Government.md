A WRITER on the solution of certain questions recently said: "We have committed the Golden Rule to heart: now let us commit it to life."

You may think this doesn't mean very much, but if you will stop to consider it, you will find it to be the very best solution of every difficulty between men, and between nations. It is the best solution of the question we have just been considering,—the equality of rights in the Transvaal, irrespective of religious differences.

Do you think it would aid any in the settlement of the differences between England and the Transvaal? Let us get this rule before us, that we may study it: "As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise." Luke 6:31. I am quite sure that all existing difficulties could be settled by this rule, and that obedience to this rule would prevent difficulties. Let us see: Does any man wish to be deprived of his right to worship God according to his own convictions? Does he wish to be compelled to serve God as some one else may dictate? Then will he in any way lend his influence to deprive others of this right, or compel them to adopt certain forms of worship? Certainly not! Committing this rule to life, then, guarantees religious liberty to every man.

The people of the Transvaal would do well to study this divine rule, in view of the question that has been submitted to them for a year.

Does any man wish to be deprived of his rights of citizenship, which includes the privileges and the protection of the government, and a voice in its affairs locally and generally? It may be suggestive to inquire just here: What would be the need of governmental laws, if all would commit the Golden Rule to life? I would then love my neighbor as myself; hence I would regard his property, his life, his character, his rights as sacred as my own,—not because the law compelled me thus to do, but because I committed the Golden Rule to life.

Human governments enact laws regulating man's duty to his fellow-man, and this is necessary, because men have not committed the Golden Rule to life. But the Scripture is true, just the same: "The law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners;" and this is illustrated in the life of Christ in human flesh. He was a righteous man, not a sinner, so the law was not made for him. Could he therefore break it? and did he ignore human laws? By no means. He kept every just and right law; not because the law said "Thou shalt," and "Thou shalt not," but because he had committed to life the Golden Rule—because he loved his neighbor as himself. But bear in mind that Christ did not obey human laws, when those laws brought him into conflict with his duty to God.

The Lord has never sanctioned his law which would inflict punishment on a man who is not a sinner; therefore no human law could rightfully have put Christ to death,—nor can any human law rightfully inflict punishment upon a man who to-day obeys the law of God.

The Golden Rule is the right basis of civil government; not that human laws can compel men to love their fellow-men, but they can compel them to respect their rights. True religion goes beyond this, however, for it leads its possessor to respect the rights of his neighbor, because he loves his neighbor—because he has committed to life the principle which should govern the relation of man to his fellow-man. We still recommend this rule. In all the volumes of national law, nothing has ever yet been enacted to compare with the Golden Rule. In itself it covers every just law enacted by any and all governments. Let us again try committing it to life.
