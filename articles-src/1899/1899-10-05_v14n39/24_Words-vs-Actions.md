It is a strange echo of The Hague Peace Conference that is now heard in South Africa. It was supposed that material progress had been made at that conference in the direction of establishing the principle of arbitration for the settlement of international disputes; and there were facts to justify this supposition. As The World (N. Y.) says:—

"The Peace Conference at The Hague agreed upon an elaborate scheme of arbitration, intended to prevent such wars as that which Great Britain seems now to be forcing upon the Boers.

"It agreed that every effort to arbitrate should be exhausted before resort should be had to force; that the parties to every quarrel should invoke arbitration, and that neutral powers should be free to offer mediation without offense, even after armed conflict should have begun.

"As an additional inducement to peaceful adjudication the conference agreed upon a permanent court of arbitration open to all countries, whether signatory powers or not, and a permanent bureau through which appeals might be made to that court.

"There was no authority of course to compel any power to submit its case to that court, but it was agreed that all the signatory powers held themselves morally bound to do so in every case not otherwise arbitrated or settled by negotiation, except such as involved the national honor, independence or sovereignty."

And now England is pursuing a course which raises a question as to her sincerity in standing for arbitration at The Hague. And with this is raised the question whether others of the great powers were sincere,—whether any of them, with the golden prize glittering before its eyes which England sees in the Transvaal, would be any more ready than England is to risk its possible loss by arbitration. Does any nation love a principle of righteousness more than it loves gold?

The question at issue, says The World, "is clearly one of those that should be settled by arbitration, and the Boers have earnestly besought Great Britain to submit it to that kind of impartial adjudication, stipulating only that one of the five arbitrators shall be selected by an entirely neutral government—that of Switzerland or that of the United States preferred.

"England rejects this proposal. Her excuse is that the Transvaal is not an independent state. But that is precisely the question in dispute, and no less eminent an English statesman than Sir William Vernon Harcourt says with emphasis: 'The Transvaal's independence is complete. Even in foreign affairs the only thing reserved is the final approval of the Queen to treaties negotiated.'"

England is not going to war with the Transvaal for the love of fighting. If war comes, it will be waged, on her part, for the establishment of British supremacy throughout South Africa. And the reason for establishing that supremacy is that "trade follows the flag," and trade means wealth. And as a first instalment of that coming wealth there will fall into her possession the richest gold mines in the world.

The love of money is still the root of all evil; and in these days of national grasping after wealth, the question of peace or war among the nations is determined almost wholly by that of which one the love of money demands.
