## Article-Level Notes

### File 23: `23_Aguinaldo-and-Equal-Rights.md`
- **Location:** Page 8, "News, Notes, and Comment" section
- **Issue:** The word "judge" appears in the OCR as "judge I" — the "I" appears to be an OCR artifact for a comma or part of the word "judged." The sentence reads: "But thereby they expose the fatal weakness of their cause, judge I from the standpoint of American principles of government."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "judged" — corrected to "judged" in the transcription to reflect the clear grammatical intent ("judged from the standpoint")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "judge I" is almost certainly an OCR error for "judged"; the grammar requires the past participle form.

### File 30: `30_Expansion-a-Moral-and-Legal-Wrong.md`
- **Location:** Page 11-12, reprint from Springfield Republican
- **Issue:** "Lyman Abbot" in the OCR text (one 't') — the correct spelling throughout the issue is "Lyman Abbott" (two t's). This appears in the sentence: "from Mr. McKinley and Lyman Abbot down."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Lyman Abbot" — preserved as it appears in the OCR (which may reflect the original print), since the Springfield Republican may have misspelled the name in their original article.
- **Confidence:** LOW — unclear whether this is an OCR error or the original reprint's spelling. Given this is a quoted reprint, the original spelling is preserved.

### Short editorial notes (files 01-10, 35-42)
- The opening "Editorial Notes" items on page 1 and the back-page editorial notes on pages 12-16 are brief single-sentence or single-paragraph items. Each has been given its own file per project instructions.
- Page references embedded in some notes (e.g., "See article on p. 612") have been preserved as they appear in the original.
- The "Ex." attribution at the end of "The Divine Touch" (file 33) is an abbreviation for "Exchange" — a common 19th-century attribution indicating the item was clipped from another periodical. Treated as editorial/reprint from unnamed exchange.

### File 16: `16_Is-War-Consistent-With-Christianity-No1.md`
- **Attribution:** The article is "By Jonathan Dymond" and is excerpted "From *An Inquiry into the Accordancy of War with the Principles of Christianity*." This is a reprint from a published book, not a periodical. The `original_publication` field names the book title.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — attribution is explicit in text.

### File 17: `17_The-Liberty-of-Christ-No3_BWM.md`
- **Attribution:** The byline reads "BY B. W. MARSH." — these initials (BWM) are not in the known authors list. Filed with initials BWM.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — attribution is explicit.

### "A Card" and subscription/publication information
- The "A Card" notice (Foreign Mission Board donation solicitation) and the "TO OUR PATRONS" subscription instructions on pages 13-14 are boilerplate/administrative content and have been skipped per project instructions.
- The book advertisements on pages 14-16 (Rights of the People, Baptist Principles, Two Republics, etc.) are advertisements and have been skipped.
- The Signs of the Times promotion on page 15 is an advertisement and has been skipped.
