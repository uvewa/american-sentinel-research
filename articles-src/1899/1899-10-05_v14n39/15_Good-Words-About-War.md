Such are the following, spoken by a fearless English statesman, Mr. John Morley, in a speech at Manchester, England, relating to the anticipated war with the Transvaal:—

"The sword won't help you. I ask myself very often whether the man with the sword blundering in and slashing at the knots that statesmen ought to have untied, is not responsible for half the worst catastrophes in the political history of Europe. You may carry fire and sword into the midst of peace and industry, but such a war of the strongest government in the world against this weak little republic, and the strongest government in the world with untold wealth and inexhaustible resources, will bring you no glory. It will bring you no profit, but mischief will be wrought. You may make thousands of women widows and thousands of children fatherless. It will be wrong. You may add a new province to your empire. It will still be wrong. You may give greater buoyancy to the South African Stock and Share Market. You may create South African booms. You may send the price of Mr. Rhodes's chartereds up to a point beyond the dream of avarice. Yes, even then it will be wrong."
