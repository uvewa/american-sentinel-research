THERE is to be held next year in Paris, in connection with the World's Fair, an international congress on Sunday Rest, of which we find the following mention in The Outlook:—

"In September, 1900, under the patronage of the French government, an international congress will be held on questions concerning Sunday as a legally and socially recognized day of rest. The sessions will be held in the Palais du Congrès of the exhibition. The president of the organizing committee is Senator Bérenger, and among the members of the committee are representatives from both Catholic and Protestant clergy, as well as members of Parliament, economists and statisticians, and delegates from the various chambers of commerce, manufacturers' unions, and railway companies. The congress will be open to all who are interested in its programme. The fee for membership has been fixed at ten francs. Only active members and delegates will have the right to take part in the sessions.

"The language of the congress will be French, although papers may be communicated in other languages, always provided that a summary is presented in French. Two sessions will be held daily, at nine and at three o'clock. The discussions will be limited to the matter stated in the programme, and speakers will not be given the floor for more than a quarter of an hour, nor will they be allowed to speak twice in the same session on the same subject, unless the Assembly should decide otherwise. The secretary of the congress is M. Bompard, 28 Rue d'Assas, Paris, France."
