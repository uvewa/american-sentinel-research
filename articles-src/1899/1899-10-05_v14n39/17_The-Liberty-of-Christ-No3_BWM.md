Satan's untiring purpose is to take from the inhabitants of earth all the freedom God has designed for them to enjoy. He persuades man to part with his liberty by promising him more liberty; this is the way he began, and he has ever since found it a good plan to follow.

Adam and Eve were given the freedom of the earth; they were at liberty to do as they pleased, and they pleased to do the thing that completely deprived them of the liberty to do as they pleased at all. That is, it pleased them to permit a third party (the devil) to interpret the Word of God for them, and it pleased him to interpret it to their understanding to be a lie; and having in this way got between man and God, it has been his chief pleasure for six thousand years to make man believe that everything God says is a lie. As long as Satan can stay between man and his Maker, man is a slave to the will of Satan, and is forced to accept his translation of the Work of God. When Eve permitted Satan to persuade her that the forbidden fruit was good, after God had said it was bad, she surrendered her freedom of thought, and placed herself in complete bondage to the one whom she permitted to do her reasoning.

This being the standpoint from which Satan has employed all his means to educate in all ages, it is not strange if at this time the majority of the human family should be more willing to have some one else exercise their power of individuality, than to stand directly in the channel of communication with God themselves.

God never designed that a third person should stand between man and his freedom of action. He has given no being the privilege or power to measure his Spirit to another, neither is the liberty to use personal influence, or mind pressure, upon another, from God. When mind pressure, personal influence, or any other kind of human influence, is used to sway the will of another, it is just as much religious intolerance, although directed in another channel, as when force is used; the only difference between such intolerance and force being the lack of opportunity. The Spirit of God is the only medium God has ever chosen to influence the will of man, and He will always be revealed as it pleases God and not always as it may please man.

The crisis that meets us to-day rests upon the awful truth that Satan has influenced the education of the world so long that he has endowed humanity, in the main, with his desires and ambitions; and has fired man with an unholy zeal to stand for the individuality of his fellowmen, and great liberty is promised the world in exchange for its greatest of all liberty—the liberty of conscience. But God has said of these that "while they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought into bondage."

Satan having brought the world into bondage to himself, his system can do nothing less than place his subjects in bondage to one another. Therefore in the apostate churches, and the state as well, we find mind against mind, will against will, and force against force; for where bondage exists there must of necessity be an unceasing struggle for the supremacy.

In the great spiritual warfare carried on by the church against the state, the state is the weaker power, and is brought into bondage to the church by the representatives of the church becoming the representatives of the state. It does not matter whether the representative is a professor of any special religion or not; his mission is to be a willing tool under the powerful hand of the church. Therefore the gist of the matter is that the church in swallowing up the state has brought herself into a bondage that is bound to augment her strife for supremacy; and not only this: it has established a system of self worship which is nothing less than pagan worship. By this it is easy to see that a union of church and state is idolatry; and the record says, that all the world will bow to idols (worship the beast and his image), save they whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life. The "beast" possesses the characteristics of the "dragon" (paganism), and the "image" is like the "beast"; therefore there is no difference between these powers except in name, and the only difference between their idolatry is in their form of worship.

The men who are to day battling for recognition of God by the state, are working for a religion of force, which is idolatry; and there is not a political issue of any importance that comes before the nation in which this thing is not in some way a factor. Therefore the Seventh-day Adventist who in politics, or in any other way, becomes a part of the great machinery of state, has yet to learn to stand fast "in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free." O, may the God of heaven help his people to love liberty and truth; and even now may we accept the grace that will forever separate us from Babylon, to stand "fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners."
