THE attitude of the London press demonstrates anew the familiar truth of history that for a nation resolutely bent on criminal aggression the only difficulty is in beginning. Once the path of crime is entered upon one aggression leads to another. It is easier to advance than to go back or even to halt. Indeed, the forward impulse is usually accepted as a providential indication of manifest destiny. Thus the mere attempt by Great Britain to assert a repudiated "suzerainty" over the Transvaal has advanced to an open declaration of annexation, and the third step in crime is the destruction of the Orange Free State, a country over which even suzerainty is not claimed.—N. Y. World.
