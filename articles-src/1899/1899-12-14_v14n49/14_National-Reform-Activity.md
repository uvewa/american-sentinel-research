In the annual report of the work of the National Reform Association, published last October, this illustration is given of the "alacrity and efficiency" of the sub-committees of this organization in its "reform" work:

"During the session of the Pennsylvania legislature for 1899, a bill known as the Fow Bill, having for its object the weakening if not the entire destruction of the Pennsylvania Sabbath law, was introduced and referred to the committee on Law and Order. The Sub-committee of the Association, at an opportune time, arranged for a hearing before the Law and Order Committee of the legislature, sent out protests against the Fow Bill to twelve hundred pastors, accompanied by a circular letter urging that a vote be taken on the protest, and that the same be signed by the proper congregations officers and sent to Harrisburg for presentation to the legislature. There is no doubt that this prompt action, thus bringing to bear the overwhelming sentiment of Pennsylvania in favor of the Sabbath, had much to do with the defeat of the Fow Bill."

And where is the alacrity and efficiency that ought to be manifested for the preservation of the sacred rights of conscience?
