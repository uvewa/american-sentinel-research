THE REV. Dr. Alexander MacKennel, one of the British representatives at the recent International Congregational Council, in his address (reprinted in the Hartford Seminary Record, November) took a survey of the question of international relations in the light of recent history. At the opening of the first International Industrial Exposition on May day, 1851, in London, he says, the nations were apparently learning the great lesson of their interdependence, and that for one nation in the universal brotherhood to wage bloody war on another people is as though the right hand of a man were stabbing the left hand. The eve of the fulfillment of Tennyson's prediction seemed near:—

"Till the war drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle flags were furl'd
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the World.
There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law."

"It was a generous forecast," remarks Dr. MacKennel, "but it left human nature out of the account. The girders of the Crystal Palace were hardly removed from Hyde Park when the Crimean war broke out; and that war has left behind it fears and anxieties and a mutual distrust that have not since allowed Europe a tranquil year." The end of the century finds us confronted by "signs in the sun, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity; men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth."

"If it were not so sad a spectacle, we might find boundless humor in the fact that Europe has been, for fifty years, massing armies which it to-day trembles to behold, perfecting weapons of precision until it is afraid to use them. History knows few more disgraceful sights than the 'Concert of Europe,' civilization covering before barbarism."

The so-called Christian governments are frankly pagan, says Dr. MacKennel, and the ultimate principles and purposes of state and church are radically different. The Christian law is: "So is the will of God, that with well doing ye put to silence the ignorance of foolish men;" and, "It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing." But there is not a cabinet in Europe where this law is accepted or dreamed of as a possible guide to national action. Dr. MacKennel continues:—

"We may frankly aver that indignation is an honest impulse, that resistance of wrong, the determination to put it down, ought to have an abiding place in human action; that the call to war, because it is an appeal to common, not to individualistic, effort, may startle the selfish into warmth of heart; and that the discipline, of which the military system has been up to now the chief exponent, has trained men in the subordination of self to society. We may recognize that humane sentiment has, from the beginning, tempered the sufferings and the humiliations of war; and that, under Christian influence, regard for the wounded and tenderness toward the vanquished, individually, have come to be prevailing sentiments. And we may wish that this pitifulness may have full play when whites are in conflict with colored men as well as in what is called 'civilized warfare.' But it has become conspicuously clear that war is no instrument for the accomplishment of the highest ends; and that involves—since the highest human ends are always in the consciousness of the true follower of Christ—that it has become hard, and will become impossible, for Christian people to employ it. War may be a fitting instrument for men inflamed with the lust of possession; it fails us when we invoke its aid for unselfish uses."
