The following is part of a resolution lately passed by the synod of a leading Presbyterian church in this city, with reference to charges of immoral conduct made against a member of the church, who after having been once convicted had appealed for a re-trial:—

"Whereas, the witnesses named in this specification to support the charges—except some who were called at the former trial to prove formal matters not touching the charge of gambling—are professional detectives and not members of the church—except possibly one—and some of them are not even adherents to any form of Christian faith, and therefore are not such that unqualified credence should be given them;" etc.

We wish it were true that church membership or adherence to some form of Christian faith constituted a certificate of character entitling the individual to "unqualified credence;" but the truth is that such is very far from being the case, and that professional detectives and persons who are not adherents of any form of Christian faith are as much entitled to credence as are other people. Profession or religious standing do not weigh in such a matter at all. If the courts of law were to adopt the view put forth by this Presbyterian synod, the whole fabric of American Republican Government would be speedily overturned.
