In a report of "an authorized interview with the president of the Filipino Junta at Hong Kong," published in The Outlook, and consisting of answers by that president to questions prepared by the Outlook's "special commissioner," we note the following on the subject of religious freedom:—

[Ques.] "Is it a fact that a law was passed by your Congress providing for absolute tolerance of religion throughout the islands and the complete separation of church from state?

[Ans.] "It is. The law referred to was promulgated on the 23rd of January of the present year.

[Q.] "Have the Filipinos endeavored to make it known to Protestant missionaries that they would be welcome in the Philippines?

[A.] "We have given out this information repeatedly, and we think it has brought many to espouse our cause, as they see that the spirit of our people is liberal. It is not so with the Roman Catholic party, however. This party is completely under the influence of the priests, who, hoping to again impose themselves upon the country, are in favor of a colonial system of government."

As under American rule, which in religious matters will be guided by the counsel of Archbishop's Chappelle and Ireland, the religious orders in the Philippines will not be seriously disturbed; and as religious liberty is impossible where those orders remain in power, it is evident that the conquest of the Philippines has been a blow to the cause of religious freedom.
