Here is a paragraph which at the present time has a very "seditious" and "unpatriotic" sound:

"Perhaps there was never an instance of a colony so much and so long persecuted with vehement and malicious abuse as ours has been for near two years past by its enemies here, and those who reside in it. The design apparently was, by rendering us odious as well as contemptible, to prevent all concern for us in the friends of liberty here when the project of oppressing us further and depriving us of our rights by various violent measures should be carried into execution."

Yet, strange as it may seem to some, this was not written by an agent of Aguinaldo or by "Oom Paul" Kruger, but by Benjamin Franklin, in 1771.
