[ADVOCATES of compulsory "Sabbath" observance refer often to the example of the prophet Nehemiah in forcibly restraining Sabbath breaking in Jerusalem, as justifying the enforcement of Sabbath observance today by the civil law. The trouble with their reasoning is that no parallel exists between the circumstances under which Nehemiah acted and those under which we as subjects of the civil government, live to-day. This is clearly pointed out in the following which we find in an exchange:—]

### KEEPING THE SABBATH.

"In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the Sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath. And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath; and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should be no burden brought in on the Sabbath day. So the merchants and sellers of all manner of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time they came no more on the Sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day." Neh. 13:15-22.

This lesson is called "Keeping the Sabbath," but it should rather be called "Breaking the Sabbath," for that is what it is all about.

In order to understand the acts of Nehemiah, it is necessary to put ourselves in his place. Therefore we must consider the Jewish state, and note the difference between it and nations generally. The great mistake that most people make in reading this account, is in supposing that his action is a model for rulers in these days. Let us see why it is not.

In the first place, Israel was not a nation in the ordinary sense of the term. When Balaam tried to curse Israel, God made him bless them, so that we know that whatever he said was directed by the Spirit of the Lord. Looking at Israel, he said, "Lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations." Num. 23:9.

Then what did Israel constitute?—Simply "the household of God," the church. It was never God's design that his people should be governed as other people are, but that he should be their sole ruler. If they had lived by faith in God, as Abraham did, there would never have been any need for judges or any sort of officers of the law. All these things came in solely as the result of that lack of faith which rejected God as ruler.

The family is the one institution which God has designed. The head of every family was to be the priest for the family, and each family, including all the dependents, would form a congregation, or what in modern language is erroneously called a church. That this family plan was to be perpetuated, is seen in the promise to Abraham, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed." Gen. 12:3.

In harmony with this plan God was bringing Israel out of Egypt—a great collection of families constituting God's great family, which was to be added to as others accepted the faith. That the family is still the unit of God's government, and that his people all form one family, is seen by the fact that we come into the kingdom of God only by a new birth. "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." John 3:3. God's subjects are all his children, and his kingdom consists solely of his family. "The whole family in heaven and earth" is named from Christ, who has been placed over it as head. Eph. 3:14, 15. God is the Father of all.

When the children of Israel called for a king, like other people, God said that it was a rejection of him. 1 Sam. 8:7. They wanted a king, that they might be like the nations, or, literally, like the heathen round them. All the nations were heathen, and in fact the formation of nations is in itself heathenism,—the rejection of God as ruler.

Although the people rejected the Lord, he did not reject them. He still claimed them as his children. He reserved the right to select their king, and the family idea was still maintained as far as possible. We must remember that it was religion, and that alone, that made the people of Israel. The name itself signified victory over sin, the victory of faith. There were no different "denominations" in the kingdom, as in England, for instance, for the entire nation was simply the church of God, although they had deviated from God's plan for them.

At the time which our lesson covers, Nehemiah was at the head of this family government. Israel had returned from Babylonian captivity, whither they had been taken because they kept not the Sabbath. See 2 Chron. 36:14-21. Now that the seventy years of captivity were at an end, and the people were in their own land again, it was a terrible thing to begin at once to do that which had before brought such calamities upon them. It is not to be wondered at that Nehemiah was greatly aroused over it.

Remembering that the whole people were really one family, for Jacob was the father of all, we read the commandment concerning the Sabbath: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." Ex. 20:8-11.

There is no question that every man has the right to demand that the Sabbath shall not be profaned in his house, either by servants or visitors. It is his duty to see that tradesmen do not deliver goods on that day. He has no right to enter into the homes of others and say how they shall do on the Sabbath, but he himself must keep the Sabbath, and that means that he must not allow the Sabbath to be profaned on his premises. Nehemiah was under God the leader of this family. He was the leader of the church. As such it was his province to exhort all the members of the family, and to warn strangers that they must not come upon the premises for the purpose of doing business on the Sabbath day. But this no more gives the rulers of ordinary governments the right to legislate concerning Sabbath-keeping, than it gives them the right to say whether or not men shall be Christians. The two cases are not at all parallel.
