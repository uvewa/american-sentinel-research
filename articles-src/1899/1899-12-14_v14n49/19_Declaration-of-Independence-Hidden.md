A WASHINGTON dispatch states that "The original copy of the Declaration of Independence is no longer to be seen by the public, because exposure to the air and light has made the text and signatures almost illegible. The document is now kept in a large safe in the library of the State Department." One paper takes cognizance of this information with the remark that "A dark and inaccessible vault is obviously the place for it" (the Declaration) these days.
