THE Union Signal reports that "A saloon-keeper of Kenosha, Wis., recently arrested on the charge of violating the State law by keeping his saloon open on Sunday, was acquitted in a jury trial, after the jury had deliberated two minutes. The defense was that the law under which prosecution was brought was a dead letter, and that the City Council of Kenosha has given a silent permit to every saloon-keeper to violate it."
