ACCORDING to the Worcester Telegram (Mass.) China is making noteworthy progress in preparing to fight after the manner of the Western nations. "The dowager empress has authorized the building of a large number of factories for the manufacture of small rapid-fire cannon in alarming quantities. Six smokeless powder factories are in operation, and the government estimate of the output is 50,000 catties a month. The government is said to have 2,000,000 cartridges loaded with smokeless powder in its magazines ready for intruders. Smokeless civilization is flooding old China."
