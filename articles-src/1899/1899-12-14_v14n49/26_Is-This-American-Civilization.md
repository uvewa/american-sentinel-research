Another case of punishing crime by mob law and burning at the stake is reported in the papers of the 7th inst., and one which, if reported correctly, is of exceptional horror. Of many instances of the execution of mob law it may be said that the perpetrators were a few of the more lawless and vindictive of the residents of the locality concerned, whose acts did not represent the general sentiment of the community. But what can be said in behalf of American civilization as represented by this Kentucky community, in the face of the facts which are here reported:

"MAYSVILLE, Ky., Dec. 6.—Richard Coleman, a twenty-year-old colored boy, was burned at the stake at noon to-day, within the limits of this city, in the presence of thousands of men and hundreds of women and children.

"Tortures almost unbelievable were inflicted upon the wretched negro. In all the vast crowd that witnessed the agonies of the man not one hand was raised in humanity's behalf, nor a single voice heard in the interest of mercy. Instead, when some new torture was inflicted upon the shrieking, burning boy, the crowd cheered and cheered, the shrill voices of women and the piping tones of children sounding high above the roar of men.

"Not one person in the crowd wore a mask. The leaders of the mob disdained the semblance of any disguise. Every act was done in the open. There was no secrecy. The population of the whole city and country for miles around, church men and church women, professional and business men of eminence, people of distinguished ancestry, formed the mob, and not a single regret for the horrible tragedy can be heard to-night from one end of the town to the other."

Can it be supposed that this community is an exceptional one, essentially different in character from other communities the country over? There is no apparent reason by which such a conclusion could be maintained.

The prisoner was not at large when seized by the mob, but was in the hands of the civil authorities, to whom he had confessed his crime. Conviction and punishment under the law were certain, and the action of the mob was taken solely with the thought of vengeance.

Is this the civilization for which, we have of late been told, the Asiatics are pining? Query: If such complete anarchy as is here portrayed can exist in the very center of the United States, how much confidence can reasonably be placed in a promise of good government under United States authority, for people of the colored race, in a distant colony on the other side of the Pacific?
