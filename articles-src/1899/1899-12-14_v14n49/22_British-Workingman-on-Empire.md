SOME plain truths which are ignored by those leading the march of empire, were stated by a British workingman recently to a newspaper interviewer:—

"What weighs with most men is this: The Government promised old-age pensions. They say now that they cannot keep their promise because they do not know where to get the money. Yet they are ready to spend millions on millions upon a war waged to lower the taxation of rich men in the Transvaal. As for the Transvaal vote, where is the sense of sending 70,000 soldiers to get it for a lot who have been attracted by gold there, when above a million of workingmen at home never have a chance, by the operation of our registration laws, to get it in their own country?"
