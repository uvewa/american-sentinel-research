WE devote considerable space in this issue to a report of the National Reform convention held in this city, December 5-7. Probably no convention ever held by this organization gave more encouragement to its adherents of the ultimate success of their plans. Do not skip this report because it is lengthy. You need the information it gives of the ideas, the workings, and the purposes of this religio political crusade.

VERY little attention was paid to the N. R. convention by the city dailies, only the merest reference being made by them at any time to the proceedings. Nor did the attendance at the meetings indicate any interest in them on the part of the people of the city. Why then attach any importance to it? some one may inquire. Suppose the speakers did make strong statements about their desire for laws to enforce religion: what of it? Are they not too small a body to make any impression upon national affairs?

The National Reform Association itself, we reply, numerically considered, is insignificant enough; and if the movement for religious legislation had been pushed by it alone during the years it has been in progress, it would have amounted to very little. But this association has been furnishing the leaven which has been gradually leavening the whole religious world. New reform organizations have been springing up rapidly of late years, which have raised aloft the National Reform standard and are pushing it rapidly to the front; and these organizations number their members by the million. The call for this New York convention—for illustration—was signed by the Rev. F. E. Clark, the president of the Christian Endeavor Society, all of whose two and a half million members are willing to follow where "father" Clark may lead. Two or three such organizations as this, the W. C. T. U., or the Epworth League, may unite and ask about what they will of the Government, and it will be granted.
