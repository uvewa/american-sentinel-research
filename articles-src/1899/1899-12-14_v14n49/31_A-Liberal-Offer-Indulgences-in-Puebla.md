### INDULGENCES IN PUEBLA.

By Rev. F. S. Borton, D. D.

In the yard of the Church of St. Dominic, in the city of Puebla, there is a stone pillar surmounted by a brass cross. On three sides of the granite base are the following inscriptions:—

1. "The Association of the Most Holy Rosary erects this cross in memory of the holy mission which we now celebrate in honor of the sixteenth anniversary of our most Serene Patroness during the feast of her glorious assumption. Puebla, August 21, 1898.

2. "Any one in a state of grace can gain a plenary indulgence by assisting at the erection of the cross of the mission.

3. "Ten thousand years of indulgences are granted for each time that any one in a state of grace and before this cross shall recite five times the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary, with Glory, in memory of the Passion of Jesus Christ."

Although I stood near the cross for more than fifteen minutes and saw many people entering and leaving the church, no one took advantage of this most liberal offer except one old white-haired woman who was probably as little in need of ten thousand years of indulgences as any one of the worshipers there. I could not help thinking that the people did not believe the lying inscription, or were no longer in need of indulgences, for in one day of ten hours, complying with the terms four times an hour a person could gain 400,000 years of indulgences! —or that they did not know how to read.

If any Roman Catholics in the United States are in need of indulgences, let them come to Puebla and there at the Church of St. Dominic they can in six days of steady application gain 2,000,000 years of indulgences! and it will not cost them a cent. With such a capital as that they can retire from business.

If any reader doubt the above I will send him a photograph of the church and cross with the above offer of indulgences.

Puebla, Mexico.
