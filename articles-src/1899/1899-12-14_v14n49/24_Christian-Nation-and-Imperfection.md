Speaking of the "real character of the nation" and of "her institutions," a National Reform writer says that these "in a real sense, however imperfectly, are Christian." But Christianity is perfect; and in so far as anything departs from this perfection, it ceases to be Christian. And that which does not have Jesus Christ in it is not Christian at all.
