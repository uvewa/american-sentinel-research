With Mr. Chamberlain announcing "an alliance, if you please," between Great Britain and the United States and calling for a triple one between those powers and Germany; with Whitelaw Reid's paper promptly answering Chamberlain in a cartoon on "The Dreibund," and boomed with the inscription: "Hail to the alliance between the Teutonic and Anglo Saxon races,"—with so much of foreign alliance talk in the air does any American stop to think how absolutely new to our politics this conception of an alliance may be?

Washington's parting advice was summed up in these words:—

"Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens), the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake. . . ."

"The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible. . . ."

"Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any portion of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor or caprice?"

From Washington's day until McKinley's this policy was carried out. And with the result that America became a great power of the earth, and the most powerful Republic of all time. But Washington's advice, while very well for his day and down until recent years, is now obsolete, it is said, and fails to meet the new conditions. New policies must prevail. Very well, consider alliances on their merits.

Was there ever an alliance, or even an "understanding"—that beautiful euphemism our statesmen are so fond of—that was just what it pretended to be? In former times alliances between Christian nations were supposed to exist for the advancement of religion, or some particular brand of it. They were, therefore, peculiarly in the service of the Almighty. It is a matter of historical record that the declared purposes of the great alliance between Russia, Austria, and Prussia, entered into in 1815, after Waterloo, were to rule justly and mercifully, to regard one another as brothers and to apply to political and international affairs the precepts of the Christian religion. The only tangible result of that profession of exalted aims was the cruel suppression of all popular movements for freedom in Europe. The "holy alliance" has gone into history in a cloud of infamy.

In these later times alliances do not profess to apply the teachings of Jesus Christ to international affairs.

That hypocrisy is too hollow and thin for intelligent people to consider with sober faces. But there is something equally good to take its place. The modern alliance invariably professes to "guarantee the peace of the world," or some part of it. The present triple alliance between Germany, Austria, and Italy, which Bismarck founded, has always guaranteed the peace of Europe. When the kaiser talks about it does he not say that it is the only security Europe has against the horrors of universal war? Yet Bismarck, who established this guaranty of European peace, secretly made another alliance with Russia, unknown to Austria and Italy, so as to come out on top whatever happened. The result was that there were two alliances for Germany—one to guarantee the peace of Europe and the other to guarantee the guarantee of the peace of Europe. The episode illustrated nicely Bismarck's faith in alliances as guarantees of peace. At the same time there is the dual alliance between France and Russia, and that, too, guarantees the peace of Europe. And all are so afraid of the several guarantees that they cannot accumulate war munitions enough, or train men enough, to quiet Europe's apprehensions.

In the light of these facts no one should be humbugged when Mr. Chamberlain comes forward and says, as he did the other day, that "the union, the alliance, if you please, the understanding between these two great nations (Great Britain and the United States) is indeed a guarantee of the peace of the world." And, above all, no one should be humbugged when Mr. Chamberlain and "Peace" Commissioner Whitelaw Reid call for a new dreibund between Great Britain, the United States and Germany. It was Carlyle who once said something very forcible in expressing his aversion for cant. It is cant of a very high order, and hypocrisy as well, that dandles these alliances before our eyes as something especially designed to guarantee the peace of the world.

What, then, is an alliance for? Let us be frank about it and leave the psalm singing to such as Chamberlain, . . . An alliance between powers exists for no other reason in the world than to enable those powers to run the world, or their corners of it, just as they please. It is designed to advance the supposed common interests of the powers concerned and to check the ambitions and interests of other powers. It is based on the implied understanding, or written agreement, to take up arms, if necessary, to accomplish those purposes. Its weapon is war, and instead of guaranteeing the peace of the world, it holds a club over the world. The only reason why it is accompanied by peace,—when it is,—is that the rival combination does not happen to have so big a club.

If the United States enters any league with England—Chamberlain says it is already accomplished—or with England and Germany together, then the United States will be in a warlike combination because its weapon to enforce its demands and achieve its purposes must be military force, or the threat of it. To say that such a combination exists to guarantee the world's peace is of the same piece of burlesque as the holy alliance's profession to apply to politics and international relations the precepts of the Christian religion.

The alarming distance the country is straying from Washington's policy ought to be apparent.
