SPEAKING of the effects of opium in China, Mr. William Jameson Reid, in an interesting volume entitled "Through Unexplored Asia," says, "The death rate from this source alone exceeds that from nearly all other causes." And he adds: "As the drug was introduced by a Christian nation, and its importance as an industry is augmented by Christian support, there is little hope of its suppression."

This is an example of the "benefits" a "Christian nation" confers on heathen lands by means of superior military force; for opium, as all know, was forced upon China by the British government. The "missionary" work accomplished at the point of the bayonet is not of a kind that blesses its recipients. The real missionary and representative of Christianity is he who goes not as a master, but as a servant.
