## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 12, Article "The Catholic Church and Revolution"
- **Item:** President's name spelled "Alfraro" in OCR source.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the OCR reads "President Alfraro" but the correct name is "Eloy Alfaro," president of Ecuador. This appears to be an OCR error (transposition/doubling of 'r').
- **Transcribed as:** "President Alfraro" — preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR source, which reflects the original printed text.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the name in the original printed text may itself be a typographical error in the 1899 issue, or a variant spelling used at the time. Preserved as-is per accuracy rules.

### Page 13, Article "A Liberal Offer"
- **Item:** The attribution structure. The article header reads "A Liberal Offer." followed by a subheading "INDULGENCES IN PUEBLA." and then "By Rev. F. S. Borton, D. D."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** Filed under title "A Liberal Offer: Indulgences in Puebla" with author Rev. F. S. Borton, D. D. Attribution marked as "explicit."
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 14 (OCR), Article "Contending for the Law"
- **Item:** Author attribution. Article ends "CLIFFORD G. HOWELL. / Pontiac, Mich., Dec. 4." — this is a contributor letter, not a staff-written editorial. Author initials CGH used.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — author name is fully spelled out in the text.

### Front Page Editorial Notes (Short Items)
- **Item:** The short aphoristic notes at the top of page 1 (before "Another Supreme Court Decision") do not have titles in the original. Titles have been assigned based on the content of each item for filing purposes.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for content; titles are editorial assignments for filing only.

### Page 16 Editorial Column
- **Item:** The back-page editorial column contains several distinct items separated by paragraph breaks rather than `---` dividers: (1) a note about using the issue for missionary work, (2) a note about the National Reform convention report, (3) a note about the Holy Alliance article and Nehemiah article, and (4) a note about Anthony Comstock and Sunday newspapers. Items 2-4 have been combined into two files based on thematic coherence: file 34 covers the NR convention note, file 35 covers the alliances/Nehemiah/Comstock notes.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the editorial column flows as one continuous text; the division into separate files reflects distinct topics but the boundaries are editorial judgments.

### Z. G. Baharian Attribution
- **Item:** The article "Judged for the Tithe" is signed "BY Z. G. BAHARIAN" and datelines "Constantinople, November 20, 1899." This appears to be a correspondent's letter, not a staff article.
- **Transcribed as:** attribution: "explicit", author: "Z. G. Baharian", author_short: "ZGB"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
