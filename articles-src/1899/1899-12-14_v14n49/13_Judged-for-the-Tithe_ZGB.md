NOVEMBER 2, the court of Karamousal, Nicomedia, pronounced a sentence against the treasurer of Seventh-day Adventists of Shagshag, with three months imprisonment and 150 piasters (about $6), cash fine.

Nicomedia is a province next to Constantinople toward the East, where in several towns and villages more than one hundred Seventh-day Adventists live, faithfully paying their taxes to the state, and paying tithes also to advance the cause of the gospel. Shagshag is one of these villages, with a small population (three hundred souls). All are of the Armenian religion, except fifteen Sabbath-keepers. Satan many times tried to destroy this little flock of Sabbath-keepers, but they were kept by the power of God, and prospered under unfavorable circumstances. Even the government acknowledged their faithfulness during the Armenian insurrection.

The Armenians were very jealous against them. They watched their steps with open eyes to find fault in their relation with the government; but they were faultless. At last they tried to find something in their religion in order to accuse them before the authorities. They saw that these Sabbath-keepers pay tithes. They were sure to misrepresent this, and bring punishment upon them.

About two years ago the ruler and the priest of Shagshag (both being Armenians), called on the Director of Yalova, and complained against them that they were collecting money, called tithes, to advance the political purposes of Armenians. The Director called all these Sabbath-keepers and investigated about the matter. We thought then that he was convinced that they were falsely accused. But he has sent the question to Nicomedia, and from there it has been referred to the court of Karamousal for a final judgment. November 2 was set for their judgment. All were invited. When the judge asked them about the tithe question, all in one accord testified that they give tithes to advance the preaching of the gospel, in obedience to God's commandment. The judge asked them to prove it from the gospel (New Testament). They were glad to read several verses. But the judge did not accept it, and told them that they were deceived. He would send them away without any punishment if they would promise to discontinue it in the future. They did not accept this proposition, and insisted that it was God's command and they were unable to disobey it.

Then the judge tried to hold the treasurer responsible for collecting the tithes without the Sultan's permission. But all at once answered with the words of Luke 20:25. The tithe belonged to God and they were not responsible when they did not get permission from the Sultan. Then the judge held a second council with the members of the court for about an hour and a half; and came out with a verdict of guilty. The treasurer was fined 150 piasters and given three months' imprisonment.

The treasurer did not accept it, and protested against it, and required that the sentence be referred to the higher court of Nicomedia. We wait anxiously to see what will be the decision of this higher court. We are sure God will help us and glorify his name.

Constantinople, November 20, 1899.
