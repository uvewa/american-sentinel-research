ON another page will be found an instructive article on the nature of alliances, which becomes timely just now in view of the alliance that appears to have been practically consummated between this Republic and one or more monarchies of the Old World. We speak of it as a sign of the times, and what we have to say regarding the nature of national alliances will make its significance more apparent. Concerning one of the most famous of alliances—the "Holy Alliance," formed in the early part of the century—of which the article speaks, this mention is made by the "Encyclopædia Britannica":—

"The emperors of Austria and Russia and the king of Prussia also entered into a 'Holy Alliance,' by which they bound themselves to remain united in the bonds of true and brotherly love, to mutually help and assist each other, to govern their people like fathers of families, and to maintain religion, peace, and justice in their dominions. This alliance, beautiful in theory, was made, in fact, the means of maintaining absolute power in the hands of the rulers, and of suppressing free institutions and almost every form of liberty among the people." Vol. III, p. 135.

Alliances are still beautiful in theory, but in that only.

On another page we print an article showing why the example of Nehemiah as an enforcer of Sabbath observance is not to be followed by the nations of the world to-day. There is a vast difference between the theocratic government under which Nehemiah lived, and the "powers that be" at the present time. The claim is made by some who want a theocracy set up to-day, that "the preachers are the successors of the prophets," and ought therefore to define and enforce what is right as Nehemiah and others did in ancient times. But a man-made theocracy, with self appointed rulers in the place of the prophets anciently appointed by the Lord, is not what this or any other country needs to promote its welfare to-day.

THERE was one ground of objection to the Sunday newspaper stated at the convention which was entirely valid, at least as regards the average Sunday paper; and that was the objection made by Mr. Anthony Comstock, who said they were filled with illustrations and reading matter which he would be unwilling to put into the hands of any youth. From our own observations we know this to be true of most of the Sunday papers in this city. The SENTINEL is altogether in sympathy with Mr. Comstock's efforts to guard the pathway of youthful innocence against the lurking insidious monster of vice.
