AN anti-clerical campaign is being conducted under government sanction in France. A raid recently made on the premises of the Assumptionist Fathers, brought to light 1,800,000 francs that were held by this religious order, presumably for no legitimate purpose.

The French government, says the Pall Mall Gazette, "must be delighted at the result of the police search of the Assumptionist premises. At the most it could not have been hoped that anything more suspicious would be found than a few more or less compromising papers, but as much to their surprise as to their satisfaction, the detectives stumbled on a treasure of over 1,800,000 francs in cash and bank notes. This secret hoard of the reverend fathers will assume immense importance in the popular imagination. That it was a sort of war chest to be drawn upon at a moment's notice for the purpose of fomenting a revolution will appear wholly undeniable to every good Radical in the country."

And this view is greatly strengthened by the further fact that "no regular reader of the Croix," which "is the most powerful instrument of clerical propaganda that exists in France," "could possibly fail to arrive at the opinion that the republic is a most objectionable form of government." The pope is evidently not so much in love with republics as he professes to be.
