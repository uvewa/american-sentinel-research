Another revolution is threatened in the republic of South America, this time in Ecuador. A dispatch which comes from that country to this by way of New Orleans December 2, gives this statement of the situation:—

"Private advices received here from Quito, capital of Ecuador, tell of a political disturbance in Ecuador. For some weeks trouble has been brewing between the church and state and recently the situation has become so acute that it is now dangerous for foreigners to venture out of the large towns. The trouble seems to have had its origin in the opposition of the priests to the work of progress which President Alfraro has inaugurated.

"Revolution now seems inevitable. Arrests of well-known men are of daily occurrence, and reports from various parts of the country indicate that the party opposed to the government has made extensive preparations for war. Heretofore the revolutions of Ecuador have had their rise among the dissatisfied politicians and professional revolutionists, but the present crisis is of an entirely different nature. With the church arrayed against the government the situation has become really alarming, and a number of foreigners have left Quito, the capital.

"A strong prejudice exists against foreigners among the poorer classes, and the residences of the foreigners in Quito have the flags of their country floating above them as a protection. An attempt was made by a religious fanatic to poison the American in charge of the railroad from Guayaquil to Quito."

This is an illustration of what we have several times stated regarding the unsettled conditions in Central and South America,—that is, that the Catholic Church party in these republics would foment revolution against any government not subservient to the church, when its overthrow is considered possible by such means; and that to this cause was largely due the unstable condition of government in those countries. The Catholic Church is in politics there, with a vengeance.
