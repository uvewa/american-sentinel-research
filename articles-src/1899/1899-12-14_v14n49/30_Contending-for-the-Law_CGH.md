SUNDAY, December 3, Dr. E. W. Blodgett of Detroit, gave an address in Pontiac, Mich., on "The Young American in Politics." He felt that his subject was appropriate for Sunday afternoon. He said that "This is a Christian nation;" then followed with the statement that our greatest need is a revival in politics. He was willing parties should differ on State questions, but "they must not differ on God's law." He exhorted the people to go from that house to stand for the enforcement of every law on the statute books.

Now every right and true position is self-consistent. If the "nation is Christian"—like Christ—it needs no revival. And when churchmen differ upon the law of God, how can political parties be expected to agree upon it? And how could those people go from that house to stand for the enforcement of all statutes when some of them are in direct opposition to "God's law?"

None present would question Dr. Blodgett's sincerity, or his willingness to even fight for his convictions; but he seemed to the writer to stand in the same position as Peter when he drew the sword to defend his Master. Dr. Blodgett sees the evil that has come from breaking the divine law; and yet is only helping on that evil by using carnal weapons to overthrow it. We must not fight fire with powder.

He would not allow politicians to differ on God's law, and yet he himself would differ from its divine Giver on one of its vital commands. Not only this, but he would enforce his own idea of that command by human enactment.

One statute of "God's law" enjoins the holy observance of "the seventh day." That this command is openly violated is plain. Its non-observance is justified by churchmen. A human enactment is placed in its stead. And yet the doctor laments the non-enforcement of the least law upon human statute books! Is God less orderly than men? Is his law less sacred? Is he less particular than men? If we feel sad when our poor laws are broken, how does he feel when his good law is trampled upon?

When men who claim to teach the things of God do not fully obey him themselves, and seek to lead and compel others to follow their example, they only hasten the calamity they would prevent. They may speak and fight as zealously as did Peter; but their efforts are of no more service to their Master than were Peter's. A revival upon such a basis augments the evils of disobedience.

Why will not such men, having splendid capabilities, turn the magnifying glass the other way so it may become God's great telescope? Then would they with the Psalmist "behold wondrous things" in God's law. They would find it needs not to be trammeled with human enactments.

O do not fight as one that breaketh the air; but as one that shall win the crown!

CLIFFORD G. HOWELL.
Pontiac, Mich., Dec. 4.
