The Supreme Court of Colorado, it is announced, has given a decision nullifying the Sunday-closing ordinance passed some time ago by the City Council of Denver. The decision rests upon the principle that it is not fair to oppress one class of the people without oppressing all,—a principle which is decidedly lame, and obviously unfit as a support for justice. An exchange sums up the points of the decision thus:

"As the case is summed up by the *Denver Republic* of November 10, Sunday closing, unless everything is closed, cannot legally be enforced against those lines of business which are not detrimental to the public good. Clothing stores are among those concerns which may be left open on Sunday under present conditions, despite the ordinance of the city of Denver to the contrary. So says the Supreme Court decision. Justice Gabbart said: 'The ordinance in question does not extend to the sale of all classes of merchandise, or to all avocations. Many are exempt from its provisions which are neither necessary nor charitable. Experience has demonstrated that to permit class legislation where a general law can be made applicable is fraught with danger, for it frequently results that a legislative body, under the guise of a law, oppresses a class or particular avocation. The ordinance does not affect all alike, and a business or occupation which is not liable to interfere with public morality or tend to create disorder, and over which the city has no special control, cannot be singled out and made the subject of prohibition on Sunday.'"

A command of God, given by divine revelation, must be known and understood by each individual for himself.
