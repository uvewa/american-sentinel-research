The following facts were gleaned from a single issue of the Boston Herald, and should serve to indicate the progress of the Sunday-law enforcement sentiment among the sturdy, conservative, and liberty-loving sons of the Pine Tree State:—

"GARDINER, ME., July 8, 1899.—At a meeting of the city government a few weeks ago the victualler's license of Marks Shapiro was revoked on the grounds that Shapiro, who keeps a fruit, confectionery, and tobacco store, dealt in a few frankfurts Sundays, so that he could get a license to keep open shop and sell his other goods. Shapiro felt badly over losing his license, but has not thus far kept his store open on Sunday. However, next Sunday he will keep open and make a test case of the affair.

"He says that he knows that he will be summoned into court on Monday, but that he has secured the best of legal talent, and will fight it out to the bitter end. He will not claim that a man has a right to sell goods on Sunday, but he will claim that, as he was granted a license to keep open until next May, the city government took it away without just cause, and he, having violated no ordinance, and having fulfilled all the conditions demanded, has a right to keep open up to the time that the license would have expired.

"The case has no parallel in Maine, and is creating widespread interest, as it will determine whether the city fathers can take away a license without showing that the man who has the license has not lived up to the contract therein. It also has created a lot of feeling, locally, as the church people agitated the movement, and, acting upon their requests, the city fathers revoked nearly all of the licenses in the city."

True to his word, Mr. Shapiro's shop was open on Sunday the 9th, and he was arrested, to be tried on the 15th inst.

The recent activity of the Maine Civic League is commented upon at length. We quote only the following facts relative to the work it is designed to accomplish:—

"The Maine Civic League, which was organized some two or three years ago for the purpose of educating public opinion to a better comprehension of temperance and other allied moral and social reforms, has entered upon an active campaign for the systematic furtherance of its purposes.

"The headquarters of the league are in Waterville, and the field secretary, to whom is attached the duty of superintending the work of the league and disseminating its influence throughout the State, is the Rev. W. F. Berry, a former Methodist clergyman in Portland and a man of recognized ability and influence.

"The work of the league . . . will comprehend public education on all civic questions of importance, and it will be its aim to build up a higher grade of citizenship and a better comprehension of its duties in every department of political and social life."

The following indicates a disinterested determination to be consistent, which is, in itself, quite commendable:—

"Bangor people who have been in the habit of enjoying Sunday at Northport as members of the excursion parties from this city will hereafter have to be content with visiting some other resort. The grounds at Northport are owned by the Methodists, and they held a meeting last week and voted not to allow any more excursions, either by land or sea, to land there Sundays. Furthermore, the camp ground people have voted that hereafter all ordinary traffic on the grounds on the Lord's day be prohibited."

Reader, are you preparing for the issue that is now being prepared for us? Does not even a hasty glance at the events transpiring around us indicate the rapid approach of solemn and stirring events?
