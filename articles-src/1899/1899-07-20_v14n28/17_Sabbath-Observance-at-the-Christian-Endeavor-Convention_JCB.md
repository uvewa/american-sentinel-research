"Sabbath observance" at the International Convention of Christian Endeavorers, recently held at Detroit, Mich., was an incidental, rather than a main, feature. The national reformers did not appear to be specially active, and none of their prominent official representatives took part in the deliberations of the convention. Doubtless they felt it quite unnecessary to do so as the organization seems already quite fully committed to, and in harmony with, the unscriptural and undemocratic theories advocated by the promoters of religious legislation.

In the general services held in the immense audience tents on the Endeavor grounds no session was devoted to the subject of Sunday observance, but a meeting of this character was held Sunday afternoon at one of the fashionable churches on Woodland avenue, and though other meetings were being held at the same hour, the church in which it was held was crowded almost to suffocation. This meeting was presided over by Mr. William Shaw, of Boston, treasurer of the United Society of Christian Endeavor. Mr. Shaw seemed very earnest in his advocacy of the strict enforcement of Sunday observance, as is indicated by the somewhat curt remark to which he gave utterance when a few people ventured to leave the church during a brief interim between two of the speeches:—

"Next to breaking the Sabbath, I think the meanest thing you can do is to break up a meeting. Now I want not another man, woman or child to leave this room until the meeting is over, unless you are sick, and if you are, just stay right in your seats and we will have the ushers carry you out so we will know it is a genuine case. I have made myself clear, haven't I?"

The first speaker at this meeting was Rev. David McAllister, D. D., LL. D., of Allegheny, Pa., who discussed the subject "The Sabbath in the Home." After asking the entire audience to repeat the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, which specifically enjoins the observance of the seventh day of the week as the "Sabbath of the Lord thy God," he proceeded to show how people ought to observe the first day of the week, which God has never hallowed or ordained as a Sabbath for man. Among other things he said:—

"Sabbath is an institution of God, made for man's good—for the good of the whole man, in body, mind and soul. You haven't a whole man if you lose one of those elements. It was made for all men, not for the Jew alone, but for all peoples. We speak of the Puritan Sabbath, the British Sabbath, the American Sabbath. What we mean is the Lord's Sabbath, which was given to all men.

"It is to the Sabbath-keeping homes of the Covenanter, the Netherlander, and the early Pilgrim fathers that we owe all honor for the blessed privileges we now enjoy on that day. They made their influence felt all through the history of this great nation.

"We find the Sabbath in the earliest record of the world. Before the fall, when He created the first man, God gave [him] the Sabbath. Sin did not make it necessary. It was for the physical nature of man when he was first put on earth. After the fall it is made even more necessary by sin.

"There must be one day in seven when you turn aside your foot from the path of your own pleasure to do as God wants you to do. This may mean to turn away from the pedal of your bicycle, unless you use it to go to the temple of God's worship. I consider that you have as much right to use it for that purpose as any other vehicle."

The second speaker of the afternoon was Mr. C. N. Howard, of Rochester, N. Y., who has taken a very active part in the Sunday closing and anti-saloon crusade recently waged in his home city. He was certainly fiery and vehement enough for the most radical national reformer imaginable. The subject assigned him was the "Side Door." In introducing this speaker, Treasurer Shaw said:—

"I don't suppose many of you people know where the side door is. As I happen to know perhaps I had better tell you that the side door to the Sunday saloon is the front door to hell. It is the open door for more evils in society, I think, than any other agency for evil on earth.

"Mr. Howard is the founder of the Prohibition Christian Union. We are not afraid of that word 'prohibition.' (Cheers.) If you want to kill a snake you do not cut off his tail. You would cut it off right behind his ears if he had any ears. Just the same way if you want to get rid of the saloon, the only way is to get rid of it. Kill it, that's all. Please God the day is soon coming when this will not be an ideal, but a blessed reality."

The following extract from the speech of Mr. Howard shows the real purpose of the Sunday closers, viz., to legally coerce into observance of Sunday all citizens regardless of occupation, religious belief, or any other consideration:—

"Did I say the side doors were shut? The newspapers said so, but they were mistaken. The police said so, but they lied. The New York reporter said the town was as dry as the desert of Sahara, but he never saw the Sahara, and he did not know. They were not closed, because the front doors of the hardware stores next door were open. The front doors of grocery stores were open and people passed in all day. The front doors of barber shops were open and men got shaved twenty times a day."

No doubt many SENTINEL readers will find themselves in agreement with Mr. Howard in this statement:—

"The side doors were not shut. They never have been shut so long as we legalize the open front door on week days. It is so with every prohibitory feature of the license laws. You can make no law which will legalize the selling of liquor to a man before he is drunk and prohibit selling it to him after he is drunk. You can't legalize it on Sundays."

Hon. John Charleton, of Lyndedoch, Ontario, member of the Canadian Parliament, was the next speaker. Evidently one of Mr. Charleton's chief grievances is the Sunday newspaper, for after enlarging somewhat at length upon the many alleged benefits to accrue from the strict observance of the Sunday Sabbath, he thus vigorously gave expression to his feelings on this subject:—

"The Sunday newspaper has grown and developed into a great power for evil. It stands before us now as more than a social demon. It is the enemy of God's law. It gives its readers instead of good vigorous reading the scandals of the divorce court and other equally sensational matter and begets a taste that is trivial and immoral, vitiating a taste for solid literature. A few months ago the newspapers of London attempted to start the Sunday newspaper but of the five millions of people in that city there was not enough constituency to keep them alive. We may copy that example in America with profit."

That the promoters of Sunday observance contemplate resort to legal coercion in compelling all to religiously observe Sunday as the Sabbath, is manifestly evident from the following from the lips of the same speaker:—

"It [Sunday observance] will promote temperance, good morals and social purity, and in all respects named, the fruit of its observance will be of a character not only to warrant, but to demand the intervention of the strong arm of the civil law to secure the nation its priceless blessings."

Strange as it may seem, in his very next period, Mr. Charleton made use of this language:—

"Its observance will be a powerful factor in promoting material prosperity. It will also secure the acknowledgment of the right of conscience, and the boon of religious liberty."

Just how the "intervention of the strong arm of the civil law" to compel people to keep Sunday whether their conscience so enjoins or not, will ensure to our citizens the "boon of religious liberty" he fails to make clear.

The question of Sunday observance was also brought up in the meetings of the general officers of the United Society of Christian Endeavor by the Toledo Ministerial Association, who are bringing pressure to bear to compel the managers of the Toledo Exposition to close the gates to their exhibition on Sunday. In response to the request of the Toledo ministers, the following resolutions were adopted by the trustees and were later endorsed by the convention.

"The sentiment of the present convention has been sounded on at least one point—that of Sabbath observance. At the meeting of the trustees of the united society yesterday morning, audience was given to a delegation of Toledo ministers to explain the crusade the ministerial element of that city had inaugurated against the desecration of the Lord's day. The centennial celebration of the founding of Toledo is to be celebrated there in 1903, and the exposition is expected to be a big one."

The ministers are already beginning to agitate a Sunday closing feature of the exposition, and, to this effect, were heard by the Christian Endeavor trustees. After their cause was listened to, Secretary Baer was instructed to prepare resolutions supporting their contention and expressing the sentiment of the convention as being opposed to any Sabbath desecration during the progress of that exposition.

The resolution, as adopted, reads as follows:—

"We believe that the Sabbath was given by our Heavenly Father to the children of men to secure to them that physical rest and spiritual uplift which the conditions of human life demand. By his sovereign decree the Lord of all has put into the fundamental law for our race the commandment, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.'

"That law cannot be broken without sin. It cannot be universally or generally ignored without arresting the development of manhood toward the Christly ideal.

"With deep solicitude the Christian people, who are praying for the coming of the kingdom of God, view the encroachment of business and pleasure on these sacred hours. The Sabbath was made for man, and man can ill afford to lose any institution over which the Son of man proclaims his lordship. Therefore, Be it resolved:—

"First, That the members of the Society of Christian Endeavor be affectionately reminded that in doing whatsoever the Lord Christ would have them do, it becomes their duty to keep holy unto God the one day in seven which the Creator's loving forethought has reserved unto our most sacred use.

"Second, That it is still further their duty to bear positive testimony, in every land and clime where their lot may be cast, to the sanctity of the Lord's day.

"Third, That state and local unions be encouraged to use this deliverance as the profound voice of three and a quarter millions of Endeavors in any battles, political or social, which they may be forced to wage, in protecting man's highest and dearest interests set forth in the law of God.

"Fourth, Under the same sanction of imperial numbers, the declaration is made that the highest success of industrial expositions and celebrations of historic events, which may from time to time be held in various places, will be secured by strict closure on the Sabbath day and that managers of such expositions be requested, in deference to the Christian sentiment of this country, to arrange for the closing of their gates and doors on the Lord's day.

"That the preamble and resolutions of this report be published in the Official Report of the convention and the press, and a copy furnished to the Toledo Ministerial Union."

Several prominent clergymen in attendance upon the convention were so rigid as to the proper observance of Sunday that they would not patronize the street-cars even in going to meet their appointments, in some cases walking three or four miles in preference. In this connection the following brief extract from Monday's Detroit Tribune will be of interest:—

"Rev. Joseph Walker of Queensland, Australia, representative to the world's Christian Endeavor convention, held a large audience interested for an hour with a powerful evangelistic sermon at the Fort Street Congregational church yesterday morning. In the course of his exhortation, Rev. Walker made comparison between the Sabbath of Australia and the Sabbath of America. He thanked the Lord that the American Sabbath with its foot ball games and Sunday school picnics had not yet invaded the country where for twenty-nine years he had labored. He even protested against street-car riding on the Sabbath, and said that only three times in his life, and then only in cases of great emergency, had he ridden in street-cars on the Sabbath. 'I have an engagement this evening,' he said, 'but I expect to walk to it.'"

Of another foreign clergyman, Rev. John Pollock, of Glasgow, Scotland, another local paper contained this interesting and somewhat amusing paragraph:—

"Rev. John Pollock, of Glasgow, Scotland, walked from the Cadillac hotel to Westminster Presbyterian church; but when he came to fill his Windsor assignment he found he would have to take the ferry or swim; and he couldn't swim."

The convention placed itself on record very strongly against the seating of the Mormon Congressman-elect Brigham H. Roberts, who is charged with openly practising polygamy. The convention also pronounced in favor of arbitration as a substitute for war and endorsed the czar's alleged peace conference, but its members also most vigorously cheered every reference to the noted military heroes of our late war with Spain and our present shameful struggle with the people of the Philippines. It was therefore difficult to determine which was most favored—peace or war.
