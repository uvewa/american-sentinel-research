A New York telegram of recent date mentioned the fact that The New Era, a Catholic journal, of London, Eng., in its issue of June 24, published an interview with Archbishop Ireland, on "Americanism."

"If by Americanism," says Mr. Ireland, "we are to understand theological errors condemned in the pope's letter, there has been and there is no such thing in America. His eminence, Cardinal Gibbons, writing officially as representative of the American hierarchy to the pope, in response to the letter of his holiness, states this fact most clearly."

After further remarks concerning the much discussed letter of Leo XIII., Mr. Ireland proceeds to define "Americanism." Of course this must be understood from the standpoint of the Roman Catholic Church. As such it is worthy of careful consideration. It most certainly emphasizes all that has ever been said by the AMERICAN SENTINEL as to the purposes of Rome toward the United States.

"If, however," continues the Archbishop, "by Americanism is understood a loyal adhesion on the part of American Catholics to the political condition of their country, and to its Constitution and laws, then Americanism surely exists among them. American Catholics proclaim no thesis which might be applicable to other nations or other times.

"If, again, by Americanism we are to understand a sincere desire to turn to the profit of the church the conditions which modern times and the peculiar circumstances of our country create, then Americanism of this kind can be imputed to us. We in America lose no time in theorizing over possible but not existing situations, nor in dreaming of conditions of past ages. We do the work that is before us.

"If, finally, by Americanism we mean activity in religious work, personal initiative which leaves no stone unturned in seeking success, while always governed in what we do by the superior direction of pope and bishops, then there is among us Americanism. Among American Catholics there is no folding of arms, no saying that nothing can be done." (*Italics ours.*)

According to the foregoing then, "loyal adhesion . . . to the political condition of their country, and to its constitution and laws," together with "a sincere desire to turn to the profit of the church the conditions which modern times and the peculiar circumstances of our country create," coupled with "activity in religious work, . . . which leaves no stone unturned in seeking success," yet, "always governed" "by the superior direction of pope and bishops," is Americanism;—this and nothing else. If this is Americanism, nothing else can be.

Therefore, to object to the dictation of "pope and bishops" in national affairs; to object to the "religious work" of the church "which leaves no stone unturned in seeking success," in turning "to the profit of the church the conditions" which the present peculiar circumstances offer,—to lift a warning voice against all such religio-political movements, as the AMERICAN SENTINEL has been doing, is not Americanism." If "loyal adhesion . . . to the political conditions" that are tending toward a religio-political despotism under the regime of imperialism is Americanism, then for one to oppose the spirit of imperialism, adhering to the grand principles of equal rights as outlined in the Federal Constitution, is not Americanism! If "loyal adhesion" to the misinterpretation given to the national Constitution by which alone the Catholic Church can even profess loyalty to the "Constitution and laws" and be true to herself, is Americanism, then loyalty to the interpretation given to the principles of the document itself by its framers, is not Americanism.

And this is exactly the condition to which we are hastening. This is just what the Catholic Church and some so-called Protestant churches are working so earnestly to secure. And when that time comes, as come it will, where will all the readers of the SENTINEL be found? If we study and cherish principle now, we will be loyal to principle then. As it was better for Daniel to stand loyal to principle with all ancient Babylon against him, so it will be infinitely better for us, then and now, to show a "loyal adhesion" to principle though all modern Babylon be against us; for theories are perishable, while right principles are eternal.
