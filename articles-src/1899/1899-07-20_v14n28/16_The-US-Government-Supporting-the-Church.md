A report from the Philippines states that already in that country the Catholic Church is receiving support from the Government of the United States. This report appeared in the New York World, and is declared to come from a credible source of information. It says:—

"Already the United States is subsidizing the Catholic Church in the Philippines. This is one of the sinister necessities of our entanglement. Abolish priestly rule there and nothing is left to differentiate the Filipinos from the savages. The maintenance of this church, contrary to every principle of our Constitution, must be continued if we are to remain. The friars have fled, but the seculars remain and are an indispensable element in preventing utter chaos in the islands."

And of course, if the Catholic Church is indispensable in the Philippines, it is indispensable in Cuba and Porto Rico. But now that the principles of the Constitution have been abandoned, and the doctrine of government by consent of the governed repudiated, why should the Constitution be expected to stand as a barrier to the support of that church in these islands, by the funds of the Government?
