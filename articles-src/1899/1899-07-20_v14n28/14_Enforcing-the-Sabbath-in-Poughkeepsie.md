Secretary Uriah Wardle, of the Young Men's Christian Association of Poughkeepsie, determined to put a stop to the sale of things on Sunday, disguised himse and went looking for evidence. He bought collar buttons, shoe polish and other articles from merchants on the Sabbath, and caused the arrest of five offenders, who were taken before the recorder yesterday.

It was shown that the astute Wardle went to the store of Morris Baker, who says he never keeps open on Sunday, and kicking at his door got him to open up. Then he worked on his sympathy by pretending that he was a member of a camping-out party, who found themselves with a pie and a ham, but without knives and forks.

After much entreaty Baker sold Wardle a knife and fork. Then one of Wardle's confederates, who had been hiding behind a tree, popped out and arrested the hapless Baker. The recorder fined him $5.

Aaron Friedman, arrested on a similar charge, was fined $5 also. He said he was a Hebrew and closed up on Saturday, but this had no effect, and he gave notice of appeal.

Three other men were forgiven by Wardle on their promising to close up on Sundays hereafter. A public sentiment developed later that caused Wardle to ask that all the fines imposed be remitted.
