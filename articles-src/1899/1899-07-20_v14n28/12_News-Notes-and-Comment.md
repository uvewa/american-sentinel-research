BISHOP POTTER, of the Episcopal Church, having asserted that the Bible is simply "a literature," and that occurrences narrated in it which conflict with "reason" and "natural possibility" are to be rejected as lacking proof, the New York Sun makes reply that by this rule the cardinal doctrines of Christianity would have to be rejected, since all these rest on dogma, which must be accepted, if at all, without proof. This falls under the eye of the Truth Seeker (atheist organ), and is immediately indorsed with the statement that "This position, that Christian theology rests on dogma and not on evidence, is impregnable."

* * *

This plainly shows the real nature of the "higher criticism" to be atheism in disguise. But is the statement true that the cardinal doctrines of Christianity must be accepted without any warrant in reason and human experience? The Sun says it is; and atheism, of course, says so. If it is, then those doctrines are as worthless for any practical purpose as the mummies of Egypt, and should be discarded accordingly. No matter what use may have been made of them once, if they are now dead, as the past is dead, they are mere curiosities of the past, and nothing more.

* * *

And if they are such, the Bible itself is false; for it asserts that "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God," and it comes to us as the Word of God. If men cannot live by its words to day,—if it is a museum rather than a storehouse of food, it does not speak the truth.

* * *

THE Sun says that "The Bible itself is wholly dogmatic in its authority. Its canon was fixed by the church, so far as it is fixed. No other evidence as to its divinity appears." This position may do for the Catholic Church, but it will not answer for Protestants. The Catholic Church claims to be the only authority Protestants have on the question of what is the Word of God and what is not. Thus the Bible rests on the authority of the church, and the church, in turn, rests on the authority of the Bible! A wonderful combination of support and superstructure is this, of a truth!

* * *

OF course, if the Catholic Church rests on the Bible, the Bible cannot rest on the Catholic Church; so that if the Catholic Church has any support at all (for if the Bible be not its support it has none), it does not support the Bible; and thus its claim to be the authority for the Bible disproves itself. The Bible does not rest upon the church, nor does it rest upon dogma; it has a far different and better support than the word of man.

* * *

THE atheist journal inquires, "How can the Fall of Man be proved by natural evidence? What support do we find in nature for the Incarnation, Redemption, Atonement, Resurrection, and Ascension?" It asserts that there is "none whatever," and that "unless they are accepted without proof they cannot be accepted at all."

* * *

NOW IN reality all these things have the very best proof; namely, demonstration. They are all demonstrated in human experience. The Incarnation is the mystery of God dwelling in human flesh. That was seen in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, and is repeated in the person of the true Christian to-day. "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" (Gal. 2:20), is the doctrine of Christianity; and the life is attested by the works. "Christ in you, the hope of glory," is the "mystery of godliness" to-day. Col. 1:27.

* * *

REDEMPTION is salvation from sin; and this is a part of the Christian's daily experience. His whole life is changed, the whole current of his desires and aims turned into a new channel. He is freed from the "law of sin and death" which before had led him in the paths of vice and crime. Are there any people in the world who have been thus reclaimed? and is there any reality to their redemption? Such questions do not demand a serious answer.

* * *

THE Atonement is the at-one ment,—the bringing back of the individual into harmony with God. The proof of this harmony is that the individual loves God. He would not love God if he was at enmity with him. His love to God is shown by his desire to live in harmony with the will of God, expressed in his commandments.

* * *

THE Resurrection is attested by the fact that Christ lives. He lives in every one who has been crucified with him. The Christian life is the life of Christ, and if Christ does not live there is no Christian life on the earth. Is there any Christian life seen on the earth? There is not very much, it is sadly true; but there is enough for a testimony to the world.

The Ascension is testified by the gift of the "Comforter," the Holy Spirit. The promise of the Saviour was that if he ascended to his Father he would send the "Comforter" to his disciples, and Peter, on the day of Pentecost, said to the assembled people, that Jesus of Nazareth, "being by the right hand of God exalted," "hath shed forth this [the Holy Spirit] which ye now see and hear." That was proof to the multitude assembled on that occasion; and the "witness of the Spirit" has been given through succeeding ages down to the present time.

• • •

As before stated, the Christian life is nothing less than the life of Christ. It is the life that testifies—the life that is seen and felt to day, in Christians, by the world; and not a dead dogma, a mere tradition of the past. This life testifies to the world of Christ, and to the truth of the Word of God, to day. "Ye are My witnesses," is the divine word spoken to the people of God; and "Ye are the light of the world." Without this witness to the world there would still be the witness of creation to the existence and character of the Creator; but it is the Christian life that is the special witness of God to the world. And this life is a visible reality in all the world, the evidence of which it requires no exercise of faith on the part of the world to grasp. It is evidence which enters the mind through the natural channels.

• • •

The statement, therefore, that the cardinal doctrines of Christianity rest upon dogma, that "The whole supernatural basis of Christian theology is necessarily dogma purely," as the Sun asserts, is as utterly false as any statement could well be. That idea is simply the basis of atheism, but the truth of the matter affords no basis whatever for disbelief in the Christian religion.

There are four "Christian Science" churches in the city of New York, which fact lends significance to the call which has been made in this city for a public meeting to protest against the "Christian Science" method of treating diseases, and to demand legislation for its prohibition. The leaders among the adherents of the sect in this city seem not to be at all disturbed by the agitation that is being made against them.

The American Ordnance Company, of Bridgeport, Conn., has received an order from the Russian government for $6,000,000 worth of rapid-fire cannon. This is the largest doubt that any government has yet expressed, regarding the success of the czar's undertaking for a general peace.
