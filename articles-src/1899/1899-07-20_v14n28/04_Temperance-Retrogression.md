The following facts regarding this subject are pointed out in the New York Christian Advocate, by H. H. Moore, D. D.:

"It is painfully apparent that the temperance wave in all sections of the nation is fast receding, and that it is followed back by the surging flood of intoxicating drink. Even while Neal Dow was living and his mighty influence pervaded the State of Maine, its prohibitory constitution was trampled under foot and the State became a profitable market for foreign manufacturers, while in many localities all kinds of liquor were sold freely in broad daylight over saloon counters.

"Though constitutional prohibition in that State has done much good, it has not fully met the expectations of its friends either at home or abroad. In Iowa the friends of temperance and good order maintained for some years a stubborn fight against the ingress of the liquor traffic, but finally the weaker ones consented that corn, because of the ruinous cost in getting it to market, might be used in the State for the manufacture of intoxicants. Its glory thus departed.

"The cause of temperance in Kansas has been kept on a higher plane, yet it is not what it ought to be in a State whose constitution pledges prohibition. We freely admit that all these States have done well—much better than their sisters—and that they deserve much credit, yet we cherish the hope that something better is in store for poor, struggling humanity.

"In glancing generally over the country we notice that the platforms are mostly silent which once earnestly pleaded for temperance. No attempt has recently been made by any State to secure constitutional prohibition. The Prohibition Party, backed by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, is doing something to keep alive the moral aspects of the liquor traffic, but we are unable to see that it makes any progress toward ultimate legislative results. In our political contests, State and national, it is scarcely regarded as a factor by either of the great parties."

The writer then proceeds to outline a more effective way of dealing with the liquor evil than those hitherto tried. It must, he says, "be subjected most rigidly to all the laws of business;" "it must support itself, sustain its own losses, and make good any damages it may inflict upon others or upon the public." He believes that "the liquor traffic cannot survive the full development of all the essential laws of its own existence."

If this be so, then a tremendous mistake has been made in not recognizing it at the outset of the temperance crusade, and proceeding at once to develop these laws which would have made the business fatal to itself. But the real basis of the liquor business is not the blunders of temperance reformers, nor their ignorance, but the lack of public sentiment necessary to enforce the measures enacted against it. While public sentiment does not demand the death of the liquor business, it will live.

This retrogression is a sad and an alarming feature of the times; and while it may have been unavoidable, the observation is pertinent that the temperance wave began to recede when the W. C. T. U. and the Prohibition Party joined other issues—particularly that of Sunday enforcement—with the temperance issue, instead of giving their full strength to the creation of public sentiment on that issue alone.
