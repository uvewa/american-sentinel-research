# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, July 20, 1899 (v14n28)

## Article 14: "Enforcing the 'Sabbath' in Poughkeepsie, N. Y."

- **Location:** Opening sentence
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "disguised himse" — this is clearly an OCR truncation of "disguised himself"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "disguised himse" — preserved as it appears in OCR; likely "himself" in the original
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR artifact; original almost certainly reads "disguised himself"
- **Reason:** The word is cut off mid-word, consistent with a column break or OCR error in the source scan.

## Article 20: Back Page Editorial Notes

- **Location:** Multiple paragraphs
- **Issue:** The OCR renders several words with apparent OCR errors: "CERGY" (appears twice, likely "CLERGY"), "MERCENARIO" (likely "MERCENARY"), "IMPECIALIST" (likely "IMPERIALIST"), "DISPARAGREMENT" (likely "DISPARAGEMENT")
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved the OCR text exactly as it appears, including apparent errors
- **Confidence:** LOW — These are almost certainly OCR misreadings of the original printed text
- **Reason:** The back page text appears to have been set in all capitals in the original, which can introduce OCR errors. The intended words are clear from context but the exact printed letters cannot be verified without access to the original scan.

## Author "H. F. Phelps" (Article 05)

- **Location:** Byline "BY H. F. PHELPS"
- **Issue:** This author's initials (HFP) do not appear in the known authors list for this publication.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** H. F. Phelps, HFP
- **Confidence:** HIGH — Byline is explicit
- **Reason:** The byline "BY H. F. PHELPS" appears clearly in the OCR. This may be a one-time contributor not previously identified.

## Author "J. C. Bartholf" (Article 17)

- **Location:** End of article, signature "J. C. BARTHOLF."
- **Issue:** This author's initials (JCB) do not appear in the known authors list for this publication.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** J. C. Bartholf, JCB
- **Confidence:** HIGH — Signature is explicit at end of article
- **Reason:** The name appears clearly as a closing signature, consistent with explicit attribution practice in the Sentinel.

## Article 07: Reprint Attribution

- **Location:** Article header "The Insular Commission on Church and State." / source line "'The Independent,' New York."
- **Issue:** The source attribution appears at the TOP of the article in the OCR rather than at the bottom. In the original layout, this may have been a subheading or caption indicating the source.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Added "—*The Independent*, New York." at the end of the article body as is conventional for reprints in this publication
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — Source is clearly identified; placement convention followed
- **Reason:** The Sentinel's standard practice for reprints is to end with "—*Source Name*". The source line in the OCR appeared above the article text, likely as a header in the original layout.
