A RESIDENT of Pennsylvania writes the following to the Christian Advocate, of this city, in the interests of the suppression of "Sabbath desecration":—

"Editor Christian Advocate: It seems as though the hearts of many Christian people just now are turned toward the question of Sabbath desecration, with the hope of finding a remedy for this growing evil. I would like to make a suggestion through the columns of your valued paper: There are many signs that the workers of this country are rising against the wholesale invasion of their day of rest. Cannot the Christian Church heartily come to terms with the working people of our land for a common campaign for the preservation of the Sabbath? Our greatest foe in this, as in so many other respects, is not the common people, but that insane greed for wealth which exalts itself above everything, even above God. O that the Lord would send us a man not afraid of plain words, who would no longer humbly apologize for the existence of God's commandments, but who would boldly lead us forward to attack! For such a leader the thousands of our Israel are waiting."

The Lord has sent a man of plain words to "Israel," and more than one; but the trouble is the thousands of Israel would not hear them. The messengers said, "The seventh day is the Sabbath," not Sunday: and just as soon as this plain message is received, the problem of suppressing "Sabbath desecration" will present a new aspect altogether.
