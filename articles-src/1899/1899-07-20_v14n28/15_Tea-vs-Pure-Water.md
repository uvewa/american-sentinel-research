The Union Signal, in a report of the "Tea Saloon" experiment started by the United States Church Army, says that—

"Colonel Henry H. Hadley, director of the Church Army, having experimented with coffee bars most successfully for two years, feels certain that the tea saloon will succeed not only because heart and soul, from the highest standpoint, are consecrated to the work, but because it is thoroughly practical. His argument is that 'tea builds up—alcohol burns up; tea quenches thirst—beer starts a thirst.'"

One would almost get the idea from this that tea is a superior beverage over that which the Creator made for the first human pair in Eden. If tea is a better beverage than pure, cold water, then the wisdom of the Creator is certainly open to doubt.

No; the best beverage—incomparably the best—ever made, to quench thirst and promote health, is pure water. Whiskey is the worst beverage ever invented, and in discarding this, why not supply its place with the best beverage, so that the drinker will most quickly and surely reap the benefit of the change?
