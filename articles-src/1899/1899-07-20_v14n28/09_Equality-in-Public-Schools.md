LEOPOLD COHN, a Christian missionary to the Jews, writes to Superintendent Maxwell, protesting against the use of Walter Scott's "Ivanhoe" as supplementary reading in the Brooklyn schools. In it he acknowledges the representative literary position of the work, but affirms that it contains "certain characters which are most misleading caricatures of the truth; such, and outrageously such, is the presentment of Isaac the Jew and his several compatriots." . . . He informs Mr. Maxwell that the letter is not the expression of a personal pique, but is drawn from his heart "at the sight of the sorrow shadowed faces of many Jewish scholars because of the jeering quotations of their schoolmates' learning at school. 'God of Abraham help me,' an expression never heard from the lips of a Jew; and the expressions: 'O holy Jacob' and 'By our Holy Sabbath,' he says every conscientious Jew would esteem as low profanity, not to say sacrilege."

We incline to sympathize with this protest. Public schools supported by the State should not require works (nor allow their introduction) which disparage any race largely [or at all] represented in our conglomerate population, nor hold up to ridicule the religious phraseology or customs of the people whose children must attend the schools. . . . The Superintendent of Education is represented in the interview as saying he has nothing to do with the selection of books, that one of the most admirable characters in literature is the Rebecca of "Ivanhoe;" and adds that when he was a principal, a member of the school board objected to the introduction of Longfellow's "Building of the Ship" on the ground that it was immoral. He is represented as closing the interview with the statement that "such objections are ridiculous."

Probably the interview does him injustice; if not, he fails to make a just distinction. How quickly politicians would rage if the supplementary reading held the Irish people up to ridicule, or caricatured their national pugnacity! The ridicule of the grasping disposition of the Jew is practically an attack upon Christian history; for with all Christian nations prejudicing the Jew in every possible way, how could it be otherwise than that he should have become grasping?

Mr. Cohn makes a powerful historical point when he exclaims: "Shall we foster in the children this anti-Jewish sentiment, which has never failed to work evil upon the oppressor of the Jew, from the death of the firstborn in Egypt to the disgrace of the general staff in France?" We know nothing about Mr. Cohn or his mission, but a man who can make a sentence like this is not to be lightly esteemed. Under the Constitution of the United States, and of the State of New York, there is neither bond nor free, Jew nor Gentile, male nor female—except that men voluntarily exempt women from the labors of political life, eligibility to draft in time of war, and similar burdens.
