There are other recommendations made by the United States Insular Commission sent by the Secretary of War to Porto Rico which we need not discuss now, but the one that has happened to meet most criticism may call for defense. The reader must carefully distinguish this War Department Commission of three members from that sent previously to the same island by the President, of which Dr. Henry K. Carroll was the sole member. He devoted much more time to his investigation, and his final report, which will be much fuller than theirs, is still in preparation.

The following is one recommendation of the War Department's Commission:

"We recommend that a complete separation of church and state be decreed, and that all property, including cemeteries purchased with the public moneys, be declared the property of the Government, except that churches used for religious worship exclusively be allowed to remain in the possession of the congregation now occupying the same, and that this exception may be applied to cover the use of a sufficient number of rooms or buildings in connection therewith now used as residences of pastors actually engaged in pastoral work, with their proper household attendants."

The general drift of that recommendation is right; and it by no means deserves the contemptuous criticisms made on it by some Catholic journals which have never learned the spirit of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Nevertheless, it is by no means clear, and would require a great deal more of interpretation in its application than the Commissioners seem to imagine. . . . Our own impression is that a special court will have to settle many questions of title, including those of ecclesiastical property, and that the ecclesiastical property cannot be limited to churches and parsonages.

But the paragraph which has excited the loudest howls of disapproval is the following:

"That priests and others who have taken the vow of celibacy may be permitted to renounce said vows and enter into married relations, the same as other persons."

A supposedly responsible Catholic paper in Philadelphia calls the Commissioners "a bull in a china shop," and says they are recommending that every facility should be afforded for "committing perjury," and that they "meddle most bare-facedly with the business of the church." A New York Catholic paper, not without usual intelligence, calls this an "impudent recommendation that the President of the United States, or his Secretary of War, shall relieve or absolve the priests and nuns from their vows of celibacy, so that they can enter into the marriage relations a la Martin Luther!"

We beg our Catholic friends to go slow. What is proposed is simply the application to Porto Rico of ordinary American principles. There is no proposition to absolve anybody from vows. There is only the proposition that those who have left the Catholic Church be no longer forbidden to marry. The Spanish laws forbid marriage to such people, but in this country we let the church attend to its own perverts, and thunder as loud excommunications as it pleases, but the state keeps its hands off; it forbids neither excommunication nor marriage. Even now a pervert priest can marry here, but he cannot in Porto Rico till the marriage laws are changed, and they ought to be changed. A priest or nun ought to be allowed by the state to renounce the Catholic Church and its vows, and then to do what any other citizen can lawfully do. Anything less is Spanish tyranny, and we are sorry that this Americanism has not yet been learned even by some of our progressive Catholics of Irish descent.
