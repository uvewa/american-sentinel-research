IT WAS HELD AT RUSSELLVILLE, KENTUCKY, A CENTURY AGO.

"The effect of the McGee brothers' preaching—especially of John McGee—at a Presbyterian quarterly meeting on the banks of Red River, in Kentucky, was so startling, and seemed so clearly to indicate that it was the result of divine agency or some mysterious force possessed by the preacher, that the news of the occurrence spread rapidly in all directions throughout that part of the State, and attracted unbounded interest," writes Clifford Howard in the July Ladies' Home Journal. "If it did not at once awaken a responsive religious feeling, it at least excited curiosity, and when it was learned that the McGee brothers were to hold a meeting at Russellville, Kentucky, a newly settled town in Logan County, near the Muddy River, persons from all parts of the adjoining country irrespective of their religious beliefs or church allegiance, prepared to attend. It soon became evident that the four walks of a country meeting-house would not suffice to hold the large numbers that were making ready to go to Russellville. The problem thus presented was solved by determining to hold the meeting in the open air. Those coming from a distance were prepared to camp; it would be no hardship to them to remain out-of-doors. The recent experience at Red River had proved this. It was not expected by those who were coming that the lodging accommodations at the village at Russellville would be sufficient by any means. Why, therefore, attempt to house the people? Prepare a camping-ground, and let the meeting be a 'camp' meeting. This, then, was the origin of camp-meetings; and the first one held in America was on the banks of the Muddy River, near Russellville, Kentucky, in the month of August, 1799—one hundred years ago. Not that religious worship had never before been held in the open air, but the special feature of camping out and the nature of the services made the camp-meeting a distinctive institution, and characterized this particular gathering on Muddy River as the first of its kind."
