Press dispatches state that the President "is working energetically" upon a plan to secure a vote of the Cuban people upon the question whether or not Cuba shall be annexed to the United States. They are to vote on this before the American military forces are withdrawn from the island.

The President, it is said, believes the Cubans would vote for annexation, and in this view is supported by General Wood, who affirms that in Santiago "annexation would be carried by four to one."

To appreciate the significance of this step it is only necessary to remember that Cuba is under American military rule, which has already discouraged the expression of anti-American sentiment in Cuba by establishing a censorship of the press. The President has supporters who know how to manage an election campaign, and with the backing of American bayonets no great difficulty could be anticipated in securing the result desired.

It is stated that "so strong is the President's tendency toward annexation that it is expected an effort will be made in Congress at the coming session to rescind the resolution providing for Cuban independence and to substitute a plan by which the matter may be submitted to a vote of the people of the island."

Such is the latest view of the vanishing prospect of Cuban independence.
