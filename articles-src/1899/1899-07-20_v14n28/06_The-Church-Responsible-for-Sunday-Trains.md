In view of the lament that is so widely heard over the prevalence of Sunday desecration, it is interesting to note that one prominent form of such desecration—the Sunday passenger train—had its origin in Sunday church-going itself. People who observed Sunday, and were regular attendants at church on that day, instituted the Sunday train themselves to accommodate themselves in church going. This being so, and also the fact that professedly Christian people are largely responsible for the Sunday newspaper, is it not evident that the reform in Sunday observance for which so many are now calling, needs to begin in the church, by a deepening of the church's own regard for the day, rather than by legal penalties enforced upon those without? Ought not the would-be physician first to heal himself?

We give the following statements concerning the origin of these Sunday trains, upon the authority of The Defender, organ of the New England Sabbath Protective League:—

"The first local Sunday trains in Massachusetts were put on in November, 1860, between Brookline and Boston. Certain well-to-do people, who were members of churches in Boston, had moved out to Brookline, but wished to retain their membership and continue to attend church in Boston as formerly. As Mr. Henry Twichell, the superintendent and controlling power of the Boston and Worcester road, was a resident of Brookline, they applied to him to put on a Sunday local, as there had already been week day locals for a number of years. It being unlawful to run any but United States mail trains on Sunday, Mr. Twichell hesitated a long time before granting their request. He was a public-spirited man, however, and felt a pride in using the resources at his command to oblige his fellow-citizens. He, therefore, yielded to the steadily increasing pressure of their requests, and put on two trains each way. These were announced in the Boston Daily Advertiser, of Monday, Nov. 26, 1860. These trains being unlawful, special pains were taken to guard against accidents, and as soon as possible the right was secured from the post-office department to make them mail trains so that they might thus become lawful.

"As soon as the trains began to run, a new movement of travel was developed; for it was found that people, who had formerly lived in Brookline, but were now living in Boston, desired to attend their old church, and were using the newly-started trains for that purpose. Thus it came about that these Sunday trains were carrying people both ways to church.

"A similar state of affairs obtained in the case of those trains which were run to Newton Lower Falls, and which were first put on August 2, 1874. They were only obtained after much urgency, and the party who was perhaps most active in the matter, carrying about the petition and otherwise working up the case, was a leading musician and chorister in one of the most prominent churches of Boston. Formerly, his custom had been to go into Boston on Saturday, and return on Monday. It seemed to him that a Sunday train, by which he could go into the city in the forenoon and return in the afternoon or evening, would be a great convenience. His efforts were at length rewarded, and a train was run three times each way on Sunday.

"In the same line with the cases just cited is that of the Old Colony railroad. Formerly a horse railroad was run to Quincy; and it appears that a considerable number of people dwelling there were accustomed to use this road to attend a very fashionable church in Boston upon the ministrations of one of the popular preachers in the city.

"There came a time, however, when the horse railroad was to be discontinued, but before this was done the authorities of the Old Colony road were appealed to, and arrangements were made by which local trains were run on Sunday to accommodate those who had been accustomed to go into Boston by the horse railroad to church. In response, then, to these appeals for Sunday trains, on Monday, June 3, 1872, three Sunday 'locals' from South Braintree to Boston, and two in return were announced. Thus began the 'church trains' on the Old Colony road.

"A striking and significant incident, in connection with these trains, occurred a few years ago. A clergyman, who resided in one of the suburban villages on the line of this road was engaged for a length of time to supply a church on the west side of Boston. In fulfilling his engagement he was accustomed to come in on the train which reached the station in Boston at a quarter past ten o'clock. Finding that a quarter of an hour was too short an interval of time for him to get to his pulpit as promptly as he wished, he wrote a letter to the superintendent of the road, asking that the train might be brought in a few minutes earlier for his benefit.

"The experience of the Boston and Providence road in this matter was quite similar to that of the roads already given, for among the signatures of the petition which finally secured the Sunday 'locals' on that road was that of a pastor of local prominence.

"To sum up the whole matter in brief, it can safely be asserted that all the facts, so far as ascertained, show that the inauguration and establishment of the Sunday local train system on the railroads which center in Boston was wholly the work of church-going people, and that it was, also, for their convenience in going to special churches to which they had become attached; it was not called for, however, by any necessity in enabling them to attend upon the public worship of God. Moreover, the prominence which we have given to the Boston and Worcester (now Boston and Albany) railroad in this matter is just; for not only did it run Sunday locals for more than ten years before any other road, but the general testimony is that it was the example and influence of this, the most powerful road coming into Boston, which finally made it necessary for the other roads to yield to the opportunity of their patrons, and do as that road was doing."
