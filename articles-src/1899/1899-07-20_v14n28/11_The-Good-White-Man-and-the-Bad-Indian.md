By Government order a strict prohibition is put upon all liquor selling to the Indians on the reservation at Leech Lake, Minn., and all white men who violate this order are to be expelled from the district. The order is issued on the assumption that it was whiskey that caused the Indians at that place to attack the whites last fall, and that the whiskey that caused the trouble was in the Indians. How would it do to prohibit the selling of whiskey to white men in the same locality? If drunken Indians are not to be allowed among the whites, let not drunken whites be allowed among the Indians. History shows that the whites have been more often than otherwise at the bottom of the troubles they have had with the red man.
