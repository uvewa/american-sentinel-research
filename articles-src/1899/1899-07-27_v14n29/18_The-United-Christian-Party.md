## The "United Christian Party."

We mentioned briefly last week the session of the "United Christian Party," at Des Moines, Ia., and steps taken by them to make this Government a government of God. We give here in full the resolutions adopted at the meeting, taken from the Des Moines Leader, of July 6:—

"We, the United Christian Party, in State convention assembled at Des Moines, Ia, July 4 and 5, 1899, acknowledge Almighty God as the rightful sovereign of all men and women, and the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler among nations of the earth, and that he is entitled to all the honor and glory and to whose laws all human enactments must conform to secure the blessings of peace and prosperity, do present the following declaration of principles:—

"That we, as a party, favor whatever tends to make men and women virtuous, intelligent and happy, and acknowledge that God gave us in his Word the foundation for law and a standard for justice through Christ for the government of all mankind.

"We hold that all temporal governments derive their just powers from God through Christ and by the consent of the governed.

"We recognize the fact that there are many important reforms needed and that none of these can be accomplished until we acknowledge Christ and unite in his name—not a union of church and state—but a union of all Christian voters at the ballot box for the overthrow of the licensed saloon and all legalized wrong.

"Therefore we, the United Christian Party, seeking the welfare of all the people, pledge our entire energies to the work of securing a system of government that will make reforms possible.

"Believing that it will be impossible to secure direct legislation without a union of all Christians, we ask all his followers, regardless of nationality, creed or color, sect or previous politics, to cooperate with us at the ballot box in making this a government which shall be in fact a government from God.

"We do, therefore, declare for the adoption of the system of direct legislation known as the 'initiative and referendum,' together with proportionate representation and the 'imperative mandate,' that the power of the people may be justly and effectually exercised; being governed in all things, law-making included, by the standard, 'What would Jesus do?'

"We, therefore, advocate this system of government and present it to the people as the only practical method of securing state and national reform.

"Resolved, That we will not cast our ballots in any other than the name of Jesus Christ, and that we will endeavor to be guided by God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.—Amen."
