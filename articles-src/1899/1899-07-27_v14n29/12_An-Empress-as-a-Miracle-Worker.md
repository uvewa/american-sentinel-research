## An Empress as a Miracle Worker.

"New York Journal."

The cable brings an absurd story of how the people of Neweselika, a village in Galicia, have been stirred by a "miracle." It seems that the owner of a portrait of the late Empress Elizabeth of Austria discovered blood oozing from the canvas at a point just above the heart of the empress.

The occurrence was reported to the church authorities. Bishop Shuciewicz took charge of the painting. He, too, found blood upon it. The canvas was cleaned and hung upon the walls of the Greek church, where no one could tamper with it. The heart of the departed empress again stained the portrait with blood. The good bishop promptly declared it a "miracle," and pious pilgrims have come from remote lands to worship before the painting of the empress.
