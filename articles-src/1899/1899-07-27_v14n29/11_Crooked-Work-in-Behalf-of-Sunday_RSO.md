## Crooked Work in Behalf of Sunday.

**Editor American Sentinel:** The following affidavit I copied word for word in the presence of the justice of the peace, T. C. Lantrip, from the original which he loaned me for the purpose:—

"State of Mississippi, Monroe Co.

"Before me, T. C. Lantrip, a justice of the peace of said county, G. P. Rye, on information makes affidavit that R. S. Owen, on or about the 14th day of May, 1899, in said county, District No. 1, was found at work hoeing cotton, the same being Sunday the first day of the week, against the peace and dignity of the State of Mississippi.

"G. P. Rye.

"Sworn to and subscribed before me this seventeenth day of May, 1899.

"T. C. LANTRIP, J. P."

It was on the authority of this affidavit that I was arrested on the 27th day of May, and on the authority of the same I am to be tried on the 19th day of July. Mr. G. P. Rye lives when at home about a mile from my home. Mr. Lantrip, J. P., lives about five miles away. Mr. Rye is, I believe, a revenue officer. He has been away from home ever since my arrest till two days ago when I met him at Amory. I had a little talk with him, and he gave me the following bit of information:—

Mr. Rye said, "I have heard of your arrest since I came back, and it has come to me that I was the prosecutor, but this was the first that I knew of it. I never entered a complaint against you; only Mr. Lantrip came to me and asked me if I saw you at work. I of course told him that I did, but I did not know what you were hoeing." I asked, "Did you not sign a paper stating that I was hoeing cotton?" "No," he replied, "I never signed any paper concerning you." "Did you not take an oath that I was seen at work on Sunday?" "I never did. I never have seen Mr. Lantrip since I saw him on the street when he asked me about your work."

I was quite surprised to hear this, and as the Methodist minister was standing near by I asked him to state the same before him, which he did.

Now this looks to me like a crooked piece of work for a man who is undertaking to correct by law his neighbor's religious practise. I am not prepared to say which one has told the falsehood; the future may bring that to light. But at any rate the one who is leading out in this prosecution is trying to cover up his tracks by falsehood. Mr. Lantrip is a member of the Baptist Church, so we would not expect him to make any untrue statement. Nor would we expect him to be in favor of religious persecution; but some way there are indications that he will be as severe on me as he can. He made the constable double the amount of my bond after it had been written out with the usual amount for light cases of misdemeanor. Then he wants every witness that he can obtain whether they will be needed for my conviction or not; which will add to the costs of the trial.

I hope to get a statement in writing from Mr. Rye.
