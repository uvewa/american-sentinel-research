"Destiny," "The Inexorable Logic of Events," Etc.—No. 1.

BY JOHN D. BRADLEY.

"Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings."

"Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his own hands shall be given him."

To the above terms the American people need no introduction. However, there are certain facts and principles connected with and suggested by them with which many Americans are evidently not familiar.

There is such a thing as destiny and there is such a thing as the inexorable logic of events. There is a destiny that means honor and length of days, and there is a destiny that means degradation and death. Every event has its logic,—yes, its inexorable logic,—which, if not resisted, produces with ever-increasing succession other events of the same kind until the final sequence is reached in one or the other of these destinies. There comes a time when the cords of iniquity are too strong to be broken.

"The first crime past compels us unto more,
And guilt grows fate that was but choice before."

Many men and nations, unwilling to recognize the fact in the day of their power and their prosperity, have found in the day of their anguish and of their calamity that the logic of events is indeed inexorable. The inexorable logic of such an event as the repudiation of truth and justice under the plea of "destiny," is that the man or the nation that does so hasten to swift destruction. Men have something to do with their destinies. Because there is such a thing as the inexorable logic of events it behooves them to look well to the events that come into their lives, and never should they for any cause or under any circumstances let one of those events be a resort to the miserable plea of "destiny" in defense of their actions. If they do, it will count much in determining their destiny, and woe unto them because of that destiny.

Destiny does not determine actions, words, and motives, but actions, words, and motives determine destiny. In the day of reckoning and retribution, men and nations will find that destiny is not responsible for them, but that they are responsible for their destinies. They will find that the logic of events is indeed inexorable and that no event in the life of an individual or in the history of a nation is so full of inexorable logic as is a resort to the melancholy excuse of "destiny" and "the inexorable logic of events."

When a course of action is defended by the plea of "destiny" and "the inexorable logic of events" it is already condemned. It is unnecessary to look farther, because anything that is lawful and just does not care to bolster itself with the prop to which iniquity has always been obliged to resort.

The doctrine of irresponsibility originated in the father of lies and was by him insinuated into the minds of the parents of the race. When Adam and Eve forsook the high destiny which faithful obedience opened to them and accepted the lie that by transgression of law they could enter a broader field of knowledge, reach a nobler development, find greater happiness, and enter upon a higher state of existence,—that, in fact, by disobedience, it was their destiny to become "as gods,"—they found in the hour of their need and shame that in return for the loss of everything they had received from the deceiver nothing but his own miserable excuse of irresponsibility. And in all the ages since their sons and daughters who have sought to find happiness, development and wisdom in violation of law, have been obliged invariably to cling to this ruinous and unsupportable support.

Men who have held unlawful power over their fellowmen have always been "men of destiny." The more unscrupulous and indefensible their usurpation the more certain have they been that "manifest destiny" was directing it all. On such an abominable doctrine and on nothing else could they base their authority. This irrational subterfuge was the nearest approach to reason of which their conduct would admit. Necessity and irresponsibility was the plea of iniquity in the beginning, and it has been the plea of despotism and tyranny always and everywhere.

"Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge
On you, who wrong me not, for Him who wrong'd.
And should I, at your harmless innocence
Melt, as I do, yet public reason just,
Honor and empire with revenge enlarged,
By conquering this new world, compels me now
To do, what else, though damn'd, I should abhor.
So spake the fiend, and with necessity,
The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds."

The doctrine of irresponsibility is individual before it becomes national. When it becomes the doctrine of an organization of men it proves that the majority of those men have held that doctrine already as an individual matter. And when that doctrine has gained such a hold upon the individuals of society and of the nation that it can pass as the doctrine of society and of the nation, the portents are ominous. Not only does it indicate the evil that is, but it prepares the way for and makes certain the evils that are to be. It indicates that the force of moral obligation has weakened upon society and that it is to become weaker. When men proclaim this doctrine and succeed in getting it indorsed by the mass of the people there inevitably follows a reaction both upon themselves and upon the rest of society. "Men are influenced by their own words. They may express that which they do not really believe, but the expression reacts upon the thought." Under the impulse to defend actions for which there is no defense, men may proclaim the subterfuges of "destiny" and "the inexorable logic of events" before they really believe them. The result will be that they will believe them in reality before they cease to proclaim them.

The effect upon society of the proclamation of the doctrine of irresponsibility will be to further obliterate the sense of responsibility from the minds of those who are already affected, and to spread the contagion to others who have not yet been effected. It has been well said that the vehemence, obstinacy, and vindictiveness of a multitude is received into the single breast of the individual who joins it in its warfare. Likewise the irresponsibility of a multitude concentrates itself in the single breast of the individual who is joined to it, and he becomes more insensible to responsibility than he ever could become otherwise.
