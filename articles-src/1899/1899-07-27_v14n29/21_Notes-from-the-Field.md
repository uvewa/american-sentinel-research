## Notes from the Field.

### IOWA.

In a quiet way the agitation for Sunday enforcement is going on in this State. In a meeting recently held at Creston, the speaker was asked if the Jews and Seventh-day Adventists ought to be compelled to observe Sunday as a rest day, after having rested conscientiously on the seventh day, while the commandment said, "Six days shalt thou labor." His answer was that if they did not abide by the laws, subject to the powers that be, they should be banished to Devil's Island, or some other place. They were a conscientious people, but sadly deluded.

### MICHIGAN.

LANSING.—On Sunday, July 2nd, just preceding the anniversary of our Nation's birth, the various congregations of Lansing, Mich., joined in union service on the front steps of the State Capitol. The minister who gave the address was the same one who a few weeks before had urged the civil authorities to pass a religious measure. He declared that he could make the law operative if it were passed. He told how he had secured the enforcement of a similar statute in another State. It was by getting the chief of police and prosecuting attorney "at swords points" with each other. Thus are the principles of truth and right perverted by those who are believed to be representatives of the Prince of Peace.

### NORTH CAROLINA.

ASHEVILLE is agitating the Sunday question again. Some six months ago the matter was up, but nothing seemed to be accomplished. It appears that the power of closing on Sunday rests with the aldermen, and it is said that some of these are interested in the concerts held at the park, and the street cars that haul the people out. In order to increase the receipts at the park these wise city fathers passed a law that the drug stores should not sell soda water on Sunday. This competition does not suit the church element of course, and so they are howling that the street cars are doing more harm in carrying the people to the park away from religious services than was done by the drug stores in selling soda water. And thus the agitation goes on.

### UTAH.

The ministers of Ogden have been engaged in a conflict with Sunday baseball. After working the matter to the best of their ability, the result was a test case of the city ordinance. These reform efforts have so far proved futile. In the Springville Independent, of May 25, it was reported that the Salt Lake Clerks' Association threatened to prosecute all clothing and other stores which keep open on Sunday; I have not yet heard of any arrest.

ALFRED WHITEHEAD.

### MINNESOTA.

LAST winter, a bill was introduced in the legislature, which provided that it should be a part of the duty of the Commissioner of Labor to look after the matter of Sunday work. The bill was pushed through, and has received the signature of the governor.

Query: Why should not the said Commissioner of Labor look after the matter of Monday or Tuesday work? The answer proves this to be purely religious legislation.
