Clericalism in politics is illustrated by events of recent occurrence in Belgium. The account says:—

"Riots promoted by Social Democrats have taken place in the Belgian Chamber of Deputies, and in the streets. Priests have taken part, among them the Abbe Dæans, who calls himself a Christian Democrat. He predicts the advent of universal suffrage, and two thousand persons accompanied him to the train singing 'The Marseillaise.' A revolution would have ensued if the government had not yielded in the matter of willingness to consider an amendment to the reform bill securing representation to minorities. In Belgium the extortions and exactions of the Clerical Party account for the rancor. The gerrymandering is such that from nine hundred and ninety-six thousand votes the opposition in parliament has thirty-eight members, whereas the Clericals, with fifty thousand less votes, have one hundred and fourteen members, and the electoral law which has provoked the riots was intended to assure this predominance to the Clericals forever."

Just as soon as the churches and religious societies in this country go a little deeper into politics and become represented in the legislatures, there will be a clerical party in the Government of the United States; and a clerical party in the Government here will act just as such a party has always done elsewhere; for all such parties are guided by the same principles.
