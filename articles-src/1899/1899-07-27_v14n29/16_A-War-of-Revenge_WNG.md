## A War of Revenge.

Despite the many efforts on the part of "the better class of citizens" to drown the slogan "Remember the 'Maine,'" and to make the world believe that "this Christian nation" waged war with the Christian nation of Spain solely on the ground of sympathy with downtrodden Cuba, there is ever coming to the surface the one underlying purpose—revenge. The administration was doing everything possible to avert war, and claimed a fair prospect of accomplishing the then desired object—Cuban independence—by diplomacy, until the "Maine" incident; then the people could no longer be restrained. And in the front rank of the clamorers for revenge were "Christian" clergymen and "Christian" periodicals. The latest bit of incidental evidence that revenge was the motive power of the war in naval circles, as well as among citizens at large, is an article in the New Voice of July 1, by William Wallace Whitelock, chief yeoman and captain's clerk of the gunboat "Gloucester." The subject is, "On board the Gloucester with Wainwright," and the chief topic is Captain Wainwright himself, who was executive officer of the "Maine" at the time of her destruction in Havana harbor. Of him the writer says:—

"As executive officer of the 'Maine' at the time of her destruction, he had earned the right of avenger, and when the hour of reckoning came on the third of July, he was waiting at the harbor entrance, ready for his part in the drama."

Further on, speaking of the position of the "Gloucester" in the engagement, the writer says:—

"There was no safety save in aggressiveness, so that unwittingly Captain Wainwright did more for us by his daredevil policy than he could have done otherwise. I have a suspicion, however, that he was not thinking much either of our safety or of his own; he was thinking of the 'Maine,' and of his duty to his country."

Before the war, independence was lauded as the ideal condition for the Cuban people, but as soon as the "Maine" was avenged, and Cuba was wrested from the domination of Spain, our "Christian-civilization" idea of good government precluded even the experiment of independence. Cuba was too little to walk alone amid the great Christian nations of earth. Since the "grab bag" has become an institution of raising means for the propagation of the modern gospel of peace, Cuba is not safe while the Christian nations are fishing for chances. Our fostering hand is needed to protest her resources, and her people ought to be happy in the prospect of being cared for by their superiors! This country has had her revenge, and the Cubans ought to be satisfied, as they are too weak to indulge in such luxury. If they will be good, and give their consent to being governed by other people, they may yet become a part of the great republic(?).
