"Disembodied Spirits" a Legal Fraud.

A NEBRASKA court has decided that the Spiritualist doctrine of the materialization of "disembodied spirits" is a fraud. The following statement of the case appears in the New York Sun:—

"LINCOLN, Neb., July 19.—The first known judicial determination that disembodied spirits cannot be materialized by human means was made by United States Commissioner Billingsly to-day, who decided that it was impossible. The State Spiritualists' Association is holding a camp-meeting here. It contracted to pay D. J. Moran of San Francisco $180 for the appearance here of his two sons as mediums. When Moran reached here he insisted upon a published statement that the children were not fakes. This was declined, and he refused to allow the children to give séances.

"He was then arrested for using the mails to defraud. President Madding of the society positively swore that disembodied spirits could be materialized, but the other officers were not so sure. The defendant's attorney moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that as a legal proposition, a man cannot be held for refusing to do that which cannot be done, and the court sustained the motion and discharged Moran."
