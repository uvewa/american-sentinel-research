## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 16, Editor's Notes
- **Issue:** The editor's notes open with "Is this week's SENTINEL we introduce for the first time..." — the word "Is" appears to be an OCR error for "In." However, the original text has been preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR source. If the original scan can be consulted, this should be verified.
- **Second pass completed:** Noted but cannot verify against original image.
- **Transcribed as:** "Is this week's SENTINEL we introduce..."
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly an OCR error for "In," but original text preserved per project rules.

### Page 8, Running Header
- **Issue:** Page 8 shows "556" as the page number in the OCR, while surrounding pages show 450–455. This is almost certainly an OCR error for "456."
- **Impact:** None — page numbers are not transcribed into article files.
- **Confidence:** HIGH that it is an error, but irrelevant to transcription.

### Article 07 — "The Demoralizing Spirit of War"
- **Issue:** The word "pawns" appears in the phrase "I have read and listened to countless pawns in the South and in the North to the dauntless courage of the heroes..." — this is likely an OCR error for "paeans" (songs of praise). However, the original text has been preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR source.
- **Transcribed as:** "countless pawns"
- **Confidence:** LOW — context strongly suggests "paeans," but the original scan should be consulted to confirm.

### "Notes from the Field" correspondents
- C. G. Howell (Michigan), R. D. Hottel (North Carolina), Alfred Whitehead (Utah), H. F. Phelps (Minnesota) — field correspondents signing their individual state reports. These are treated as part of one collective article (file 21) rather than four separate files, as they appear under a single department heading.
