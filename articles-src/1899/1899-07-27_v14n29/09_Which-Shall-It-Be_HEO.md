**Which Shall It Be?**

BY H. E. OSBORNE.

One of the latest propositions relative to the advancement of the modern so-called "good-citizenship" movement, comes from former Postmaster-General John Wanamaker, whose rare qualities of mind have won for him a triune crown of fame. In the commercial world he is esteemed as a prince among merchants. In the political field his success won for him a place in the national cabinet, and more recently he has distinguished himself in seeking to overthrow "boss rule" in Pennsylvania. Last but not least, Mr. Wanamaker is famous in the religious world as the model superintendent of the world's greatest Sunday school, and at the recent International Sunday-school convention he was elected chairman of the Executive Committee.

Presumably Mr. Wanamaker's recent unsuccessful tilt with the Goth-like giant, Bossism (who still walks at large, be it observed), has caused him to unduly associate political problems with his duties as a faithful Sunday school superintendent. In any case Mr. Wanamaker's fine intellect has brooded over political and Sunday-school problems, till it has hatched the following confession of faith:

"I believe a good government club in a Sunday school and in a church and the teaching of lessons on good citizenship, must be a part of the future work of our churches and Bible schools."

To all of which a leading Sunday-school magazine makes haste to give decided approval, saying, "Well said, and well it will be when it is well done." Of course it must be presumed that Mr. Wanamaker here speaks as a Sunday-school worker and not a politician. Thus it is officially purposed by the head of the International Sunday-school movement, to make good government clubs of the churches, and transform the Bible schools into institutes of instruction in good citizenship! Doubtless this proposition will be heartily indorsed by many who have not hitherto been so much interested in Sunday schools as in politics.

Now if it is the duty of some church members to join the good government club, it must be the duty of all the members. And when all the members of the church are also members of the club, how can the parson know, as on a Sunday morn he invokes God's blessing upon his congregation, whether he is praying for the church or the club?

The church cannot be a good government club, neither can the good government club be the church, for the great Head of the church himself has distinguished and divided the functions of civil government and the church. What, then, can the pastor's congregation really be? If it is the church where is the club? and if it is the club what has become of the church? Who will properly name this new-fangled conglomeration?
