ENFORCED rest always makes a well man very tired.

DEMOCRACY and great wealth cannot flourish together in the same land.

EVERY Sunday law finds fault with men for following the example of the Creator.

THE cords that hold mankind in the channels of morality are not attached to any earthly source of power.

THIS age is doing its best to give the lie to that old and familiar Scripture, "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches."

THE nations all profess friendship for one another, but no nation has as much friendship for any other nation as it has for gold.

THE only significance that can belong to a weekly rest upon a specified day is a religious one. That was the significance given it by the Creator in the beginning, and no sophistry of man or act of the legislature can make it different.

THE only Sabbath which God ever provided for mankind is a spiritual Sabbath—"the Sabbath of the Lord;" and that the Omniscient never provided any other ought with Christians at least to be proof that no other is needed.

It is not more and louder thunders of law, with awe-inspiring manifestations of power and majesty, that is needed to make things better in the world. The ancient Hebrews had all this at Mount Sinai, but instead of drawing them nearer the Lord, it only drove them further away.

IN republican government an institution is subservient to the individual, and not the individual to an institution. Government serves the individual, and is not his lord and master. The former was made for the latter, not the latter for the former. The individual was the crowning act of God's creation, and man has not made anything greater than was made by him.
