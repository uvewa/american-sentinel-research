NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT

LAST week a strike of motormen and conductors was inaugurated on the surface roads of Brooklyn, under the direction of the labor organization to which these men belong. The outcome has called attention to several noteworthy facts.

* * *

THE strike failed, because the places of the strikers were promptly filled with "non-union men"—some being imported from Philadelphia and Boston—and the street car company was thus enabled to continue the service on its lines with but little interruption. This event contradicts the glowing reports of prosperity that have been circulated throughout the country. There can be no very great prosperity in a land where many thousands of intelligent men are ready to hail as a godsend the chance to earn two dollars by working twelve or fourteen hours a day in a great city. The lot of the most miserable farm laborer is far preferable to that of men compelled to maintain a family under such circumstances.

* * *

THERE are hard times wherever there are many people who are dependent for employment upon other persons who have no employment to give them. The number of workingmen is too large for the amount of work that business corporations have on hand to be done. This is not the fault of the corporations; it is the fault of the people themselves. The people themselves do not have enough love for independence; they do not have enough love for the quietness and simplicity of country life; they prefer to flock to the great cities, and become dependent almost for their very existence upon the will and caprice of a mortal like themselves. They flee from the gardens which God made to the cities which man—and the devil—have made. If they had a Garden of Eden to live in they would not be satisfied until they had turned it into a hell of piled-up brick and iron and stone, of saloons and slums, of sweatshops and stifling factories, of soul-crushing corporations and the political boss. God had to drive man out of the Garden of Eden after he had sinned, not merely to guard the Tree of Life, but to guard everything else within the place against the "improvements" which sinners, prompted by their human nature, would speedily have undertaken if he had been allowed to remain. Every sinner is engaged in choosing and building for himself the hell he will finally enter unless he shall be reclaimed by the grace of God.

* * *

It is the devil's studied plan to crush out of the people all independence, and the people readily lend themselves to his scheme. He is making them more and more dependent upon man, in order that they may feel less and less dependence upon God. He is working steadily to crush out of men the principle that leads an individual to think and act for himself, so that he may have one man think and act for a multitude who look up to him as though they depended on him rather than on God for their daily bread. Thus he exalts man into the place of God, and lightens work for himself by controlling a multitude through one person. The whole principle and purpose of this miserable dependence is devilish, and directly contrary to the order of God.

* * *

THE gospel stands for individuality. God made men as individuals, and will save them only as individuals. Faith can be had only by individuals. The devil therefore is working to crush out individuality from the earth. In this, at the present time, he has largely succeeded. The idea that a man can stand alone, that he can think and act for himself in the business affairs of life, paying deference only to upright principles in his dealings with his fellows, is now an antiquated doctrine in most minds. He must join and move with a federation, lose his individuality entirely and become like a mindless and soulless piece of a machine. When the committee of the union says "strike," he must strike, whether he wants to do so or not. On the other hand, he is equally a part of the machine of the corporation by which he is employed.

* * *

THIS is plainly stated in the following, said with reference to the Brooklyn "strike," by a daily of this city:—

"Whenever a strike is in progress there are a few people who object to concerted action on the part of the men, and think the existence of the union is the source of all the trouble. They always raise the same old cry, 'This is a matter between man and man.' They will tell you that each individual should deal directly with his employer and make the best terms he can for himself.

"Those people are the Rip Van Winkles of to-day; they have been asleep while the whole world has been changing. . . . If they would open their eyes and look about them they would discover that there is no longer anything that is 'a matter between man and man.'

"The individual employer has disappeared, and in his place is a corporation representing many men and a vast aggregation of capital. In the face of this combination the workingman standing alone is utterly powerless. Even the separate union is finding the odds against it too great. A union of unions is a necessity now, and probably will arrive before long. It will include all the workers of every class, and will soon settle the labor question. Nothing short of it can do so."

* * *

Not merely must there be a combination of men in a "union," but there must be a "union of unions," in order that the laboring man may get what is his due from his employer. But how much will an individual count for in a "union of unions"? Whatever the laborer can get from such a combine, cannot possibly be as valuable to him as are the independence and individuality it obliges him to give up.

* * *

The counsel of the Lord to the workingmen is not to trust in confederacies, but to sanctify Him in their hearts, and to let Him be their fear. The fear of the Lord casts out the fear of man; and in union with Him there is more strength than in any union of unions of men.

That clear thinker and lover of American principles of government, Mr. Carl Schurz, in a speech made not very long ago against imperialism, said that so far as the advantage of an alliance with Great Britain was concerned, it would be found that America and England would be very likely to have a falling out when they undertook to divide the spoils of the earth together. The truth of this statement is illustrated just now by friction that has arisen between the two nations regarding the possession of gold bearing territory in the Northwest. The friction is termed by the press, the "Alaskan boundary dispute." It is claimed by the United States that Canada is demanding possession of a piece of ground to which the United States has clear title; that her course in the matter is unprecedented and her claim absurd. Negotiations for a settlement of the difficulty have been in progress for some time, but the situation has only become more and more serious, until both disputants are sending armed forces to the district to preserve order. "The State Department," it is stated, "is apprehensive of serious trouble between American and British miners and the Canadian police."

* * *

American journals, of course, insist that there shall be no surrender of United States territory to Canada and Great Britain, and this decision, it is said, has been reached by the Administration at Washington. The Government has called a halt upon Canada and Great Britain, and waits for them to precipitate a conflict if they so desire.

* * *

It seems not to have occurred to the imperialists that the United States is not now in a position to make the firm stand against Great Britain that it made under President Cleveland. The United States now has colonies, which are especially exposed to attack by a strong sea power. The Government has staked its sacred honor upon the acquisition of the far-distant Philippines. It has already expended upon them much blood and vast treasure. What could the Government do if in case of refusal to accede to her demands in the Alaskan boundary dispute, Great Britain should send a powerful fleet to the Philippines? What could the Government do against the sea power of Great Britain in that far-off quarter; or for that matter, against the fleet Great Britain could send to Porto Rico or Cuba? The United States is vastly more vulnerable now than it was before it acquired its colonies. A colonial power must needs have a strong navy; but in point of sea power the United States makes no comparison with Great Britain, and on the sea would be simply at the latter's mercy.

* * *

Is it at all strange then that Great Britain, knowing all this well, takes a firmer stand than was expected in the boundary line dispute, and seems ready to let this country choose peace or war on her terms? The fatuous policy of imperialism is even now ready to bear a harvest of bitter fruit for the American people.
