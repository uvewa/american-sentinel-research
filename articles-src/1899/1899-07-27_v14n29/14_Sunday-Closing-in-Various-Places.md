## Sunday Closing in Various Places.

[From the Union Signal we quote the following items of Sunday-closing news in several States.]

Gloucester City, near Philadelphia, is strictly enforcing the Sunday-closing law.

The city marshal of Nashua, N. H., is making a determined effort to close saloons on Sunday. He has had four saloon men arrested and fined $100 and $10 costs each.

Sunday closing is being enforced at Spring Valley, Ill., by Mayor Baxter, whose election was antagonized by the united saloon interest.

Director of Police Barrett, of Cleveland, Ohio, declares he is determined to close the saloons of that city Sundays and at midnight. He says if the present policemen fail to obey orders, he will get others that will.
