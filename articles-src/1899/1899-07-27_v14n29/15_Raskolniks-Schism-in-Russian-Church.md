The memorable dispute in the "Christian Church" of early times, over the orthodoxy of "homoousian" or "homoiousian," is recalled by reading the following press dispatch from the Russian capital, describing the cause of an alarming schism in the Russian State Church:—

"A religious sect known as the Raskolniks, which for years has been growing in various parts of Russia, is causing a great schism in the orthodox church, and has appealed to the Greek ecumenical patriarch at Constantinople for recognition denied it by the head of the Russian Church.

"These Raskolniks number 25,000,000. The whole dissension is due to a difference of opinion as to how the sign of the cross should be made.

"In the orthodox Russian Church the bishops and priests make the sign of the cross with the thumb, index finger and middle finger united. The Raskolniks persist in making it with the thumb bent toward the little finger, while the index and middle fingers, closely united, are extended toward heaven.

"In addition to this difference, which is considered to be most vital in the saving of men's souls, another point at issue concerns infant baptism. In the procession around the baptismal font, the orthodox priests pass to the left, while the Raskolniks insist on marching around to the right.

"The Raskolniks have appointed a deputation to wait upon the high patriarch of the Greek Church at Constantinople and demand that the Holy Synod recognize the authority of their clergy, and thus give them standing.

"It has been the custom of the Greek Church not to interfere with the schisms in the Russian Church, but leave them to settlement by the Russians themselves. So unless the rule is changed, the Raskolniks may find themselves excommunicated."

The less the point in dispute amounts to in itself, and the less the disputants know about it one way or the other, the more violent the dispute becomes, and the more serious are its consequences. This has always been true of disputes between factions in the church. The real point at issue, however, is not one of truth or error, but the question of which faction shall gain the supremacy. And this can never be a cause of strife between true Christians.
