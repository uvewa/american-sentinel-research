## The Sovereign Remedy for Human Ills.

From Sermon by Dr. Chas. A. Blanchard, President of Wheaton College.

That we live in an age of confusion and unrest requires neither statement nor proof. In social, political, religious life the winds are out, and all thoughtful men are asking: "What is to come next?" Meanwhile a thousand voices proclaim panaceas for all ills. More government or less, more relaxation or relaxation of a different kind, changes in doctrinal statements, abolition of such statements, or a return to former statements of doctrine, social settlements, laws prohibiting tramping, employment of labor seekers at public expense, single tax, Christian science or government ownership of monopolies, each thinker has his "sure cure," but others will not adopt it, and so we whirl along to the end which God alone foresees.

In the midst of this babel one voice low and solemn speaks ever the same marvelous word. In varying phrase with no variation in requirement, now as in the morning of creation, here as on Sinai or Mount Zion, God lays claim to the heart of man. This is his sovereign remedy for all ills, personal, social, and political. He says to each man: "Son, give me thy heart." When this is done health will improve, times will be better, remorse will end, fear will pass away, anxiety will disappear. And until this is done there can be no real cure of ill. The festering sore of human misery will continue until it destroys men or drives them to do this simple yet wonderful thing—give their hearts to Jesus.

That this harmony is to come by voluntary surrender is evident. There can be no enforced agreement. Unity may be pretended, but cannot exist until of two warring wills one chooses the other. That God should give way to man is impossible. He wills love and hope and justice, and to surrender these would constitute an abdication of his throne. It is strange that so frequently men wish to give God everything else but this which he desires. Bodily suffering, large sums of money, rites and ceremonies, all are freely bestowed at infinite cost in order to have peace with God, but the heart is withheld. Filled with pride, vanity, ambition, jealousy, envy and ill will, conscious of alienation in spirit from the loving and faithful God, the poor storm-tossed sinner seeks rest and finds none. It is waiting for him. God wills that he have it. He longs for it, would like to buy it, but can secure it only by giving God his heart, and this he will not do.

When once this blessed step is taken it is not difficult to do all else. A man may easily lavish diamonds upon a wife to whom he is a traitor. But he cannot keep back from a wife whom he loves the things she needs when he has power to bestow them. A man or woman may give money or time to missions or charities from supremely selfish motives, but one whose heart is given to God cannot fail to be interested in the work for which Jesus Christ laid down his life. Where our hearts are there will easily and naturally go our treasure also.

This text suggests two thoughts which should be helpful to us, and first, are our hearts given up to God? Has he a first place in our love? If not, all that we have done or may do cannot please Him. We may be members of the church, but we are doomed to hell if we do not love God. We may be self-righteous and popular with men, but God cannot abide us unless we love Him. Many church members act with God as a son of a millionaire, selfish and thankless, might do who should try to buy his father's approbation for a cent. Are we ourselves happy in Jesus, and do we desire to benefit our fellows? We can only accomplish this by leading them to give their hearts to God? We may give them health, money, friends, praise, but if their hearts are alien from God they must be restless and dissatisfied in this world and hopeless and miserable in the world to come.
