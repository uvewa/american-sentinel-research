## Pointed Press Paragraphs.

It is becoming fairly evident that none of the nations are willing to begin disarming until all the others have finished.—Detroit News.

PERHAPS it is just as well that we did not undertake to whip the Filipinos first and Spain afterward.—The Ledger, Philadelphia.

THOUGH there may be a gentle art of making enemies, a gentle art of making war is yet to be discovered, and there is something incongruous in the idea.—Chicago Times-Herald.

VERY solemnly and seriously the peace delegates at The Hague are deciding what may and what may not be done in time of war.

It is interesting to see the nations of the world thus repeating on a great scale for national fighting the arduous labors performed by the Marquis of Queensberry in behalf of prize fighting.

The marquis says, "You must not hit below the belt."

The nations say, "You must not use dum dum bullets."

The marquis says, "You must not strike in a clinch."

The nations say in their latest announcement: "You must not drop explosives from a balloon."

This is all very well, but the marquis knows and the men at The Hague know, that when rough and tumble fighting comes on, all these beautiful rules are forgotten and men destroy each other as best they can.—N. Y. Journal.

GOVERNOR ROOSEVELT's idea [and the idea of many others as well] that it is outrageous and even treasonable to criticise the Administration's policy or no policy in the Philippines would not pass muster in England. He is more imperialistic than the imperials.

The London Spectator, though favoring a firm and, if need be, a forcible policy toward President Kruger, says:—

"By all means let those who think we have no right to interfere in the Transvaal speak out, and let them denounce what they believe to be an oppressive and unjustifiable policy. We trust the day will never come when Englishmen will be afraid of proclaiming that their country is in the wrong when they honestly think her to be so."

It is a century too late to fetter the press or muzzle the speech of Anglo Saxons.—N. Y. World.

The necessity for a greater number of troops with which to prosecute the campaign of killing natives in order to convince them of their need of assistance in the formation of a government, is known to be urgent, but the President hesitates against issuing a call for volunteers for fear the response may be chilly. Apathy has seized upon the majority of the people, and, aside from an earnest wish for the health of the boys unfortunate enough to have been drawn to the scene of the struggle, the only general interest centers in having these same boys speedily returned to their homes.

Disguise it as one may, this is the situation as it exists at the present time, and surely the champions of an expanding sovereignty will not dare to attribute it to lack of courage.

Rather let them admit the truth at once, the truth which, sooner or later, must become patent to all—that their humanitarianism is not of a kind to incite the voluntary risking of precious lives; . . . and that that war is certainly unrighteous which has for its object the governing of a people, strangers to us, by claim of purchase, and without their consent.—St. Paul Globe.
