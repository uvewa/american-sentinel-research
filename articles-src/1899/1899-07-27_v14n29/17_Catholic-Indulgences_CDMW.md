## Catholic "Indulgences."

Editor American Sentinel: A Catholic family has just moved into the house with us and they have a framed image of the Virgin Mary. On the back of the frame is pasted a piece of paper on which is printed the following:—

"SHRINE TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

"This shrine has been issued to commemorate one of the most touching and beautiful incidents of that most fearful and disastrous flood which swept Johnstown from amongst the cities of the country. The small but beautiful image of this Shrine is a copy of the famous, we may almost say miraculous, statue, which adorned one of the Johnstown churches, and which, amid the crashing of walls and towers of the sacred edifice and the angry roar of the devouring waters, alone remained uninjured, as though she, the Immaculate mother of God and Star of the Sea, was unwilling to leave her children in the fearful hour of their peril. The prayer attached to the Shrine was composed by the great St. Bernard, and those who recite it devoutly receive three hundred days' indulgence. There can be no more welcome faces in our homes than those of Jesus and His Blessed Mother, and this Her Image will serve to remind us that, in the midst of the mortal perils of our lives, Mary never deserts Her faithful children. If we wish to honor her and secure her protection in life and death, if we desire to instil the love of her into the hearts of our children, let us raise an altar to her in our dwellings, where we can kneel and implore her protection. To the sick and suffering the sight of this Image of Mary will bring patience; to the dying, hope."

In front of this image there was placed a card written as follows:—

"PETITION TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

"Remember, Mary, tenderest-hearted Virgin, how from of old the ear hath never heard that he who ran to thee for refuge, implored thy help, and sought thy prayers, was forsaken of God. Virgin of virgins, Mother, emboldened by this confidence I fly to thee; to thee I come, and in thy presence, I a weeping sinner stand.

"Mother of the Word Incarnate, O cast not away my prayer [Here mention your request] but in thy pity hear and answer. Amen.

"[Indulgence 300 days.]"

I send you these thinking that it might be pleasant and perhaps profitable for your readers to see for themselves and know what an indulgence is and how they are used now. How much has Rome changed since the days of Luther?
