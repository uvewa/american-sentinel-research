## Aim of the National Reform Movement.

WHAT the SENTINEL has so long kept before the American people as a source of great danger to their liberties, a movement threatening both the state and the church, is defined anew in the September issue of the Christian Statesmen, the organ of the National Reform Association. And that many of our readers who have not before had the opportunity, may see what this movement is, upon the authority of those who are conducting it, we reprint what the Statesman has to say of it:

"The aim of the National Reform movement is to bring the Constitution of the United States into harmony with the requirements of the divine law.

"The necessity for such a movement arises from the fact that in that document there is no recognition of Almighty God, the source of all authority, the Lord Jesus Christ, the governor among the nations, or the Bible, the supreme standard in civil affairs. There is nothing so distinctively Christian in it as to prevent it being adopted by any nation, Mohammedan or heathen, as its constitution of government.

"This seems strange when we remember that this nation in its origin was Christian. By the colonies God, Christ and the divine law were again and again acknowledged. The legislation was based upon the principles of Christianity. During the Revolutionary war fast and thanksgiving days were frequently appointed; the interposition of God on our behalf was again and again sought and proclamations acknowledging our indebtedness to him for victories issued. Not until our independence was secured and we were ready to enter upon our career as a nation was he forgotten, to whom we had so often acknowledged ourselves indebted for our success.

"Whatever may have been the reason for this, whether it was a mere oversight, or because of a foolish fear of complications, such as, in the Old World, are the result of the union of church and state, or because of the spirit of infidelity then so prevalent, it was most unfortunate. To-day we are reaping the consequences. The Christian features of our institutions are one by one being eliminated. The 'liberal' element in our country is becoming very aggressive. Each success makes it the bolder and more determined in its demands. Unless a change is effected soon in the organic law of the land, we will become ere long, as a nation what the Constitution is—Godless.

"Thoughtful people are beginning to see this. They are being made to understand that there is a cause for the increasing political corruption, local, state, and national; the character of the legislation; the growth of heartless monopolies; the desecration of our Sabbath; the spirit of unrest and lawlessness everywhere prevalent and that there can be no remedy for the evils so long as the cause exists. The conviction is deepening and becoming more general, that the godless character of the national Constitution is the cause, and that the remedy, the only remedy, is the effecting such a change in it as will bring it into harmony with the law of God and the early history of the nation.

"In a movement of this kind, there will be, necessarily, persons of different, and it may be, opposite views on subjects of importance. There will be members of different churches, different parties, advocates of different reforms. This fact ought to be recognized. It must be recognized in order to obtain success. The movement should not be allowed to become so identified with any body of Christians, with any political party, or to be so obscured by prominence given to any other reform, however good it may be, as to cause it to occupy a subordinate place. The one object, the only object, should be to unite all who are heartily in favor of it, regardless of their opinions on other subjects, in an earnest effort to secure its accomplishment. Now is the time for such an effort to be made.
