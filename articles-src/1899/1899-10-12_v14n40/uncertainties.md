## OCR Corrections Noted

### Page 1, Front-Page Maxims
- OCR read "SELF-EDINAL" — corrected to "SELF-DENIAL" based on context (the contrast drawn is between self-denial and self-supremacy). Confidence: HIGH.
- OCR read "SELF-SUPPERMACY" — corrected to "SELF-SUPREMACY" based on context. Confidence: HIGH.
- OCR read "HEART RIGHTEOUSSNESS" — corrected to "HEART RIGHTEOUSNESS" (OCR double-s artifact). Confidence: HIGH.
- OCR read "knowledgedoes" (no space) — corrected to "knowledge does". Confidence: HIGH.

### Page 2, "The Natural Enemy of Free Government"
- Article begins mid-sentence on page 1 ("This is made very plain in the following which re-") and continues on page 2 ("cently appeared, editorially..."). Joined as continuous text. Confidence: HIGH.

### Page 8 (last page), Editorial Notes
- OCR read "hANSAS CITY, MO" at page 14 — clearly "KANSAS CITY, MO" (OCR misread capital K). This appears in an advertisement, not transcribed.

### Author "G. W. Anglebarger" (Article 06)
- Not in known authors list. Initials GWA assigned. The dateline "September 29" is a date, not a location/author; the author signature "G. W. ANGLEBARGER" appears on the line after the date. Confidence: HIGH.

### Author "Mrs. O'D. Fletcher" (Article 14)
- Not in known authors list. Initials MODF assigned. Signature appears at end of article. Confidence: HIGH.

### Author "H. F. Phelps" (Article 10 and 18)
- Not in known authors list. Initials HFP assigned. Byline "BY H. F. PHELPS." at top of article 10; signature "H. F. PHELPS." at end of article 18. "St. Paul, Minn." at end of article 10 is a dateline, not authorship. Confidence: HIGH.

### "Austria Against the Jew" (Article 20)
- Source attribution "N. Y. 'Christian Advocate'" appears before the article as a source label, then the article continues into page 12 without a closing attribution line. Treated as reprint from N. Y. Christian Advocate. The editorial comment at the end ("But it is the politicians...") is the Sentinel's own editorial voice appended to the reprinted material, consistent with the Sentinel's editorial practice. Confidence: MEDIUM — the boundary between reprinted text and editorial comment is not entirely clear.

### "Gold and the Conflicts of the World" (Article 16)
- Source "Saturday Evening Post" appears as a subheading before the article. Closing line "—*Saturday Evening Post.*" added to match reprint convention visible in the OCR (the source appears both as subtitle and at end). Confidence: HIGH.

### Page 15 advertisements
- Pages 14-15 contain advertisements for books (The Rights of the People, Two Republics, Baptist Principles of Religious Liberty, etc.), Signs of the Times World's Harvest Number, The Christian Sabbath tract, Greek-English Lexicon, Two Important Sabbath Tracts. These are advertisements and subscription boilerplate — not transcribed as articles.

### Subscription/Masthead boilerplate (pages 13-14)
- "TO OUR PATRONS" section and "AMERICAN SENTINEL" publication info with subscription rates are boilerplate, not transcribed as articles.
