## Sunday Observance Mass Meeting in Duluth.

At a mass meeting in Duluth, Minn., for the promotion of Sunday observance, referred to in last week's issue, the following resolutions were passed:—

"WHEREAS, it is evident that long hours and Sunday labor do more to demoralize the masses than all other causes; long hours of labor will make the poor poorer, and less intelligent, and the rich richer, a condition not desirable by a liberty-loving people, and,

"WHEREAS, low wages are the natural outcome of low conditions, and the logical remedy is the elevation of the wage-worker, and,

"WHEREAS, it is the object of trade and labor organizations to decrease the hours of labor and prohibit as far as possible Sunday labor, to increase the wages and the hours for mental and moral advancement through which the wage-worker elevates his condition into intelligent citizenship; and when any people disregard that law of God, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,' they degenerate and are severely punished, therefore be it

"Resolved, That all those interested in the above abolition of Sunday labor pledge their moral and financial support to organized labor in all its attempts to right the cause of Sunday labor and kindred evils."

These resolutions were drawn up by a committee of the "trades assembly," whose president, in a speech at this mass-meeting, declared that "the only solution of the problem is to have laws passed prohibiting Sunday labor and making it a crime punishable by fine or imprisonment." This is the view that has long been advocated by the church party with whom the labor unions were on this occasion allied.

It would appear from these resolutions that the participants in this meeting had really worked themselves up into the belief that Sunday labor is more demoralizing upon the working classes than the traffic in strong drink. This only shows the length to which a person is carried away from the line of obvious truth, when he falls under the spell of the delusion that Sunday observance ought to be taken up by political bodies and forced upon people by the law of the land.

This alliance of ecclesiastical and labor organizations for the furtherance of this delusion will bear careful watching.
