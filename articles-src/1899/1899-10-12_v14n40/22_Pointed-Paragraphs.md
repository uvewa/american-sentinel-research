## Pointed Paragraphs.

If we try to shoot God into the Filipinos it is only a question of time until the issue will be transferred here, and we will be shooting our particular creeds into one another for the glory of the Lord.—W. J. Bryan.

War is not America's greatest triumph. It is the civic purpose. In Washington we saw that purpose superbly embodied, brought it war or brought it peace—the resolve to live our national life as best beseemed us, to do the best for the human kind and give a model of elevation and devotion to the world ridden by outworn oligarchies and narrowed in human opportunities. That purpose is our inheritance.—*The Criterion.*

INDEPENDENCE granted the Transvaal and independence granted the Philippines would greatly increase the respect of the world for the United States and Great Britain. These two nations can not be leaders in the highest civilization if they are to be controlled by greedy schemers and sham patriots who are so lacking in moral sense that they are altogether unmindful of the demands of simple justice.—*St. Louis Post-Dispatch.*

MANY of the British delegates to the Congregational Council in this country have some strong ideas concerning the destiny of the race they belong to. One of them, Alfred J. Shepard, a member of the London School Board, announced in an address in New York the other evening:—

"God has cast on the Anglo Saxon race the great responsibility of governing the world, and there is no doubt that we shall be able to do it well."

The whole world! That means all Europe,—France, Germany, Russia—as well as Africa, Asia, and the scattered isles of the sea. It may be said that Mr. Shepard spoke with oratorical license, but that is not so. One of the most interesting facts of the time is the honest belief which has grown up among Englishmen that their race is really destined to rule the world. Imagine for a moment what must happen before that end can be achieved. The iron and steel market ought to boom for a thousand years on the warship demand and the requirements of military armament.—*Springfield Republican.*

DANIEL WEBSTER, for Congress, sent a message of sympathy to the struggling Greek. We sent messages to struggling Cuba, but we are now debarred from sending messages of sympathy to people struggling for freedom. Suppose we sent our sympathy to the Boers? In an hour England would send back, "What about the Filipinos?"—W. J. Bryan.

The real object of England, whether accomplished now or later, is to secure absolute control over all South Africa, and just as soon as the war begins this will be argued for by those in favor of the war, who will claim that half measures will only prolong unrest and produce more disturbances. Already Sir Walter Peace, Agent General in London for Natal, is talking for that kind of war, declaring that the war to accomplish this would not last more than two months; that to make pacification effective Great Britain must assume absolute control over the whole of South Africa. He rejoices that the Orange Free State has taken a hostile attitude, for that means her addition to British possessions; the Free State would always have been a disturbing factor in the quiet of South Africa.

The same sort of logic is always resorted to when a great nation wishes to engorge a small one. If one reads old Roman history and changes the dates and names, he will read in substance the history of every great conquering nation that has risen, grown rich, luxurious, arrogant, and been broken up or disintegrated.—*N. Y. Christian Advocate.*
