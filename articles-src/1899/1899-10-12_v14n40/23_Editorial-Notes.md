A few copies of No. 38 of this volume were inadvertently mailed in the place of No. 39. Anyone affected by this mistake will please notify us at once, that it may be rectified.

If you want to know how to make a splendid investment of ten cents, or of ten times ten cents, read what we have to say of the forthcoming World's Harvest number of the "Signs of the Times," p. 639.

Whatever you may skip in this paper, do not fail to read what it says on the subject "The Messages, the Messengers, and the People," p. 626. Read it carefully, and especially paragraph five; for the last part of that paragraph surely fits some readers of this paper who are not aware of the fact.

In this issue we give the second of the thoughtful articles by Mr. Jonathan Dymond, showing the incompatibility of war with the precepts of Christianity. But does not Christianity sanction war when it is in self-defense? perhaps you ask. This question will be considered in the third and fourth articles, which will conclude the series.

The bigger tyrant a man is, the fewer people does he see in the world who ought to be allowed self government. And the biggest tyrant of all is only the man who thinks his own ideas of propriety and right ought to be the standard and the law for all others.

POLYGAMY is a bad thing, whether it be simultaneous polygamy, as sanctioned by Mormon custom, or consecutive polygamy, as sanctioned by the marriage and divorce laws of the States, or secret polygamy, which lurks everywhere beneath the cloak of respectability. And we are not sure that the Mormon form of polygamy is the worst one.

A great petition containing many names of prominent men has been prepared, asking the President to offer the services of the United States to Great Britain as a mediator in the Transvaal dispute, in accordance with the rules of international right agreed on at the Peace Conference. But this is just what the United States is now estopped from doing, by having itself adopted England's policy. To silence this Government on such a matter England would have only to point to the Philippines.

The more militarism there is in the nation, the less freedom will there be, since military government is in its very nature despotic. And the less freedom there is in the nation, the less manhood will there be; for despotism always crushes out the manly qualities in those who submit to it. And the less manhood in the nation, the less power will it have, for national virility is inseparable from manhood in its citizens. So that by cultivating militarism with the idea of making itself powerful, a nation really makes itself weak. This may seem paradoxical, but it is a statement approved by experience.

It was predicted that the disciplined troops of Spain in Cuba would prove superior to the "raw" American volunteers who went against them; but just the opposite proved to be true. The volunteers were better men, because they had grown up under a freer government. And all history testifies that the breath of civil and religious freedom does more to create power in a nation than the discipline which reduces men to mere machines. That nation is strongest which can depend on its citizens rather than on its soldiers.

The United States has nothing to gain, but much to lose, from a development upon military lines.

It has long been evident that the "trust" business is getting overdone, but we were hardly prepared to hear the announcement of a "murder trust." Yet it appears from the London Times that the discovery has been made in Montevideo, South America, of a syndicate which has been insuring the lives of poor people and then murdering them to collect the insurance money. From three such cases that are known to have occurred the "trust" netted the sum of $50,000. Among the companies affected by its operations is said to be a prominent life insurance company in New York City. As yet, however, public sentiment does not sanction this stage of trust development, and the ringleaders of the Montevideo concern have been arrested.

The following "Filipino Fable" of recent origin, is credited to Judge Charles G. Garrison, of New Jersey:—

"A boy who had a brindle dog on a string was so tired that the dog was on the point of achieving independence, when a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals accosted the boy and chided him for not giving the dog his freedom, and finally bought the string for the sum of 25 cents. The last the boy saw of the kind-hearted stranger he was kicking the stuffing out of the dog because it hung back when he pulled on the string."

"EXPANSION" is in harmony with the Declaration of Independence when it is peaceable. Forcible expansion is imperialism.

IDENTIFY yourself with a truth that is eternal, and that truth will identify you through eternity.
