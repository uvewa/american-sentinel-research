# State and Church at the Capitol.

What possible necessity or propriety there could be in grouping Cardinal Gibbons with the President and Admiral Dewey at the public reception to the latter in Washington, we have not seen stated; but it is stated that this is what was done on that occasion. "The grouping of President McKinley, Admiral Dewey, and Cardinal Gibbons, the three highest dignitaries of the State, the Catholic Church, and the navy of the United States, on the stand at the Capitol to-day, made a historical, picturesque, and significant scene," is the statement given in a dispatch dated at Washington, the 3rd inst.

It is made to appear in the dispatch that the cardinal came to the scene reluctantly; that in fact he had "twice declined to accept the invitation, pleading a pressure of business." But Catholic dignitaries are not in the habit of declining an honor offered to the Catholic Church; and in view of this fact the cardinal's alleged reluctance to appear at the reception becomes at least a matter of doubt.

For it was distinctly an honor to the Catholic Church that was tendered by the Government on this occasion. To group together church and state, at a ceremony presided over by the state, is itself an honor to that church which distinctively stands for the principle of church and state union; and especially is this so when the Catholic Church alone is thus represented.

The Catholic Church is losing no opportunity to push forward the claim, insidiously yet effectively, that she is the church of the nation; and this is precisely the meaning that by inference is conveyed by such a grouping of the "three highest dignitaries" as was made on the occasion in question.

Back in 1892, the national Supreme Court declared that "this is a Christian nation," as a conclusion arrived at after considering the force of certain papal documents, customs and laws, and historical acts made under Catholic auspices. The Catholic Church approved this as good Catholic doctrine, and added that this is a "Catholic Christian" nation. That was one big step in the direction of recognition as the national church. Later, this church secured the privilege of erecting a chapel on the military reservation at West Point. Still later, in the war with Spain, she was taken practically into partnership with the Government in the work of managing affairs in the newly-acquired possessions; and now she appears, in the person of Cardinal Gibbons, as of right entitled to stand by the side of the state at a state celebration, as the leading representative of religion.

It is stated in this Washington dispatch that "The cardinal's acceptance of the invitation to take part in the ceremony is being used here to-night as a great political card by the wire-pullers for the President. . . . The Administration politicians are claiming that not only by his presence, but in his remarks to Admiral Dewey and in the benediction, Cardinal Gibbons indorsed President McKinley's whole course in the war with Spain."

Whether this "great political card" was traded off by the cardinal in exchange for the prestige that would be given his church by grouping him, as the representative of religion, with the President and the admiral, in "a historical, picturesque, and significant scene," we can not say; but certain it is that this trading of influence and power is a cardinal feature of papal policy in advancing the interests of the church; and certain also it is that the interests of that church were materially advanced by the honor accorded the cardinal on this historic occasion. The papacy can be absolutely relied on never to forget a precedent in its favor.
