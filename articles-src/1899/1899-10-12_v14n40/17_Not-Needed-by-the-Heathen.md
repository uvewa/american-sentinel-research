## Not Needed by the Heathen.

The New York Press, of October 3, has this to say of American civilization as exemplified in the city government of Philadelphia, in which city there have been within a recent period 10,000 deaths from typhoid fever:

"Only last week the Councils graciously permitted the people to vote on the $12,000,000 loan necessary for the rehabilitation of the water supply. Repeatedly has it been charged by responsible citizens in mass meetings and in public print that the plant was allowed to run down in order that the public, grown desperate, would permit the turning over of the water system to a syndicate which stood ready to supply an unpoisoned fluid—at a price. The charge seems to be borne out by the fact that appropriations have been totally withheld for the last three years. It was this policy which made 6,000 typhoid cases and 677 deaths in Philadelphia from January 1 to May 10 of this year. This is a death rate of seventy a thousand in this disease, when the total for the city, naturally one of the most healthful in the world, is below twenty. For calculating cruelty in the pursuit of gain the American local politician has nothing to learn from the Spanish Governor General."

The heathen may well be excused for fighting to keep away from their shores this kind of civilization.

There is published a rough translation of a letter recently written by the Empress Dowager, of China, to the Emperor of Japan, relating to a proposed alliance of the two countries, which is interesting as revealing the Chinese view of the "Chinese question." The Dowager Empress is not impressed with any deep sense of the piety and benevolence of the "Christian nations" of Europe. She says:

"I am in great difficulties. European Powers are pressing for a portion of the empire. England, France, Germany, and Italy have presented demands, and I do not know what to do to satisfy these greedy dogs. England is the worst of all, for she has not disguised her longings for the Yang-tse-Kiang Valley, and has evidently set on Italy to claim Fuhkien. She has evidently done more; she has attempted to frustrate my relations with Russia. Such indignities are insufferable, and I have therefore addressed myself to my good friend the Emperor of Japan for succor in my distress."
