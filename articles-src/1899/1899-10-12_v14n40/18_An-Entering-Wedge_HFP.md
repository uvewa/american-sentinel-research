## An Entering Wedge.

MINNESOTA, the "North Star State," is preparing to take a hand in persecution for conscience' sake. According to The St. Paul Globe, of September 22, the State Labor Bureau has completed arrangements for an investigation into the Sunday labor problem as directed by the legislature of last winter, and will begin the inquiry at once.

This is an entering wedge, but no doubt it will be driven to its utmost. If the next legislature will only pass another bill providing for investigation of Monday labor, the farce will be complete.

H. F. PHELPS.
