## The Victims of Experiment.

No patient likes to be experimented on by a green practitioner. Least of all would a well person enjoy being told that he is sick, and under this plea forcibly compelled to submit to the fledgling doctor's experiments. Yet in just this position the United States has placed the Filipinos, by its purpose to subjugate the island and make of them an American colony. And the Filipinos comprehend the point, as is evident by this statement given in their behalf by one of their generals, Alejandrino, to the Manila correspondent of the New York Herald:

"Our government is willing to accept a protectorate under the United States. We fought Spain because we did not wish longer to be a colony. A colonial government under American rule would be worse than the Spanish, because you know nothing about the way to govern colonies. We do not want to be experimented on for a century while you learn how. With England it would be another matter.

"You are another race and are not in sympathy with us. We know how to rule our own people. We do not understand why your powerful nation wants to crush us like insects. You can conquer us because you are rich, and our soldiers can not fight successfully against yours.

"We want an honorable peace, but we will fight until death for our institutions."
