## They Are Mixed.

Some time ago it was my privilege to attend a ministers' meeting in Canon City, Colo. The Baptist, Methodist, Christian, Presbyterian, Cumberland Presbyterian, and Free Methodist churches were represented. The paper read that day was entitled, "The Proper Observance of the Christian Sabbath." After the reading of the paper, all of the ministers present were invited to discuss its contents. After several had spoken, one said, "Well, the more I hear this question discussed the more I am in a dilemma. In the first place the paper does not cite one single text of Scripture for the proper observance of the Christian Sabbath, but every text quoted by the brother in his paper has direct reference to the Jewish Sabbath. Now I would like to know why he did this." Another minister answered at once, "Because there are none;" and then there arose a discussion about the best name for the Christian Sabbath. One said, "The Bible don't call it the Sabbath." Another said, "Sunday don't sound just right," or words to that effect. So it was generally agreed that "The Lord's day" would be the best name.
