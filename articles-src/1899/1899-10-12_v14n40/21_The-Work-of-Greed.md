## The Work of Greed.

[From "The Harvest of Greed," by John Clark Ridpath, LL.D., in the World's Harvest Number of the "Signs of the Times."]

GREED fills the granaries of the world with the threshed-out hopes and virtues of mankind. Greed has hedged the way of aspiration and made the sincere truth of life read like a lie. In the lexicon of gain, truth and falsehood are the same word. In the Decalogue of Greed, the word not is nine times omitted, and in the fifth commandment the not is inserted! In the New Testament of Greed, the place of the Sermon on the Mount is marked only with a foot note, which reads: "Omitted for business reasons." By Greed, the Declaration of Independence and the Rights of Man have been placed on the Index Expurgatorious; and by Greed the Farewell Address and the Emancipation Proclamation are declared taboo.

By Greed the free, outdoor, industrious life of the American people has been converted into a life of turmoil, beginning in competition and ending in fraud and faro. By Greed the great Palaces of the Avenue have been substituted for the humble homes of the people, and by Greed the doors and windows of the palaces have been nailed up while the occupants have gone off yachting to Norway and Venice. Within a single square mile of the City Hall, more than three hundred thousand human bodies are left to swelter and three hundred thousand souls are left to starve through all the burning months of summer, while the cool sea washes but a few furlongs away, and the hills of Westchester are green and the sky bends blue over the Tappan Zee and the Catskills.
