## In the Heart.

When the law of God is outside of a man it can do nothing but condemn him; and he will see it as an accuser. But when a man consents to have that law written in his heart, its condemnation ceases, and it becomes part of his own life. When the law was written on tables of stone Israel feared, but they did not obey. Now, under the new covenant, God proposes writing that holy law where it will prove effective—on the "fleshy tables of the heart." Heb. 8:10. If you are opposing God's law, ask him to write it upon your heart, and your opposition will all cease.—*Bible Echo.*
