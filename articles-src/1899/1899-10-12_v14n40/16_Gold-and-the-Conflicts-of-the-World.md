## Gold and the Conflicts of the World.

*Saturday Evening Post.*

It has been estimated, by one who makes a business of combining the facts and figures of history, that every gold dollar in the world costs over three dollars. Within five hundred years the gold production of the earth has been over eight billions of dollars, so that the wealth which has been spent to find and to mine the gold of to-day exceeds twenty billions of dollars—a sum which goes almost beyond human conception.

This calculation takes into account some of the cost of wars which were fought for gold. It seems to be the experience of history that as soon as a goldfield is discovered there must be an international complication, possibly leading to human slaughter. Methods have improved with civilization, but the old compelling cause remains. There was no trouble in Venezuela until gold was found. Alaska was as peaceable as a frozen sea until gold was announced.

There would be, probably, no wars nor rumors of wars in South Africa to-day were it not for the existence of the gold and diamond mines, and the billion-dollar British mining-ring, which must have its profits. The South African republic is about the same size as Arizona territory, and is much less than half as large as Texas, and yet from its mines this year $130,000,000 of gold is being taken. It may go up to $200,000,000 next year, if peace prevails. Transvaal mines paid to English stockholders the following dividends: 1896, $7,450,000; 1897, $13,500,000; 1898, $24,450,000. One mine paid 675 per cent. on the capital invested.

If one keeps this thought in mind he will have the beginning and the cause of the intensely interesting conflict in South Africa.—*Saturday Evening Post.*
