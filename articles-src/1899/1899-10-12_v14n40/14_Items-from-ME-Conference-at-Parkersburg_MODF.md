## Items from the M. E. Conference at Parkersburgh, W. Va.

This conference, attended by 510 M. E. clergymen, closed its annual session at Parkersburgh, W. Va., October 3.

A noteworthy statement made by one of the speakers was:—

"The M. E. Church has always been recognized as one of the bulwarks of our Government in time of peace and also in war."

In the resolutions that were passed was the following relating to expansion:—

"We believe that when peace succeeds this rebellion, our banner in the Philippines will be the symbol of commercial prosperity, educational culture, social elevation, freedom of conscience and absolute liberty in the methods of divine worship."

In a lecture by Mrs. Clara Roach, of Washington, D. C., secretary of the Woman's Home Missionary Society, many good things were said about deaconess' work at home, the curse of the liquor traffic, etc., and last but not least, there was an eloquent appeal made by her to the conference to form and pass a resolution against seating in the senate of the nation the bold and daring polygamist, Brigham H. Roberts, of Utah. She also said there were already twenty-eight heathen temples in America; and that in ten years over 82,000 foreigners passed through Castle Garden on to our shores. Is it anything to us that heathen are coming to us to-day? Have we nothing to do at home nor abroad? We as a missionary people should be upon our faces in the dust pleading with God for power from on high.

The Sunday law in West Virginia is as yet a dead letter; only in one or two places inland has the spirit of bigotry or persecution been shown.

MRS. O'D. FLETCHER.
