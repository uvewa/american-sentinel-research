## Austria Against the Jew.

*N. Y. "Christian Advocate."*

THE anti-Jewish party raised the false flag of Christian socialism for political purposes, and got an immense majority in the Vienna Town Council and the Provincial Diet of Lower Austria; but they did nothing for the working classes, the destruction of the prerogatives of the nobility, the loosening of the burdens of militarism, nor for the removal of distress among the poor; they said nothing about the liberty of the press or the right of association. All they wanted to do was to drive the Jews out, and if they could not do that, to deprive them of the rights of citizenship. They proposed to drive them from public places, and from the numerous chairs they have in the universities. Of the million and a half of the people in Vienna one hundred and twenty thousand are Jews, not one in ten. But of the four thousand physicians half are Jews, and of the one thousand lawyers about six hundred and fifty; and the majority of the medical professors, that place Vienna in medical science at the head of the cities of the world, are Jews; while the greater part of the daily newspapers, and the bulk of the trade, wholesale and retail, are controlled by Jews.

The fight will still be long. These anti-Jews are playing, of course, into the hands of the Roman Catholics. It is affirmed that nearly all the celebrated professors from Germany are abandoning their chairs at Austrian universities, while most of the German professors who have had chairs offered them in Austria have refused them. These enormities, it is believed, will bring about a tremendous collapse in a short time.

A Brooklyn clergyman, Dr. A. J. Lyman, has defined the occasion upon which war is just and right. We quote his words:—

"The sentiment of American Christianity forbids all wars except for two purposes—to define freedom or procure it. To create for mere political reasons an American dependency in the Pacific would be a deplorable misuse of American cannon. But to meet the emergencies which the Spanish created, and to establish law and order in these islands, to introduce civilization that these people may be forever free, and able ultimately to govern themselves—this sentiment, which from the standpoint of the politician may seem an utopian dream, is from the standpoint of Christian patriotism the only practical excuse for prosecuting a war in the Philippine Islands."

But it is the politicians and not the "Christian patriots" who are prosecuting the war; and they are doing it not with the expectation of realizing an utopian dream of Philippine civilization, but of securing material commercial advantages in the islands and upon the mainland of Asia.—*N. Y. "Christian Advocate."*
