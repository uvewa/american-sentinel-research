"A Funny Country."

SO THINKS AN ITALIAN WHO CAME TO AMERICA BECAUSE IT WAS THE "LAND OF THE FREE," AND NOW HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR THE CRIME OF CHOPPING WOOD ON SUNDAY.

New York "Press," January 9.

Frank Vindot was arrested for unloading a wagon load of wood in front of his house in North Fourth Ave., Mount Vernon, yesterday, and then attempting to chop the wood. Chief of Police Foley was passing the house when he caught Vindot chopping a limb of a tree.

"See here," said the chief, "don't you know it is Sunday?" You must not be chopping wood out here on the Sabbath."

"This is a free country," Vindot answered. "There ain't no law against my chopping wood, is there?"

"We will see about the law," said the chief. He called patrolman Thistleton and ordered the arrest of Vindot on a charge of violating the Sunday law.

"This is a funny country, and I am going back to Italy to live," was all the prisoner had to say.
