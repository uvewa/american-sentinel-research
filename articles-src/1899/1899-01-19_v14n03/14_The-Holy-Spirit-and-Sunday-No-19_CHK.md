## The Holy Spirit and Sunday.—No. 19.

BY C. H. KESLAKE.

Christ did not begin his ministry until he was baptized with the Holy Ghost and with power. From that time, throughout his ministry he was under the immediate control of the Holy Spirit, by it accomplishing all his work. This is plainly to be seen in the life of Christ, so that for the Pharisees to reject Christ was to reject the Holy Spirit.

As has been stated, the words and acts of Christ conflicted with those of the religious teachers of his time. An instance is given in Matthew 15: "Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your traditions?" Showing how they had done this, he continued, "Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition." And again, "In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." Verses 1–9.

Thus far we can see clearly that whatever the Pharisees taught, it made of none effect the commandments of God; nor could it be otherwise, for against God's commandments they put the commandments of men.

What the net result of their work was is expressed by Christ in the following terrible denunciation, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity." Matt. 23:27, 28. And all this shows that the teachings of the Pharisees in making void the commandments of God could have no other effect than to make one appear outwardly religious, while inwardly they were full of iniquity. It is plain, therefore, that they taught neither the law nor the gospel.

Christ's preaching being directly opposite to that of the Pharisees, it must therefore have had an exactly opposite effect—it upheld the law of God, teaching the people, not only that the law should be kept, but also how they should keep it. And as Christ preached under the direct control of the Holy Spirit, it follows that when the gospel is faithfully preached, through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, it will lead sinners to reverence God's law and to keep it. And unlike the teachings of the Pharisees, it will make so complete a change in the believer that it will cleanse him within and without.

But it was Christ's attitude in regard to the Sabbath that particularly aroused the opposition of the Pharisees, and because of it they began to persecute him and to plan to kill him.

It is well to bear in mind that Christ was "Lord of the Sabbath day." Mark 2:28. He it was who made the Sabbath in the first place. Compare John 1:1–3; Mark 2:27. That being so he knew exactly what Sabbath-keeping was, and therefore nothing that he could do on the Sabbath day could by any means be a violation of the Sabbath.

And beyond all this, "God was in Christ," "manifested in the flesh;" and therefore every act of Christ on the Sabbath day was a manifestation of God's idea of Sabbath-keeping.

Christ's preaching of the gospel was accompanied by the working of "miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst" of the people. Acts 2:22. And the most of the miracles recorded were wrought on the Sabbath day. This led the Pharisees to charge Christ with breaking the Sabbath and to deny that he was the Messiah. Thus the Pharisees said, "This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath day." John 9:16.

From this scripture and others it can be seen that the Sabbath had become the test as to whether Jesus was or was not the Messiah.
