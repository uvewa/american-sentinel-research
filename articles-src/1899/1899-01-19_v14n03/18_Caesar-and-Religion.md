# Cæsar and Religion.

"Southern Sentinel," Melbourne, Australia.

The question of religious instruction in the State schools has again been brought before the Victorian Parliament.

In urging its support, Mr. Deakin, M. L. A., advocated a course of instruction such as, he claimed, could be religious without being denominational. "It could be simply Christian." But what would appear simply Christian to him might be deemed rank denominationalism by another. No standard has yet been found by which the "simply Christian" can be defined.

It was admitted that, at best, the provisions proposed would only supply a small proportion of the religious needs of the young, and that the effect of the elementary lessons would be infinitesimal compared with home training. Why then ask Cæsar to pose as a religious teacher with such an infinitesimal result in view. Far better leave to the home and the church a task that promises so little.

But the smallness of the anticipated results is not the greatest objection. In this question there is the danger of the church delegating to the state the very work that God and humanity demand she shall do. This would, in itself, blight her spiritual life, and cripple her power for good. Then there is the still greater danger of the state, with its power, becoming the obsequious mouthpiece of an intolerant ecclesiastical system.

A conscience provision would be made for the Jews, but that does not remove the danger of Cæsar's rude hand interfering with the religious liberty of those who desire to think and act for themselves in matters of religion. Better let Cæsar attend to earthly things, knowing that it is no part of his work to attempt to manufacture Christians.

The darkest page of all the Dark Ages reveals a time when the interests of the church became the business of the state.

The only force which can of right enter the domain of religion, is the force of love.
