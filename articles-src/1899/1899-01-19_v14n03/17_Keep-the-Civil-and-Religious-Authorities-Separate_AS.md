# Keep the Civil and Religious Authorities Separate.

BY A. SMITH.

Although it is true in a limited sense that the devil has usurped the dominion of the earth, yet God, for wise and beneficial purposes, overrules the rise and destinies of nations and peoples.

Babylon, the first universal kingdom of the world, was, by the command of God, given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar (see Jer. 27:1-8); but when that proud king boasted that by his own power he had acquired the great dominion which he exercised, God humbled him until he learned the lesson that "The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will." Dan. 4:25.

Paul says that God has "made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation." Acts 17:26.

When Jesus was arraigned before Pilate, that ruler said to him, "Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above." John 19:10, 11.

The abuse of the civil power given to man constitutes one element of Satan's dominion in the earth. Paul says, "The [civil] powers that be are ordained of God." Rom. 13:1. Of civil rulers he says, "They are God's ministers." Verse 6.

While those who properly fill legitimate civil offices are called "God's ministers," there is another class of men who are called "the ministers of God" (see 2 Cor. 6:4) to whom is committed quite another work, even the ministry of the gospel (good news of salvation), and whose office is to persuade men, not to coerce them. "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." 2 Cor. 5:11.

God ordained the "powers that be" to attend to civil matters, and he will hold civil rulers accountable for the use they make of entrusted power. Also, God appoints men to minister in sacred things, and holds them also accountable for the manner in which they fill their office.

Neither of these classes of ministers have any right to interfere with one another in their legitimate callings.

It is not ordinarily considered honorable to meddle with other men's business.

Saul once undertook to officiate as a priest, and as the result lost his kingdom. See 1 Sam. 13:8-14.

Uzziah, a king of Judah, made a like error and was smitten with leprosy for his temerity. See 2 Chron. 26:16-21.

A most noted example of interference with the civil power by the religious is given in the trial, condemnation, and death of Jesus. The priests, elders, and people who were the orthodox religionists of that day, so clamored for the crucifixion of the Saviour that it overpowered the courage and better judgment of Pilate the governor, and he gave sentence of death upon one whom he declared to be innocent.

The same religious element did their utmost by the civil power to prevent the resurrection of the Son of God. The result was that the Jews lost their nationality, and Pilate is said to have spent the closing years of his life in self-banishment and remorse, and finally to have committed suicide.

Let civil and religious ministers alike be instructed by such warning examples.
