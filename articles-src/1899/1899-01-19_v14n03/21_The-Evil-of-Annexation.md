The Evil of Annexation from a Military Standpoint.

From Speech by Congressman John F. Shafroth.

I TAKE it as a general proposition that the consensus of opinions of statesmen is that solidarity of territory presents the most invulnerable form of possessions. No better demonstration of this can be found than in the present war with Spain. We have made the attack upon Spain, where? Not on her home territory. If this war were waged upon her home territory, it would take ten times the number of men and ten times the amount of money to produce the same result we are now accomplishing.

We have attacked Spain at her weakest points, namely, in her outlying possessions. If we acquire colonies, the first attack upon us will be through them. As long as you have a compact territory no nation will dare invade it, because nothing can be made thereby. There is no way of holding a slice of territory cut from a nation located such as ours. Sooner or later it would be retaken. When nations find that nothing can be gained by war with such a country the idea of conquest vanishes even if they covet our possessions. We should not exchange concentration for diffusion.

We have heard much in this debate of England's greatness. England is great, but not to be compared to the United States. On account of her small home territory, England could not have a large population without colonial possessions, but we have a territory so large in area that it can easily accommodate ten times its present inhabitants without overcrowding. But even British statesmen have doubted the wisdom of that country having colonial possessions. Mr. Gladstone once said:—

"The United States have a national base for the greatest continuous empire ever established by man. . . . The distinction between a continuous empire and one severed and dispersed over the seas is vital."

Even India has been a source of depleting the British treasury, and it is said in England that, more than any other part of the British Empire, India gives their statesmen sleepless nights. Besides, England is continually at war with her provinces in suppressing uprisings and revolts, at the expense of her treasury.

The United States need have no fear of the outcome of a contest with any foreign power. Great Britain is the only dangerous power, and her outlying dominions make her so vulnerable that she dare not attack us. Even if her navy is larger than ours, she realizes that the minute war is declared the armies of the United States would cross the Canadian borders and wrest from her grasp the gem of her colonial possessions. Canada is our hostage and is a sure preventive of war.

When the Hawaiian Islands are annexed, the point of attack by any foreign power will be there, because it is so far from our strength and power. There they can meet us on equal terms, and it will make our wars of the future contests upon the high seas instead of upon the land, where our great natural strength lies.

Why should we throw away our natural strength—land power—in order to grasp that which is expensive and not necessary to us—sea power?

The Hawaiian Islands have a coast line of over 800 miles—as large as that of New England. If we annex them, they must be fortified and defended. It puts the outposts of our defense 2,100 miles into the Pacific. As we know it will be the point of attack in case of war with foreign powers, it must be fortified more strongly than the other portions of our country. It means, therefore, the expenditure of millions in fortifications and an unnecessarily large navy.
