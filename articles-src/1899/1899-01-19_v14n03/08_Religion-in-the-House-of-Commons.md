## Religion in the House of Commons.

"Morning Herald."

Visitors to the House of Commons are not a little puzzled by the fact that before a great debate the first two benches are empty at prayer time, though the rest of the house is invariably well filled. A writer in the *Nineteenth Century* explains that this peculiar circumstance does not argue that the party leaders stand less in need of devotions than their followers; it is due to an unwritten law of the House, which cannot accommodate more than half the members. Here is the explanation in full:

"On the table, in a little box, is a supply of small, white cards with the words, 'At Prayers,' in large old English letters. Obtaining one of these cards, and writing his name on it under the words 'At Prayers,' the member slips it into a receptacle in the bench at the back of the seat, and thus secures the place for the night against all comers. He may immediately leave the House, and remain away as long as he pleases; the place may be occupied by another member in the meantime; but whenever the master of the seat—the gentleman whose autograph is written on the card in the little brass slit—returns to the chamber, the temporary occupant of the seat must give place to him. Thus does piety in the House of Commons meet immediately with the substantial reward of a seat in which to listen in comfort to a long debate. The consequence is that at times of great excitement in the House there is a most edifying display of devotion on the part of members; but in the dull seasons the attendance at prayers is deplorably lax. And as the occupants of the front benches have their seats secured to them by custom—a custom which now possesses all the force of a law—they never lend the eclat of their presence to the daily devotions of the House."

This curious custom is a pretty good illustration of the way in which religion is regarded by the average politician; it isn't a bad thing when it helps him to a seat in the halls of legislation.
