# Uncertainties — v14n03 (1899-01-19)

## General Notes

This issue was split from the Mistral OCR file `v14n03_1899-01-19.md`. The OCR quality appears good overall with few ambiguities.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 07 — "The Army Chaplain" (R. M. Kilgore)

- **Location:** Body text, paragraph about Christ and Herod
- **Issue:** The OCR text reads `"Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast [out devils` — the opening bracket `[` before "out" appears to be an OCR artifact or possibly a damaged original. The bracket does not close in the text.
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved as in OCR: `"Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast [out devils`
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the bracket appears to be either an OCR error for a damaged character or an original printing artifact; the text is otherwise clear and contextually correct (Luke 13:32).

### Article 12 — "Governing the Filipinos"

- **Location:** Senator Mason quotation
- **Issue:** Two instances of `[` in the OCR: `"Shall we send special instructors to [teach them how to kill postmasters` and `Shall we [change Mr. Lincoln's famous words`. These open brackets without closing appear to be OCR artifacts from damaged text or column breaks in the original.
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved as in OCR with brackets intact.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the text makes sense without the brackets; they likely mark where text was obscured or damaged in the original scan.

### Article 29 — "The War of Principle No. 14" (Frances E. Bolton)

- **Attribution:** The article ends with the initials "F. E. B." — identified as Frances E. Bolton, the same author as "A Mad Marriage" (article 10) which is signed "FRANCES E. BOLTON." Consistent attribution applied.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 16 Short Editorial Items

- **Issue:** Page 16 contains a series of short editorial paragraphs (articles 30–43) that are not visually separated by section headers in the OCR. They appear as a continuous flow after the advertising pages. Each has been treated as a separate article per project guidelines.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the separations; each paragraph is clearly a distinct, self-contained thought.
