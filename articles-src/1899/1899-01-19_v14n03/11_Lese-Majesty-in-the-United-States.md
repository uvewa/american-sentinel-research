# "Lese-Majesty" in the United States.

An exchange remarks that giving utterance to language derogatory to the Roman Catholic priesthood, appears to constitute the crime of "lese majesty" in the United States; and in support of the assertion quotes the following from the press despatches of recent date:—

"The Richmond Borough School Board, which has been investigating charges against Mme. Alma de Belprat, a teacher in the Stapleton High School, concluded its work last evening. Mme. de Belprat was charged with assailing the Roman Catholic Church in connection with a recitation in geography, and particularly the rule requiring celibacy among its priests.

"Many witnesses testified that she said she pitied the poor priests, who could not get married.

"The board unanimously found the teacher guilty of gross misconduct in her classroom, fined her five days' pay, and transferred her to the high school in Tottenville, the transfer to take effect after the regents' examinations in January. She will be formally warned not to offend the religious sensibilities of any pupil in future."
