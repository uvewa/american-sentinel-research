The German emperor has demanded a stronger army, so the latest dispatches from Berlin affirm. New army bills have been introduced in the Reichstag, which call for "large increases" in the military forces. A member of the Reichstag, Herr Richter, upon hearing the bills read arose and inquired if the czar's peace manifesto was due only to "an excess of sentimentality." He was answered by another member who said that the czar's manifesto was to be taken seriously, but that nevertheless the proposed increase was necessary, because the "dual alliance" (France and Russia) had grown to be stronger than the "dreibund."
