## A Mad Marriage.

BY FRANCES E. BOLTON.

"No," said the Church to her suitor, the State,
"A union with you would but ruin my fate.
Your proposals are vain, for my pledge and my love
Have both been bestowed on my Suitor above."

Sir State half-disheartened turned back to his throne.
"Now have you no fear," said a demon's soft tone;
"For I will in person beseech her to hear,
And bring the persuasions that please the fair ear;
Wait on, sir, in hope, she shall yet be thine own
And thou'lt have a mistress to brighten thy throne."

The evil one surely exerted his power;
And slowly he tempted her hour by hour,
Presenting the kingdoms of earth, till at last
The hand of the Church and the State were made fast
But bitterly, bitterly, did she repine,
Till she came once again to her lover divine.

Sir State, ill-requited, would never return;
For he dreaded the fire he once had felt burn,
And knew that the Church was no mate for his heart,
That the world was blest most when they kept most apart,
The demon's proposals the State would not hear.
Nor seek ere again to the fair lady's ear.

But the demon determined to wound her dear King,
And place on her finger the State's wedding ring;
So he wooed her away from her dear Lord again,
And showed her earth's throne, where as queen she might reign.
Through the power of the law she might make sure her claim,
And force men to bow to her in the State's name.

Then bold grew the Church; for she now came to woo,
And said to the State, "I would wed, sir, with you."
She pleaded, and tempted, and teased him, until,
She tarnished his reason, and weakened his will;
And lo, once again in an uncanny hour
The State gave the Church the control of his power.

Woe to the world; for how sad was the day
When a false-hearted Church through the State had her way!
False to high heaven, with a dream of high fate
She lived to unman, and undo the grand State.
Tool for her jealousy, fool for her whim,
A most evil mistress she made unto him;
Jezebel never was given to more evil,
Nor lent swifter ear to the schemes of the devil,
And men and high angels bewailed for the hour
That gave to the hands of the Church the State's power.

But oh, shall the Lord she had left be alone
With no one to love, or to share his high throne?
No; for he chooseth a church that is white,
Robed in fair purity, crowned with love's light,
Loving him loyally, true to her vow,
He placeth his seal of high power on her brow.

Bitterly scorned by the false Church to-day,
She waiteth the hour that shall bear her away.
Doomed now to death by the Church and the State
She looketh to heaven to alter her fate;
And He who beholdeth, now moveth all heaven,
To save her the fate that their hatred hath given.

Thousands of chariots speed from the throne.
The King of all kings comes to rescue his own.
Angels of splendor shall bear her above,
To crown her with glory, and robe her in love,
Fair as a queen she shall sit by his side,
The high elect lady, the heavenly bride.
But the false Church shall fall by the sword of her fate,
And sink in oblivion's depth with the State,
But he who seeks love in the high worlds above,
Shall go in to feast at the marriage of love.
