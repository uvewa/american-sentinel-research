## The Real Purpose of a "Protectorate."

"Chicago Times-Herald."

ENGLAND went into the Sudan ostensibly as the friend of Egypt. She opposed French claims with ancient Egyptian rights which were supposed to extend indefinitely in almost all directions. Now she places that famous Egyptian, Lord Kitchener, of Omdurman, in control of the territory which he so recently conquered. "For the future," said Lord Cromer, in addressing a convocation of Sudanese sheikhs, "you will be governed by the queen and the khedive. The sole representative in the Sudan of the two governments will be the sirdar, in whom both the queen and the khedive have the fullest confidence. No attempt will be made to govern the country from Cairo, still less from London."

We imagine, however, that London will be heard from occasionally. England is in fact getting ready to throw off the mask, and this speech is, as the *London Times* declares, the assertion of British sovereign rights, and means the establishment of a protectorate. The Egyptian and his pretensions have been a sham all along for use against other European powers, and, having served their purpose, they are relegated to the background.
