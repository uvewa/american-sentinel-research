The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has decided that Senator S. M. Quay must stand trial on the charges brought against him of fraudulent use of public funds. Now that his downfall appears imminent, why do not the advocates of Sunday enforcement rally as one man to his support? Have they forgotten that Senator Quay championed their cause in the U. S. Senate in the summer of '93?
