THE papal prelates who claim that this is a Catholic Christian nation would do well to remember that there is a law of Congress in existence which forbids the lottery business, and see that this law is repealed or so amended as to represent Catholic sentiment upon that point. In support of this we quote the following from the Chicago Times-Herald:—

"ST. LOUIS, January 3.—Rev. C. F. Lavery, pastor of the Roman Catholic church at Macon City, Mo., returned from Chicago this morning, whither he had gone in the interest of his niece, Miss O'Connell, who, with Dr. P. T. Cunningham of this city, drew a $3,750 prize in a lottery said to be run by J. T. Brady, whose office is at Dearborn and Monroe Streets, Chicago.

"Miss O'Connell and Dr. Cunningham paid 25 cents for ticket No. 33,477, and this, they claim, won a $3,750 prize. They experienced trouble in collecting the money, and Father Lavery went to Chicago to make a demand for the cash. He met Brady and his assistant, Dr. Higgins, he says, but was refused payment in full. He says they wanted to pay $1,500 on the ticket and call it square. Father Lavery refused to accept this.

"Quite a number of St. Louis people have been buying this company's tickets, and several others besides Miss O'Connell and Dr. Cunningham won part of the $15,000 prize, and they say they cannot collect the money. They have no legal recourse, but threaten to make it hot otherwise for the lottery people if matters are not satisfactorily settled."
