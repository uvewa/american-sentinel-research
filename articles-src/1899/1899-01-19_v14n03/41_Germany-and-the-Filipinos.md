Germany, it is said, is backing up the Filipinos in their resistance to the authority of the United States. Of course! what else was to be expected than that some one of the jealous Powers would seize this ready opportunity of making trouble for this Government? This is a part of the diplomacy the Powers of Europe have been trained in for many years, and of which they are full masters. And while the opportunity remains—which will be as long as the Filipinos desire to be independent of American rule—what can be expected but that Germany or Russia or some other Power will be inciting them to revolt, and involving this nation in continual trouble, and complications with the nations of the Old World which may easily result in war? It ought not to be difficult for any truly patriotic American to rightly answer the question, Do we want the Philippines?
