The bishop of Havana, it is reported, has issued a letter to the various parishes, directing them to "impress upon their parishioners the necessity of making contributions" for the support of the church. Unless the scheme for a "voluntary loan" by the American Government shall be put into effect, the support of the church in Cuba will rest upon a system of "voluntary contributions" made by the Cubans in lieu of the taxes collected from them formerly by the church under Spanish authority. If the people really love the Catholic Church, they will of course cheerfully support it under this new system.
