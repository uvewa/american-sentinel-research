English clergymen have decided on an international demonstration in behalf of the czar's proposal for peace. The clergy could do more to promote peace by ceasing to quarrel among themselves, than by any other means that could be devised. The discord and strife which exists in the religious world, are only the counterpart of that which appears in politics. Both are prompted by the same spirit, and are equally contrary to the gospel.
