# Manifest Weakness.

BY E. W. CAREY.

A few Sundays ago as the writer was passing along the street of this city to attend a mission Sunday-school he was accosted by a well-dressed young man, who presented a card of appeal as follows:—

"SALESMEN APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC.

"We are endeavoring to close ALL stores on Sunday, thus securing one day of rest for the retail clerk and his employer. You can assist us by not buying any goods on Sunday. Will you do it?

"Yours truly,

"SALESMEN'S BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION."

At the next corner a similar card was presented by a representative of the same association. Thus these cards were scattered all over the business part of the city.

It was a strong "appeal" to the arm of flesh. Instead of looking up for power, the cry was made to weak mortals like themselves. The Word says, "Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no salvation." Ps. 146:3 (margin).

They want to be good, and ask sinful man to make, or help them, to be good; but "there is none that doeth good, no, not one." They have appealed to the wrong source for rest and righteousness.

This cannot be the appeal of Christians, for they are "kept by the power of God"—not by the arm of flesh, nor by the power of the State. And Bible Christians are not heard pleading that all temptations or tests be removed from them; but their cry is, "Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts, and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting." With the noble-hearted Paul we hear them say triumphantly, "We glory in tribulations also."

Temptations and tests have their place in the development of Christian character, and "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." To appeal to man in view of this assurance of our Father's care is to deny him, and make manifest to the world a weak and faithless generation.
