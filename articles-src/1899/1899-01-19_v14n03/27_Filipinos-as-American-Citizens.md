## Filipinos as American Citizens.

By Senator George F. Edmunds.

ALL the people of these islands who were the subjects of Spain will become citizens of the United States by the mere act of cession unless the treaty of cession should provide that those who wished could remain subjects of Spain and aliens as to the United States. This has been a necessary rule of international law for hundreds of years; and the rule is founded upon the obvious fact that the people of every country, or of any part of it, must owe allegiance to and be subject to the government of some sovereign power, be it a tribe, or emperor, or king, or republic, and must, unless they are slaves or serfs, have the rights of such.

But a republic can have no subjects. Its people must be either citizens, slaves, or aliens.

If aliens they are the subjects or citizens of some other power which is bound to protect them. The transfer, therefore, of the sovereignty of Spain over the Philippines to the United States makes all her subjects at once citizens of the United States.

If citizens of the United States, they have all the rights that belong to other citizens in the territories, whether on the mainland or on islands of the sea. Neither geography nor distance has anything to do with it.
