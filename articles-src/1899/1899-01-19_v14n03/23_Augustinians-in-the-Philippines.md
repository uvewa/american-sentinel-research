"The vast property of the Augustinians in the Philippine Islands, and the stand taken against them by the natives," says a writer in the *Washington Post*, "will require in the adjustment that must come the most silken gloved diplomacy on the part of church and state."

This view is quite consistent with the idea that the "vast property" which the Augustinians have taken from the natives shall be retained by the church intact, and no part of it surrendered to the rightful owners. That this shall be so, is a matter to which Rome is now giving earnest attention. The "prior general" of the Augustinians, Dr. Rodriguez, it is stated, "is expected to come to the United States to help in the rescue of his order so perilously situated in our new Asiatic possessions." And the attitude of the administration is such that there is little doubt that the order and all its "property" will be "rescued," if the force of American authority can suffice for that purpose.

Is it any wonder that when the American Government sends a papal priest to the Filipinos and manifests an intention to perpetuate the religious institutions of which the Filipinos so much desire to be rid, the latter should not take kindly to American domination?
