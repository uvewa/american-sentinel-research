Civil rule in Havana has been turned over to the Cubans, two Cuban officials having been sworn into office at noon of the 14th inst., who will be at the head of the government in that city. This is pointed to as proof that the American policy formerly announced for Cuba is to be carried out, and we trust that this inference is correct. The oath of office was administered to the Cuban officials by the American General Ludlow, and binds the officials to perform the duties of their office "in conformity with the law and the orders of the military governor;" so that the military government still remains really paramount.
