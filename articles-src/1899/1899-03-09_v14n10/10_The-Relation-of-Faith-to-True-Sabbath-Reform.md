## The Relation of Faith to True Sabbath Reform.

BY C. H. KESLAKE.

In former articles it has been shown what the true basis of Sabbath reform is; that it must necessarily begin from within, in the heart, by the shedding abroad therein of the love of God by the Holy Spirit; that love—God's love—is the only power that can possibly be used to bring about the true observance of the Sabbath.

Any observance of the Sabbath effected by any other means, not only fails to glorify God, but it works a positive injury to the person who is thus forced to observe it, and can only result in confirming such in their sin.

Hence it is absolutely impossible for Sabbath reform, according to God's standard to be accomplished other than by the straight and exclusive preaching of the everlasting gospel, which is none other than the power of God. Rev. 14:6, 7; Rom. 1:16.

But this preaching of the gospel, as well as the receiving of it, is purely a matter of faith. Faith is the only channel through which the power of the gospel is conveyed to the soul.

Faith occupies a field all its own. To add anything to faith, in order that that thing, whatever it may be, shall aid faith in its work, can only result in denying faith, and consequently to negative the power of God in the gospel.

Faith itself works, and it works by love. Gal. 5:6. There is no obedience such as God can accept, but that which is of faith. Hence we find the Apostle Paul writing to the Romans as follows: "Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest; and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith." Rom. 16:25, 26.

Now as faith works by love, it is evident that it can work nothing but that which is in harmony with love—the love of God—and "this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous." 1 John 5:3. There is no fear therefore but that faith will infallibly lead one to keep the Sabbath, for that is a part of the commandments of God.

We have said that to add anything to faith as an aid to it, is to deny faith, and thus negative the power of God. But this is exactly what is being done with reference to the Sunday-Sabbath reform. While professing to have faith in God, the advocates of Sunday are not content with that. In addition to this they appeal to earthly powers for help to save their sabbath from destruction. In doing so they deny that the power of God is sufficient, and so they contradict themselves in their profession of faith.

How different such a course is from that set forth in the Scriptures. There we read that the preaching of God's servant was not "with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." 1 Cor. 2:4, 5.

It was true then; it is true now. One's faith is everlastingly to be in the power of God. In the history of the Reformation we find an illustration of this truth. We look in vain for a single instance where Luther sought for help from the State. It is true that the Elector Frederick protected him, and once had Luther seized and carried to the Wartburg. But this was contrary to Luther's wish, and it was not long before he left the Wartburg without the knowledge of Frederick, refusing all protection from this prince, but rather offering him his (Luther's) protection—that which he had through being connected with God by faith.

And so it is with the present-day gospel reform, for Sabbath reform is gospel reform.

Let every soul beware how he espouses the Sunday-Sabbath reform, and unites his voice with the others in asking help from the State. To do so means for him to raise his hand against God's creatures, and do them violence; and sooner or later, to find that he has in this work been fighting against God. It can mean nothing else than persecution. The work is not of faith.

We have before remarked that to compel a person to keep the Sabbath by means of the civil power, can result in nothing else than injury to him, confirming him in his sin.

But this is not all. It will do the same for one who uses the civil power, be he minister or statesman. He not only brings the other man into the most abject slavery; he brings himself into it, even the slavery of sin. This is so because his work is not, cannot be, of faith; and "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin." Rom. 14:2, 3. But "the wages of sin is death." Therefore there is death in Sunday laws for all who have anything to do with them.

Not so is it with those who advocate the seventh day as the Sabbath. It is true that they number less than one-tenth of one per cent. of those who keep Sunday.

From first to last they repudiate the principle that the state can keep the church of Christ—although it may any other church; they deny that it is possible for the Sabbath to be kept by means of any law, even the law of God; that it can be done only through the power of God by the faith of Jesus Christ in the gospel. "And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith." 1 John 5:4.
