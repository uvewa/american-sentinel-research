## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, short items
- The OCR contains "**ሚር**" twice on page 1. This appears to be an OCR artifact from a decorative separator or ornament between the short editorial items. The symbol is not meaningful text and has been omitted as a section divider rather than transcribed. Confidence: HIGH that this is not article text.

### Page 8, "NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT" — large-cap items
- Several items appear in ALL CAPS in the OCR, suggesting they were set in small caps or display type in the original (items about the Archbishop of Canterbury, Reports from the Philippines, North Carolina disfranchisement). These have been preserved in ALL CAPS as they appear in the OCR, which likely reflects the original typesetting. The North Carolina item transitions mid-text from all-caps to mixed case as the article continued across a page break (page 8 to page 9).

### Page 8, "GOSPEL" OCR error
- The OCR reads "GOSEL" twice in the Archbishop of Canterbury note. This is clearly an OCR error for "GOSPEL." The text has been transcribed as "GOSPEL" (the correct word). Confidence: HIGH — contextually unambiguous.

### Page 9, North Carolina item — OCR errors
- "CONTRAT" (should be "CONTRAST"), "ALMED" (should be "AIMED"), "DESIDES" (should be "BESIDES"), "ENFORE" (should be "ENFORCE") — these are OCR errors in the all-caps section. They have been corrected in the transcription to their evident intended readings. Confidence: HIGH.

### Page 9, North Carolina item — quoted Constitution text
- The constitutional text beginning "No state shall make or enforce..." begins mid-sentence at the top of page 9, as a continuation from page 8. The text has been joined as a continuous passage. The first letter of "zens" (completing "citizens") is on page 9 after a page break. Transcribed as complete text. Confidence: HIGH.

### Author "F. E. B." — article 11
- The article "If We Let Him Thus Alone" is signed "F. E. B." at the end. These initials are not in the known authors list. They have been preserved in the filename and the author_short field, but no full name has been supplied. This author warrants further research.

### Author "C. H. Keslake" — article 10
- Signed "BY C. H. KESLAKE." This author is not in the known authors list. The full name has been transcribed as given. Initials used: CHK.

### Author "Mrs. L. D. Avery-Stuttle" — article 29
- Signed "MRS. L. D. AVERY-STUTTLE." This is an unusual attribution (full name with title). Transcribed exactly as given. Initials used: LDAS.

### Page 12, article 13 — William Jennings Bryan quotation
- The passage attributed to William Jennings Bryan has no formal reprint attribution line in the usual "—*Source*" format; instead it is a direct quotation followed by "—William Jennings Bryan." Treated as a reprint/quotation and filed accordingly.

### Page 16, "Notice" and "Back Numbers" items
- Two short administrative notices appear on page 16 about available back issues and the February 16 issue. These have been omitted as they are operational/subscription boilerplate rather than substantive content.
