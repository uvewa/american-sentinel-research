FOUR bills relating to Sunday observance have been introduced in the Connecticut legislature. They are aimed at the repeal of existing Sunday restrictions. One provides for "the running of railroad trains any hour on Sunday." Another relates to Sunday restrictions upon other public conveyances. A third calls for the repeal of the existing "Lord's day" law of the State, and a fourth aims at an "open Sunday." The New England Sabbath Protective League are of course stirred up over these bills, and against this opposition they are not likely to become laws.
