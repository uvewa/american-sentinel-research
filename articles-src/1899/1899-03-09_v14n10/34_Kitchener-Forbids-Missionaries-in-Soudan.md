GENERAL KITCHENER, who has been given almost supreme authority in the regulation of affairs in the Soudan, has forbidden missionary enterprises being started in that district for the present, and meanwhile will foster the Mohammedan religion and government as being best suited to meet the requirements of the situation and restore peace and happiness to that great territory. Of course, General Kitchener's dictum would have no great authority in excluding Christian missionaries if he were not backed up by the British government; and the British government would not have backed him up in it if that government did not maintain a union of church and state. So that the English union of church and state is now keeping Christianity away from the Soudan and fostering Mohammedanism.
