## The Coming Federation With Great Britain.

### VIEWS OF A YALE PROFESSOR, WHO FAVORS "EXPANSION."

At the session of the Wisconsin Historical Society, at Madison, on Washington's birthday, George B. Adams, professor of history at Yale University, spoke the following relative to the subject of Anglo-American federation:—

"A single word of ours, like the word which, we are told, England spoke for us at the beginning of our war, would suffice by its single speaking to create the unity of the English-speaking races before the world, for the world would then know that danger to the least land of our kinship or to any protected land would bring the whole race forward in its defense, and this is all that is needed.

"A federal government is not necessary, nor even a formal alliance. Only a determined resolution, backed by a ready power of action, that in the age which is now coming on, when the frontiers of the races draw together and a struggle between them, if it comes, will be the last and the decisive one of history—a determined resolution that in such an age our race shall act as one in behalf of civilization which is one.

"There is no determination which has grown so rapidly and so strongly in this nation in the last generation, and I believe the same to be true of England, as the determination to do justice ourselves as to other men, to protect the weak, to check wherever possible the merely rapacious, and to hold our institutions, our civilization, and our religion in trust for all men.

"With this resolution at heart the nation may make mistakes, it may be badly led, it may not always be able to distinguish between the mere scheming of the politician and the line of true policy, nor know how to do what it does know should be done; it cannot in a generation free itself from selfishness and greed.

"If we embark upon empire we shall not do as well even as England does, and we shall suffer, and those we rule will suffer in consequence. But we shall learn and we shall at no distant day do well."
