THE GREAT HINDRANCE TO THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL ALL OVER THE WORLD, SAID THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, RECENTLY, IN SPEAKING BEFORE THE CHURCH INSTITUTE OF FOREIGN MISSIONS, IS THE IRRELIGIOUS LIFE LED BY SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CARRYING COMMERCE TO OTHER NATIONS. IN OTHER WORDS, THE GREATEST HINDRANCE TO THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL IN HEATHEN LANDS IS THE UNCHRISTIAN CHARACTER OF THE AVERAGE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE "CHRISTIAN" NATIONS.
