An advocate of Sunday observance has referred to the Sabbath as the pearl of days. Now, the pearl of days is a gem that man cannot attempt to improve, nor alter, without destroying its value. Other gems may be cut and polished and thus be made more beautiful, but the pearl must be taken as it is found if its value would be retained. How apt an illustration is this of the law of God, as a whole, or of the Sabbath as a part of that law! The Lord's Sabbath is the seventh day, and is indeed the Pearl of Days. As for Sunday it is no pearl at all. It is an imitation, and all the tinkering in the world can make it nothing more.—South African Sentinel.
