REPORTS FROM THE PHILIPPINES MAKE IT PLAIN THAT THAT FAR-DISTANT SECTION OF TERRA FIRMA IS AT BEST A POOR PLACE FOR AMERICAN HUSBANDS AND SONS. THE CLIMATE IS DEADLY TO FOREIGNERS, AND 4,000 OF THE 20,000 MEN UNDER GENERAL OTIS ARE REPORTED SICK FROM SMALL POX, FEVER, AND OTHER DISEASES. A SOLDIER WRITING FROM MANILA SENDS THIS NEWS:

"Manila is getting Americanized. Before I left I saw a sign printed in English, which said: 'Americans, Attention!—Gin, I cent.'

"But the boys do not like the place. An enthusiastic California volunteer said to me: 'I would rather be a lamppost in San Francisco than governor general of all the Philippines.' That represented the general opinion of the boys. They were all thinking of home."
