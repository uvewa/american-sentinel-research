THE WEATHER VANE OF POPULAR SENTIMENT.

The promoters of the movement for religious legislation are energetically seeking to work up a popular sentiment which will give the movement the needed support. When they have secured this they will quote the saying, "The voice of the people is the voice of God." But popular sentiment is only a weather vane; it is constantly changing; it is no safe guide to truth. The safe guide is not a weather vane, but a compass—the compass of eternal truth—the Word of God. When popular sentiment shall sanction legislation enforcing the observance of Sunday as the Christian Sabbath, it will still be true, as it always has been, that "the seventh day is the Sabbath;" and it will not be safe for anyone to observe any other than the Bible Sabbath, however unpopular it may be.
