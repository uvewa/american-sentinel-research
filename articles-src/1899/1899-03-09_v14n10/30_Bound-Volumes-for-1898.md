## Bound Volumes for 1898.

The weighty questions that have entered the arena of national thought and the advance moves which have been made in the education of public opinion and the popular conscience, in regard to religious legislation, and the relation sustained in its discussion of them by the AMERICAN SENTINEL, together with its well executed and forcible front page illustrations make the bound volumes for 1898 a treasure indeed, a storehouse of information to be desired.

Our prices are as formerly: $2.50 in cloth with leather back and corners; in heavy manilla paper cover, $1.50.
