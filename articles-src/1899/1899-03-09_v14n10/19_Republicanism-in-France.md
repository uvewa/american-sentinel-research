REPUBLICANISM as it is in France, with its great burden of militarism, is illustrated by the following facts and figures relative to the daily mail of the French president. The average number of letters sent daily to this individual at the Elysée is 700. Of these, 250 are begging letters, 150 petitions on criminal affairs, 100 petitions from criminals, 100 complaints against various functionaries, 80 anonymous insulting letters, and 20 containing threats of assassination.
