## An Importation of Conscience.

So the editor of the *Presbyterian Record* calls the four thousand Doukhobors, who have landed on Canadian soil and gone to make new homes in the far West.

He says: "They have been welcomed by voice and press, for their clean, healthy bodies, their high-toned morals and their dauntless faith and courage under sore persecution, prominence being given to one or another of these according to taste.

One point may be noted. They have been driven from their homes, they have lost everything, they have come to our land, all for conscience sake. Conscience is a valuable commodity in any country. Russia has none to spare and her policy is suicidal. Canada cannot have too much of it. Her fields and forests and mines are of great worth, but more essential to her true prosperity is 'a good conscience toward God and toward man.' This is probably the largest single importation of conscience in the world's history, and well may we rejoice that Canada is the recipient of it. May it spread.—*Primitive Catholic*.
