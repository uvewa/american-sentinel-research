ITALY has demanded a naval base and a "sphere of influence" in China; and what is very significant about this is that Italy consulted Great Britain before making the demand, and Great Britain has interposed no objection since the demand was made. As the "sphere of influence" stands for a policy directly opposed to the "open door" policy hitherto contended for by Great Britain, this circumstance is interpreted by statesmen as indicating that Great Britain has abandoned her "open door" policy, and that the doom of the Chinese empire is sealed; for the obtaining of spheres of influence by the Powers means the partition of China. And now the question is raised as to where the United States will come in for its "sphere of influence" which there seems to be no question will be demanded by this Government. The United States must demand it or lose its trade in "the East," to secure which it has taken possession of the Philippines.

If it be true, as statesmen believe, that Great Britain has abandoned her policy of keeping the Chinese empire intact, then, as the Sun (N. Y.) observes, "the far East may be the scene of a most dramatic political tragedy during the closing hours of the century."

Events are moving rapidly, indeed. But do you see to what issue they are moving, and are you getting prepared to meet it?
