Human Automatons.

"O, HARRY!" exclaimed Willie Hunter to his particular friend whom he met on his way down town;" "have you been to see the automatons? come on; I'm going again, though I've been once."

"Automatons? well, you've got me this time; never heard of such a thing; guess you'll have to tell me what you mean."

"I never did, either, till this exhibition came along. Why, there are thirty or forty little bits of images that look just like the little men we read about last summer in 'Gulliver's Travels,' and they act like little men too, as well as look like them. Why, they—"

"They don't walk, do they?" interrupted Harry, while his bright blue eyes opened very wide.

"Walk? I should say they did, and some of them dance; and O Harry! one little old man climbs up a ladder and then climbs down again, and—"

Harry was too excited by this time to listen to his friend's description any further, and he bounded away, shouting back at Willie:—

"I'm going to see if Uncle Frank knows about it. I think I'll coax him to take me to night."

Uncle Frank was Harry's favorite uncle, because he always joined in his boyish plays, and told him stories of the time when he was a boy.

So it came to pass that a very happy lad walked close by Uncle Frank's side that evening to see the wonderful sights at the exhibition.

"Do see that little old woman, uncle, she is striking that funny old man with her umbrella; isn't it queer! I should think she would be tired by this time, she hasn't stopped a minute since I first noticed her."

"No, Harry, she will not stop until the machinery runs down. She is made to do just that one thing, and she cannot stop. Do you see how naturally those little women pull the oars of that pretty boat? You see they are made to do it by some machinery which is hidden from our sight."

"See that tiny man stand on the other man's back. Why! he is moving his arms and legs. O Uncle Frank, there goes a little train of cars into that dark tunnel! Hark! we can hear them whistle down brakes!"

That evening as they were walking home, Harry chattered continually about the wonderful things they had seen.

"Wouldn't it be nice, Uncle Frank, if boys were only made like those automatons? Then we wouldn't find it such hard work to split wood and do chores and run errands,—why, our legs would go without a speck of trouble."

"But, Harry, that's not the way the Lord makes men. Suppose he made a man in such a manner that, in spite of himself, ever so often through the day, his knees would bend and his mouth would utter a very fine prayer. Do you think the great Creator would be pleased with such worship?"

"Why, what a funny idea! Of course not. How did you ever think of such a strange thing?"

"Well, there are some people who dislike to go to church or to pray, just as badly as you dislike to run errands, or to split wood. But the Lord did not choose to make people mere automatons. He will not force men or boys either to serve him. He does not take any pleasure in the prayers of people who pray to him, or go to church, just because others do so, or because it is popular, or even because they are afraid of the laws of men."

"Why, uncle, I should think it was a queer thing for men to try to force other men to go to church. I didn't suppose any one had a right to do that."

"No one has a right, my boy. Even God himself does not do that. He has made men capable of choosing the good or the evil, that they may serve him intelligently and from the heart. No other service is pleasing to him. In some sections of the country there is a great deal of talk about making laws to force people to keep a certain day of the week as the Sabbath, and in some places they are actually doing this. Now suppose I go to church on that day and bow my knees, pretending to worship God, just to avoid being shut up in jail, what do you think I ought to be called, Harry?"

"Why, you would be an automaton, uncle."

"Indeed, I would; and I should, besides this, be a wicked hypocrite; for I would be pretending to be what I was not."

"I heard grandma say this morning that there were lots of people over on the other side of the world who keep Friday. How would those fellows who make such laws feel if they were over there and were forced to keep that day or go to jail, I wonder?"

"And yet it would be no more unjust. Human beings were not born automatons, and if even their Maker does not think forced worship of any value, why should men be so unwise as to think to make of their brother men mere automatons?"
