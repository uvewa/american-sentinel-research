"If We Let Him Thus Alone."

"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and our nation." This was the decision of the council of the priests and Pharisees in regard to the work of Christ. They had just been informed of the raising of Lazarus from the dead by the Son of God, and were constrained to acknowledge, "this man doeth many miracles." They had had evidence upon evidence that he exercised divine power, that he lived a blameless life in harmony with the law of God; yet these men concluded that they were jeopardizing the nation by letting him alone.

He was no malefactor, he was no law-breaker, he was no insurrectionist. He condemned nothing but unbelief, hypocrisy, and tyranny. Peaceably he went about his own business,—laying hands on the sick, and healing them, opening the eyes of the blind, unstopping the ears of the deaf, bidding the lame to walk, the sorrowful to rejoice, and the sinful to sin no more. He healed the broken in heart, brought deliverance to the captive soul, and preached good tidings to the poor. What was there in such a work of mercy and love to call for the decision of the priests and Pharisees, and move upon them to proclaim that it was not safe to let him alone?

When they looked into his pure, compassionate eyes with murderous hate, he asked, "Which of you convinceth me of sin?" And they could not answer him; "for he did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth." He was no enemy to civil government in the exercise of its just functions, nor did he neglect the ordinances of religion. Their plots to entrap him on both questions had made him manifest as more loyal than his enemies to both religion and civil government. And yet they declared that it was dangerous to let him alone.

What was the fundamental reason of their cruel decision? It was a selfish, satanic reason. His mild and gentle power was undermining the kingdom of self and Satan. By both precept and example he was revealing to men the character of the subjects of God's true kingdom, and souls were turning from darkness to light, from disobedience to holiness, from Satan to God. The rightful Prince of men and the world was manifesting his dominion over hearts and nature, and the Usurper was alarmed, and inspired his subjects with his own satanic fear. All men would "believe on him," and such was the doctrine he taught, that it would leave them the helpless prey of their enemies, and they would be swallowed up in Roman captivity. This was enough to stir up the world-loving priests and Pharisees, and would yet instill into the selfish mobs, murderous hate, and satanic fury. Jewish patriotism was of the incendiary kind, and it stood for allegiance to the god of this world.

Through all centuries there has been strife between the powers of good and evil to win and to keep subjects for the kingdoms they represent. At the time of Christ's advent to the world, it seemed as if the powers of evil were to win a world-wide triumph, and that the Usurper was to ally all men on his side, and that the true King was to be left without one advocate or witness. Satan had taken the place of Christ, and had organized the state and the church according to his own perverted ideas. He, through priestly representatives, domineered over men's conscience, and compelled them to pay homage in his synagogue through the force of the sword, if not willingly. He sat in the temple of God, showing himself to be God, and the worship men gave, was given to devils.

The powers of hell were stirred against the Redeemer of the world; for he was invading the kingdom Satan wished to secure, and compelled the Usurper to rally his forces that he might banish the disturber, and make fast his subjects. It would not do to come out in candor and display his hellish banner. The grace and truth of the true King made it impossible to appear in his real character, and therefore the Usurper must disguise himself and mask his plans, and stir men against Christ on a false issue. It was he who insisted that it was not safe to let him alone, and that of all enemies to the nation, none were so dangerous as was the humble Teacher of Galilee.

Nursing the fear of hell, listening to the terrors of the devil, men were prepared to go to the lengths of his hate, and take his council through the mouth of the high priest, "Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not." They were reconciled to the cross and the agony of Calvary on the plea of expediency. Thus they found an excuse for crucifying the Lord of life and glory, because in their selfish reasoning they decided that it was not safe to let him alone.

At infinite sacrifice the Father had sent his beloved Son to win back his rebellious, suffering subjects. Divine pity had prompted the great heart of Love to send a Deliverer to his oppressed world, that groaned under satanic dominion. The Deliverer had manifested his superior power, and had broken the chains of sin, sickness, sorrow, and death. No dungeon of the enemy could be barred so that he could not enter and say to the captive "Go free." The Word of God went forth conquering and to conquer, and the ranks of tradition were melting away in weakness before the battalions of God's host.

A divine power attended Christ's ministry; but men had long reigned in the temple of God, and this Jesus was not of their choosing. He had not been educated in the school of the rabbis, nor did he bear the credentials of the Sanhedrim. He was not sent forth trained in the doctrines and traditions of the synagogue of Satan. They were determined to put a stop to his intrusion into their special field of teaching. They would check the work, and hinder men from allying themselves with heaven. This was what led them to decide that it was not safe to let him alone. They acted in the name of both church and state; for he was jeopardizing the nation, and overthrowing the established religion. His doctrine cast contempt on tradition, and exalted the Word of God alone. The cherished observances would be set aside, the priesthood would be brought into irreverence, the Jewish religion would be given up for a new heresy, and when unity ceased, the nation would go to pieces. It was out of the question to leave him undisturbed.

Having reached the decision of the peril of giving to Jesus civil and religious liberty, of allowing him free speech and unhindered action, they speedily completed their plans for cutting off the disturber. False witnesses were secured, a betrayer found, soldiers equipped, the inquisitors set on the scent, and the Son of God submitted himself to the impotent hands of men. He was first brought before the religious teachers and leaders, and by them delivered to a reluctant, man-fearing state official, who found no fault with him, but who, to save himself, crucified the Lamb of God.

Hearken diligently, even in this day and age of the world; for the old cry is sounding, and again the councils of priests and Pharisees are deciding that it is not safe to let those alone who represent their Lord, and teach the Word of God, setting it in opposition to the traditions of men.
