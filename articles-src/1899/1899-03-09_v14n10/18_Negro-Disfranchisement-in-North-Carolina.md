IN NORTH CAROLINA, BY RECENT ACTION OF THE LEGISLATURE, THE NEGRO HAS BEEN PRACTICALLY DISFRANCHISED. THIS HAS BEEN DONE BY A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WHICH PRESCRIBES EDUCATIONAL, PROPERTY, AND TAX QUALIFICATIONS WHICH COMPARATIVELY FEW NEGROES IN THE STATE POSSESS. THAT THE AMENDMENT IS AIMED AGAINST THE NEGROES AND NOT AGAINST IGNORANCE AND THE LACK OF PROPERTY, IS EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT A PROVISION IS ADDED IN IT ALLOWING ANY PERSON TO VOTE WHO WAS ENTITLED TO VOTE ON JANUARY 1, 1867, OR AT ANY TIME PRIOR THERETO, OR WHOSE ANCESTORS WERE SO ENTITLED TO VOTE. THE NEGROES IN NORTH CAROLINA NOT HAVING BEEN ENTITLED TO VOTE PRIOR TO THAT TIME, THEY ARE OF COURSE EXCLUDED UNDER THE PRESENT PROVISION, IN CONTRAST WITH THE WHITES. AND BESIDES THIS, AN AMENDMENT TO THE EDUCATIONAL LAWS IS ALSO PROPOSED UNDER WHICH, IT IS STATED, NEGROES WILL BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR PRESENT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT.

THIS ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE OF NORTH CAROLINA IS INDIRECTLY IN DEFIANCE OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION, WHICH PROVIDES THAT "NO STATE SHALL MAKE OR ENFORCE ANY LAW WHICH SHALL ABRIDGE THE PRIVILEGES OR IMMUNITIES OF CITIZENS of the United States; nor shall any state . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws" (Amendments, Article 14, Sec. 1); and also, "The right of the citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude" (Article 15, Sec. 1). The full significance of this disfranchising measure can not be appreciated without remembering that negro enfranchisement was one of the important fruits of the Civil War; and that no greater single step than their disfranchisement could be taken in the direction of a return to the conditions existing before that war was fought.

ALL this only emphasizes the fact that the white race in America is no longer disposed to deal with those of different color in the spirit of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The news from North Carolina harmonizes perfectly with that from Manila. While the nation is acquiring subjects abroad, it is quite consistently making subjects at home.
