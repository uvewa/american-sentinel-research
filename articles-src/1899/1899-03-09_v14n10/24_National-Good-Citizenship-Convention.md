## National "Good Citizenship" Convention.

We have received a Bulletin sent out by the Good Citizenship League, which has headquarters at Washington, D. C., giving the call for the third annual convention of the League, to be held at Cincinnati, May 2–4, 1899. "The proceedings, general discussion, and program of addresses," it is stated, "will be in accordance with the aims and objects of this movement, which briefly stated are as follows:—

1. Unification of reform forces.
2. Promotion of the study and practice of good citizenship.
3. Eclectism at the primary caucus and convention—selection of the best and most competent in nominating candidates for public office.
4. Direct legislation through the Initiative and Referendum.
5. Proportional Representation.
6. The Imperative Mandate."

All this is in order "that the nation may be saved from peril, our homes be rescued, our sons and daughters saved to all that is best in the Republic, and that there may be a realization of the hopes and desires of those who have ideals of truth, freedom, and justice."

The Bulletin calls attention to the hopelessness of any effort for reform through the political organizations, and states that this convention will be for "all genuine reformers," and the only credentials required for admission will be "the possession of a desire to see honor and purity, virtue and justice, the Golden Rule and the majority rule applied to politics."

The "Good Citizenship League" sees the urgent need of reform; that need is everywhere apparent. But it is one thing to see the need of reform, and quite another thing to get hold of the means by which this need can really be supplied. In this effort good people are groping in the dark. The old effort of human nature to reform itself by good revolutions, has its counterpart in these efforts of society to reform itself by political organization. It is all "of the earth, earthy." A man cannot lift himself by taking hold of himself. Neither can society lift itself by taking hold of itself.

The man—and society—must take hold of something higher than self before there can be any uplifting—any reform—above the level of existing conditions.

The people are almost wholly adherents of the great political parties. These parties were all started for the purpose of saving the country, preserving liberty, applying the Golden Rule and the majority rule to politics, etc. If the people cannot secure these ends through these political organizations, how can they hope to secure them through another political organization? If they cannot control any of these for their purposes, how can they expect to control another established on precisely the same principles? For the principles of politics are the same everywhere. Those principles constitute no barrier against the evils which "good citizenship" seeks to prevent.

Reform that is to be beneficial must be individual reform; and that cannot be secured through politics.
