This republic is not a wayward son; it has not spent its substance in riotous living. It is not ready to retrace its steps, and with shamed face and trembling voice solicit a humble place among the servants of royalty. God grant that the crowned heads of Europe may never have occasion to kill the fatted calf to commemorate its return from reliance upon the will of the people to dependence upon the authority which flows from regal birth or superior force.

Other nations may dream of wars of conquest and of distant dependencies governed by exterior force; not so with the United States. The fruits of imperialism, be they bitter or sweet, must be left to the subjects of monarchy. This is the one tree of which the citizens of our republic may not partake. It is the voice of the serpent, not the voice of God, that bids us eat.—William Jennings Bryan.
