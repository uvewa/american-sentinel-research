NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT

Nine persons are reported to have been arrested recently in Toronto, Ont., charged with "unlawfully practicing sorcery, witchcraft, and enchantment in attempts to tell fortunes." The law under which these arrests were made is an act passed during the reign of George II., and if convicted the parties are liable to a year's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred pounds. It is stated that these nine individuals are phrenologists, palmisters, clairvoyants, and spiritualists.

OF course, it is not within the province of civil law to deal with sorcery and witchcraft. That was attempted in Massachusetts back in colonial days, and one of the darkest chapters in American colonial history was the outcome of it. Withcraft and sorcery are forbidden by Scripture—by the law of God; and if it were proper for the civil power to administer the law of God and punish people for its violation, it would be proper to put people to death now for being sorcerers and wizards, as was done in Salem in the days of Cotton Mather; for death is the penalty which God's law provides. This, indeed, is the penalty for every transgression of the divine will; and therefore the attempted enforcement of the law of God by the civil power would only result in the extermination of the human race wherever the civil power could reach them; since "all have sinned," and "sin is the transgression of the law." The civil law can only protect rights; it cannot enforce righteousness.
