Save the Birds.

A NATIONAL law is now assured which will extend the authority of the Commission of Fish and Fisheries over "game birds and other wild birds useful for man." The rapidity with which birds have disappeared from the settled portions of the United States has been as unfortunate as it has been unnecessary. In some cases it has been due to the destruction of their coverts and food through the development of agriculture and the reclamation of marsh lands.

Most reprehensible has been the destruction of birds in the interest of the cruel fashions which have prevailed in connection with ladies' hats. After having stripped our Atlantic coast, the whole of Florida and the Gulf coast of egrets, terns, and thousands of other birds acceptable to the milliners, the plume hunters are now at work along the coast of Mexico and Central America. Lower California, and even upon the headwaters of the Orinoco and Amazon. Statistics show that the decrease of bird-life in thirty states and territories reaches a maximum of 77 per cent. in Rhode Island and a minimum of 10 per cent. in Nebraska, the average being 46 per cent.—Sabbath Recorder.
