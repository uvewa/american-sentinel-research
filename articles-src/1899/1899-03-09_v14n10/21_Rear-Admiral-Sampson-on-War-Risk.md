AT a banquet in Boston not long ago Rear-Admiral Sampson gave it as his opinion without qualification, that the increase in territory subject to American authority outside of the Union, will increase the chances of the United States for war at least one hundred per cent.; and asserted that the navy must be increased in the same proportion. There is no exaggeration, certainly, in this statement; for between attacking the American continent, and attacking some distant outlying American island, the difference is more than a hundred per cent. in favor of the latter. Sooner or later the people of the United States will be made to realize the full meaning and cost of maintaining isolated possessions across the sea under the very shadow of the war clouds of Europe.
