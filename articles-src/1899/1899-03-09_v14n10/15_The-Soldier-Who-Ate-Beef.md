A "soldier who ate beef" during the late campaign in Cuba, has written to a paper in this city stating some facts about the experience of himself and his comrades with that article of army diet. He says that the soldiers "made a horrible attempt" to eat it, and that "eating it whiskers and all was a little difficult"—an allusion to the fungus growth termed the "beard" which appears on decaying meat. When their supply of "fresh" meat was driven up before them at Santiago, the surgeon-major, sniffing the air and uttering an exclamation, said "Have they a corpse in that wagon?" In this remark the surgeon-major touched the root of the whole difficulty. There was a corpse—or a part of one—in the wagon; and it is in the nature of a corpse to decay, and become altogether unfit for food. From the experience the troops have had in this matter, the Government may well find reason to pause and consider the question whether corpse is really the best food for the men who are fighting its battles. Certainly no such results as those reported would have followed the use of any other food than corpse, and no such scandal would have arisen to taint the military department of the Government.
