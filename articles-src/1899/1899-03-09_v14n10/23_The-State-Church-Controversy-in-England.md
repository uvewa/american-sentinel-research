## The State-Church Controversy in England.

The Ritualistic controversy in England still goes on as bitterly as ever. The party in the Church of England—the established church—who want to conform to the practices of Rome, are the cause of the controversy, and the state now threatens to turn this party out like a disinherited heir. Sir William Harcourt, speaking for the government, alludes to them as "a body of men who are dismissed by the nation on account of their lawless conduct," and who therefore need not expect to be "treated with liberality and generosity." "They need not," he explains, "lay the flattering unction to their souls that they are going to carry off the Protestant plant of the National Church in order to carry on their Romish manufactures. They are not to be allowed to occupy the parish churches or the cathedrals in which to erect confessionals and celebrate without restraint their high masses. They are not to be secured by life incomes as commutation and compensation in the work of accomplishing the 'Conversion of England' out of the Protestant Establishment. These are considerations on which the bishops and the clergy may with advantage reflect. Their time is short, their sands are running out; if they continue pusillanimously to shiver on the brink, their impaired authority will be finally extinguished, and the existence of the church they have so ill-tended will be, and is indeed to-day, at stake."

And to this the Church Times, organ of the "high church" or Ritualistic party, replies that Sir William and those opposed to the Romish ritualism, "have sown such distrust in the lay mind that there is talk already of withdrawing support from the charitable and philanthropic work of the church. They have threatened coercion as a remedy for disorders which might easily have been removed by the exercise of Episcopal tact and intelligence. They have given a tremendous fillip to despairing radicalism, and inspired in dissenting minds the hope that the ascendency of the Nonconformist conscience in English politics may shortly be reasserted."

The ascendency of the church "conscience" in English politics is at the bottom of the whole controversy; and if the "Nonconformist conscience" gets into the place of the "conformist" or Church of England conscience "in English politics," there will simply spring up another shoot of controversy out of the tap root of the evil. A church which is united with the state will inevitably drift into conformity with Rome; for such union made the papacy in the first place, and must continue to make imitations of the papacy as certainly as that like causes must produce like results.
