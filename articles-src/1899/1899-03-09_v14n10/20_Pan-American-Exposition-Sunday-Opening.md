AT Buffalo, there is to be held in the year 1901 a "Pan American Exposition," and the question has been discussed whether or not it shall be open on Sundays. This question came up recently in the State Senate at Albany, in connection with the consideration of the bill providing for an exposition incorporation and appropriating money for a State building. Senator Raines, of Raines law-hotel fame, who announced recently an intention of showing certain of the people that "there is a God in Israel," offered an amendment to the bill providing for Sunday closing. But his amendment was voted down, and the bill, containing no provision against Sunday opening, was passed by forty votes against four. Thus the New York State Senate has placed itself on record against this form of Sunday legislation.
