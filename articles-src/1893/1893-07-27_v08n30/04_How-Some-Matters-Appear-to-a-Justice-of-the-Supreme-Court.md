## How Some Matters Appear to a Justice of the Supreme Court.

At the late Fourth of July celebration at Woodstock, Conn., Justice Brewer spoke on Individual Liberty. Among other things he said:—

> The most noticeable social fact of to-day is that of the combination of capital and the organization of labor. Whatever may be the causes, and whatever may be the results, good or bad, the fact is beyond dispute that the trend of the two great industrial forces of capital and labor is along the line of consolidation and cooperation. I am not here to decry this tendency. I realize full well that only through this movement are the great material achievements of the day possible; but one thing is clear, and that is, that the penalty which the Nation pays for all its benefits is the growing disposition to sacrifice the individual to the mass, to make the liberty of the one something which may be ruthlessly trampled into the dust, because of some supposed benefit to the many.

Notwithstanding the speaker's apparent effort not to appear as an antagonist to labor organizations, he nevertheless told some things in connection with their work which are worthy of attention. The closing statement of the foregoing quotation should be specially noticed, in which he declares that there is a "disposition to sacrifice the individual to the mass, to make the liberty of the one something which may be ruthlessly trampled into the dust, because of some supposed benefit to the many."

More truthful words, setting forth the dangers of the present social system, are seldom heard from the platform. But could not the same line of thought on the religious outlook of to-day be also studied with profit? Is it not true that the same tendencies obtain in matters of religion, to a large extent? The ready demand for legislation on religious lines whenever Congress or State legislatures meet, is a pointer showing the bent of combined religious effort on certain specified tenets of church belief. The argument, too, advanced in support of the claims made, is the same as that offered by labor combinations—"some supposed benefit to the many"—for which the majority seem willing to "make the liberty of one something which may be ruthlessly trampled into the dust."

This is exactly the present status of the Sunday question before the courts of Tennessee and Maryland. The combination of churches agree that the observance of Sunday by the public is necessary to the sustenance of their organization, and they, like other selfish beings, assume to coerce those who do not coincide with the Church theory on the question. This is done, too, without the least apparent regard to the inconvenience and trouble caused by their ill-advised movements. In this they deny to others what they themselves claim, namely, the right to believe as they will, and freely act their conscientious convictions. It is only because they have the power to do it, that these self-assumed guardians of the public conscience attempt to trample in the dust, the liberty of the few "because of some supposed benefit to the many."

Where is the difference, then, between the much talked of labor agitators, who seek to bend everything to the advantage of their order, and religious monopolists who assume to control public conscience by legal enactments, even to ruthlessly trampling into the dust the personal liberty of a few who may not be in accord with them? But the defense set up by these people is that wholesome religious restraint by law is good for those thus restrained. But this pretense cannot cover the selfishness which prompts such work. Besides, everybody knows that religious restraint is not good for either party concerned. It is but the revival of the senseless assumption of the old slave-holding theory. The same foolish reasons were advanced in the days of slavery for the maintenance of that pernicious system. Referring to the days of that hateful scheme, Justice Brewer said:—

> In the ante-bellum days, we all remember how slavery was defended on account of its benefit to the slave. Support, with ordinary labor in times of health and strength, food and care in days of old age and weakness: again and again it was asserted that he was so much better off than those left to struggle for themselves. Pentionly, and with shame, we look back to long tolerance with that argument produced in the mind of the Nation. But is servitude to a single man less of slavery than servitude to an organization.

Who can answer affirmatively the question which closes this quotation? When the potentates of Europe terrorized whole districts in the Dark Ages by holding the Church of those days to the tenets of faith held by themselves, and that too, under penalty of death, they justified themselves by the same argument used by slave-holders for holding their servants as chattels; and we might add, though strange as it may seem, the same exactly is now advanced for the propagation of religious laws in the United States. But this only shows the sure trend of public sentiment; for law is but the reflex of public sentiment, and can be no stronger than that sentiment.

It matters not how much men point to the Constitution of the general commonwealth, and to the organic laws of each State, as guarantees of personal liberty of conscience, so long as the tendency of public sentiment is toward the legal enforcement of religious dogmas. The words of Justice Brewer in another part of the speech alluded to, are to the point on this:—

> You may fill your statutes with all the provisions that the mind of man can conceive of guaranteeing personal liberty; but unless you have back of those statutes a universal public opinion, thundering "Stop!" in the ear of every trespasser upon such liberty, you may find within the forms of law the most abject personal servitude.

Although these words were used more particularly with reference to the effect of labor strikes, they apply just as forcibly to the religious phase of public sentiment. And just as long as a single person, though the humblest and weakest in all the land, may not freely and fully follow the dictates of conscience in religious duties—so long as said duties do not lead to infringement of others' personal rights—just so long is personal liberty an unaccomplished fact in the United States of America.
