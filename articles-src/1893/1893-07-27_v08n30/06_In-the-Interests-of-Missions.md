The story of modern missions has many times recorded how men of faith in the promises have refused to formulate the Lord and put their trust in earthly convenience or power of danger, and have found the God of Ezra their God. Of the fact which the proclamation at the river of Alva, Ezra has left this testimony as a lesson to the gospel worker in all its professions.

For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen, etc. In every country in the way, because we had spoken unto the king saying, the hand of our God is upon them for good that seek him, but his power and wrath is against all them that forsake him, etc.—Ezra viii, 22, 23.

In India the triumphs of missions began amidst the opposition of the government. Under the name of "missionary in India," they have to face from the forbidding of a government alien from virtually the first. So far as it has been absolutely successful, it has helped the cause of missions by presenting civil order, the object to which all missionaries in dispute or distinction. Thus, an Indian official of thirty years standing, Sir Charles Wood, made and said recently in the Church Missionary Society.

By firmly adhering to the principle that our influence over a native for a complete understanding reception of the gospel in the hearts and consciences of the native.

Inconveniently enough, some Church people have been the greatest opponents of this just principle. This writer further says:—

It is not lawful for us as officials to employ the civil authority in any way against the tenets of which we have received authority. These are the truths which our rulers ought to be credited: that they do not be preserved; that no have been placed here in order to enforce what we ourselves see in the Bible; that the consciences of the people who have more certainly concern ought to have insisted that the Bible is meant to be a rule of the individual soul's relation to its God, then no officer, however zealous, may go so far as this; which would, in our opinion, constitute a breach of faith with other churches and weapons, for fighting our names from.

Wherever the administration has departed from this principle, instead of favoring the true cause of missions, it has hindered it. More than one instance might be given of this. Let us note one, which has very recently been closely emancipated. In the old established rule of 1854, Sir Charles Wood said of the government schools:—

These institutions were founded for the benefit of the native populations of India, and it is the education concerned in them should be exactly the best qualified for that useful purpose.

Places of worship may be so changed by legal act; it granted government aid to private schools, or of both native, as well as other schools were allowed to participate in this grant. The conditions being made for the benefit of these institutions and through the influence of missions that did stop short that none. Although it was said to keep Hindus and Mahomedans to receive the same body, in the natives of the case there is very little use of the law ever made by them. What has been the influence of this? We will let evangelical workers, to speak from personal knowledge, tell and to me.

At the recent session of the Missionary Conference in Bombay, the following resolution was adopted. The missionaries tried to get the assembly to protest against the government licensing of

so-called, and failed, although this moralization has grown to be a second department of State. The reason for the failure is thus stated by Dr. Henry Venn, the well-known English evangelist, who wrote to the *Missionary Review of the World.*

No man can speak out persistently and commonness of these persons who neither realize or can raise it in favor of a conspiracy of silence that the professors of certain Christian colleges simply do nothing, because the government grants them aid, and then take a strong stand against the wrong otherwise.

Of the work done in these colleges, which give a power in its days of their establishment, he says, "Cases of God's commanding to God are new, and growing, in order to parental position or work of something known." D. Pelton Hall, the editor, a meeting of Christian workers who are called to review the articles of the Mission Colleges and Churches, in their relationship to the London Missions, Hugh Goldie wrote:—

It is clear that the real hindrance in India lies in that of the denominations who are holding official positions, and who come in contact with government officials.

And Dr. Petterson, who has been in and in India, speaking of the work of the college, which is under a Christ, we are educating Brahmins to be our enemies. We want leaders not officials. One-half of our college work might well be given up.

This, in mission fields is being repeated the sin and error of Church and State alliance, who have succeeded in undermining the power of the Church that has been the history of such unions in all times and all. God forbid that the park and the Church of the nineteenth century should fail to profit by the principles of the gospel from the principles to put their trust in prince of the faith in those that abide by the faith have with them a stronger than that. "If God be for you, who can be against you," and "lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."

not be contained by Christian money, and not be under the direction of Christian institutions in any manner.—*St. Louis Advocate.*
