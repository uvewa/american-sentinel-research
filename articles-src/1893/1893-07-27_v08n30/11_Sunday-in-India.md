## Sunday in India.

The *Bombay Guardian* of May 6 says that "a Lord's Day Union for India has been formed in Calcutta, through a provisional committee appointed by the Calcutta Missionary Conference. The constitution is drafted, and is in process of revision. The central committee, which consists of seventeen Calcutta Christians appointed by the provisional committee, will meet one month hence to take final action in the matter. Among the items suggested is a 'Sabbath Creed Card,' being a simple statement of belief in the sanctity and value of the Sabbath, and a promise to keep it holy. This card will be widely circulated, particularly among the young. In all the principal centres of India, vice-presidents of the Lord's Day Union will be nominated, who, it is expected will become presidents of Auxiliary Unions in their own localities. When the list is completed, their names as well as names of other officers of the Union will be made public."

Of course this movement, like all others in the interest of Sunday observance, means not simply encouragement for the stricter observance of Sunday by professed Christians, but compulsion for those who do not profess to be Christians, or who, being professed Christians, do not see the connection between Christianity and Sunday-keeping. And thus the work of substituting a gospel which is but the power of man, for the only true Gospel, which is the power of God, goes on throughout the world.—*Present Truth*, London.
