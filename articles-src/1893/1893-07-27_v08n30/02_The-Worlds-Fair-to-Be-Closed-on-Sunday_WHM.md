## The World's Fair to Be Closed on Sunday.

AFTER all the vicissitudes through which the discussion of Sunday closing of the World's Fair has passed, the local directory has determined to close the gates on the first day of the week. The decision has been arrived at from financial reasons. The Sunday attendance at the Fair has never been large and has gradually decreased. The last open Sunday, July 16, at which time there was a special call made for a large attendance for charitable reasons, the entire proceeds being devoted to the benefit of the families of the firemen who lost their lives at the burning of the cold storage building, the turn-stiles registered only a few more than 49,000 visitors.

The directors have been successful in the courts, both in the case brought by the Government to enjoin them from Sunday opening, which has been quoted from previously, and in the suit brought by Wanamaker & Brown for the same purpose. This last suit Judge Jenkins dismissed, saying in the course of his opinion, "the United States has never attempted to pass a Sunday law applying to a district outside of its jurisdiction. That power lies with the State. If this Exposition has broken a State law it must answer to the State of Illinois if required to do so, but it does not lie within the province of a shareholder to assert the majesty of violated laws in such a case, his property rights not being hereby involved."

This decision of Judge Jenkins as well as that of Chief Justice Field, in both of which the right of the directory to manage its own business seems to be upheld, has been looked upon by several writers, and very strongly upheld in editorials as a vindication of religious liberty in this country and an assertion of the constitutional rights of conscience. But this is an error; both decisions are clearly in defense of the principles of State rights, but the propriety of the original Act of Congress, for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, has not been questioned in either of them, and it still stands and will stand as an unrepealed precedent.

The final agitation of the Sunday question was opened by the National Commission, which, when the case was brought to a vote before them, placed themselves on record for Sunday closing by a vote of 54-6. The commissioners then appointed a committee of four to confer with the Council of Administration and the local directory and urge upon them a strict compliance with the rule requiring the gates to be closed on Sunday. This was brought before the directors in the following resolutions which were carried by a vote of 24-4.

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors at a regulamenting heretofore held to wit, May 16, 1893, adopted certain resolutions providing for the opening of the Exposition on Sunday, in response to urgent appeals from persons and organizations representing a large majority of the public, as well as from stockholders of the corporation, and also in accordance with a resolution adopted by the city Council of the city of Chicago, representing the financial interests of the said city in the said Exposition to the amount of $5,000,000. and,

WHEREAS, this action has been sustained by the United States Court of Appeals and the right and power of directors to control the physical administration of the Exposition on Sundays as well as on other days of the week, has been upheld by the final decree of the said court; and,

WHEREAS, it now appears by actual admissions that the general public does not by its attendance manifest a desire that the said Exposition should be kept open to the public each day of the week; and it further appearing that if the Exposition is kept open on Sunday it will require the attendance of more than 16,000 laboring men and women, the employés of the Exposition and others, including the curators and clerks of the exhibitors; and while the Exposition authorities can give its own employes one day of rest out of each week, it seems impracticable for the exhibitors and others to provide for their own clerks and employés, and,

WHEREAS, it further appears that the number of laboring men and women whose services will be required to keep the Exposition open on Sunday is disproportionate to the number of visitors on said days, and therefore the interests of the public are not promoted by keeping the Exposition open on each and every day of the week. Now, therefore, be it—

Resolved, That all the said resolutions so adopted on the 16th day of May, 1893, and the amendments to the rule relative thereto, adopted on said day, save and except the prices of admission, be, and the same are hereby rescinded, to take effect after the 16th inst.; and, be it further—

Resolved, That a certified copy of the foregoing preamble and resolutions be transmitted to the National Commission and the Council of Administration.

It will be seen that the apparent reason in the last resort is financial, but it is one with which the most enthusiastic Sunday closers seem to be content. It is the one great reason which was advanced in the Wanamaker case against the World's Fair; the plea being made that an injunction should be granted against Sunday opening because of the fact that the stockholders interests were jeopardized thereby. This has been the argument which the Sunday closers have of late used most vehemently: that the amount necessary for the return of the souvenir coin appropriation to the Government would not be equalled by the Sunday gate receipts and financial loss would therefore result. It is probable, in fact quite evident, that notwithstanding almost all the different religious organizations throughout the country have weakened as to the threatened boycott which they declared would be instituted, yet they have quietly and unofficially followed, as nearly as possible, the original course marked out and have used all their influence against attendance upon the Fair, especially upon Sunday, and have thus succeeded in some degree in reducing the receipts of the Fair. They have also quietly worked to secure as large a percentage of Sunday observance as could be obtained among the exhibitors at the Fair, as is witnessed by the number of covered exhibits and the double page advertisement of the lists of exhibitors covering their exhibits on Sunday which appeared in one of the Chicago papers, which has given itself to the furtherance of Sunday closing from the beginning. Several of the prominent promoters of the Sunday movement throughout the country have been in Chicago for the past two weeks quietly using their influence and working toward the end which has been accomplished. They have made large promises, as it has been reported, as to the increased attendance at the Fair which will be brought about by Sunday closing, and have pledged all their influence and their utmost endeavors in the matter of the furtherance of excursions and lower railroad rates, and the favor of the religious element throughout the country, to give the Fair a great and marvelous success. It may seem a little late for them to promise this, and somewhat as if they were taking advantage of something which was already assured in making such promises; for in spite of all the difficulties under which it has labored, the Fair is already an unquestioned success. It may be, nevertheless, that the continuation of Sunday closing throughout the remainder of the period of the Fair will be conditioned somewhat upon how fully the Sunday closers keep their pledges. If toward the close of the Exposition there should be a large demand for Sunday opening, and evidences that the Fair would be largely attended on Sunday, it may again be open. The directory has demonstrated to its own satisfaction, the possibility of ordering the business affairs of the Exposition to suit itself, and may now be expected to take such a course as seems to it most advisable and profitable.

In this whole matter, the Sunday closing element has gained but a sorry victory; yet, although by no means satisfactory to them, it is beyond their knowledge a victory. As much has been accomplished as it is likely ever will be accomplished—that is, the Government has been committed to the form of religious legislation. While they have failed most ignominiously of the strict enforcement which they desired to obtain, they have gained a technical victory. Their success, no doubt, always, will be in special and particular cases rather than general, and wherever a sweeping observance of religious law is gained, it will be for reasons of policy and financial interest, as in this case. This may well be taken as an evidence of the progress of religious legislation and the course which it will take in the future. It is both a type and a prophecy.

Chicago, July 17.
