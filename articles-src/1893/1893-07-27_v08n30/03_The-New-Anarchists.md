## The New Anarchists.

The ardent supporters of the "American Sabbath" had much to say about the duty of obeying the "law" and the "court," when the decision in regard to "Sunday opening" was in their favor. They declared that those who would attempt to disobey or in any way nullify the action of the court, were anarchists and opponents of good government. But no sooner was there a decision of another and a higher court, allowing the gates to be opened, than they showed their insincerity and utter contempt for the ruling of the court by denouncing the judge, and proclaiming and urging all to adopt that meanest and most despicable of all weapons, the "boycott." A large congregation of this new kind of "anarchists" at Winfield, Kans., June 25, passed a series of resolutions, the last part of the last one calling upon the management of the Fair "to return to Sabbath closing, which is required by commercial honor whatever the decisions or divisions or doing of the courts."

By this it may be seen that these great friends of law and order (?) are very loyal to the law and strong supporters of the court, when it harmonizes with their views. But let the court once have the temerity to render a decision inimical to their peculiar interest, as the self-constituted custodians of the Nation's welfare, and they have no more respect for it than they have for the composition of a schoolboy.

When it is in their favor, it must be regarded; when opposed, it is to be disregarded, and others are urged to throw contempt upon it. Thus they are bound to have things their own way "whatever the decisions . . . of the courts." The cry of "anarchy" comes with very poor grace from such persons.—*Advent Review and Sabbath Herald.*
