REFERRING to the *Mail and Express*, the *World*, in its issue of July 16, says:—

> The Evening Pearsese derives much comfort from the fact that the World's Fair is to be closed on Sunday because it doesn't pay to keep it open at full rates for half a Fair. It makes the sapient observation that "it has been demonstrated that the American people still believe in the preservation of the American Sabbath."

Oh! do they? Suppose you send one reporter to the churches of New York to-day and another—if you think it won't imperil his soul—to Coney Island, and tell your readers how the people observe the institution which you call "the American Sabbath," meaning the obsolete Puritan Sunday.

Cast your eye on the shores and waters of the Bay and the Sound; visit Central Park at the hour for music; go to the summer gardens in the city and to the far finer and better free fields and woods of the country, and observe how American citizens seek and take needed rest and innocent recreation on the first day of the week.

If you fail to find here many signs of what you call "the American Sabbath," make an honest inspection of Chicago and its environs after the Fair shall be closed and tell us if you think the cause of religion, of morality or of education has gained by the barring of the gates through a false economy.

The *World* is quite right. The small Sunday attendance proves nothing under the circumstances except that the people are not willing to pay full price for less than half a show. The false claim as to the significance of Sunday closing is a fitting finale to the means used from start to finish to secure it.
