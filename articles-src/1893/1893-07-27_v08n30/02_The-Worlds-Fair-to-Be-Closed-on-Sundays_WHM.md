AFTER all the vicissitudes through which the alternation of Sunday closing of the World's Fair has passed, the local directory has finally given orders to close on the first day of the week. The decision this time has been arrived at from commercial reasons. The Sunday attendance at the Fair has never been large and has gradually decreased. The last open Sunday, July 9, at which time there was a special call made for a large attendance for charitable reasons, the entire proceeds being donated to the families of the firemen who lost their lives at the cold storage fire, less than seventy thousand turn-stile registered only a few more than the first open Sunday.

The directors have been mournful in their losses, both in the case brought by the Government to enjoin them from Sunday opening, which has been quoted from previously, and in the suit brought by Mrs. Stickney of Borrow for the same purpose. This last suit Judge Jenkins dismissed, using in the course of his decision, "the United States has never acquired to put a Sunday law applying equally a power lies with the State. If this Exposition company is amenable in this answer to the State of Illinois it required the assent of that State to change a provision of a shareholder to assert the majority of vested lien in such a case, his property right not being hereby invaded."

This decision of Judge Jenkins as well as that of Judge Fuller, in both of which the right of the directory to manage its own business without let or hindrance has been looked upon by several writers, and very strongly upheld; to editorialize as applying the rights of minorities in this country and an assertion of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of individual and an error; both decisions are clearly in defence of these great principles; but they lost the propriety of the original Act of Congress; or for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, has not been questioned in either of them, and it still stands and will stand as an unrepealed precedent.

The result is not due in any manner to the desire of the directory to cater to the large constituency of Christian people who did not believe in opening the gates on Sunday. It was merely a commercial transaction. It didn't pay to keep it open on Sunday, and so it is to be closed.—*Cols. Sol. Smith.*

By this it may be seen that those great friends of law and order (!) are very loyal to the law and strong supporters of the court, when it harmonizes with their views. But let the court once have the boldness to render a decision inimical to their peculiar interest, as the self-constituted custodians of the Nation's welfare, and they have no more respect for it than they have for the composition of a school-boy.

When it is in their favor, it must be respected even at the muzzle of the musket; against, and cities are urged to throw aside its mandates as puerile. The people should be to have things their own way "whatever the decisions" of the courts.

The cry of "anarchy" comes with very poor grace from such persons.—*Review and Sabbath Herald.*

following resolutions which were carried by a vote of 22-4.

Whereas, the Board of Directors at a regular meeting held on July 10, 1893, adopted certain resolutions providing for the open Sunday of the World's Columbian Exposition, and said resolutions have been protested against by a large majority of the public, as well as by a large proportion of the press, and

Whereas, the Sunday experiment has been attended with almost no financial success, and

Whereas, the Local Council of the city of Chicago, representing over 1,200,000 of population, has refused to make an appropriation of $100,000 conditioned upon Sunday closing; now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That we, the members of the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition, exercise our power of directors to control the gates of the Exposition during the period of the Fair. Be it further

Resolved, That we hereby request the Local Directory to rescind said resolution of the Board of Directors, and to enforce the original decree of the said court; and

Resolved, That this Board request of the Executive Committee and the local directory that the said general public does not by its representatives express its wish for Sunday opening, and that the majority of persons representing the religious conscience of this country should be heard and not be ignored; and further

Resolved, That the Exposition authorities who have been entrusted with the exposition of the achievements of the century should obey and enforce the aforesaid legal decree, and it is further appearing that if the Exposition be not opened upon Sunday, with or without admission fee, that the local city governments or the proper officials of the Exposition and other authorities will not act in regard to keeping all saloons or other like places closed on that day; the Exposition authorities can give the public access to the grounds Sunday, free or otherwise, and to limit the scope of same the employees for their own civic ends and rights; and this board requests the Executive Committee and local directors to keep the Exposition open on Sunday if the Exposition cannot be properly managed and run upon that day, and there the interests of the exhibitors and their employees and of the public be best served by keeping the Exposition closed on Sunday.

Being That all the said resolutions as adopted do not in any way change the attitude of this Board as to the rule relative thereto, adopted on said 14th day of September, 1892; but that this Board and the same are hereby forestalled, to take effect from and after Monday, July 31, 1893.

The first five resolutions are perhaps as grandiose resolutions as the stately Board of Lady Managers has ever adopted; but the sixth is the real thing.

It will be seen that the apparent reason in the last resort is financial, but it is equally apparent that the motive and intent of the Sunday closers is religious. In the Vanderwerker case against the World's Fair; the plea being made that the Fair was run "without profit," the Sunday opening because of the fact that the attendance was small was strenuously denied. This has been the argument used most strongly in Congress, and used most vehemently that if the gates are opened the management will so greatly impoverish the company that the latter cannot return appropriation to the Government. Sunday gate receipts and financial figures are cited against the Fair people. It is in fact quite evident, that notwithstanding all these declarations of financial deficiency, institutions throughout the country closed on weekdays so the workmen themselves could go on Sundays and be counted. At any rate they have quietly and unsuccessfully followed the financial argument and narrow market cut and have set all their influence and their money against the Fair, especially upon Sunday, and have succeeded in keeping the crowd away. These are the receipts of the Fair. They have been as quietly worked to secure a large percentage of Sunday observance as could be claimed also the exhibitors are willing, as is witnessed by the number of exhibits closed on Sunday and the judge has the authorities, of the lists of exhibitors willing that exhibit on Sunday which appeared as the names of manufacturers who have given itself to the fruitfulness of Sunday closing of the Fair. There can be no doubt the prominent promoters of the Sunday movement throughout the country have been in Chicago for the past two weeks quietly using their influence and working toward the end which has been accomplished. They have made large promises, and it has been reported, as to the increased attractions at the Fair which will be brought about by Sunday closing, and have pledged all their influence and their utmost endeavors in the matter of the furtherance of excursions and lower railroad rates, and the favor of the religious element throughout the country, to give the Fair their patronage.

It may seem a little late for them to thus come in with aid to a Fair that has been taking advantage of something which they are already assured in its making such promises; for in spite of all the difficulties under which it has labored, the Fair is an unquestioned success. It may be, nevertheless, that the continuance of Sunday closing throughout the remaining period of the Fair will be conditioned somewhat upon how fully the Sunday closers keep their pledges toward the close of the Exposition there should be a large demand for Sunday opening, and evidence that the Fair would be largely attended on Sunday, it would go far to prove that the Fair has demonstrated to its own satisfaction, the fact that Sunday opening pays. But the forces of the Exposition to suit itself, and that would be the natural and proper course as seems to it most advisable and best calculated to save the greatest profit.

In this whole matter, the Sunday closers have gained; but a sorry victory; yet, although by no means sufficient to them, it has been a genuinely inglorious victory. As much has been accomplished—that is, the Government has been committed to the force of religious legislation. While they have failed most completely of the great effect before which they expected to close all places of business which they expected to control. They have gained a sectional victory. Their principles and particular cause rather than general, and however somewhat the basis of any religious law is gained, it will be an evidence of the process of religious legislation and the courses which it will take in the future. It is both a precedent and a prophecy.
