THE editor of the *Christian Statesman* says: "We frequently hear of a minister going to the pulpit from a Sunday train. Why not prelude the sermon with theft or adultery, or murder, the commands against which are in the same code and much briefer than the Sabbath law?" Mr. Crafts has asked the question; he ought to answer it. Why does he set at naught and utterly ignore the divine command of the Sabbath, which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath"? And why does he without a shadow of divine authority keep Sunday, stealing for it the name given by God himself to the seventh day? And why does he seek to bind the consciences of men to this day by unwarranted assumptions, and their bodies by civil laws?
