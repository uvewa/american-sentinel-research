A RECEIVER or stockholder who thinks that the Georgia railroads are in the hands of a receiver because the frown of God is upon them for running Sunday trains. It is, of course, a little difficult to prove a negative in such a case, but this fine gentleman who advances the theory explain the accident to the Sunday school excursion train near East Aurora, N. Y., on Monday, the 17th inst., in which twenty-two persons were injured. Have Sunday schools become such wicked things that the Lord has to maim those who attend them? or was this particular school also sinful? And as this gentleman is so alert about it he might devote a little attention to the wail that demolished Sam Jones' institute, by law as preaching on a moral Sunday. It is preaching in a tent is also a thing also wicked?
