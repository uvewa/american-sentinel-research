## A Baptist on Religious Liberty.

No people in the early history of this country were made to feel in a most effectual manner the results of an intolerant religious bigotry more than the Baptists. They were regarded with perfect hatred by the New England Puritans, who nicknamed them "Anabaptists," and history records the fact that a certain "Rev." Thos. Shepard, of Charleston, in a sermon designed for the Governor and Magistrates, by way of information (?) delivered just after the banishment of Roger Williams, stated that "Anabaptists had ever been looked at by the godly leaders of this people as a scab," and the President of Harvard College said that "such a rough thing as a New England Anabaptist is not to be handled over tenderly." The persecutions and banishments that were inflicted on this people in the years that followed aroused them to a true sense of what religious liberty meant, and to them is due much for the stand that was taken through the efforts of Madison and Jefferson, which made this the first Government in all history that declared in favor of a total separation between the Church and State. But of late years, their voice has to a large degree been hushed, as it were, on this subject, and quite a large number of them are found enrolled with that class of religionists who are clamoring for a civil law to enforce the observance of Sunday as a day of worship. Indeed, at the attempted closing of Marlow Theater, in Chicago, last August, which was done largely at the instigation of the Baptists of the suburban town in which the theater was located, if the reports of the city papers at the time are to be relied upon, they showed forth a degree of religious intolerance scarcely to be credited to them. However, it is refreshing to know that not all of the denomination entertain this spirit, as witness the following from Rev. W. P. Throgmorton, of Ft. Smith, Arkansas, in the *Young People's Union*, as comments on the subject of Religious Liberty, which is the topic for the weekly prayer-meeting of July 2, and contains principles as sound as the gospel:—

> By this is to be understood liberty, so far as the State is concerned, to worship God as we may think right. Religious liberty means that no matter what my faith is or what my religious practice are, I shall not be interfered with by the State, so long as I do not interfere with the rights of my neighbor. Thank God we live in a country where religious liberty prevails. Baptists have always contended for this principle. Indeed, the time has been when in this they stood alone. There have been Protestant Christians who, while claiming religious liberty for themselves, were not willing to accord it to others. In Protestant England and in Protestant Germany, men and women in times past have been persecuted even unto death, because of their religious convictions. The first human government, at least in modern times, which allowed full religious liberty, was the Colony of Rhode Island, which was established under Baptist leadership. To the Baptists also is largely due the fact that religious liberty is provided for in our national Constitution. They have always maintained that in the eye of the State, Romanists, Protestants, Quakers, Jews and Infidels, should all stand as exactly equal, and should all have the fullest right to advocate and practice their peculiar sentiments. Hence, we would not, by any legal measure, hinder the building of Roman Church, or Jewish synagogue, or Infidel club hall. Let truth and error have equal showing, and there can be no fears as to the final result. If men teach error, if they blaspheme, if they deny Christ, vengeance is the Lord's; He will repay. Let the State keep hands off the conscience.

To which conclusion every Christian should say Amen. Truth needs no help from the civil arm. "Truth is mighty and will prevail."
