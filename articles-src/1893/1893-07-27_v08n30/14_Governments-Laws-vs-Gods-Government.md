GOVERNMENT'S laws is past age and seemed to dominate the results of conscience; the sceptre in the history of the Inquisition. The thumbscrew, the rack, and the fagot were the means; but every intelligent civil government has any jurisdiction whatsoever in religious things. The advocates of religious legislation may affirm that they would not carry it so far as that, but it is unpractical for them to begin without following the same road. It is far better to have the right to stop and turn about it without abandoning their theory. It is far better for those that we oppose all law-making on religious questions and controversies. It is for those reasons that we oppose Sunday laws. Sunday was not regarded as sacred; there would be no demand for laws enforcing its observance. It is not a physical rest but spiritual worship that is the object of Sunday laws. It is therefore a matter that the State has no right to touch. It is for this reason that we also oppose any and all Sunday laws.
