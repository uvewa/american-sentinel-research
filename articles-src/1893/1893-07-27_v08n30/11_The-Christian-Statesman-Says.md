THE *Christian Statesman* says: "A greater peril to the Sabbath, even than Sunday opening at Chicago, is the widespread Sabbath-breaking of Christians cheap and easy victory." It is a truly deplorable condition. The influence of Christian example upon secular affairs is one that cannot be defeated and divert so very generally disregard the Sabbath. Even the editors of the distresses observe another day and heap contempt on the day the Lord sanctified and blessed. It is little wonder that the flocks go astray when the shepherds wander from right paths. The widespread agitation of the Sabbath question is rapidly destroying regard for Sunday, for it is revealing the fact that it is without divine authority. But as this becomes more apparent the demand for human law to bolster the tottering institution becomes more imperative. Ephraim is joined to his idol.
