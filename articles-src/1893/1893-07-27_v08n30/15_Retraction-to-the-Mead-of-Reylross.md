Retraction to the *Mead of Reylross,* New World, its Issue of July 8, it says, in its editorial column:—

The *Evening Pressing* derives much comfort from the reflection that the first open Sunday of the Fair was a losing game financially. This is, of course, because it doesn't pay to keep it open at full price that in all the circumstances, the observation that "it has been demonstrated that the American people and citizens-loving institutions of the American Sabbath."

"Oh," they Suppress you and end one reporter to the churches of New York to-day and another—if you think it were in the name of Sunday go the nearest, and tell yourselves how the people observe the institutions which you call "the American Sabbath," meaning the genuine Puritan Sabbath. Cast your eye on the shores and waters of the bay and the Sound, vis Central Park at the hundreds; go to the summer gardens in the suburbs; pass through the rural communities of the country, and observe how American citizens spend the day that you call the "American Sabbath" on the first day of the week.

If you fail to find how many of what you call "the American Sabbath," make an honest inspection of Chicago and its suburbs after the

fair shall be closed and tell us if you find the name of religion, of morality or of education has gained by the barring of the gates through a false pretense.
