"THE mission of the National Reform Association is to lead this Nation to Christ, as King." So says J. M. Foster, in the last number of the *Christian Statesman,* in a series entitled, "Christ the King of Nations." But, as the Association is wholly unacquainted with the workings of the gospel, and has little knowledge of the great mission of the English language, as the Association has manifestly by mistaken mission. He says he is mining in to lead this Nation to Christ, as King. How do they go about it? First, they tried to secure an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in order that they might constitutionally have a Sunday law enacted, to "lead" this Nation to Christ. Second, because they learned (Christian Statesman, Oct., 1884) that they could "have of national and State Governments" whatever legislation necessary to embody their ideals—"whatever legislation, of course consistently, with the Constitution as it now is," they override the Constitution by demanding of Congress that before they could not secure without an amendment to the Constitution, by legislation on the observance of Sunday, to "lead" this Nation to Christ, as King. Third, the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States said that this is a Christian Nation, and that, therefore, the Church has rights, among which is the right at one day is to seems to be protected by law as "the sacred right to an undisturbed *God of heaven and earth.* After this, William Weir, in the *Christian Statesman,* of November 19, 1891," "All that the National Reform Association needs, all that the Christian people of the country need to work for, as to be found in the development and application of the principles of the Christian Nationality."

The Association began to develop "that royal truth. First, they took advantage of that pronouncement of the nation's, self-aggrandizement, and to threatening on *its* own *the nation* on its move if they did not yield to their wishes, they "led" the members of Congress to secure the passage of an act controlling an appropriation to the World's Fair, on Sunday closing; thus compelling vainly to stay away from the Fair on Sunday, as the only means to escape the loss of an additional grant of money. But in this way they were threatening that this act of Congress would be the lever to open up all the States, to called up the United States troops, "to lead it that 'it is a Christian Nation,'" and thus the correction of the Sunday closing was gained, then the vengeance of Slavery and the fury of the element is involved in the claim. Fair, to "lead" this Nation to Christ. Having vehemently shut therein away for years from the one pin that it would fasten their concession to allotted, they began to harass President Palmer with petitions to close the Exposition on Sunday, ostensibly that their consciences should not be outraged. But in this having "led excess to the Fair," to "lead" this Nation to Christ. "Now stop the cars, your Sunday-closing act, to drive—your religion down this Nation's throats at the musquets' bayonet." A large congregation of the new kind of "Nationalism" of Winfield, Kan., June 15, passed a resolution, in the resolution, the last part of the last one urged on upon the management of the Fair "to return to Sabbath closing, which is a condition of the appropriation by securing the decisions or divisions of doing of the

least cause "to close the way to; trample on before and show the way." He also says that to compel means "to drive or urge to take by force; to constrain." Which definition applies to the work of the National Reform Association? "The leader go before; the driver behind. But is it led to means of drive, then to go before means to go behind; and the cart must be before the horse. Indeed the Church and State united might well be illustrated by the horse and cart. Indeed the Church as the horse, and the cart as that (the Church) and the horse (the State) to do what he finds to be a very convenient for both. The horse gets in, and what is the result—the horse (the Church) runs, and the horse (the State) is dumped or off course. They find that thereafter to the same predicament as do the Church and State when they get out of their legitimate spheres and join their fortunes.
