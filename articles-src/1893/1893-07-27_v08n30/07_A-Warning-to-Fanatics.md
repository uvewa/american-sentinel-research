## A Warning to Fanatics.

A FANATICAL Sabbatarian meeting was held in Boston, a couple of months ago, to protest against Sunday opening of the World's Fair. A preacher who was present in an official capacity introduced to the audience Congressman "Sunrise Stove Polish" Morse as a speaker "who would call down fire from heaven" on the World's Fair unless its gates should be hermetically sealed on the Sabbath. It was at the same meeting that another pulpit-shrinker said the troops should be called out to shoot the people who sought to enter the Fair gates on Sunday. Whether the World's Fair should be open Sunday or not is a question not to be decided by such exhibitions of fanaticism.

The malignant impiety of these fanatics must have received something like a rebuke, if not a shock, by the terrible catastrophe last Monday at the World's Fair grounds. Fire did not descend from heaven, but it was kindled by natural cause in a building within the walls, and the loss of life in the flames was appalling, while the torture from physical injuries caused by the fire was terrible. The survivors of the disaster suffered more than the agonies of death, as they were rescued from the flames, fire-blasted, with broken limbs, crushed and maimed, many of them, for life. It was this awful disaster which the alleged Christian gospel meeting at Boston invoked on the Fair.

Yet the judgment of these ultra-righteous people went wildly astray. It was not World's Fair property that was destroyed, nor World's Fair people responsible for Sunday opening, who perished in this holocaust, or whose burned and lacerated remnants of humanity were carried to the hospitals. The burned warehouse did not belong to the Fair corporation. The property belonged to private owners. Though inside the Fair grounds, it was closed for business on Sunday. The fire did not occur on Sunday, but on a week day. The victims of the fire were the men hired by the city of Chicago as members of its fire department. They died in the discharge of their desperate duty as the soldiers of the union died in battle during the war. The most precious sacrifice of human life is that which occurs when a man dies to secure the safety of others, or when he dies in a sacred cause. The last fluttering breath of each man who died in the fire at Jackson Park is a more acceptable offering to Heaven than all the prayers that ever proceeded from the lips of the Boston religious fanatics whose incendiary impression on the World's Fair is recalled by this awful event.—*Chicago Herald.*
