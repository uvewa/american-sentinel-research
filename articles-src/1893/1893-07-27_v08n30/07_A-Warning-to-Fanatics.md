A FANATICAL Sabbatarian meeting was held in Batavia, a couple of months ago, to protest against Sunday opening of the World's Fair. A preacher who was present read in its official capacity introduced to the audience Congressman "Sunrise Steve Posken as a minister" who appeared to call down fire from heaven on the World's Fair unless its gates should be closed on Sunday. The Hon. Mr. Posken was at the same meeting that another pillar of the church was said to have actually called out to shout the people who sought the Sabbath closing of the Fair gates. Whether the World's Fair should be open Sundays or not is a question not to be decided by such exhibitions of fanaticism. The malignant impiety of those fanatics must have received something like a response, if not a rebuke, by the frightful catastrophe last Monday at the World's Fair grounds. Fire did not descend from heaven, but it was kindled by natural cause in a building within the walls, and destroyed a number of men of its firemen's doing, while the toilers from physical injuries, while the burns of the victims or survivors of the disaster suffered more than the agonies of death, as they were

rescued from the flames, fire-blistered, with broken limbs, crushed and mutilated, many of them, for life. It was this awful fire after which the alleged Christian admirers of the god of the Sabbath who thus fanned the meeting at Boston invoked on the Fair.

The reason for the failure of this particular part of the movement to close the Fair's Sunday opening, is the same as that of others who have tried to coerce people into Sunday-keeping. The reason for its failure in the case is the same as that of every other forced religion. Its real motive is not the welfare of the people, but the maintenance of a system. The Fair property that was destroyed in the fire was built with money contributed to it by the poor and the rich. Those who were the victims were plain, working men who came to maintain their families. They had no interest in the Sunday question on the ecclesiastical side. They wanted to visit the Fair for Sunday opening and the most compelling reason came from the fact that they could not come on the week-day—these industrial thousands of humanity were given but Sunday to enjoy the privileges of the Fair, and more did come. These were people who otherwise would not have been able to visit the Fair at all. And these are the people who the fanatics would shut out.—*Chicago Tribune.*

Though in this the Fair grounds, they came and found for themselves. Still, the fire did not occur on Sunday, but on a week day. The notice of the fire was the most hated by the city of Chicago as well as by the Fair people generally, when cited in the discharge of their absolutely solemn duty as citizens, the memory of those who gave their lives in trying to save the buildings of the exposition; and the saving of much money in the course of doing so was reduced. The most precious kind of funeral rites, like that in which at the hands of those who stood forth at risk of their own lives to rescue, the bodies were recovered. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." We stand amazed at the enthusiasm and faithful heroism of these men. The faithful fireman, Marshall B. Davis, who died in his fire at Jackson Park was perhaps the most heroic figure during the entire series of events. His courage and all the prayers ever proceeded from the lips of those who prayed that the Fair and its people be closed, the whole of that nation whose increasing mortality makes the World's Fair imploring the protection of these from the god of the Sabbath.—*Chicago Herald.*
