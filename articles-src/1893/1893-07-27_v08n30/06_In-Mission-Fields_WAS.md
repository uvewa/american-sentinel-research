## In Mission Fields.

WHILE in this country certain Church leaders have been working to get the State committed to the policy of making it easy for men to be "Christians," so called, by making it very dangerous for them to be anything else, it is not surprising that the same principle should be working in mission fields. The evangelical fervor and piety which have led many to foreign service, and the circumstances under which they have labored, have saved them from trusting in the arm of flesh; but here and there are evidences of a falling away from the principles of the gospel which can only lead to the dishonoring of the name of Christ.

In last month's *Missionary Review of the World*, Dr. Cyrus Hamlin has an article on the relation of foreign missionaries to their governments, in which he says:—

> It has been a principle of action rather than of statute that the foreign missionary must take his chance and must expect little aid, when in difficulty and danger, from his government. This, however, is peculiarly an American view. No one of the great governments of Europe, Catholic or Protestant, ever asserts it or acts upon it. It is an unsafe principle, and should be made un-American.

Dr. Hamlin is a veteran missionary, and his name an honored one in the annals of missions. This does not establish the soundness of his proposition, however, which must be weighed in the light of the principle involved rather than in that of some immediate and temporal advantage which might be gained by the missionary in danger. Dr. Hamlin himself entered the mission field in Turkey in the days when governmental interposition on the part of the United States in behalf of its missionaries was even less common than now, and those were days of greater power in mission work than the present.

Among other instances, Dr. Hamlin cites the example of England in sending an army into Abyssinia to rescue an English missionary and other prisoners held by the king. "The army accomplishes this," he says, "and also killed Theodore and destroyed his capital, Magdala." This action must have impressed the Abyssinians with the majesty of British citizenship, but it is surely not argued that it advanced the cause which the missionary had at heart, the conversion of Theodore and his capital. Such action on the part of a government as a policy of State, under treaty obligation, is one thing, but to call for such intervention or approve of it as a missionary policy is an entirely different matter.

The triumphs of the cross in heathen lands have been won by men who put their lives in the hands of those for whose souls they prayed and worked, trusting the God whose voice more than many times has said to fierce and barbarous hearts, "Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm." Sometimes, it is true, the Lord has allowed life to be taken, and then the blood of martyrs has been the seed of the Church, and savage natures have been won to Christ by the patient sufferings of those whom they persecuted. How different the situation when heathen peoples understand that behind the missionary are the bayonet and the cannon. He then loses his distinctive character as an ambassador of Heaven, and becomes in the eyes of the people, and in fact, the semi-official representative of a foreign religion.

For this reason the missionary of apostolic mold, not only does not ask protection of his home government, but protests against it. Here is one of the paragraphs in the prospectus of the Soudan and Upper Niger Mission, signed by its late heroic founders, Brooke and Robinson, which breathes genuine Christian courage, and sets forth the true principle of the gospel worker:—

> POLITICAL STATUS.—As the missionaries enter the Moslem States under the necessity of violating the law of Islam, which forbids any one to endeavor to turn Moslems to Christ, they could not, under any circumstances, ask for British intervention to extricate them from the dangers which they thus call down upon themselves. But also, for the sake of the natives who have to be urged to brave the wrath of man for Christ's sake, it is necessary that the missionaries should themselves take the lead in facing these dangers; and should, in every possible way, make it clear to all that they do not desire to shelter themselves, as British subjects, from the liabilities and perils which would attach to Christian converts from Mahommedanism in the Soudan. They will, therefore, voluntarily lay aside all claim to protection, as British subjects, and place themselves, while outside British territory, under the authority of native rulers."

The appeal to government, it is sometimes argued, is justified by Paul's assertion of Roman citizenship and his appeal to Cesar. But Paul never appealed to Cesar for protection, nor did he ever, in all his persecutions by the people, ask the intervention of law in his behalf. It was only when he was a prisoner of the law, by no act of his own, that he demanded his right to be tried according to law, and when he appealed to Cesar, it was, he says, "not that I had aught to accuse my nation of." Now, in Asia Minor, in the same region in which the apostle labored and suffered joyfully, if religious prejudice leads a mob to persecute or destroy missionary property, it has become the fashion to appeal to the home governments to demand of the Turkish authorities reparation for property injured and the punishment of the offenders. In apostolic days the Christians "took joyfully the spoiling of their goods." One can hardly be said to take the spoiling of his goods joyfully, for the sake of Christ, when he seeks to recover them at the law and punish the offender. We have only to read the Acts of the Apostles to see that this kind of missionary work falls far short of the apostolic model, and for that reason of apostolic power. They received their commission from Heaven and asked no earthly power to support them, and they loved those who were their enemies for Christ's sake, and sought their conversion rather than their punishment.

The story of modern missions has many times recorded how men of faith in the promises have refused to forsake the Lord and put their trust in earthly power in time of danger, and have found the God of Ezra their God. Of the fast which he proclaimed at the river of Ahava, Ezra has left this testimony as a lesson to the gospel worker in all time:—

> For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying: The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. So we fasted and besought our God for this; and he was intreated of us. Ezra P. 22, 23.

In India the triumphs of missions began amidst the opposition of the government. Latterly, the cause of missions in India has had more to fear from the friendship of government than formerly from its enmity. So far as it has been absolutely neutral, it has helped the cause of missions by preserving civil order, the object to which all government is divinely ordained. Thus, an Indian official of thirty years' service, W. Mackworth Young, said recently in the *Church Missionary Intelligencer*:—

> By firmly adhering to the principle that the weapons of the State may not be used in matters of conscience it has prepared the way for the willing reception of the gospel in the hearts and consciences of the people of this land.

Inconsistently enough, some Church people have been the greatest opponents of this just principle. This writer further says:—

> It is not lawful for us as officials to employ the organization of the State for influencing the consciences of those over whom, for specific purposes, we have received authority. There are some who think that the official conscience on this matter is perverted; that we have been placed here in authority in order that we may use that authority for the dissemination of Christian truth; that government ought to have insisted that the Bible should be read in its schools; that caste ought to have been put down by law long ago. Perhaps not many go so far as this, which would, in my opinion, amount to making use of unlawful means, carnal weapons, for fighting our unseen foes.

Wherever the administration has departed from this principle, instead of favoring the true cause of missions, it has hindered it. More than one instance might be given of this. Let us take one, which has only recently been clearly emphasized. In the educational despatch of 1854, Sir Charles Wood said of the government schools:—

> These institutions were founded for the benefit of the whole population of India; and in order to effect their object it was and is indispensable that the education conveyed in them should be exclusively secular. The Bible is, we understand, placed in the libraries of the colleges and schools, and the pupils are free to consult it.

But the same despatch went beyond this. It granted government aid to private educational institutions, and the mission schools were allowed to participate in this State aid. Undoubtedly it was for the benefit of these institutions and through the influence of missions that this step was taken. Although it was open to Hindus and Mahommedans to receive the same help, in the nature of the case there is very little use of the favor made by them. What has been the influence of this? We will let evangelical workers, who speak from personal knowledge, tell it.

A few months ago, at the Decennial Missionary Conference in Bombay, the friends of social purity among the missionaries tried to get the assembly to protest against the government licensing of vice, and failed, although this scandalous business has grown to be a colossal department of State. The reason for the failure is thus stated by Mr. Henry Varley, the well-known English evangelist, who writes to the *Missionary Review of the World*:—

> No man can speak out persistently and courageously of these questions with ut running the risk of social ostracism. The voice of the "social set" in Bombay is in favor of a conspiracy of silence. Certain missionaries, ministers, and principals and professors of certain Christian colleges simply do not speak out. These institutions receive government money, and they cannot consistently do this and then take a strong stand against the wrongdoing of the government.

Of the work done in these colleges, which were a power in the days of their establishment, he says, "Cases of real conversion to God are rare, and training in order to pastoral position or work is scarcely known." In Exeter Hall, London, a meeting of Christian workers was called to review the attitude of the Missionary Conference, and according to a report in the *London Christian*, Hugh Price Hughes—

> Made it clear that the real hindrance in India lies with the missionaries who are in the more influential positions, and who come in contact with government officialism, and are leavened with its views.

And Dr. Pentecost, who has been in and out in India, speaking of the early workers in India, said:—

> They made converts to Christ; we are educating Brahmins to be our enemies. We want leaders not misleading of our missionaries. We must cut loose from government support, and our missionaries must be sustained by Christian money, and not be fettered for the sake of the few hundred thousand rupees received in grants from government.

Thus, in mission fields is being repeated the sad error of Church and State alliance, with the same weakening of the moral power of the Church that has been the history of such union in all time and all lands. God forbid that the rank and file of the missionaries laboring in the strongholds of paganism shall ever be held by false principles to put their trust in princes or lean upon earthly power. They of faith have with them a stronger than earthly power; for the promise is, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."
