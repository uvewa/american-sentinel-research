THE *Christian Advocate* tells of a woman in Baltimore who has succeeded in making a number of people believe that she is Jesus Christ. Well, there is nothing so very strange about that; millions of people believe just as absurd a thing, namely, that the commandment which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath," enjoins the keeping of the first day; and the editor of the *Advocate* is among the number. There is nothing more absurd than the popular belief in Sunday sacredness.
