A SECULAR paper remarks that "the seizure of an Aztec god at Xochilte, in Mexico, by a Catholic priest, has been stirred by the God's Indian devotees, who threaten to go on the war-path in his behalf. He is of stone, and in form is partly human, partly serpentine. We presume that the archbishop must have believed he had a right to seize the god of the Aztec religions; and yet it is a fact that, under the Constitution of Mexico, all religions are tolerated there, so that the Indians are as free to worship their god as the Chinese, for example, are to worship theirs." And then this paper

which is quite other than the Son of the city, shows its utter lack of appreciation of the real principle involved, by saying: "We do not see, however, that the Indians of Xochilte need to do battle for their god. They can make another."
