AT the late Fourth of July celebration at Woodstock, Conn., Justice Brewer spoke on Individual Liberty. Among other things he said:—

The most noticeable social fact of to-day is that the individual is being lost in the organization. It may seem a contradiction to say that whether or not may be to the result, good or bad, the fact is as I have stated. We know that the development of industrial forms of capital and labor is along the line of organization, corporations and trusts on the one hand and labor unions on the other, and that only through this movement are the great industrial enterprises of the day made possible. The Nation goes for all its benefits is the growing sense of individual responsibility. Legislation tends to make the liberty of the one something which the majority of others determine rather than something inherent.

Notwithstanding the speaker's apparent effort not to appear as an antagonist to organization he nevertheless said some things in connection with that that are worthy of attention. He said:—

The abandonment of the foregoing position should be speedily, in which religion should be speedily, in which secures the individual to the man, the right of individual self-assertion, and which may be ruthlessly trampled into the dust, because of innumerable numbers.

More truthful words, setting forth the dangers of the present social system, are seldom heard from the platform. But could not the same line of thought on the religious question of the day be used about with profit? Is it not true that the same tendencies exist in matters of religion, to a large extent? The ready demand for legislation on religious lines whenever any organization's interest is at stake, pointedly showing the bent of combined religious organizations to override the individual church belief. The argument, too, addressed to members of the different trade unions, is the same as that offered by labor combinations: men supposed hostile to the union—in which the majority seem willing to make the liberty into something which may be ruthlessly trampled into the dust.

This is exactly the present status of the Sunday question before the system of Presbyterians and Methodists. The combination of churches agree that the observance of Sunday ought to be enforced by law. The constituency of the denomination in several instances in the sustenance of their organization, and they, holding the majority, suppress those who do not coincide with the Church theory on the question. This is close, too,

without the least apparent regard to the inconvenience and trouble caused by their ill-advised movements. In this they deny to others what they themselves claim; namely, the right to believe as they will, and freely and freely their conscience in these matters. It is only because they see failure or loss to do it; that churches had assumed guardians of the public conscience stopping of trampling in the dust, alike, the liberty of the many to do as they will as well as of the many."

Is the difference, then, between the much talked of labor agitator, who obtains control of a man's business and labor, and the church, and religious monopolist who assumes to control a man's conscience by legal enactments, even to ruthlessly trampling into the dust the personal liberty of a few who may not be in accord with them? But we are defied to see by those people in what manner a Justice of a court may be in a good for these are restituted. But this pretense cannot cover the abolition of slavery in this country. Brethren, everybody knows that slave retention is not good for either the slave or his master, but there is no getting over the less assumption of the old slave-holding spirit. The very same arguments that were advanced in the days of slavery for the perpetuation of that institution are used now. Referring to the days of that fateful struggle,

In the ante-bellum days, we all remember how the preachers and churches of the South, nearly all of the large churches, endorsed and supported slavery. Support, with ordinary labor in times of great stress. And there were not wanting churches even in the North which endorsed it, and it was no so much better of than those left to its no much better or more patriotic than those who, producing the same spirit in time of the Nation's need, produced the same spirit as in the mind of the Nation.

And they are now the same everywhere, and they are using alternately the same arguments which closes this institution of slavery. Emancipation. Religious equality which when others in the Dark Age began to abolish human slavery produced an effect which resulted in the abolition of slavery. It was the argument used most strongly in Congress, and used most vehemently that if the gates are opened the management will so greatly impoverish the company that the latter cannot return appropriation to the Government.
