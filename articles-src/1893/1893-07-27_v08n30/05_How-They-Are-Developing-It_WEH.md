## How They Are Developing It.

"The mission of the National Reform Association is to lead this Nation to Christ, as King." So says J. M. Foster, in the *Christian Statesman* of July 8, in an article entitled, "Christ the King of Nations." Mr. Foster must either be wholly unacquainted with the workings of the Association, or must have made a gross misuse of the English language, or the Association has wonderfully mistaken its mission. He says its mission is to lead this Nation to Christ, as King. How do they go about it? First, they tried to secure an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in order that they might constitutionally have a Sunday law enacted, to "lead" this Nation to Christ. Then, because they learned (*Christian Statesman*, October 1, 1892) that they could "have of national and State Governments whatever legislation against immorality" (Sabbath breaking, of course they mean) they would "ask unitedly and earnestly," they overrode the Constitution, and secured just what they were convinced before they could not secure without an amendment to the Constitution—legislation on the observance of Sunday, to "lead (?) this Nation to Christ"! And after the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that this is a Christian Nation, and that, therefore, the Church has rights, among which is the right to one day in seven to be protected by law that it may be devoted to worship of the God of heaven and earth. After this, William Weir, in the *Christian Statesman* of November 19, 1892, said, "All that the National Reform Association seeks, all that this department of Christian politics works for, is to be found in the development of that royal truth, 'this is a Christian Nation.'"

They immediately began to develop "that royal truth." First, they took advantage of that propensity of human nature, self-aggrandizement, and by threatening not "to send them up" any more if they did not yield to their wishes, they "led" the members of Congress to secure the passage of an act conditioning an appropriation to the World's Fair, on Sunday closing; thus compelling visitors to stay away from the Fair on Sunday, to "lead" them to Christ! When there was indication that this act of Congress would not be complied with, they threatened to call up the United States troops, "to lead (?) this Nation to Christ"! Failing to secure the execution of the Sunday-closing act, then the vengeance of Heaven and the fury of the element is invoked on the Fair, to "lead" this Nation to Christ! Having voluntarily shut themselves away from the Fair on the plea that it would violate their consciences to attend, they began to harass President Palmer with petitions to close the Exposition on Sunday, ostensibly that their consciences might rest easy, and to "assure the highest success to the Fair," to "lead" this Nation to Christ. Oh! Congress, enforce your Sunday-closing act, to drive—your pardon, please—to "lead" this Nation to Christ.

A queer way to lead! Webster says to lead means "to show the way to; to guide; to go before and show the way." He also says that to compel means "to drive or urge; to take by force; to constrain." Which definition applies to the work of the National Reform Association? The leader must go before; the driver behind. But if to lead means to drive, then to go before means to go behind; and the cart must be before the horse. Indeed! the Church and State united might well be illustrated by the horse and cart. Instead of each keeping in its own place, the cart (the Church) asks the horse (the State) to get into the cart, and then it will be easier for both. The horse gets in, and what is the result? The cart (the Church) stops, and the horse (the State) is dumped out behind. They then find themselves in the same predicament as do the Church and State when they get out of their legitimate sphere and join their fortunes.
