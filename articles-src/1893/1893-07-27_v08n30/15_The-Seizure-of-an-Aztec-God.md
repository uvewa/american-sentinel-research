A SECULAR paper remarks that "the seizure of an Aztec god at Xohiltepec, in Mexico, by the Catholic Archbishop, has stirred up the god's Indian devotees, who threaten to go on the war-path in his behalf. He is of stone, and in form is partly human, partly aquiline. We presume that the archbishop must have believed he had a right to seize the god of the Aztec religion; and yet it is a fact that, under the Constitution of Mexico, all religions are tolerated there, so that the Indians are as free to worship their god as the Chinese, for example, are to worship theirs." And then this paper, which is none other than the *Sun* of this city, shows its utter lack of appreciation of the real principle involved, by saying: "We do not see, however, that the Indians of Xohiltepec need to do battle for their god. They can make another."
