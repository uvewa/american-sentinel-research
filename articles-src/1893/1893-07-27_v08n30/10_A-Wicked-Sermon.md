The following synopsis of a sermon is from the *Pittsburgh Press* of July 17:—

"The R. Squared, pastor of the Central or First Presbyterian Church, Allegheny, preached yesterday on 'Compulsory Sunday Rest.'

"There has been a most wonderful change in sentiment on this subject during the last few years. Men had over and over again avoided looking at it candidly, and it was only when the Fourth Commandment did it suddenly and by a decided vote of its legislature establish a weekly rest day. At a late meeting it brought to the subject to their attention at its every session were introduced bills designed to establish a modified form of the Continental Sunday, and of God in the holocaust and that they would be the institution for which it would be a burden, and man, being here by busyness for free themselves from the restraint of having to keep one day each week, they finally decide, Well, what day shall we go or take? Monday? Will this be any better than Sunday? In fact, is there any possible position for us but this one: to accept Sunday for what it has been and allow it to be the day of rest and worship together? No let us then take the connection." We must be careful in our issue of the term "compulsory rest." We must not compel people to take rest in a special way. We cannot compel men to attend on any religious institution or corporation as he may choose. Since the Pittsburgh press report of this sermon opens in the following paragraph: "The R. Squared pastor of the Central or First Reformed Presbyterian Church, Allegheny, during the city were gathered in the First Presbyterian Church, by force of the same municipal law which closed the gates, this awful catastrophe took place." The reverend advocate of compulsion in religion holds true. There had been a breach of faith on the part of the

Sunday such as would doom any man in business. The Fair was closed on Sunday, and it was shut. God was defied. A conditional Sunday was the only experiment left. And these people did not back the money given them by Congress on the other condition. And the first thing to do was to keep these people out of the saloon and to give the workingmen one day in seven, free from toil. The beer-gardens and kept aides dismead never thrive as they do when there is a great exposition in full swing to attract crowds on the open day. God's judgments were poured against them because it was violated.

It is enough to compare the opinion of the pastor with the Fair that which has been expressed by the Fair management.

In order to understand fully the wickedness of this sermon, it is important to know that the building that was burned was not open on Sunday. The dishonesty of the sermon lay in stating that the destruction of the burned building was on the part of the contractor who built it rather than by its destruction. The firemen who lost their lives had nothing to do with the opening of the Fair; and the contortions of the most respectable clergy who applauded the decision of the directory to close the gates on Sunday. There was simply no connection between the fire and Sunday opening. The World's Fair on a Sunday is closed.

Now the Fair management has decided to close the gates.

Sunday such as would doom any man in business, God was defied. A conditional Sunday was shut in order to keep on those people who came to the Fair. The beer-gardens and kept aides dismead never thriving as they do when there is a great exposition in full swing to attract crowds on the open day. God's judgments were poured against them because it was violated.
