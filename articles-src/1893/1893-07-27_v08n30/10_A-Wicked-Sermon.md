## A Wicked Sermon.

The following synopsis of a sermon is from the *Pittsburg Press* of July 17:—

Rev. J. W. Sproull, pastor of the Central Reformed Presbyterian Church, Allegheny, preached yesterday afternoon on "Learning Righteousness from Judgments on the Columbian Exposition." He said:—

> There has been a most wonderful change in sentiment in a very short time. The commissioners had over and over again delayed action looking to the closing of the gates on Sunday, but they at last did it suddenly and by a decided vote of 34 to 4. How was it brought about? The burning of the storage building and the loss of life involved in it brought the subject to their attention as it never had been brought before. They felt that the religious sentiment of the country would see the hand of God in the holocaust and that they would be held up to the world as defying the law of God and man, hence they hastened to free themselves from the situation in which they were placed.
>
> How can the hand of God be seen in what took place on last Monday? Men may say: "These brave firemen were doing their duty. Had the local directory been on the burning tower and perished we could understand it. Had the fire occurred on Sunday and not on Monday we could see the connection." We must be careful in our interpretation of God's judgments and remember that the judgment may fall on any part of a sinful nation or corporation as He may choose. Since the beginning of the Fair it has had various troubles, and at the very moment when the ministers of this city were gathered in the First Presbyterian Church, Wood Street, praying and planning for the closing of the gates, this awful catastrophe took place. How do you connect the judgment and the closing? There had been a breach of faith on the part of the directory such as would damn any man in business life. God was defied. A continental Sunday was thrust upon the people. They proposed to give back the money given them by Congress in a crisis and free themselves from obligation, which they could not do. They professed to open the gates to keep people out of the saloons and to give the workingman a chance to visit the Fair, but they ran beer-gardens and kept sixteen thousand men employed upon the grounds every Sunday. There was dishonesty in the erection of the very building destroyed. God's judgments were revealed against all this. The holocaust turned the tide of public opinion so strongly against the many evils connected with the Fair that the directory were compelled to close the gates.

In order to understand fully the wickedness of this sermon, it is necessary to know that the building that was burned was not open on Sunday. The dishonesty in the erection of the burned building was on the part of the contractor who lost nothing by its destruction. The firemen who lost their lives had nothing to do with the opening of the Fair; and the occurrence had not the most remote connection with the decision of the directory to close the gates on Sunday. There was simply no money in a Sunday Fair, hence the decision to close the gates.
