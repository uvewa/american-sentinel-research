The editor of the *Christian Statesman* says: "Woe to the minister of a majority going to the pulpit from a Sunday violation." A Sunday all of the ministers seem willing to preach and were not, the commands against which are in the same code and much better than the Sabbath law? Mr. Crute has made also a point which ought to answer it. Why does not a man go nought and utterly ignore the divine command to keep the seventh day, the very day as day in the Sabbath? And why does he then give to the wildness and sin of driving a person on a Sunday keep Sunday, standing for it the same place by God himself to the seventh day? And how does he seek to bind the commandment of men to his fellow men by religious assumption, and their holy toleration of them by law?
