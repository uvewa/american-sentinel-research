WHILE it is true in certain Church circles, certain Church leaders have been working to get the State to enforce Christianity, and the idea for men to be "Christians," so called, by legislation is still new in this country, if anything else, it is not surprising that the same spirit is becoming visible in the mission fields. The evangelical fervor and piety which have led many to foreign service, and the circumstances under which they have labored, have saved them from trusting in the arm of flesh; but even there there are evidences of a falling away from the principles of the gospel which can only lead to a failure of the mission to the heathen.

Dr. last month's *Missionary Review of the World,* Dr. Cyrus Hamlin has an article on the relation of foreign missionaries to governments, in which he makes some very instructive points. He says:—

It has been a principle of action rather than of creed, that missionary work should not depend on governments, and most expect little aid, when in difficulty and danger, from the great governments of Europe, Catholic or Protestant governments. For their protection add the means of power to their work and the danger is to be borne in America.

Dr. Hamlin is a veteran missionary, and his name is honored one in the annals of foreign missions. This does not establish the soundness of his proposition, however, but it must be weighed in the light of the principle involved rather than in that of mere reputation and temporal advantages which might be gained by the missionary in danger. Dr. Hamlin himself seemed to know this, for he adds: "It may be said when governmental interposition on the part of either Great Britain or America for missioanaries was even less common than now, and close acquaintance with the government's ways was of even greater importance in mission work than the present. Among other instances, Dr. Hamlin cites the example of England in sending an army into Abyssinia to rescue an English missionary and other prisoners held by King Theodore. "The army accomplished the," he says, "and also killed Theodore and destroyed his capital, Magdala. This action must have impressed the Abyssinians with the majesty of British civilization and power. And after a time it advanced the cause which the missionaries had at heart, the liberation of Theodore and his capital. Such action on the part of a government of a Christian State, under treaty obligation, is one thing, but to call for such intervention or

approval of it as a missionary policy is an entirely different matter.

The triumphs of the cross in heathen lands have been won by men who put their lives in the hands of those for whom the gospel travel and worked, and when the God whose voice more than many waters and mightier than the waves of the sea; who had heard His voice that saith, "Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm." In every age since the cross, the Lord has allowed men to be taken, and then the blood of martyrs has been seed of the Church. The heathen nations have been won to Christ by the practical demonstration of the cross as perceived. How different the situation from this, should missionaries understand that behind the missionary are the bayonets of the nations. He has thus done his distinctive character as an ambassador of Heaven, and become, in the eyes of his people, and in fact, the semi-official agent of a foreign and dreaded government.

For this reason the missionary of apostolic mold, not only does not desire the protection of his own government, but protests against it.

We learn of the troubles of the Southern and Upper Niger Mission, signed by its late lamented Bishop Crowther, Bishop Hill, and fifteen others, was to refuse the troops of the British government, saying:—

> We, the undersigned, desire to return thanks to the Mission for its kindness in offering to supply us with firearms of defence in the present unsettled state of affairs. Whilst at the same time we desire to express an opinion that it would be an improper step for us as ministers of religion to have recourse to Modern to Christ, they could not, under this appeal to arms; and that a resort to them would only provoke the natives to fall down upon themselves. But, for the sake of the spiritual welfare of this community, we feel it right that we should be left entirely in the hands of God, and therefore, to the last, will continue to help one another on, till the Lord in his good time, make it clear to us that they do not desire our continuance among them.

This is the true missionary spirit. And the appeal to government, is in accordance with the principles of the early church. To the Christian persecutors, Roman citizenship and his appeal to Cæsar were only a means by which to secure time. It was not an appeal for the intervention of law in his behalf. It was only to delay what was a prisoner of the law, by act of his own, that he desired the right to be before its higher or tribunal to secure him in whatever his right was.

Now, it is true that the apostles labored in the Roman empire, and that in many of these regions in which the apostles labored there was no established religion, but the old heathen religions. Not only, therefore, did the apostle feel no temptation to make a mob to persecute or destroy missionaries. The principle in both cases, however, was the same. The Christians did not appeal to the laws governing the commercial relations. In their relations to the gospel the apostle respected the law of the nation property for himself and the principle.

This is what the difference is. It amounted to this that the Christian "took the spoiling of their goods joyfully," to take the spoiling of his goods joyfully, for the sake of Christ, in lieu of being able to recover them at the law and punish this persecutors. We learn, also that this kind of apostle the Apostle to see that this kind of missionary work falls far short of what it might otherwise be, and neglects the only apostolic power. They received their commission and promise direct from Christ. They needed no human or earthly power to support them, and they went forth, as we are told, working for Christ's sake, and sought their conversion rather than their punishment.
