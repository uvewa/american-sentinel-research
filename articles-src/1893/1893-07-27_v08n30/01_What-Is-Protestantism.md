THIS is a question of living interest and vital importance just now, to the people of the United States.

Where the point has been reached where professed Protestants call upon Congress and courts to decide religious controversies for them, and to enact laws enforcing their church dogmas, and where they in plain style calling out the troops to enforce upon the people at the point of the bayonet the recognition and observance of religious observances, then it is time, and it is proper too, to inquire, Is this Protestantism?

At the second Diet of Spires, held in 1529, there was presented the Protest, which originated, and gave, to those who made it, the title and name of Protestants. And it is interesting that this protest the historian states the principle as follows:—

The principles contained in the celebrated protest of the 19th of April, 1529, constitute the very essence of Protestantism. Now this protest opposes two abuses of man in matters of faith; the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the second is the arbitrary authority of the Church. Instead of these two abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the Word of God above the visible Church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine things, and says with the prophets and apostles: We must obey God, rather than man. In the presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it upholds the crown of Jesus Christ.—*D'Aubigne, Hist. Ref. Pref. Book 13; Ch. VI, par. 6.*

The Sunday closers maintain that Sunday is the Christian Sabbath, that it is given a charter of their religion, that it is indeed the very citadel of their faith. And they claim to be Protestants. Now did they oppose the intrusion of the civil magistrate into this great question of their religion? No, indeed. Everybody knows that so far from the very first from opposing any intrusion of the civil magistrate they actually and at firmest required the civil authority to intrude upon the discussion and decision of the question and the enactment of a law requiring its observance; and also required the courts to intrude themselves into it when the act of Congress was called in question; and further called upon the executive to further intrude the civil authority by force of arms. All this they have done before the eyes of all the people.

Now as it is the very essence of Protestantism to oppose the intrusion of the civil magistrate in religious things; and they did not oppose this, it plainly follows that they are not Protestants, and that their movement and work is not Protestantism. As it is the very essence of Protestantism to oppose the intrusion of the civil magistrate in things religious; and as the people engaged in this Sunday enforcement, professing to be Protestants, not only did not oppose it, but actually required the whole magisterial power of the United States Government make threats to enforce them; it follows that the people who engaged in this Sunday-law movement are not Protestants at all, and that neither their movement nor their work is Protestantism in any sense.

SECONDLY, it is the essence of Protestantism to oppose "the arbitrary authority of the Church."

Now, for Sunday observance in any way there is no authority but the arbitrary authority of the Church. This the churches may not only *say* this, but they openly say it. The American Sabbath Union itself in its own official publications, in answer to a call for a definite command of God for Sunday observance, plainly says:— "We admit there is no such command." The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in one of its own publications, inquiring about the change of day from the seventh to the first, says that Christ "did not directly" do it. These are but samples—also too many to cite here. Well then, as they know that there is no command of God for Sunday observance; and as the Church power only is that which requires the observance, this is proof in itself that the only authority for the civil authority in the enforcement of Sunday observance is the arbitrary authority of the Church.

Yet more than this. Even though Christ had commanded it, for the Church to require, and enforce upon men the observance by law—this would be nothing else than to assert the arbitrary authority of the Church. Because, Christ himself has said, "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge [condemn] him not." As therefore Christ leaves every man free to observe his words or not, for the Church to compel any man to do it, is to put herself above Christ and do what he does not do. And this, in itself, is only to assert the arbitrary authority of the Church. So that whether there be a command of God for Sunday observance or not, in this matter the result is the same; to do as the professed Protestant churches of the United States have done and are doing, in requiring Sunday observance of any by law, is nothing else than to assert the rightfulness of the arbitrary authority of the Church.

BUT it is the essence of Protestantism to oppose the arbitrary authority of the Church. Therefore, as the professed Protestants of the United States have not opposed the arbitrary authority of the Church in this matter of Sunday observance, it plainly follows that they are not Protestants. And as it is the essence of Protestantism to oppose the arbitrary authority of the Church, and as these professed Protestants, not only did not oppose it, but actually asserted it and still maintain it, it unmistakably follows that they are not Protestants at all; and that neither their movement nor their work is Protestantism.

This proves that to oppose this movement in all its parts, to oppose Sunday laws in any and all their phases, to oppose and deny the right of congresses, or courts, or executives, to touch the question of Sunday observance, or any other religious question in any way, and to repudiate the authority of any government action when it is asserted—this and this only is Protestantism. Even admitting that Sunday were the Sabbath, those who choose to act as Protestants only by opposing all intrusion of the magistrate into the question; by questioning all attempt of the Church to require the recognition or observance by law, and by asserting their own individual right to observe it as they choose, without any dictation or interference from anybody. This alone is Protestantism.

This is living, present, absolute truth. There is no discount on it at all. "Protestantism and the power of conscience above a magistrate," even though in word you may deny being a Christian, a Protestant, and, purposes to enforce the "Christian Sabbath." "Protestantism sets the authority of the Word of God above the visible Church," even though the Church calls itself Protestantism! "Protestantism rejects the civil power in divine things, and says with the prophets and apostles, 'We must obey God rather than man.'" And that too of God as he has *revealed* it, and not as man commands it.

This is Protestantism; and the AMERICAN SENTINEL is, unquestionably and incomprehensibly, Protestantism. The work of this paper, from the first to the last, is the excellent work in which the Saviour and the apostles were engaged. This is genuine Protestantism. That work, as the SENTINEL does, opposed everything unwaveringly, unconquering, opposition to every form of Sunday legislation, or any other religious legislation, and to all interference or control of ecclesiastics in the affairs of Government. Protestants are needed today to protest against this apostate Protestantism which is now carrying things with a high hand.

Is there not some of us enough of ancient weight as ever, and as true to-day, against the abuse of ecclesiastical power, as at any other time or any of another crisis?

"The Reformation was accomplished in the name of a spiritual principle. It had proclaimed for its teacher the Word of God; for salvation, faith; for king, Jesus Christ; for arms, the Holy Ghost; —and had by these very means rejected all worldly elements. Rome had been established by the act of a carnal communion," the Reformation, by "the power of an outlaw life."

Protestantism has nothing whatever to do with the world and with politics. Where it has been connected with the matter of diplomacy and a court intrigue, the Reformation owes ever greater and more than that which proceed from the scepters of Jesuits.

"If the Reformation, having attained a certain height, becomes untrue to its nature, comes to parley with temporize with the world, and ceases thus to follow up the spiritual principle that it had so boldly proclaimed, it was faithless to God and to itself. Henceforward its decline was at hand.

"It is impossible for a society to maintain its powerful existence, if the principle it lays down. Having abandoned the living principle of its life, it could nought but—*death.*

"It was God's will that this great truth should be inscribed on the very threshold of the temple he was then raising in the world, and a striking contrast was to make too truth stand gloriously prominent.

"One portion of the reform too was led astray of the world, and in this alliance find a destruction full of desolation.

"Another portion, faithful to God, was laughingly to reject the arm of the flesh; and by this very act was to gain a noble victory.

"If universities have gone astray, it is because they were unable to comprehend as by faith."—*D'Aubigne, Hist. Ref. Bk. XIV., Chap. 1.*
