THE Fair will be closed on Sunday hereafter. This was not the desire of the visitors who are not residents of Chicago, who are partly religious and partly on religious grounds and partly because they are tired out by their week's work that they must have a day of rest. The local population who would go to the Fair on Sunday because they cannot spare the time any other day are not sufficiently numerous to warrant the expense of Sunday opening. As this has been proved by experience, there is no more to be said.—*New York Express.*

The action of the local directory of the World's Fair in voting to close the gates of the Exposition on Sundays has been countermanded by those exhibitors who refused to uncover their goods on that day. The people said to be inflamed to pay full price for a half exhibit.—*Philadelphia*

The action of the Board of Managers is more probably the result of the discretion which comes from experiment of dollars and cents than anything else.—*Columbus Dispatch.*

The Sunday attendance at the Chicago Fair has become so small that it is expected Sunday opening will be abandoned. It is argued, though, that this has been caused by a class of people who have to get their pleasure on Sunday because it is the only day available to them: still likely they will go to the park, rather than to the saloons and dives. They will go to the parks, or to the beer gardens, and on Sunday they must rest by patronizing the parks or take the consequences of saloon-going.

This resolution cannot be regarded as a typical one. A day of rest is a fine thing, a good experiment, but only as crowning evidence of the greedy unscrupulousness of

the Exposition management.—*St. Louis Post Dispatch.*

The Sunday attendance at the World's Fair Sunday strikes on its last and its evidence against opening it on that day than all argument against the Fair opening it as it has been opened. The fact is that the opponents of this proceeded, though they were defeated on the direct vote, got in their work against the opening, in this account which ever for them smoldering very large lobs.—*Boston Herald.*

If it be true, as a fundamental principle of justice, that the moral quality of an action lies in the intention, then the local directory of the World's Fair is entitled to little credit for closing the Exposition gates on Sunday. This intention was to make the most possible money out of the Fair.—*Boston Transcript.*

Will the various religious denominations which are, exclusive over Sunday closing kindly remember that the Fair will be closed for financial reasons? "The evil, but these were likely to be the rest of — all evil, but these were likely to be the rest."

After having discovered that Sunday opening does not pay Chicago could no longer resist the constellation compile against "violating the Sabbath."—*St. Louis Chronicle.*
