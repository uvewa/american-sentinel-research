## Some Press Opinions on Sunday Closing.

The Fair will be closed on Sunday because it does not pay to keep it open. The visitors who are not residents of Chicago refrain from Sunday attendance partly on religious grounds and partly because they are so tired out by their week's work that they must have a day of rest. The local population who would go to the Fair on Sunday because they cannot spare the time any other day is not sufficiently numerous to warrant the expense of Sunday opening. As this has been proved by experience, there is no more room for dispute.—*New York Evening Post.*

The action of the local directory of the World's Fair in voting to close the gates of the Exposition on Sunday was practically constrained by those exhibitors who refused to uncover their goods on that day. The people could not be induced to pay full price for half a show.—*Philadelphia Record.*

The action of the Board of Managers is more probably the result of the discretion which comes from considerations of dollars and cents than anything else.—*Columbus Dispatch.*

The Sunday attendance at the Chicago Fair has become so small that it is expected Sunday opening will be abandoned. It is singular, though, that this has been caused by a class of people who have no respect for Sunday, but prefer, probably from force of habit, to spend the day in the saloons and dives. They will go to the Fair every day in the week, but on Sunday they must rest by patronizing barrooms.—*Richmond Times.*

This resolution cannot be regarded as a proof of the failure of the Sunday opening experiment, but only as crowning evidence of the greedy unscrupulousness of the Exposition management.—*St. Louis Post Dispatch.*

The slim attendance at the World's Fair on Sunday strikes us as less an argument against opening it on that day than an argument against the conditions on which it has been opened. The fact is that the opponents of this proceeding, though they were defeated on the direct vote, got in their work against the opening in a manner which won for them something very like a victory.—*Boston Herald.*

If it be true, as a fundamental principle of morals, that the moral quality of an action lies in the intention, then the local directory of the World's Fair is entitled to little credit for closing the Exposition gates on Sunday. This intention was to make the most possible money out of the Fair.—*Boston Traveller.*

The result is not due in any manner to the desire of the managers to cater to the large constituency of Christian people who did not believe in opening the gates on Sunday. It was merely a commercial transaction. It didn't pay to keep the show open on Sunday, and so it is to be closed.—*Ohio State Journal.*

Now that the Sunday attendance at the World's Fair has fallen off to a marked degree, the managers talk of closing the gates on the "Lord's day." They are willing to be pious, finding that the other thing doesn't pay. There's no end of worldliness in this.—*New York Morning Advertiser.*

Will the various religious denominations which are exultant over Sunday closing kindly remember that the Fair will be closed for financial reasons? The love of money used to be the root of all evil, but we have changed all that—*Milwaukee Sentinel.*

After having discovered that Sunday opening does not pay Chicago could no longer resist its conscientious scruples against "violating the Sabbath."—*St. Louis Chronicle.*
