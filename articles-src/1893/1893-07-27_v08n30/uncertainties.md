# Uncertainties — v08n30, 1893-07-27

## Masthead Staff Names

- **OCR transcribed:** "ALOUZO T. JONES" — likely OCR error for "ALONZO T. JONES." Preserved as OCR'd in masthead; the correct spelling is used in article frontmatter.
- **OCR transcribed:** "CALVIN F. BOLLMAN" — likely "C. P. Bollman" (Calvin P. Bollman). The OCR may have misread "P." as "F." and expanded "C." to "CALVIN." Preserved as OCR'd in masthead.
- **OCR transcribed:** "WILLIAM H. BICKER" — likely "W. H. McKee" (William H. McKee), the known associate editor, whose initials W.H.M. appear at the end of article 02. OCR may have misread "McKee" as "Bicker." Preserved as OCR'd in masthead.

## Article 04 — Author Identification

- **Signed:** "J. O. CORLISS" — initials JOC. Not in the standard known authors list for 1893. Confidence: HIGH (explicit signature at article end).

## Article 05 — Author Identification

- **Signed:** "W. E. HOWELL" — initials WEH. Not in the standard known authors list for 1893. Confidence: HIGH (explicit signature at article end).

## Article 06 — Author Identification

- **Signed:** "W. A. SPICER" — initials WAS. Not in the standard known authors list for 1893. Confidence: HIGH (explicit signature at article end).

## Article 04 — OCR Transcription Issue

- Page 4, article "How Some Matters Appear to a Justice of the Supreme Court":
  - OCR reads "tiss—so long as said duties do not lead..." — the line break split the word "duties" across pages (page 3 ends mid-word "du-" and page 4 continues "tiss"). Joined in transcription as "duties."
  - OCR reads "Pentionly, and with shame" in the Justice Brewer quotation. This is likely an OCR error for "Patiently, and with shame." Preserved as OCR'd; flagged here. Confidence: LOW.

## Article 06 — OCR Transcription Issues

- Page 5, article "In Mission Fields":
  - "with ut running the risk" — OCR split "without" as "with ut." Joined in transcription as "without."
  - "Ezra P. 22, 23" — likely a reference to Ezra 8:22, 23. The "P." may be OCR for a period or verse marker. Preserved as OCR'd.

## Page 8 — Short Items

- The first paragraph on page 8 (AMERICAN SENTINEL subscription/sample copy notice) was treated as administrative boilerplate and not transcribed as an article.
- The "READ 'Some Press Opinions...'" cross-reference blurb was treated as a promotional internal note and not transcribed as a separate article.

## Advertisement Pages

- Pages 7 (Battle Creek Bakery and Battle Creek Sanitarium health food advertisements) were not transcribed as articles — these are clearly commercial advertisements.
- The West Shore Railroad excursion advertisement on page 8 was not transcribed.
- The AMERICAN SENTINEL subscription rate table on page 8 was not transcribed (publication info, not article content).
