# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, July 27, 1893 (v08n30)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from 300 DPI B&W scans. The scan quality presents significant challenges throughout, with small text in three-column layout making many words difficult to read with certainty. The following documents specific areas of uncertainty.

## Page 1, Article "What Is Protestantism?"

- **Issue:** "unconquering" may be "uncompromising" - the letters are not entirely clear
- **Confidence:** LOW

## Page 2-3, Article "The World's Fair to Be Closed on Sundays"

- **Location:** Multiple sections throughout the article
- **Issue:** The Board of Lady Managers resolutions text is extremely dense and in very small type. Several phrases throughout the resolutions may not be exactly captured.

## Overall Assessment

This issue presented exceptional difficulty due to the B&W scan quality, small type size, and three-column format. Many articles would benefit from comparison with higher-resolution scans or the original documents. The overall structure and themes of articles are captured, but word-level accuracy is significantly lower than usual for this transcription project.
