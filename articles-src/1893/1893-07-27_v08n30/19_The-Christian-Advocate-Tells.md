THE *Christian Advocate* tells of a woman in Baltimore who has succeeded in making a number of people believe that she is Jesus Christ. Well, there is nothing so very strange about that; millions of people have just as absently a thing named, that the commandment which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath," enjoins the keeping of the first day; and the editor of the *Advocate* is among the number. There is nothing more common than the popular belief in Sunday sacred.
