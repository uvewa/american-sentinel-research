# Uncertainties — v08n46 (1893-11-23)

## Page 2, Article "Signs of the Times"
- **Uncertainty:** The phrase "The earth mooredly and fadeth away" appears to be a garbled OCR rendering of a biblical quotation (Isaiah 24:4: "The earth mourneth and fadeth away"). However, since this is OCR of a printed document, the word may actually read "mourneth" or another spelling in the original. The OCR text reads "mooredly."
- **Transcribed as:** "mooredly" (preserved as OCR output; likely OCR error for "mourneth")
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly an OCR error for "mourneth" but cannot verify without the original scan
- **Recommendation:** Check original scan for this word in the Isaiah quotation on page 2

## Page 4, Article "Be Not Deceived!"
- **Uncertainty:** The word "Romiei" in "the effect which the Columbian year has had upon Romiei liberality" appears to be an OCR error. The context suggests "Romish" or "Roman" was the intended word.
- **Transcribed as:** "Romiei" (preserved as OCR output)
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error for "Romish" or "Roman"
- **Recommendation:** Check original scan

## Page 6, Article "An Epoch in Politics and Religion"
- **Uncertainty:** The word "smaah" in "it is well to 'smaah' the rings occasionally" is clearly an OCR error for "smash."
- **Transcribed as:** "smaah" (preserved as OCR output)
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR error for "smash"
- **Recommendation:** Check original scan

## Page 7, Article "A Significant Interview"
- **Uncertainty:** The phrase "the title he so much comes—that of 'The Pope of the People'" appears garbled. The OCR likely misread "craves" or "covets" as "comes."
- **Transcribed as:** "comes" (preserved as OCR output)
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error; intended word may be "craves" or "covets"
- **Recommendation:** Check original scan

## General Note on Advertisements
- Pages 7-8 contain book advertisements ("Some Valuable Books for Young Men," "Special Holiday Offer") and a railway advertisement (Grand Trunk Railway). These were not transcribed as article files as they are commercial content. The "Special Holiday Offer" book list contains highly garbled OCR output (many book titles and author names appear to be OCR errors), confirming these are advertisements not worth preserving as articles.

## Author: Geo. B. Thompson
- The "South African Correspondence" is signed "GEO. B. THOMPSON" with dateline "Cape Town, Oct. 11, 1893." This author does not appear in the known authors list. Initials assigned as GBT.

## Author: G. C. Tenney
- The article "Where Shall the Line Be Drawn" is signed "G. C. TENNEY." This author does not appear in the known authors list. Initials assigned as GCT.

## Article 16 (Notice to Readers)
- **Uncertainty:** The phrase "It is our breath able rule" is likely an OCR error for "It is our invariable rule" or similar. Preserved as OCR output.
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR error likely

## Page 2, "South African Correspondence" footnote area
- The "THE AMERICAN SENTINEL" header appears on page 3 above the continuation of the South African article. Article was correctly joined across the page break.
