AT the time of closing this paper, the National Reform Convention in Allegheny City, Pa., has not yet finished its work, but the SENTINEL has a representative on the ground, and adequate reports will be furnished in due season.

THE convention in question is larger and more enthusiastic than former conventions held under the auspices of the National Reform Association. Up to the time of writing this note, the several papers read have been unusually able. Logic could scarcely do more in the service of error than it has been forced to do thus far in this convention.

THE purpose of the National Reformers, as revealed in the resolutions presented at the first meeting of the convention, is to immediately follow up the practical work already done in Congress, and the Supreme Court, by aggressive work in Congress. A committee is to be sent to Washington to advance the work of the association. The amendment to the national Constitution, rendered really unnecessary by the Supreme Court decision, is to be urged; while every effort will be put forth to secure the passage of a national Sunday law. The enemies of liberty and of true righteousness were never more active than now. It is no time for the friends of liberty and of genuine Christianity to slumber.
