The religious dogma, then, of the idle and cheerless Sunday is not a Christian dogma at all, but a dogma of the Cromwellian Church militant. The development of this dogma is as curious as the origin of the first Sunday law, which, as we have seen, was avowedly created in honor of Mithra, the sun god, and applying as it did to work alone, and very partially to that, of course established nothing like "our American Sunday." The distinguishing attribute of the Puritan was moroseness. His pet aversion was gaiety, light-heartedness, play, sport. To be serious, solemn, and gloomy was, outwardly at least, to manifest a respect for Puritan ideas, to be Puritan-like, if not Puritan. When the Puritans got the power to compel by law special "observance" of their sacred day, they naturally turned their minds in the first instance to the requirement of that form of observance which was calculated to make everybody, externally at least, respectful toward the puritanic idea, and imitative of the puritanic deportment and behavior. Their first Sunday legislation, therefore, was directed against sports, play, diversions, visiting from one parish to another, etc. It was not till they had been tinkering at the subject for about fifty years that it occurred to them to prohibit work as a "profanation" of "the Sabbath." And even then it was not work per se that they objected to. It was only work of one's "ordinary calling." Thus, a carpenter might engage in blacksmithing, and a farmer build on his house; and persons who had no "ordinary calling," e. g., noblemen and tramps, remained as free on Sunday as on other days. In consequence of the application of these words, "ordinary calling," by the English courts they were omitted from the puritanic Sunday law, as transplanted to this country.

The manner in which the Puritans attained "the immortal honor" of an idle and cheerless Sunday by law established, was as follows: They repudiated all tradition, holding, as they said, to the "written Word" alone, meaning thereby the King James' Version of the Bible. Now, there is nowhere in this "Word" any prescription or even suggestion regarding the "observance" of Sunday in any manner, the only day of the week "set apart" therein being Saturday. But the Puritan repudiator of tradition altered the fourth commandment as given in the "written Word" so that it read: "Remember Sunday to keep it holy, . . . the first day is the Sabbath of the Lord, thy God," etc., and this alteration he made on the strength of tradition alone. Again, the Puritan repudiated with acorn and indignation the authority of the Catholic Church; he appealed to the "written Word" against her and all her works. But the written Word says "the seventh day is the Sabbath." etc.; and for his authority to change "seventh" to "first," the Puritan repudiator of Catholicism had nothing to rely on except the Catholic Church, and her incorporation into a dogma of a traditional practice.

Having by this strange process fixed upon his sacred day of the week, the Puritan next proceeded to settle the manner of its observance. And here he displayed an originality for which he does not usually receive sufficient credit. The "Sabbath" of the fourth commandment is only half of the Puritan Sunday. The first involves abstinence from work alone. Saturday was a day of play, recreation, social visiting, and entertaining, etc., with the Jews in Palestine. The Puritan Sunday involves abstinence from work and play. The inhibition of the latter is, as already shown, the stamp of puritanism upon the day. As Sunday play and social intercourse were objects of Puritan antipathy long before Sunday work, so it is safe to challenge contradiction of the assertion that if our Puritans of to-day were given their choice between the repeal of the prohibition of Sunday work and the prohibition of Sunday play, they would, to a man, vote to retain the prohibition of play. "They hated bear-baiting," says Macaulay, truly, "not because it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators." They hated Sunday opening of the World's Fair, not because it kept the employees at work, but because it enabled non-Puritans to enjoy themselves on Sunday. A man may work on Sunday and still pay puritanism the compliment of an outwardly gloomy and morose,—that is to say a puritanic, demeanor on its sacred day. But if non-Puritans are to be permitted to enjoy themselves on Sunday at their own sweet will, just as they may on other days, there is an end of external deference to puritanism by law compelled; there is an end of the union of the Puritan Church with the American State; there is an end of the embodiment of the Puritan dogma of the idle and cheerless Sunday in an American statute.

All history shows that attempts of the civil power to enforce religious duties, while sure to fail of their purpose, develop the most objectionable traits of human nature, and debauch the moral sense of the community. It may be true, that the more profound philosophers of the Inquisition looked on as calmly and dispassionately at the sufferings of the heretic, as a surgeon views the lacerated limbs of a patient under his knife, being wise men as well as good, and so knowing that their work was a salutary one, and that it was necessary for the sufferer's own sake that he should be tortured into conversion here to save him from eternal agony hereafter. But the masses were not philosophers; and it is impossible to doubt that their interest in an auto da fé was little connected with their appreciation of its value as a means of grace to the victims, and that it was mainly based on the love of cruelty and the appetite for blood always latent in human nature, and like all our baser passions "growing by what it feeds on." We have gotten rid of the stake and the rack, let us hope, forever. The Sunday laws are about the only means left of invoking the power of the State to compel an external compliance with a dogma of the Church. The Sunday opening of the World's Fair has attracted special attention to these laws, and sporadic and spasmodic attempts have been made to enforce them. The obvious futility of the attempts renders them ridiculous. But they have a serious side. While the instinct of cruelty, in its worst and extremist manifestation, the delight in actual physical torture, cannot be gratified by means of persecutions under the Sunday laws, other low, shameful, and deplorable instincts find in such proceedings at once a vent and a stimulus.

Not the least conspicuous of these is the desire to cause others annoyance because they differ from us on religious points and the impulse of meddlesomeness, the spirit of "setting others straight," the ambition of "bossing" one's neighbor and compelling him to govern his private conduct by our standard instead of his own. If we consider that to instigate and subserve the cause of prosecutions under the Sunday laws requires the sacrifice of manliness and self-respect to the extent of playing the part of a volunteer detective and spy, we may form some idea of what a man must be or become, who habitually foments such prosecutions. Add to the demoralizing effects upon the prosecutors of such proceedings, the inevitable rankling in the hearts of the prosecuted, who, being reasonable creatures, understand perfectly that they are proceeded against not because they have done any harm to anybody, but solely because they have violated a religious dogma, in which they do not believe, and we begin to get some idea of the evil effects on any community of Sunday law trials.
