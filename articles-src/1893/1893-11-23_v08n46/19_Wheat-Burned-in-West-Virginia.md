A CORRESPONDENT of the West Virginia Monitor, writing to that paper from Newark, that State, says: "Not far from here a Seventh-day Adventist has been persecuted in many ways. Not long since they burned his wheat in the stack." This means of punishing this man for working on Sunday was resorted to because under the law of West Virginia "one who conscientiously believes the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as a Sabbath and actually refrains from all secular labor and business on that day," cannot be punished for devoting the first day to secular purposes.
