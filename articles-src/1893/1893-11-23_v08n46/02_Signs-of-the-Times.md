THERE are no more worlds to conquer. For generations the hives of Central Asia and Central Europe had swarmed and swept on to the westward. The Atlantic met them. They bridged it with ships. A new world was found. That too is occupied. They go to and fro but find no more worlds to conquer.

As these advancing human tides turned back upon themselves when they first came to the impassable sea, so now, as they meet the Pacific boundaries of emigration and encounter the reverse current from the Orient, they turn again. There is no new world beyond. Neither is there any possibility of stemming the flood, either from the east or the west. Here the conflict will be.

THE powers of Europe must utilize their great standing armies. They must fight out their final battles on the prophetic battle fields. Nevertheless, here, on this western continent, must come the turbulent struggle of the races. Here blood that will not mix will burn hot. Color prejudice is not fading out. Race hatred is increasing. The right hand of fellowship is no longer offered to the alien. He will still come. There will be strife. And where the battle is there the vultures will gather.

THERE is an impending conflict. The forces are gathering to it from all quarters. Diverse human agencies are nursing their anger against each other. Long hidden animosities are being uncovered. Persecutions are developing. The legal enforcement of the observance of one dogma of the present prevailing religious creed is common in more than half the States of the Union. In four States Protestants have been fined and imprisoned, for no other reason than because of the very reality and purity of their Protestantism. In at least one State Jew-baiting has begun. The spirit of Satan, in the guise of religion, already occupies men's minds, and has hardened their hearts against their fellows.

HUMAN reason is fast becoming dethroned by intemperance and by excessive indulgence in all the pleasures of the senses. The gratification of personal desires and selfish delights is made the end and aim of existence. By this means all the higher and finer feelings are either blunted or destroyed. All the increased facilities for the attainment of the sensuous joys of the world only increase the number of the devotees and slaves of pleasure, and carry them to even greater extremes and more extravagant indulgencies. It is doubtful if at any age of the world sensualism, in its various forms, was carried to greater lengths than now, and it certainly was never so widespread. The result of this is apparent in the prevalence of insanity, and the many monstrous, inhuman, and abnormal deeds of criminality and violence. Even in those who do not otherwise show any lack of mental balance the very sources of the milk of human kindness seem dried up, and a man's foes are found to be those of his own household. Certainly the last state of mankind is likely to be worse than the first.

WHILE the corrupt nature of man conspires with the originator of all evil to dethrone human reason and work the eternal destruction of both mind and body in as great a number as possible,—the elements also become a fateful factor in existing conditions. Subtle combinations not before known give rise to new diseases, or new and perplexing forms of ancient ills. The very achievements of man, in science and supposed control of the elements and forces of nature, bring him into the presence of heretofore unknown dangers, and the more intense expressions of force with which he is totally unable to cope. Thus he continually finds himself handling so-called natural forces, in forms of their expression so intense, that his use of them becomes possible only through the merciful assistance of the restraining hand of Omnipotence. Then, when, as a result of his presumption or defiance, the restraining hand of Providence is removed, disaster follows quick and terrible. So man, working without God in the world, is allowed to compass his own destruction. Why has man forgotten that, if he would but follow the Master in simplicity of faith and obedience, his command of physical forces would be no less than that which said to the winds and the waves—"Peace, be still,"—and they were still.

BUT the very elements themselves are becoming treacherous. The gaseous combinations of air and water seem to show possibilities of dangerous variableness. The effect of hidden fires within the earth shows itself with increasing power. The subtle capacities of electric forces are displayed with increasing frequency and greater evidences of ability to destroy. Unprecedented tides and storms upon the sea make known how unstable a thing it is which covers such a proportion of the earth's surface, and how unlimited is the possibility of its destructive use when once it becomes an instrument in the hands of the destroyer. Is it not true that all these subtle essences and forces are now coming, and soon will be, within the control of the arch enemy of mankind? Is it not true that Omniscience has foretold this in prophecy?

Satan works through the elements also to garner his harvest of unprepared souls. He has studied the secrets of the laboratories of nature, and he uses all his power to control the elements as far as God allows. When he was suffered to afflict Job, how quickly flocks and herds, servants, houses, children, were swept away, one trouble succeeding another as in a moment. It is God that shields his creatures and hedges them in from the power of the destroyer. But the Christian world have shown contempt for the law of Jehovah; and the Lord will do just what he has declared that he would, he will withdraw his blessing from the earth, and remove his protecting care from those who are rebelling against his law, and teaching and forcing others to do the same. Satan has control of all whom God does not especially guard.

While appearing to the children of men as a great physician who can heal all their maladies, he will bring disease and disaster, until populous cities are reduced to ruin and desolation. Even now he is at work. In accidents and calamities by sea and by land, in great configurations, in fierce tornadoes and terrific hailstorms, in tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal waves and earthquakes, in every place and in a thousand forms, Satan is exercising his power. He sweeps away the ripening harvest, and families and distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and thousands perish by the pestilence. These visitations are to become more and more frequent and disastrous; destruction will be upon both man and beast. "The earth mooredly and fadeth away," "the haughty people . . . do languish. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant."

All these things the Pharisees of the latter days will claim, as they even do already, to be the visitations of God because of the refusal of those who are indeed his servants, and keep this law, to join them in the observance of the changed ordinance and the breaking of the everlasting covenant.
