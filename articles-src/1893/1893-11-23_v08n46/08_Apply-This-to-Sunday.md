The following is from an Irish paper:—

Mr. Wm. Johnston.—I beg to ask the Chief Secretary whether he is aware that (as has been stated in the Westmeath Independent of July 1st) Father Kelly informed five painters employed in Mr. Coen's premises on June 26th that it was a religious holiday and that he would not allow them to work; that because they declined to leave off work the men were denounced from the altar afterwards by Father Byrne at ten o'clock mass, that after the artisans were denounced they left their work and returned to Dublin; and whether he will take steps to prevent the recurrence of such action on the part of ecclesiastic.

Mr. J. MORLEY.—I am afraid that the facts are substantially as stated in the gentleman's question. I am forced to think, however, that the case is one in which the aggrieved persons themselves should take action rather than the Government.

Mr. Johnston is a member of Parliament and Mr. Morley Chief Secretary for Ireland. The question put implied that a priest had no right to interfere with men because they worked on a saint's day or other religious holidays. Mr. Morley's answer grants that such interference is improper. But why any more improper for a priest to denounce men for working on a saint's day than for the boycotting Sunday preachers to denounce men for working on Sunday?
