THERE are no more worlds to conquer. For generations the hives of Central Asia and Central Europe had swarmed and swept over the westward. The Atlantic met them. They bridged it with ships; a new world was found. That too is exploited. They go to and fro but find no more worlds to conquer.

As these alternating human tides turned and spent themselves upon first one and then the opposite shore, so, as they came to the impassable sea, or, as they encountered the reverse current from the other side, they turn again. There is no new world beyond. Neither is there any possibility of absorbing the flood, either from the east or the west. Here the forces meet.
