The Power Unto Salvation.

IT is true there never was a time when there were more efforts being put forth, professedly, in the interests of all morality. It is also true that there seem to be more to acknowledge that power is necessary to the success of these organizations. And it is also evident that there is a lack of that power, notwithstanding the supposed means of obtaining it.

When we look over the various organizations, unions, etc., on this line, and see the enormous amount of machinery and the vast sums of the mints of power is seen, by so many at least, is organizations. But having the widest practical range, made up of men and women, we again conclude that few things are truly effective.

We listen to the voice of organization, however, before passing judgment, as from almost every direction, whether from the Church so-called, or from the professed auxiliary organizations, the trumpet is blowing with no uncertain sound.

Here is a blast from a ministerial conference: "The object of the gospel is to make matter [for the establishment of their own ideal]. We want legislation [we have it too]; and when we got it we will show on." And their time is short? Where is the power here? "What we want is law." "Is it they acknowledge that they do not have the power, but when they get the law they will have the law. But what is law? It is but the expression of the will of a community. Therefore the cry from individuals or organizations "law" is but the voice of man, for more power of man is new man.

But some will say at this point, "It is man we want; he is worth it. God is law." Very well. Do you mean to say that you do not have God's law? and if not, what law do you want? If it is God's law on record, in God's statute book, for ever and ever, the law of God is not written by the finger of the eternal God himself in tables of stone at Mount Sinai, and all down the ages since in the hearts of all his true people. These be Ex. 20: 1-17; Heb. 8:10. If it is God's law that you may want but without obeying it they do not have it, and in their hearts too. But that is just the trouble, for to have the law is just the basis that it is worked, but in the Constitution and statute books of our country God's law is not.

"We propose to incorporate in our national and State Constitutions the moral command, etc." Again, "Have the Government of the United States it is to inscribe this character on our Constitution. So may whatever you call any law, or say law for that matter, on our statute books, unless its defense for one is or enforces upon all force of some one else who is usually some one else's; therefore, every plan that does not take into consideration the moral and religious law with the Government of the nation, of the whole department of morality and religion. Not a few have put an admirable crystallization of the following:—"Have the Government to inscribe it in the statute book, and lay its hands on any religion that does not conform to it." Substantially it does not only that entirely to be refused, but let us see if this is that kind of morality that is to be forced, is it the morality that is to do the saving?

Let those who will, remember the Sabbath to keep it holy, from murder of laws and obedience; the remnant must be made to keep it by force.

Call it the law of God all we may, but if it is ever to reach or save, it must come to the heart of man, and put it there, then man must put with it all his penalty for its violation. It is that kind of penalty, and this makes it a man's affair, and if ever it makes any saving.

Christ came into this world, God has never made men save themselves. The law is all. Again, we ask, what is the object in all of it, for God? To make men, "body," or to man, to make men, "holy," or make him act, or as though they were "holy, by law, a man that is to be an externally, *commandment*) holy, from motive, or from penalty—which is to express the "law?" All the holiness man can get from forced conformity to the law, or any form there is in the compelling power; but as a man, from them, alone, the civil government (power for religion acts) to man, and he needs not to be separated from the gospel of God, of God says that he is at all fitly rags."

"Organization for morality!" that is the best thing organization, for the evident reason that its saving influence can do no poor sinner a man-made righteousness part. This is the power unto salvation that is being aggressively sought after. This is the power of men not of salvation, but it is not the power of God unto salvation.

It is of God to "show" and that is just what his service is, therefore it must first of all be true and in appearance only, to be at all acceptable to God; and that love and service can only come through faith in Jesus Christ. "Therefore," says Paul, "I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." This is the power gospel power.

There is no holiness or goodness for a man, or woman, except what comes from God, a direct gift from God. For holiness can come, to man only through the channel of faith, so no man is able to take any name under heaven given among men.

Law cannot accomplish holiness in the singly ones, no one of "the holy law" and "perfect" law of God. Why? For, by the law of the Lord is the knowledge of sin, and as long as a man has only the law to confront him he is but continually confronted by his sin right.

Let us turn now again to that of Rom. 3:19, 20, etc. "It is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have come by the law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. Man must be saved; but the law itself. The law tells this world there has been no Christ, and hence no salvation. For where there is no law, however thoroughly enforced, or make him just, or teach him, nor be, or develop in him, one single principle of righteousness."

This religious dogma, then, of the religious in the creeds is to be a church, not a dogma of all, but a dogma of the creed—when the first approach was to come for an effectual saving power. The power of Mithras, the son God, and applying this law through the gospel, the power of Paul's teaching, is that of, of course established by the most striking, the most instructive, and most staggering attributions. How the whole system of morality that man has instituted. It is business, play, sport. It is an earthly influence, not a divine one.

We say, the Puritan. It is not Puritan, this the power unto salvation. This has come by law special "observance" of a particular day of worship. Puritanism was the impulse in the first instance to escape the tyranny; and then the machinery was calculated to purify everybody, externally. And the effort went just so far and was true, and no further. And that is the same, that, and Puritans in the broader and also holier sense, went along in this direction; and obedience and behavior. Find the Puritans who battled against the worst against plays, diversions, low art, debauchery, blasphemy, and all manner of not till they had been tinkering at the morals of the community. And they went at it. All the energy of the human mind was created to them to publish work as a basis for the new moral order of things, even than it was not work per se that they are champions of morality. The Church at the present day is practically engaged in blacksmithing, and is seeking to "make the world over" even into a new faith, and had no "ordinary calling," no trade, no barter, with the exception of "going to Church on Sunday as other days. In consequence of the application of these words, "ordinary calling," by the English courts they
