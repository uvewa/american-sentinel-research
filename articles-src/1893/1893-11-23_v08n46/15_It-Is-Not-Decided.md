It is Not Decided!

ROMANISM is in a sweet mood these days. They are as pleasant as a day in June. They are profuse in their declarations of loyalty to this country and its institutions. They talk very loud for a free conscience and freedom of schools. All is the liberties were due to their efforts, and, under their direction, are safe. A correspondent of the *Catholic Standard* has been lately carrying favor in this wise. The most conspicuous is in favor of the educational proposition in its most advanced form. It is wonderful the effect which the Columbian Exposition has had on the Catholic mind. But what does it all mean? Has there been a change of policy on the part of Rome; are we to see a new era of friendship toward Protestant Christians? This is the question. Is the spirit of the papacy more benevolent, humanity ready to live with Protestantism side by side, as the Republic and its institutions were designed to permit? The answer is an absolute negative on both sides. But Americans are not blind to this, no more are the Jesuits, who are so amiable. They have not made their laws friendly to our American civil law any more, to Jesuits. Jesuiticle, they have laws, but they have a displacement too. This is the history of the Jesuit policy on his part, and that of his supporters. Their position is best expressed in the question—what is she and what she may become—that, and all the way one thing to the man who is willing to see the truth. For men, though, their sorrowings and merciless inquisitions are not wasted on the surface. Their device, their cunning, and nation grows with growing provocation to more wickedness.
