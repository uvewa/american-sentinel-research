Born in New England.

THERE is an alarming condition of affairs in New England. A report written in 1890 shows that the communicants of Roman Catholic churches exceed the total number of all the members of Protestant churches, the Protestant population being of a million. New England and churches contain 1,000,760 Protestants and 1,155,000 Catholics. Dr. Wordsworth, in the *Independent,* describes the condition of affairs in this wise: "The pulpit of New England in the last twenty years has changed, as to the order and quality of its preaching. Up to that time it had a standard and moral code which the New England pulpit was militant, and aggressive to a degree that was aimed to attack error and unbelief, on any ground it might elect to occupy. But for a generation it has been growing pacific and has been given more to fine literariness. It has lost its teaching skill for themselves, and within its own has been apologizing, and the entire field of human life has within it has been a cry. Let controversy alone. Cease from violent effort." The field has not been lost to orthodoxy and the Protestant Church, and comes from the land and gotten rid of this." They have been vailed and the pulpit has supplied the things and made the sects. But its legitimate forces are dwindling. The old enthusiasms are still formulated in the creeds, and are still assented to by old established congregations, but they are held very much as the fondest of extinct animals are held at the museums of natural history. It is a mournful thing for us to learn in view of these facts before us. First we are struck with the fact of a high degree of spirituality and that we happened ourselves for the world, and going toward to the world," without fear, favor, or affection. A cold, honest, unending, and a cringing, time-serving, ministry, preach the most terrible foes yet, for the Catholicism.—*Central Baptist.*
