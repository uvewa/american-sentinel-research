THERE is an impending conflict. The forces are gathering to it from all quarters. Diverse human agencies are turning their anger against each other. Long hidden animosities are being uncovered. Persecutions are developing. The legal enforcement of the observance of one of the signs of the present prevailing religious creed is common in more than half the States of the Union. In four States Protestants have been fined and imprisoned, for no other reason than because of the very reality and purity of their Protestantism. It is but one State so far—bushing at its spirit. Spirit of Satan, in the guise of religion, always encouraging idleness, and the hardened heart bearing its shell has threatened its great heart.
