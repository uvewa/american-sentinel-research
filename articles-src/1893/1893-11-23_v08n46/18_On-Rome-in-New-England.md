ON another page is a short article, from the Central Baptist, "Rome in New England," which is significant not only for the fact stated, namely, that "the communicants of Roman Catholics in New England exceed the number of all the members of Protestant churches combined," but also for the reason assigned. And what is the reason? In substance, that Protestant ministers have ceased to "contend earnestly," or at all, "for the faith once delivered to the saints." Modern Protestantism has ceased to be aggressive and has become utterly colorless as to those doctrines once looked upon as essential to vital piety; and as inculcated by the Protestant pulpit; Christianity is now little more than a system of ethics, scarcely distinguishable from the better phases of the false systems which it recently met upon a level in Chicago in the Parliament of Religions.

Sound doctrine is essential to sound faith. The inspired charge to the ministers of Christ is, "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine." And why? "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine." Has not that time fully come? and is not that fact the reason why Rome dominates that section of the country once the stronghold of Protestantism?

The gospel, the whole gospel, meets exactly the wants of the human soul. But emasculated, it becomes "another gospel," impotent to lift man out of himself and into God; powerless to change the heart and to transform the life; utterly insufficient to satisfy the longings of the human soul, and its thirst for the streams of living water. Denied the water of life by those who profess to be dispensing it, is it any wonder that multitudes turn to Rome?

But this suggests another thought. If a failure to preach the whole gospel, the real gospel, has resulted in such large accessions to the ranks of the Papacy in the United States, does it not follow that the only effective way of successfully resisting the Papacy is by preaching the pure gospel? It was thus that Luther broke the power of Rome when the Pope ruled supreme in Christendom; and shall Christians now resort to other methods? Shall they deny Christ and the power of his truth by resorting to papal methods in resisting Rome? Nay, verily; let us not go down into Egypt, but let us oppose popish craft and deception with the living Word, the force once potent to create worlds, which caused light to shine out of darkness in the beginning, and which is now pledged to renew the human heart and to subdue the stubborn will, causing light to shine out of the moral darkness of superstition and sin.
