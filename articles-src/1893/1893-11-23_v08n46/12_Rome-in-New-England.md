THERE is an alarming condition of affairs in New England. The census of 1890 shows that the communicants of Roman Catholics in New England exceed the number of all the members of Protestant churches combined, by nearly a quarter of a million. New England churches contain 1,005,120 Catholics and 763,987 Protestants. Dr. Wordsworth, in the Congregationalist, explains the condition of affairs in this wise: "The pulpit of New England in the last twenty-five years has changed, as to the style and quality of its preaching. Up to that time it had a strong doctrinal cast and tone. The older New England pulpit was militant, and was not only ready to defend itself, but to attack error and unbelief, on any ground it might choose to occupy. But for a generation it has been growing pacific and has been quite content to let false doctrine and false teaching shift for themselves, while its own tone has been apologetic, and as little antagonistic as possible. There has been a cry, Let controversy alone. Don't hold up the dry bones of orthodoxy. Preach Christ, and cease from the hard doctrines of the fathers! The cry has prevailed and the pulpit has supplied the demand made upon it. The old doctrines are still formulated in the creeds, and are still assented to by candidates for church membership; but they are held very much as the fossils of extinct animals are held in our cabinets of natural history." The lesson for us to learn in view of these facts is this: First, that we should maintain a high degree of spirituality and that we "contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints," without fear, favor, or affection. A cold-hearted membership and a cringing, time-serving ministry, present the most inviting field on earth for the Catholics.
