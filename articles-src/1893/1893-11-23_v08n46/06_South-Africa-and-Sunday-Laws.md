In former communications to the Sta­tesman a correspondent of the South African Colonial Parliament for laws concerning Sunday observance was called to attention. I stated some facts regarding the Sunday work that is already in existence. Parliament has already in existence. Parliament has been adjourned without touching the matter. Numerous petitions were presented, principally by the Dutch Reformed Church, praying for a more stringent Sunday law. These petitioners, however, did not so much ask for more rigorous enforcement of the Sunday laws as they are now on the statute books. It is difficult to conceive what they wanted. It seemed that to would be much more strict than the one now in existence or that they wished it to existence, but which is really repealed, so far as it is practical.

But the time of the question before us had, the members of the household of faith had very different views concerning the matter. They all wanted to "come together in one place." When the question was divided on the question, they were fearful that they would be found on the wrong side to please their constituents, who would, in consequence, "rather unto them at the polls." To antagonize the measures would be to array themselves against the so-called religious part of their constituency, some of whom had already expressed themselves in resolutions. At a recent meeting of the Presbyterian Conference, held in Swaellendam, Cape Colony, a committee appointed to consider the matter of Sunday observation, reported as follows:—

This assembly feels called upon to request the Government, through a properly authorized committee, to present a petition to the Colonial Parliament for signature, and declares that the time has arrived for a more rigorous enforcement of the Sunday observance law now on the statute books of this dominion, men will then upon themselves be restricted.

As they did not think it "wise statesmanship" to push the Sunday law, they are anxious over for the time being. This I understand is the reason; but there is another in the matter being booked, prepared by some religious bigots in America.

*Resolved,* That we do hereby pledge ourselves anew to do all in our power for the due observance of the Lord's day, and that we do protest against all forms, refuse to vote for, or support for any office or position of trust, any man who does not respect Sunday as a day of rest and worship; and we go even further and for the World's Fair, except on the distinct understanding that it shall be closed on Sunday.

It is easily seen, that the motive power behind both of these resolutions in the same in its nature. It is that political persuasion born of bigotry that constitutes its votaries, first as a deceiver, and in false representation.

And how is it that this attack on the Sunday laws is made by the clergy, which makes it evident that their zeal is for religions, and that it is religion itself, and not morality, that the power to force the sciences, and compel the minority to worship according to their dictates? Let us see. A meeting of the Evangelical Alliance was held at Bloemfontein a short time ago. Our Parliament the necessity of more stringent Sunday laws was discussed freely. All ministers and church officers in those churches, we may be sure, in to be interested from it.

Printing. During the discussion, all who ventured to suggest all the wars not agreed on as to which day was the proper rest day. The measure, if carried out, would enable the ministers to prosecute anyone for the non-observance, and the manner of dealing with it was certainly extraordinary for conscience' asks. He is fined; and if the amount is $10 he pays the *Seventh-day Adventist.* On, in replying in kind; and now this is not the case as is formed by the presiding officer that that he need not pay, because no one would be to all except those who were in favor of the Sunday law. These then placed themselves in all movements in favor of compulsory Sunday laws. Now, "These be thy gods, O Israel!" Shouts of "'law-breakers,' "anarchist," etc., do not come from the pulpit and clergy of the south. When once the laws are pushed the law-breakers are met by the urgencies of a bigoted majority, though they are forced to. In the wilds of Siberia, of the United States they are the same, sending brilliant criminals, and in this colony they have it we know a law which we can invoke against them for the benefit of the State. The strangest of all is that these people are doing nothing but a wicked work. The eyes of the world are turned to this African continent, for as they see her engaged in such an unhappy work. Does not condemnation. "Unto you therefore the more. Rom. 2; 3, 4."

Some works through the elements also to garner his harvest of unrighteous souls. The law and its servants of fair weather were often were talking in reference to the work of persecution now commenced in America,
