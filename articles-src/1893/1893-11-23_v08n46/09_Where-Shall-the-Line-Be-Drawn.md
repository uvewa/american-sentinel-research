Where Shall the Line Be Drawn.

THE State cannot do the work that has been assigned to the Church by the Lord Jesus Christ. And it is not for the State to be set to the work of Christ and because of it hold the civil power, to seek to retain his purity and also the work of political authority. A line must be drawn, a line must be drawn between the civil power and the work of the gospel. There must be a clear distinction; their work though not antagonistic, is not interchangeable. There is no work that the State and Church can do in co-operation, with both hands except, at the per of the legitimate and different work of each. This question of line of separation should ever be maintained between them. Any infringement of this condition is fraught with danger, to true religion and of true statesmen as well.

These words are written with a profound impression that they convey the truth upon the minds of every reader, and with the ardent wish that it might become the rule of every citizen. These are truths that we let them into our public safety, the integrity of the Government, the security of all natural rights, and the success of the gospel. Since we adopt this position in theory, we are encouraged by the number of those who do not hesitate to carry favors for one or the other; those who seek to maintain their State and somebody else's Church, but look very pleasantly upon the scheme when it is their State and their Church. Indeed, this is where the great majority of the people really stand upon.

But there is a better place for honest people to stand upon; and that is for the right for right principles, and having found them, are willing to abide by them wherever the lines may be drawn. Such our rules are taken to be. It is in this our confidence that the position before stated has been assumed.

The question of the separation of the Church from the civil power should be entire and complete. In taking this position we are not to be understood to be in favor of the anarchist. He who stands on these grounds of the true and the religious and in the full light of the genius of Christianity and is in accord with the teachings of the grand Founder. History justifies the stand he has taken, and every consideration of justice declares that his position is right.
