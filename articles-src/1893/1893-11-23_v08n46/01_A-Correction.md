OUR attention has just been called to a mistake in the fifth paragraph on the first page of No. 43, date of November 2. As printed the statement is exactly opposite to the truth. The blunder was made by the compositor, and in some unaccountable way was overlooked in reading the proofs. The copy reads: "The correct principle of the separation of Church and State,—that the State has no jurisdiction in religious affairs, and the Church no authority in civil matters,—that every man must 'render unto God the things which are God's, and unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's,' is not primarily an 'American' principle, although first governmentally enunciated in the Constitution of the United States. It is first a divine and biblical principle."
