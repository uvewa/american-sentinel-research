The State of Maryland vs. the Fourth Commandment.

The Circuit Court of Queen Anne's County, Maryland, before Chief Justice Robinson, Wickes, and Stump on the reserved, the question whether or not the fourth commandment says that the seventh day is the Sabbath and rest thereupon; whether the State of Maryland can by any statute enact that the first day is the Lord's day, and whether this statute can be made the object lesson for the enforcement of this. Isaac Judefind, Geo. W. Marvel, and Milton A. Bryan, Seventh-day Adventists and members Christian men, law-keeping in the sentence of, "Five dollars and costs each," regardless, in the county jail till costs are paid.

The circumstantial evidence presented within the walls and laws of Centsville churches, were every day, no trouble according justice at a moment. It is told that outside ploughing in his field; that of George Marvel was that of doing necessary repairing, as he was seen in his garden making notices such as each might at that work; and the complainant witness, on going there, had to walk quietly past. In his own place, and Marvel, the son of the defendant, was bold; the prosecution witness and the complaint was set down to having a carpenter, that of Milton Bryan, the willingest man of the community. The testimony was "took to be" cutting up bushes; they chopped some limber wood, then, taking up a stump, and in plain sight, at his woodpile, chopped some firewood; then, taking up a shovel threw a seathing together into a thing. The two other officers against each of these men were offences against no man, these three men, with families depending upon them, were, with familiar desperation they had for liberty.

As many as three there were four or five similar cases to come before the court at the same time, but, in the case of Charles O. Ford, his brothers, both, were the complaining witnesses, had, without the knowledge of the defendant, paid the fine and costs imposed in the lower court; and this secured the removal of the case from the docket. Alexander Dodd was acquitted of one case, and in a second, the case of Alexander himself and Joseph Warren were dismissed because of a fatal variance between the papers, one by fair justice in the court below, and the facts.

Although all of the seven trials that were expected to be had there were but three convictions, yet from the demeanor of the court, and from the readiness of all concerned in the prosecution, it is evident that this sort of persecution will continue. Seventh-day Adventist can expect to escape. It should be mentioned that as the cases came before the court on Friday, Nov. 3, at the end of the first trial was finished that day, the remainder were postponed until Monday, Nov. 6. It did not appear manifest that this was due to the request of the court for the defendants were ready at all times. It was further in consideration to the request of the defendants. Each case was tried to a jury. Mr. Sheckels, who volunteered in their defense every courtesy of the law—brought light to the situation, and made also in their behalf the appeal as stated in previous columns.

Each case was tried before a jury, and to them and to counsel Mr. Sheckels, who volunteered in their defense in the situation, among others, the point that Sunday is not the Sabbath, and no observance was due the day as a Sabbath. But the reply to that, as such was also all that the law of the State was concerned with, was that the court sustained the law and State as constitutionally and properly enforces, therefore, that none of the three had broken the peace, to man, nor broken the public peace, they had not committed any crime known to the laws of Maryland, and were impressively urged. But Judge Robinson on the bench to show any injustice of so enforcing the Maryland Sunday law by putting Seventh-day Adventists in the same class, that they therefore held these constants who observed the Sabbath actually, the violation of the Sabbath on account of bodily rest, they enforced the law from the constitution, to jail.

Further matters will be heard from further.
