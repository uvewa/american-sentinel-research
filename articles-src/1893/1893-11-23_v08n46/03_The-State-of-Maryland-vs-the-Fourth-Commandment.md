The Circuit Court of Queen Anne's County, Maryland, has decided, Judges Robinson, Wickes, and Stump on the bench, that whether or no the fourth commandment says that the seventh day is the Sabbath and must be remembered, nevertheless the laws of Maryland affirm that the first day is the Lord's day, and must be observed as the Sabbath. As an object lesson for the enforcement of this, Isaac Baker, Geo. W. Marvel, and Milton A. Bryan, Seventh-day Adventists and conscientious Christian men, have received the sentence of, "Five dollars and costs with confinement in the county jail till the amount is paid," and are to-day within the walls and bars of Centreville jail. The offense of Isaac Baker was plowing in his field; that of George Marvel, supposedly setting out tomato plants, as he was seen in his garden making motions such as one might at that work, and the complaining witness, on going there, found newly-set plants. In this case Samuel Marvel, the son of the defendant, was both the prosecuting witness and the constable who made the arrest. In the third case, that of Milton Bryan, the witnesses saw him at a distance doing what they "took to be" cutting up bushes; they came nearer while he also approached them, and in plain sight, at his woodpile, chopped some firewood, then taking up a shovel threw something together into a heap in his garden. For such causes, which were offenses against no man, these three men, with families dependent upon their daily labor, are deprived of their liberty.

Besides these three there were four other similar cases to come before the court at the same time, but, in the case of Charles O. Ford, his brothers, who were the complaining witnesses, had, without the knowledge of the defendant, paid the fine and costs imposed in the lower court, and thus secured the removal of the case from the docket. Alexander Dodd was acquitted of one case, and in a second, the cases of himself and Joseph Warram were dismissed because of a fatal variance between the papers, sent up by the justice in the court below, and the facts.

Although out of the seven trials that were expected to be had there were but three convictions, yet from the demeanor of the court and the temper shown by all concerned in the prosecutions, it is evident that while the present spirit continues no Seventh-day Adventist can expect to escape. It should be mentioned that as the cases came before the court on Friday, Nov. 10, and but two of the four tried were finished that day, the remainder were postponed until Monday, Nov. 13. It did not appear whether this was due to the respect of the court for the defendants' observance of the seventh day, or from consideration to the request of the defendants' attorney, Mr. James T. Ringgold, of Baltimore, who exhausted in their defense every device of the skilful lawyer applicable to the situation, and made also in their behalf the appeal of an earnest advocate.

Each case was tried before a jury, and to them and the court Mr. Ringgold made, among others, the point that Sunday was not the Sabbath and no observance was due it other than a civil observance, and that, as such was also all that the law of Maryland, or any civil law, could constitutionally and properly enforce, therefore, as the defendants had injured or disturbed no man, nor broken the public peace, they had not committed any crime known to the laws of Maryland, and were improperly held. But neither judges nor jury seemed to show any intention of secularizing the Maryland Sunday law by putting upon it any such profane construction as that; they therefore held these consistent Bible Christians to be guilty of profanation of the Sabbath on account of bodily labor done on Sunday, and committed them to jail.

This matter will be heard from further.
