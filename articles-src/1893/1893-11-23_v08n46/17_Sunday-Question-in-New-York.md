THE question whether a man may fish on Sunday in the State of New York is now before the Court of Appeals. The case in which this question is to be decided is that of Robert H. Morey, who was arrested on July 3, 1891, for fishing on Sunday in the preserve of the Orange County Anglers' Club, of which he is a member. The case has gone from the local Justice Court to the Court of Appeals at great expense and different troubles and vexations. If the final decisions of the courts acquit Mr. Morel it will make it necessary forever hereafter to produce every fish caught with the words "It was not on Sunday."
