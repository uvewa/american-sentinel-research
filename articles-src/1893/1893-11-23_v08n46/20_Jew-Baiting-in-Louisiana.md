A CONSIDERABLE number of the "leading citizens" of St. Mary's parish, Louisiana, lately began a very energetic anti-Semitic movement. The Jewish storekeepers of Franklin, the principal town in the parish, were ordered to leave within ten days, and were so intimidated by the threats made to "run them out of the country," that they were preparing to go, when Judge Allen, of that district, interfered in their behalf and promised them protection. In several other parishes of the State the Jews have also been ordered out. The roll of dishonor is increasing; to the religious persecutions of Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Maryland, can now be added the Jew-baiting of Louisiana.
