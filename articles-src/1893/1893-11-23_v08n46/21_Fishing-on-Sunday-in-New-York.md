THE question whether a man may fish on Sunday in the State of New York is now before the Court of Appeals. The case in which this question is to be decided is that of Robert H. Moses, who was arrested on July 5, 1892, for fishing on Sunday in the preserves of the Orange County Anglers' Club, of which he is a member. Mr. Moses has carried the case from the Justice Court to the Court of Appeals at an expense to himself of nearly eight hundred dollars and infinite trouble and vexation. If the final decision of the court is against Mr. Moses it will make it necessary forever hereafter to preface every fish story with the words—"It was not on Sunday."
