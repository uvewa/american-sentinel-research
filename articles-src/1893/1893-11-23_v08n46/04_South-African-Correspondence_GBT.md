In former communications to the SENTINEL I referred to the agitation in the Colonial Parliament for laws concerning the observance of Sunday, and also mentioned some facts regarding the Sunday law already in existence. Parliament has since adjourned without touching the matter. Numerous petitions were presented, principally by the Dutch Reformed Church, praying for a more puritanical observance of Sunday. The petitioners did not so much ask for more rigorous laws, as for the enforcement of those that are now on the statute books. It is difficult to conceive how they could get a law that would be much more strict than the one now in existence (or that they consider in existence, but which is really repealed, as shown in a former letter).

But the time of the general election being at hand, the members of the honorable body were rather timid in taking hold of the matter. They all wanted to "come back again," and as public opinion was divided on the question, they were fearful that they would be found on the wrong side to please their constituents, who would, in consequence thereof, "knife them at the polls." To antagonize the measure would be to array themselves against the so-called religious part of their constituency, some of whom had already expressed themselves in resolutions. At a recent meeting of the Presbyterian Conference, held in Swellendam, Cape Colony, a committee appointed to consider the matter of Sunday observance, reported as follows:—

> This assembly feels called upon to request the moderator of the church to prepare forms of petitions to Parliament, to be sent to their congregations for signature; and declares that the time has arrived when they, as ministers and elders, are called upon to use their influence at elections to send to Parliament, men who will oppose Sabbath desecration.

As they did not think it "wise statesmanship" to oppose, the matter was passed over for the time being. The above resolution is similar to one that was passed by some religious bigots in America, as follows:—

> Resolved, That we do hereby pledge ourselves and each other, that we will from this time henceforth, refuse to vote for, or support for any office or position of trust, any member of Congress, either senator or representative, who shall vote for any further aid for the World's Fair, except on the conditions named in these resolutions (that the Fair be closed on Sunday).

It is easily seen that the motive power behind both of these resolutions is the same. It is that august personage, known as a deceiver, and in fable representations, said to have cloven feet.

All the agitation here concerning Sunday laws is made by the clergy, which shows at once that Sunday legislation is religious, and that it is religious bigotry clamoring for the power to force the conscience, and compel the minority to worship according to the consciences of the majority. A meeting of the Evangelical Alliance was held not long since in Cape Town. The object of the meeting was to urge on Parliament the necessity of more stringent laws for the observance of Sunday. All ministers and church officers in the city and suburbs were invited to be present. During the discussion, one gentleman, a clergyman, who was present, ventured to suggest that all were not agreed as to which day was the Sabbath, that the measures, if carried out, would conflict with those who observed another day, and asked if it would not lead to persecution for conscience' sake. He was asked by the chairman, if he was not a Seventh-day Adventist. On replying in the affirmative, he was summarily informed by the presiding officer that he must keep quiet, as no one would be heard except those who were in favor of the movement. This displays the despotism in all movements in favor of compulsory Sunday laws. Those who oppose the making of the laws are stigmatized as "law-breakers," "anarchists," etc., and are proscribed as among the off-scourings of the earth. When once the laws are secured, they are then made to feel the vengeance of a bigoted majority. In Russia they are sent to the barren wastes of Siberia, in the United States they are sent to prison and worked in the chain gang with brutalized criminals, and here in this colony they have a law which confiscates all the offender's property to the benefit of the State. The strangest of all is that the United States should engage in such a wicked work. The eyes of the world are turned to the United States, and as they see her engaged in such an unholy business they wonder. Not long since at a meeting where the writer and some others were talking in reference to the work of persecution now commenced in America, a gentleman who was present asked in astonishment, what we could mean. When we explained the matter to him he was amazed beyond expression, and could scarcely believe that such could be the case. He wanted some SENTINELS that he might read for himself some of the devilish proceedings. I could better understand then, how the United States, having led all nations away from Rome, will, by commencing to persecute, lead all nations back to the "mother of harlots."

At the magistrates' court here, Oct. 9, 1893, the cases of several persons who were accused of selling goods on Sunday were heard. The articles sold were fruit, cigars and tobacco. An Indian and a Greek, were fined thirty shillings; five others were fined a pound each; and another unfortunate individual, who had been convicted of the same crime (?) before, was fined three pounds, the extreme limit of the law.

Thus the Sunday juggernaut moves on in the earth, seeking to exalt itself, by force, to the place of the true Sabbath, the seventh day.

Cape Town, Oct. 11, 1893.
