Apply This to Sunday.

The following is from an Irish paper:—

MR. JOHNSTON—I beg to ask the Chief Secretary for Ireland whether his attention has been directed to the case, reported on November 14, of five men employed by Mr. Kelly informed five partners employed in Mr. Conn's brewery, Dundalk, that if they continued to work on Sunday they would be prosecuted, because they declined to leave off work the men were denounced they left their work and resumed it. It appears that their only offence was working on Sunday, namely as stated in the gentleman's question, I do not see that any prosecution has taken place. Whether his Grace can remedy the matter in which the test the recurrence of such action on the part of the police?

Mr. Johnston is a member of Parliament and Mr. Morley Chief Secretary for Ireland. The question put implied that a priest had no right to interfere with men because they worked on a mainly set day of other than religious holiday. But it is a very great grant that such interference is proper. His way and improper for a priest to denounce men for working on a saint's day than for the hypocrites Sunday law preachers to denounce men for working on Sunday?

It is Not Decided!

ROMANISM is in a sweet mood these days. They are as pleasant as a day in June. They are profuse in their declarations of loyalty to this country and its institutions. They talk very loud for a free conscience and freedom of schools all is the liberties were due to their efforts, and, under their direction, are safe. A correspondent of the *Catholic Standard* has been lately carrying favor in this wise. The most conspicuous is in favor of the educational proposition in its most advanced form. It is wonderful the effect which the Columbia Exposition has had on the Catholic mind. But what does it all mean? Has there been a change of policy on the part of Rome; are we to see a new era of friendship toward Protestant Christians? This is the question. Is the spirit of the papacy more benevolent, humanity ready to live with Protestantism side by side, as the Republic and its institutions were designed to permit. The answer is an absolute negative on both sides. But Americans are not blind to this, no more are the Jesuits, who are so amiable. They have not made their laws friendly to our American civil law any more. Jesuits rejoice, but they have a displacement too. This is the history of the Jesuit policy and policy on his part, and that of his supporters. Their position is best expressed in the question—what is she and what she may become— that, and all the way one thing to the man who is willing to see the truth. For men, though, their sorrowings and merciless inquisitions are not wasted on the surface. Their device, their cunning, and nation grows with growing provocation to more wickedness.
