ROMANISTS are in a sweet mood these days. They are preaching up charity at a great rate. They are profuse in their declarations of loyalty to country and love to its institutions. They talk very glibly about the Republic, as if they owned it and as if its liberties were due to their efforts, and under their special guardianship. Chicago has been fairly overrun with smooth speeches in favor of the educational and religious institutions of the land. It is wonderful the effect which the Columbian year has had upon Romiei liberality. But what does it all mean? Has there been a change of heart in Jesuitism? Are we to see a new era of friendship toward Protestantism? Is the Roman Catholic hierarchy really in love with Protestant development? This Republic is the product of the principles and life of Protestantism. But Americans are not blind to facts, nor are they ready to shut their eyes to Jesuitic intrigue. They hear much just now about the good points in Leo, but they have no disposition to encourage his advances. It is a fine stroke of policy on his part, and that of his supporters, to fall in with the current and exalt America—what she is and what she may become—but he and they are working for ulterior ends, and discerning Protestants see through their cunning devices, and will watch the movements of Rome under various guises with growing vigilance.
