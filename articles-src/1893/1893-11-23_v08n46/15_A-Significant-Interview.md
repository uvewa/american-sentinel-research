A PROMINENT Catholic in Washington, in an interview with a representative of the New York World, said:—

> Archbishop Satolli becomes more and more impressed all the time with the United States and her institutions. He is enthusiastic indeed about our great arena for the battle of human progress and he wants to see, and expects to see, Catholicism having a leading part in all the work. It is everything, even for so great a man as the apostolic delegate, to gather his information at first hand—to see for himself, as the phrase is.

> This Archbishop Satolli is doing as rapidly as possible; and every time he returns here it is with increased encouragement in his work. The rest of all this of course is to advance the church in America, in the eyes of the supreme pontiff and to insure it consideration at Rome that it has never enjoyed before. As a matter of fact, Leo is looking to America for that distinct triumph of his policy which is to insure him the title he so much comes—that of "The Pope of the People." His work in France is great, but his work in the United States is even greater. This is the larger field. Here the people have been born to the estate of freedom, and to that of self-government and Leo wants Catholicism to go hand in hand with popular suffrage.

Such things are significant, and especially when taken in connection with the trend of public sentiment in the United States Homeward. The coming of Satolli, the Catholic Congress, and the World's Parliament of Religions have directed all eyes toward Rome as never before in the history of the country, and the increase of the popish influence is simply astounding. Nor is this remarkable turning toward Rome confined to the United States; all the world is wondering after the beast.
