The papers report that at the recent Boston meeting of the League of Railway Trainmen a resolution was adopted declaring against Sunday trains. Commenting on this fact, a paper of this city says:—

> There are some considerations involved which are amply conclusive against the wisdom of such a resolution, and we are confident that when railway workmen examine them carefully they will refuse to maintain the position the league is said to have taken, and this, without reference to the Church and State issue, which is the real question at the bottom of all Sunday law agitation.

The population of the cities increases in a much more rapid ratio than does that of the country. It is not necessary to our present purpose to inquire regarding the cause of this difference, we are here concerned only with the fact, and the sequences. The rich and moderately well-to-do city residents have, most of them, homes in the suburbs, or at least some distance removed from the crowded centers, and hence are not directly so vitally interested in the question of transit. But the masses of the people are forced to live in close quarters, contiguous to their work, and so their surroundings are often unsanitary to a degree, and even when not so bad as the worst, are far from healthful or desirable in other ways. By millions so situated Sunday is hailed as a day of release. On cheap excursion trains and boats they flock into the country and to the seashore or to the marge of some inland lake. They get away from the noise and dust and unwholesome odors of the city. The restful, cooling green of forest and meadow delights eyes strained by the glare reflected from towering walls of brick and stone. Children dance and roll and play merry games upon the sand or under the trees. They watch in wondering awe the incoming and receding tides, or with bare feet and rolled-up clothes wade in the limpid waters. To old and young is brought relaxation, rest and quickened pulses, but the benefit to the children is greater than to the elders. They are growing, and they need every touch with nature that can be given them. To none, however, is it less than a positive blessing, and he is an enemy of his kind who would lift a finger in opposition to the weekly outflow into the country and to lake and ocean.

Then there are other multitudes who have relatives and friends in the country, and in neighboring villages, towns and cities. On Sunday, with proper traveling facilities, they can hold delightful family reunions or make and receive pleasant visits to and from valued friends and agreeable acquaintances. Or they can go and hear a lecture or attend an entertainment in some other place. All these varied forms of recreation, entertainment and instruction are rendered possible by the Sunday train, electric or cable car, and boat. They are all innocent and health-bestowing. The trouble is that there are not half enough trains and boats running on Sunday.

In view of these self-evident facts, and many more equally unassailable, it is a matter of amazement that any laboring man can oppose Sunday trains. All classes of workingmen are benefited by them, and this is especially true of trainmen themselves. It is perfectly easy, with the power possessed by organized labor, to so arrange business that each man will get his weekly rest-day without depriving any other person of the opportunity to go into the country, to the seashore, or on a visit on Sunday.

This shows how strong are the holiday tendencies against which friends of Sunday sacredness protest so loudly. But their protest is in vain. Whatever may be true of Sunday labor, Sunday recreation, Sunday play, is bound to increase. The rapid growth of our cities makes this inevitable. Enforced idleness on a given day in cities cannot fail to make it a holiday. Civil law can never make a holy day. It does make holidays, and it is fast making little else of Sunday.
