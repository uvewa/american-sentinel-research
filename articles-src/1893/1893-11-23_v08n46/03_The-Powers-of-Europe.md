THE powers of Europe must settle their great standing armies. They must fight out their final battles on the prophetic battle fields. Nevertheless, here, on this western continent, too, can come the last struggle of its races. Here blood that will not out will burn hot. Color prejudice is not ending. Race blood is increasing. The right hand of fellowship is no longer offered to the alien. He will still come. There will be strife. And where the battle is there the vultures will gather.
