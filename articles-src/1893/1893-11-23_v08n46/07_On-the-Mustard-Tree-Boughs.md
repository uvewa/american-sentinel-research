Like the mustard tree of Christ's parable, the Parliament of Religions, at Chicago, gave hospitality to a great variety of habitation. The gatherings were very different from that of Pentecost, although from the analogue pronounced upon this great assembly many Christians were compelled to associate the two. There are few parallels.

Representatives of many nations were in the upper chambers at Jerusalem, and representatives of many nations met at Chicago. A religious element is noticeable in both of these historic gatherings, but the object of meeting can hardly be said to have been the same. There in the multitude was as simple and direct in its manner and purpose as at any time. That the results will tend in the same direction, in the nature of the Gospel, would be very seriously doubted.

That exhibiting the best motive and intentions to those persons who covered the place has been exercised I do not in all cases so thoroughly, and who find their efforts crowned with success for that as any one ever come together with, has no likeness to the cause of religion or humanity. None can fly or even grow. They are blown to a mustard seed, because, though not growing the seeds, it becomes great among the trees, and because on its leafy branches and the cover of its wide-spread found shelter and a resting place. Like many fair-looking and the tree not fashioned by Christianity to nurture religious systems. Their have perched by invitation. The mustard tree with its overhanging great boughs. The sight has been unusual.

Some sermons, a short time ago, many sermons have been preached upon this exhibition in respect to a religious action, and some clergymen the great Parliament has appeared as the crown and acme of the whole World's Fair. Preachers have waxed warm with these themes and have put themselves upon high ground. Let us with wonder to invite missionary programs. Such a scheme in connection with the foreign mission fields is beyond that of almost any sect of the ministry, it is reported as saying that the Christian religions would be safe in the Chicago Parliament, because it is the handiwork of God and religion nothing, but the living truth. Truth cannot suffer by contact with anything human. Human sects and sectrust only serve to make the genuine truth all the more glorious by contrast. The great men of the old and widely practiced religions of Asia, who came to the Chicago, may go away with a greater admiration and higher appreciation of our civilization, and the account they will render of their trip to Chicago may be in the path of the missionary smoother.

There have even passed a more glorious display of the grandeur of the kingdom of heaven does not come by observation, but by quiet, unheralded progress through weeks of immense assemblings and stirring addresses. The world will never be captured by way such meetings over and over.

To say that truth cannot suffer by contact with error, and that each only makes the resultant contrast only serve to make the position esthete who ever met anyone at an intellectual plane.

Truth is of God and must ultimately prevail; nevertheless God does not seek, and is often wounded in the house of his professed friends. To those who are wondering at the great Parliament of Religions, it and its objects is a clue to wondrous import. It marks as never before, should not the false and the true doctrine be genuinely represented by men.

Men are intoxicated with an and want more. Among the highly cultivated many are outwardly Christians as were those who were washed and blistered in the days of the apostles. But the cry is always so that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. This is addressed particularly to those who are burdened with the convictions of guilt before God. This is man's supreme burden, his sin on every account, for they are as heavy as the weight that otherwise must sink the being into the uttermost. There is but one remedy for sin in all the world. There is but one Mediator between God and man—Jesus Christ. There is in Christ one door by which if a man enters he shall be saved. Christ is the only Redeemer, the one Mediator, the only way, the one door of hope opened, if not the end of human bitterness. In the salvation which he offers is an atonement, by virtue of which every obligation of the law receives from truth a new power. No religion but Christianity, and that of the resurrected Christ alone, offers redemption. Therefore, because there is but one Saviour, one Redeemer, one Lord, one Spirit, all, the ministers of his gospel, to be as free how they make a platform of Christianity broad enough to accommodate the believers of all religions that are not of Christ. The Chicago Parliament has practically to a number attained fashioned a number of man-made religions.

Asia Asiatic will undoubtedly feel kindly toward the land of the free, and alongside of the one genuine religion, as many a man has established himself alongside their terms on the virtues of their respective faiths. We are not told that any of the representatives of the Asiatic religions will land close their doors and go home flying the banner of Calvary. In his paper — "Hinduism," Virchand Ghandi, a Hindu, said, "What we want instead of being a mere matter of faith, the religion of the Hindus is based on reason, and a science of religion may not be so much, a dream as is imagined by persons pledged to certain conclusions." Holding, therefore, these views on the nature of religion, and having at heart the great benefit of a common basis of religion for all men, he submitted the following points: "1. Belief in a living God. 2. Belief in the existence of an after-mundane state of conscious existence." That all, he said, he believed reassociable and verification by action. "Then principles for a possible universal religion might stand or fall on their merits, being free from condemnation of any philosophy or revelation already enjoyed.

"Salvation by action," forsooth! How is that matched by the "vile of the heathen?" The heathen man is a man with a heart and hears on likeness whatever to the fruits of the Spirit of God or the fruits of faith. "By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified." And yet they would make universal religion propositional at Chicago, to be accepted or rejected by the individual dream. And shall the soldiers of the cross cringe or waver because the hordes of these countries religions meet in the very marching ground of the very vanguard of the believers. How long will the Lord hold the winds of strife? The period is last where there is in no early prospect of a return to normal conditions. We have consort with men of creeds so numerous, so varied, so false, that the worldly Parliaments have lost the pharmacy, but they are not of God. All men pray? Let no man kneel to Jeanette to any but God. Let him know the name of Jesus, and he shall be lifted up.

"Hinduism of the New Congress," was the theme of the Rev. Ashitosh Datta, LL.B. who is a friend of Mr. Ghandi. He says of him and his paper: "He is a true son of India, a man of the highest aspiration, and the audience was interested in that which he said. This is a striking illustration of the religious instinct of nations." This, and all of this, added to the claim of the parliament of religions at Chicago, is humiliating, that it, the striving for the universal religion, degrading to the intellect of mankind, especially for men in distinction, further, for the study of nature furnish all the law and all the liberty that the family, community, society and humanity need." True, these are not Christians; their grasp of the true religions was not meant to be held in. As India looked and pained to contemplate, that there was no meaning or teaching in the Parliament. So few have made over before those fairly equal them. For man to make the sorrowing and greatest.

Aye! But in the "ideal" religion!—"Salvation by action!" What a miserable thing! Not over again. Christianity, it is true, works by faith and practice. But the Holy Ghost. It preaches Hinduism and practiced in life. But Christ is in all, above all, tempted in all points like as we, that human "ideal" is a patchwork of both themes that are tempted. Do we want or need Christianity? Or these

No antiquity of years, no widespread diffusion of a religion through uncounted multitudes of human kind, no overmastering to beauty or mystery, can place a religion in the ranks of truth. This is so and needs no proof. This is as a mountain among other facts in argument. We carry out the plan man is connected. We carry out and put forth service and do both the service of God, and we know that these subordinations facts contain with these subordinations further. We must not look outward to Babylon for these things, nor to Medo-Persia for alliance will lead to disaster as they did to the Jews. When we are to the school of Christ let us learn there. God's school is God's people, enlightened and instructed by the word and the spirit. Here lies our strength in God. Not need we any other ballot. All is in the magnificent coat of patchwork which deft fingers would
