Rev. Dr. Scudder, pastor of Jersey City Tabernacle, sees roseate hues in the political horizon, the first beams of a better day in municipal, State and National rule; and all the result of the late election. Referring to the result in New Jersey, he said in a recent sermon:—

> One peculiar feature of this moral revolution was the interest taken in it by the churches and the cooperation of all the sects against a common enemy. There was a prodigious moral current in this election, and in my judgment it marks a new epoch in both politics and religion. Hereafter these two forces are to be combined. A religion that cannot enter politics is not worth having. Christianity is heaven, not sawdust. Its business is to quicken, to put moral life into political dough.

> Not until recent years have we ministers of the gospel done our duty toward our country. We were afraid to bring politics into our pulpits—cowards that we were! But all this has changed and when great moral interests are concerned, we shall speak out like men. We are here to build up the kingdom of righteousness, and one of the best ways to accomplish that result is to purify politics. The modern clergyman is becoming more courageous and cannot be quieted or bluffed by low-down politicians, who cry "keep politics out of your pulpits." Our churches are moral forts, from which we shall pour shot and shell into all forms of wickedness.

> Sectarianism is dying out, and cooperation between the various sects of Christendom is already an assured fact. Even Protestants and Catholics are learning to work shoulder to shoulder in behalf of good government and a variety of useful reforms.

> I am proud to say that the churches of Hudson County had much to do with this recent election. They will have more to do in years to come.

The doctor forgets that rings have been "smashed" before and new ones formed in their stead. He who looks to political agencies for the moral reformation of man must look in vain. Human nature does not change, and political corruption is the legitimate and inevitable fruit of human greed. It is well to "smaah" the rings occasionally; and all who had a part in "smashing" the particular rings in question are entitled to credit for it; but churches in politics, as churches, are a dangerous force, and it is far from reassuring to be told that Protestants and Catholics are learning to work together shoulder to shoulder. Good may come of it occasionally, but it must in the end result in disaster to free institutions.
