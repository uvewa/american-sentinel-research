The State cannot do the work that has been assigned to the Church by her Lord. When it undertakes that work, it ceases to be the work of Christ and becomes antichrist. The Church of Christ cannot retain her purity and do the work of politicians. The question arises, Where shall the line be drawn between the civil power and the work of the gospel? There must be a clear distinction; their work though not antagonistic, is not interchangeable.

There is no work that the State and Church can do in conjunction, acting as Church and State. They cannot join hands except at the peril of the legitimate work of both, and therefore a clear-cut line of separation should ever be maintained between them. Any infringement of this condition is fraught with danger, not only to the citizen, but to the cause of true religion and of true statecraft as well.

These words are written with a profound impression that they convey the truth upon this vital question, with the earnest prayer that this truth may be deeply impressed on the mind of every reader, and with the ardent wish that it might become the ruling sentiment of our country at large; for herein lies our public safety, the integrity of the Government, the security of individual rights, and the success of the gospel. Some who adopt this position in theory desire to see it modified in actual practice, and do not hesitate to curry favors for their church from the civil power. There are some people who are totally opposed to any union of State and Church when it means their State and somebody else's Church, but look very pleasantly upon the scheme when it is their State and their Church. Indeed, this is where the great majority of the people really stand upon this subject.

But there is a better place for honest people, and many such there are, who seek for right principles, and having found them, are willing to abide by them wherever the lines may be drawn. Such our readers are taken to be. It is in this confidence that the position before stated has been taken, that the separation of the Church from the civil power should be entire and complete. In taking this position no one places himself alongside the infidel or the anarchist. He who stands on these grounds stands by the Bible. He stands in the full light of the genius of Christianity and is in accord with the teachings of its great Founder. History justifies the stand he has taken, and every consideration of justice declares that his position is right.
