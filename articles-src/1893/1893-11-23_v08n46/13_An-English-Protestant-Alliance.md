An English exchange contains an account of the Protestant Alliance, its object and work, from which this extract is made:—

> The object of the Protestant Alliance is to maintain and defend against all the encroachments of popery, the scriptural doctrines of the Reformation and the principles of religious liberty, as the best security under God for the temporal and spiritual welfare of the British empire.

And for this purpose: "To unite the Protestants of the empire in a firm and persevering demand, both in Parliament and out of it, that the national support and encouragement given to popery of late years should be discontinued. In this demand would be included all endorsements of popery in every form and of every kind drawn from the public revenues, concession of rank and precedence to Roman ecclesiastics, and the allowance of conventual establishments, not subject to the inspection and control of the law."

It seems that organizations to unite Protestants against the encroachments of Roman Catholics are not confined to this country alone.
