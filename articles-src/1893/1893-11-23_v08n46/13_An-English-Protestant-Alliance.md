An English "Protestant Alliance."

An English ecclesiastical weekly, the official organ of the Protestant Alliance, its object is to maintain:—

> That the Protestant has a first claim to maintain and defend against all the encroachments of popery the principles of the Reformation. (2) That the exercise of all spiritual and ecclesiastical authority under God for the temporal and spiritual benefit of the Church requires its absolute separation from the State.

And for this purpose: "To unite the Protestants of the Empire on a firm and general movement against the present fearful encroachments of popery, support and encouragement given to popery of late years should be discontinued. In this demand would be included all inducements of popery in the Queen's prisons, the Army and Navy, the reformatories, orphanages, of rank and prominence granted to persons professing the Roman Catholic faith or in sympathy with Roman Catholicism, and control of the State.

It seems that organizations to unite Protestants against the encroachments of Roman Catholic are not confined to this country alone.
