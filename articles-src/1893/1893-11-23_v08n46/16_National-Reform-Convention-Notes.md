AT the time of closing this paper, the National Reform Convention in Allegheny City, Pa., has not yet finished its work, but the SENTINEL has a representative on the ground, and adequate reports will be furnished in due season.

THIS convention is in some respects in larger and more enthusiastic than former conventions held under the auspices of the National Reform Association. Up to the time of writing this note, the several papers read have been unusually able, and suggest that nothing can be as far in advance of them it has been forced to do thus far in this convention.

The purpose of the National Reformers, as revealed in the resolutions presented at the first meeting of the convention, is to immediately follow up the practical work already done in Congress, and the Supreme Court. Already a variety of results. A committee is to be sent to Washington to get Congress to recognize work for it. The amendment to the national Constitution, rendered really unnecessary by the Supreme Court decision, is to be urged; but every effort will be put forth to secure the passage of a national Sunday law. The enemies of liberty and of true statesmanship are at work.

On another page is a short article, from the *Central Baptist,* "Born in New England," which is significant not only for the fact it reveals, namely, the growth of the Roman Catholic in New England as it exceeds that number of all the numbers of Protestant churches combined," but also for the unsound advice. And what is the remedy? It is substance, that Protestantism must have some or "command correctly," or ask, "for the fields now delivered unto the saints." Modern Protestantism has ceased to be aggressive and has become utterly colorless as to those doctrines once locked upon as essential to vital piety and an inculcated by the Protestant pulpit; Christianity is now little more than a system of ethics, scarcely distinguishable from the better phases of this false system which it recently met upon a level in Chicago in its Parliament of Religions.

Sound doctrine is essential to sound faith. The inspired charge to the minister of Christ is: "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine." And why? "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine." Has not that time fully come? and is not that fact the reason why Rome dominates that section of the country was the stronghold of Protestantism?

The gospel, the whole gospel, meets exactly the wants of the human soul. But unmatured, it becomes "another gospel," impotent to lift man out of his sins and into God's provision to change the heart and to transform the life, utterly inadequate to meet the deep wants of the human soul, and its thirst for the streams of living water. Denial has the water of life by those who professed to be dispensing it, is it any wonder that multitudes turn to Rome?

But this suggests another thought. If a failure to preach the whole gospel, the real gospel, has resulted in such large accessions to the ranks of the Papacy in the United States, does it not follow that the most effective way to counteract the growth of the Papacy is by preaching the pure gospel? It was thus that Luther broke the power of Rome from the Pope; ruled supremes in Christendom; and shall Christians now resort to other methods? Shall they deny Christ and the power of his truth by resorting to good methods in realizing Rome? Nay, verily, let us not go down into Egypt, but let us oppose popish craft and deception with the living truth of God's eternal and ever-present words, which caused light to shine out of darkness in the beginning, and which is now pledged to renew the human soul and to exhibit the exhibitors well, casting light to shine out of the moral darkness of superstition and sin.

A commentator of the *Mail and Express* (of New York) to a *Missionary* of Monroe, writing to that paper from November, that State, says: "Not far from here a Seventh-day Adventist has been persecuted in many ways. Not long since they burned his wheat in the stack. This means of punishing this man for working Sunday was exercised by 'benevolent' Baptists of West Virginia "who so enthusiastically believes the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as a Sabbath and actually refrains from all secular labor and business on that day," cannot be punished for devoting the first day to secular purposes.

A REMARKABLE number of the "leading citizens" of St. Mary's parish, Louisiana, boldly began a very energetic anti-Semitic movement. The Jewish storekeepers of Franklin, the principal town in the parish, were ordered to leave within ten days, and were so intimidated by the threats made to "run them out of the country," that they were preparing to go, when Judge Allen, of that district, interfered in their behalf and promised them protection. In several other parishes of this State the Jews have also been ordered
