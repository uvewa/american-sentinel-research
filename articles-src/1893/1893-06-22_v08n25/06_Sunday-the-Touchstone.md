Instead of issuing a proclamation ordering the Columbian Exposition to be closed on Sunday, May 28, and ordering troops to keep it closed, the President went yachting down the Potomac on that day. Concerning this fact the Mail and Express' Washington correspondent says:

No wonder the minor officials of the Government tarry in their work of carrying out the Sabbath-closing law, when the heads of the Government themselves openly violate the express will of the people and desecrate the Lord's own day by yachting excursions down the river.

All the pulpits of the churches at the Capital yesterday were filled with eminent divines of the Presbyterian Church, and had the President so desired he could have listened to words of wisdom as well as arguments why the law of the Nation should be upheld and the World's Fair be closed on Sunday. But instead Mr. Cleveland preferred a Sunday excursion down the river on a steam yacht, while the Sabbath bells were still ringing out their welcome to churchgoers. Mr. Cleveland, accompanied by his Secretary of the Treasury and his Ambassador to England, boarded the pleasure yacht of W. R. Hearst, of California, and steamed off for a day's excursion down the Potomac.

The boat was well stocked with provisions, and "dry and wet" lunch was served before the party reached home.

This action of the President on the day when the law was being violated in Chicago by the inaction of his Attorney General has caused no small amount of criticism here.

wanted to show to the public that he favored Sunday desecration, and if he could not go to the World's Fair, he did the next best thing, and went yachting.

In this regard, it may be mentioned that it is stated here that Secretary of State Gresham used all his influence with Attorney-General Olney to let the World's Fair be open. It is said that heavy Chicago influence was brought to bear on Gresham, and he in turn informed Olney that to close the Fair by injunction meant its utter failure. The result is too well known to need further remark.

Some time ago Mr. Cleveland forbade the holding of a Sunday concert; it was at once proclaimed to the world by the Sunday people that the President was a Christian. Now he has displeased them by disregarding their ideas of Sunday sacredness, and he is a desecrater of the Lord's day, and a wine bibber! And thus it appears that loyalty to Sunday is the great touchstone by which every man's Christianity is to be tried.
