wanted to show to the public that he has banned Sunday day observance; and it does not go far to the church.

In this regard it may be mentioned that it is well known to need further remark.

Some time ago Mr. Cleveland forbade the holding of a Sunday concert; it was announced with the evident purpose of showing Sunday people that the President was a Sunday keeper, the attempt being made by disparaging their ideas of Sunday observance, Lord's day, and a wine ribbon! And then it is expected that this loyalty be bound to the great "institutions" by which every man's Christianity is to be tested.
