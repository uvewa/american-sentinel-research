It is stated that Circuit Court Judge Rogers of Tennessee has refused to give instructions for General Laws with regard to Seventh-day Adventists; leaving them to prosecute the Adventists, and if anybody wants them prosecuted he must get his own counsel and act at prosecuting witnesses. Thus for the present gives a stop to the organized persecutions of Seventh-day Adventists in Judge Seligman's court.
