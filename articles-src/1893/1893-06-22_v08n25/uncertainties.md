# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, June 22, 1893 (v08n25)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from B&W scanned page images at moderate resolution. The text throughout is very small, approximately 6-7pt type in three columns per page. Many passages, especially in the longer articles, were difficult to read with full confidence. The uncertainties below highlight the most significant issues, but readers should be aware that the overall transcription confidence for this issue is MEDIUM due to scan quality and small text size.

## Page 1, Editorial (Article 01)

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "...must in the very nature of things seek elsewhere for that power he fails to have but which he must wield, and because he senses the aim from whence it alone comes."
- **Confidence:** LOW — The sentence structure in this paragraph is awkward and may contain misreadings. The words "wield" and "senses the aim" are uncertain.
- **Reason:** Very small print, dense text in column 3

- **Transcribed as:** "But can the true friends of Sunday close in the Lord to maintain the fair name of that institution..."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "close in the Lord" seems unusual; may be "choose" or "trust"
- **Reason:** Small print difficult to distinguish individual letters

- **Transcribed as:** "Is departure from the true source of spiritual power—the Lord Jesus Christ? It certainly is."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — Context suggests this is the intended meaning but surrounding sentence fragments are unclear

## Page 2-3, "The Basis of Sunday Laws" (Article 02)

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **General note:** This article spans from page 2 left column through page 3 top left. Many portions of the text were very difficult to read due to small print size.
- **Confidence:** LOW for several passages in the body text
- **Specific issues:**
  - The block quote about Sunday closing ("no one who gives any thought...") may have missing or garbled words
  - The section under "NOT A PHYSICAL NECESSITY" has several passages that were extremely difficult to read
  - The "Birmingham" section on page 2 right column has uncertain text
  - The argument about physical rest and sleep hours contains passages that may not be accurately transcribed

- **Author:** "W. A. V." with location "London, England." — This author is not in the known author list for the American Sentinel. The initials are clearly readable.

## Pages 3-4, "The United States vs. the World's Fair" (Article 03)

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **General note:** This long legal article contains extensive quotations from judicial opinions. The legal language combined with very small print made accurate transcription challenging.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM overall, LOW for some quoted passages
- **Specific issues:**
  - Judge Woods' opinion contains complex legal reasoning that may have transcription errors
  - Judge Grosscup's opinion at the end of the article was particularly difficult to read
  - The date at the end of the article: transcribed as "Chicago, June 11, '86" but likely should be "Chicago, June 11, '93" — the date was partially obscured

## Page 4, "Opposed to the Boycott" (Article 04)

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — Several portions of the quoted text from The Christian Union were difficult to read
- **Reason:** Small print, particularly in the middle column area

## Pages 4-5, "The Union of Church and State" (Article 05)

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **General note:** This lengthy historical essay was particularly challenging due to small print and complex subject matter.
- **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM — Many passages may contain misreadings
- **Author:** "G. E. F." with "Battle Creek, Mich." — identified as G. E. Fifield based on known author list and location

  - Several philosophical passages about church-state relations may have word-level errors

## Pages 5-6, "Sunday the Touchstone" (Article 06)

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
