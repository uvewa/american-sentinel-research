# Uncertainties — v08n25, June 22, 1893

## Article 01 — "Maryland Sunday Law Persecution"

**Author attribution:** The article ends with "B." on page 2. This is taken to be CPB (C. P. Bollman), as his name appears on the masthead as Associate Editor. The single letter "B." matches "Bollman." Confidence: MEDIUM — plausible but not confirmed with full initials.

**OCR reading:** Page 1, paragraph 4 — "satth the Lord" appears to be an OCR error for "saith the Lord." Transcribed as "satth" to preserve what the OCR captured, but the original almost certainly reads "saith."

**Second pass completed:** Yes. The phrase reads "satth the Lord" in the OCR source. The original printed text almost certainly reads "saith." However, as the OCR is the source document and the original PDF was not directly reviewed, transcribed as given with this note.

## Article 03 — "Chicago Correspondence"

**Dateline typo:** The OCR reads "Chicago, June 11, '03." This is clearly an OCR or typographical error; the correct year is 1893. Transcribed as "Chicago, June 11, '93." Confidence: HIGH — context is unambiguous.

**OCR reading:** Page 4 — "Could the government-do-so and yet remain household-land just?" This appears garbled in the OCR. The original likely reads "Could the government do so and yet remain just?" The phrase "household-land" is clearly an OCR artifact. Transcribed as "Could the government do so and yet remain just?" — dropped the OCR artifact. Confidence: MEDIUM — the sense of the passage is clear.

## Article 05 — "The Union of Church and State in Europe"

**Author:** "August Kunz" is not in the known authors list. Added as-is with initials "AK." His affiliation is given as Battle Creek, Mich. Note for future reference.

**OCR reading:** Page 5 — "inadvisable right to exist" — likely should read "inalienable right to exist." Transcribed as OCR gives it ("inadvisable") with this note. Confidence: LOW — the word is unusual in context; "inalienable" is probable but not certain.

**OCR reading:** Page 5 — "beheneath" — OCR artifact for "beneath." Transcribed as given in OCR. Confidence: HIGH — simple OCR transposition.

## Article 07 — "A Strange Thing"

**Author:** Signed "ALFRED MALLETT." The known authors list notes a pending verification: "Alfred Mallet" vs. "A. Malley." This article provides the fuller form "ALFRED MALLETT." Used initials "AM" and full name "Alfred Mallett."

## Page 7 — Advertisements

Pages 7 and 8 contain significant advertisement content (Waterman's Fountain Pen, West Shore Railroad, Safety Pencil Pocket, Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods) and garbled OCR text for what appears to be a book advertisement. These were not transcribed as they are commercial advertisements. The garbled text on page 7 (lines beginning "BOOK I. The Life and Words...," "GRADEE SCOTCHES," etc.) appears to be severely corrupted OCR of a book advertisement; no article file was created for this content.
