But even if doing work or transacting business on Sunday was sin, it would not be proper for the State to prohibit it. The State cannot judge sin; it cannot punish sin; it cannot even know sin. The State forbids and punishes crime, but crime is not always sin. The Christian martyrs were condemned criminals; but they were none the less saints of God.
