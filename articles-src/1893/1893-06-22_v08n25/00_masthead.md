# American Sentinel.

**Volume 8.** NEW YORK, JUNE 22, 1893. **Number 25.**

*"Equal and Exact Justice to all Men, of Whatever State or Persuasion, Religious or Political."*

American Sentinel is set for the defense of liberty of conscience, and is therefore uncompromisingly opposed to anything tending toward a union of Church and State, either in name or in fact.
