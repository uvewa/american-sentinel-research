There is some comfort in the fact that to assume that a thing is so does not prove it true. In all the pleas for Sunday closing of the World's Fair, it is assumed that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that to keep the gates open on that day is sin. The assumption does not prove it to be so. The Sabbath is a divine institution, and rests upon divine authority. It is dependent upon revelation for its very existence. Without divine revelation there would be no Sabbath, as is proved by the fact that peoples wholly destitute of revelation are entirely without the Sabbath. They know nothing of any such institution, and have nothing answering to it. But the Bible says nothing of Sunday as a sacred day. How then can it be sin to do anything upon that day that it is proper to do upon any other of "the six working days" referred to in Ezekiel 46:1? It cannot be. Then let it never be forgotten that nothing is sin simply because it is done on Sunday.
