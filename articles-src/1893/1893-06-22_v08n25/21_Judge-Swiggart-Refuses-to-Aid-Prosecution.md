It is stated that Circuit Judge Swiggart of Tennessee has refused to give Inquisitor-General Lewis the authority required by the statute in order that he may proceed against the Adventists, and that if anybody wants them prosecuted he must come out squarely and act as prosecuting witness. This for the present puts a stop to star-chamber proceedings against the Adventists in Judge Swiggart's circuit.
