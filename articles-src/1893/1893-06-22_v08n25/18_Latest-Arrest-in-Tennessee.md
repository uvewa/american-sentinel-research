The last arrest of an Adventist in Tennessee on Sunday was made when a member of the church who had been absent from the county for some time, selling destitutional literature in Memphis, home was not attended when several of his brethren were taken into custody some months before. Reverently he was from Henry County, and the fact being reported to the sheriff, the actual fact; instead of railing a posse to apprehend the dangerous criminal, gives the warrant for an day to another Adventist who happened to be at the county seat, with the request that it be in it, the indictment delivered and request him to present his court, first that the officer of the law deal with these men in this way is an unintelligent character to the religion.
