SEVERAL years ago Cardinal Gibbons expressed himself in a letter to Mr. Crafts as being in favor of a national Sunday law. Ever since that the whole membership of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States have been counted as politicians in favor of the various Sunday bills that have before Congress. "All the Christian people of the country," to the number of forty millions, including Catholics, were, it is well-boldly claimed, in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday; and this all on the strength of Cardinal Gibbons' letter to Mr. Crafts. But now Cardinal Gibbons has come out squarely for open Sunday Fair; which, according to the Charity sundries, himself, persisted by the Sunday closers, would take seven and a half millions in round numbers, from the estimated forty millions in favor of closing Sunday; and this leaves only thirty-five millions on the other side, thus dividing the population of the United States about equally on this question. It is time that stuffed and fraudulent petitions went away.

*The Independent* of Santa Barbara, Cal., expressed this opinion:

The World's Fair will do some good in this regard: It will be a break, a wide and far-reaching break from the people. Sunday, the bondage in America is only the forerunner of whatever general good may be at last gained; but at the beginning of the reconstruction of the Common-Sense Law. When this is by long odds the most powerful of all movements, may those engaged in it never rest until every person, no matter what race they may be, no matter what their nationality, any member of a public body like the nation with a proud spirit.

The effect will be just the opposite to that which the *Independent* anticipates. "Revolutions never go backward," and a great religio-political revolution is in process in our land to-day. Whether the World's Fair is opened or closed on Sunday, a purely religious question has found its way into politics, has been discussed and voted upon by Congress, and argued before courts and been, based upon by judges. It can never again be relegated to the provinces of ecclesiastical councils. "The domain that government invades it dominates"; the jurisdiction it takes it holds.
