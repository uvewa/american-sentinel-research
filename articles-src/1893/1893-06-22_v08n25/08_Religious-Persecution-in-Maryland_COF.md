Ford's Store, Md., June 7, 1893.

EDITOR SENTINEL: On Sunday June 4, 1893, Bro. Alexander Dodd and myself, of this place, hauled from the Chester River Steam Boat Company's wharf at Jackson Creek, some goods, and were arrested on Tuesday, June 6.

The agent, T. F. Ford (my brother), had three other men to see the work done so as to be witnesses against us. They were Samuel H. Ford (my brother), Samuel W. Morvel and John T. Collier. The latter is a professor of religion in the M. E. Church.

We were tried June 7 before the Magistrate, J. M. Aker, convicted, fined $5, and cost $3.90; total, $8.90 in each case. I acted as counsel in these cases. Under the law (which is the law made while this country was under English rule) the magistrate did all he could for us.

When the cases were over the magistrate said that we would have to pay $2 for the bond (as we took an appeal). I told him that we could not do so. He then said, pay the $2 or go to jail. I told him to send us to jail. The magistrate (who is a friend of mine) says, "I can't do that." I told him to add all costs together, and if Queen Anne's County Court convicted us, we would go to jail and the county could pay all costs.

Also, Sister Hettie Mansfield was arrested at the same time for sewing on Sunday, April 30th. She was also informed on by her brother; but the State's witnesses did not appear, so the case was postponed until June 14. I am positive if the State's witnesses can be made to appear, that our sister will be convicted. We are building a church, and the devil is getting angry.

In my cross-examination to-day I caused three of the witnesses to say upon their oath that they would not break the law knowingly, so the justice read the law to them. Now if they even ride out to church or ride out for pleasure (which they always have done), they will perjure themselves. But Seventh-day Adventists will not seek revenge even within the law as it is not their religion.

The justice said that he was sorry that these people were becoming so strict about Sunday, it will cause the old Blue Laws to be brought into legislation again. He said, "If the law is strictly enforced here I would sooner be magistrate than Chief Justice of the United States of America, because there are none that keep the law."

You can readily see that this is fulfilling the Bible when my own brothers had me arrested. But thank God, that his grace is sufficient for us here, and we are glad to suffer for Christ, as he suffered so much for us. Pray for us, that we may continue faithful until the end.

The goods hauled were goods that were easily broken, and because of the prejudice that exists here, they were unsafe out on the wharf. The agent notified me on Saturday night, June 3, at 8 o'clock, too late to haul them. I requested them to be put in the warehouse built upon the wharf for that purpose, but the agent refused to do so.

CHARLES O. FORD.
