Whatever may be the opinion entertained as to the propriety of Sunday laws, it will be readily admitted by all that were it not for the fact that the day is by many regarded as sacred, there would be no laws for its observance. Sunday laws are, therefore, a religious dogma crystallized into civil statutes.
