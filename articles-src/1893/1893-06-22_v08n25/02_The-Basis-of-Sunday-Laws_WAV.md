THOSE who have read the papers to any extent cannot have failed to notice that the enforcement of Sunday observance is increasing. In Birmingham, in Southampton, in Belfast, and at various other places in the Kingdom, crusades have been carried on against those who have ventured to take Sunday as a business day, instead of a day of rest and worship. These things are becoming so commonplace, and are done so much as a matter of course, that it is necessary, again and again to call the attention of the people to the basis upon which Sunday laws rest.

We may, at the outset, recall a statement recently taken in the Isle of Man. A correspondent of the *Christian Commonwealth* has taken the Sunday trading question in the Isle of Man.

The Sunday trading question generally, has become distasteful and intolerable. At a recent sitting of the House of Keys, Mr. John Thomas Cowell, the member for Ramsey, obtained leave to bring in a new clause, to the effect that any person publishing, selling, or distributing, or offering, or exposing for sale, any Sunday paper, or chattels whatever, on the Lord's day, shall, at the discretion of the magistrate, be fined.

The clause was carried by a vote of fifteen to five, by no means unanimously; and the minority has since given notice that the whole subject shall be brought before the House of Keys for reconsideration. But the advocate of the clause fervently said: "This will undoubtedly be the case, you'll find." This is the usual course: these things are gradually growing worse. The Gospel is no longer the rallying power of the Christian Church; religious laws are taking its place, and the voice of the people must ultimately be heard and a strong measure be passed to meet the case.

NO CONNECTION WITH TEMPERANCE.

In this connection it may be well to note the fact that the Bishop of Sodor and Man said that during his twelve months' residence on the island, he has been favorably impressed by the temperance of the population. "So far as he could recollect, he had not seen a single case of drunkenness in a Manxman." So it will be seen that in question be settled that Sunday legislation is on necessity on the ground of temperance.

We have already shown that the Sunday observance question may some be considered a temperance question. The same number of 1 to 4 was dealt most effectively with the item in regard to the Isle of Man, had an editorial on the drink question. From that editorial we quote the following:—

"— no one who gives any thought to the subject can doubt that Sunday closing ought to be national, and not local. But the first thing to make clear is that the country is ripe for a national Sunday closing bill, and that is a thing that not a few persons doubt. We fail to see why Sunday closing should be made the subject of a special fight, when the real battle for freedom is, that no man shall be bound to work for more than one day, and yet some who are fighting for shorter hours are actively fighting the Sunday closing."——

This should be sufficient to settle the question as to the connection of Sunday closing with temperance. There is none whatever. "The whole country is ripe for a national Sunday bill." Let it be sent by any means for national prohibition every way, in this work. Sunday closing would make but little appreciable difference in the amount of liquor consumed, for people can drink just as much the other day nights as they are on Sundays, and laborers can spend just as much of the rest of their wages, even if they did not lay in a supply of drink in the last day.

NOT A PHYSICAL NECESSITY.

We may therefore leave the question of temperance entirely out of our consideration of the basis of Sunday laws. There are only two other possible grounds on which compulsory Sunday observance may be urged, and they are (1) the physical benefit to be derived; and (2) the religious character of the day. We will consider them. But first, again, let me say that very much importance is attached to this matter of Sunday observance by the religious press as a result of March 30, and——

In Birmingham the crusade has been chiefly directed against Sunday trading; in this country an anti-Sunday trading society has been established and a counter society formed, and is making a crusade against Sunday trading. It is to be noted that all these various organizations are for the betterment of the people, especially of the working people. But is it for this or that or many other things. For it is a fact, in every man, that every person who has to have a regular attendance at sleep in every four or five hours, to a man who had not had a rest before for an indefinite time, if he has sufficient exercise during the day—

"Also we have to the fact that Sunday observance is necessary for the physical well-being of people, especially of the working people. At the most that can be claimed is that persons should rest in fact the rest for importance than many other things. For that, it is to say, if for more necessary, that a man should have a regular attendance at sleep in every four or five hours, to a man who had not had a rest before for an indefinite time, if he has sufficient exercise during the day. Physical rest is clearly a rest at night for a few nights, he will be well and fresh and fit for the next day. Eight hours' of a refreshing that allowing man should be completed by let to sleep, seven hours every night, and nobody will ever think of enforcing the law."

Laws are not needed to compel people to rest when they are tired; nature will attend to that.

Again, if enforced Sunday rest is only for the physical well-being, there it is most absurd, not to say unjust. In the first place, persons do not become weary and in need of rest simultaneously. Different classes of labor induce different degrees of weariness; even the same amount of rest, and at the same time, is as absurd as to say that all persons require precisely the same kind of food, and at precisely the same time. What refreshes one man, another man tired, neither can the fact that a hundred men are in a certain stage of weariness be a reason for legislating one from resting, and therefore there is no ground for Sunday rest laws. Rest need not be given time, simply because a few will to give time.

But it is often urged that the Government should set apart one day in seven days as holidays. Very true, but that is not what Sunday is claimed to be. A holiday is a day in which people are perfectly free to do as they choose; but when Sunday is it desired to force people to observe against their wish or to not observe it—the Government has no right to interfere. Were there an attempt to force everybody to attend the races, or to go to the football, there would be such a protest as would not end to the attempt. Pleasure may be urged, and the law is to the attempt. Pleasure can but be forced, and neither can rest.
