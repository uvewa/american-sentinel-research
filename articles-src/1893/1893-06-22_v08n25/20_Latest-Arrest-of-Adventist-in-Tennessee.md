The latest arrest of an Adventist in Tennessee for Sunday work was made upon this wise: The accused Adventist had been absent from the county for some time selling denominational literature in Memphis, hence was not arrested when several of his brethren were taken into custody some months ago. Recently he returned to Henry County, and the fact being reported to the sheriff, that official, instead of calling a posse to apprehend the dangerous(?) criminal, gave the warrant one day to another Adventist who happened to be at the county seat, with the request that he serve it on the returned Sunday-breaker, and request his presence at court. The fact that the officers of the law deal with these men in this way is an unimpeachable testimony to their inoffensive character.
