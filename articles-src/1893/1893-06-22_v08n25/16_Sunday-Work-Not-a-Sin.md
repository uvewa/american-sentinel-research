But even if doing work or transacting business on Sunday was a sin, it would not be proper for the State to prohibit it. The State cannot judge sin; it cannot punish sin; it cannot even know sin. The State forbids and punishes crime, but crime is not always sin. Christian martyrs were condemned criminally; but the Church of the Covenant, the first of the faithful, was not even on the right side of those acts.
