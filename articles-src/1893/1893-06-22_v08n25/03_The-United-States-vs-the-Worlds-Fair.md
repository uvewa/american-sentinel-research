## Chicago Correspondence.

ON June 5, a decision was rendered in the United States Court at Chicago, on an injunction against the World's Fair management to compel the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday henceforth; during the case, Judges Woods and Jenkins gave opinions in favor of Sunday closing, though reaching the conclusion from somewhat different standpoints, and Judges Grosscup dissented. Judge Woods held that the United States Court had jurisdiction over the grounds upon which the World's Fair is situated and its buildings and exhibits placed there; so that the operations of the Fair fell under the control of Congress. He also held that Congress had the right to make regulations for a private or quasi public corporation, being the agents and servants of the Government. And this applies. Nevertheless he says of the Local Directory:

That company was the only financially responsible agency in the enterprise of the Exposition. Congress expressed an express limit to the liability which it assumed. There was no assumption of liability for all obligations created, whether by the government agencies or by the local directory; but rather its obligation was to contribute to the general scheme. In fact, the local corporation, as originally created by the legislation of Illinois, was not only needed as the agent of the government, but was indispensable for the use of providing the buildings, and carrying on the exposition. Under the provision made by Congress *its* the nature of which had had assumed a public character— the duty of the Government through its agents, or instrumentalities, or servants, to make certain exhibits, and to make its part of the exposition the best possible.

Judge Woods considers the appropriation of the souvenir coins as a gift with a condition attached, and says:

I do not think it at all permissible to speak of the souvenir coins as a gift of the Government, or of the Exposition to be bargaining on any such basis. Congress, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, in aid of one of the most important plans and scope of the Exposition, greater regard was paid to the religious sentiment of the people in the matter of Sunday closing. It does not propose to give further help, but in the meantime we can rest assured, I think, that the regulation is binding and sticking to that sentiment, so indorsing it, it attached a condition to all of the aid beyond this condition. The government, without giving a dollar, might have made such a regulation; and I think it clear that Congress did in fact legislate to that did not choose to do it now absolutely, but, simply as a condition to be observed in the use of a specific fund. If the very body that the public generally regards as the highest authority in the land shall so closet. If the very body that the people themselves have created for the purpose of making the law, shall designate its will in such a matter, to change the language that it did. The expression of this will was something more than a sentiment. ... The conditions upon which the souvenir coins of the Exposition are made upon the condition that the Fair shall not be open to the people on the first day of the week, — commonly called Sunday.

Having reached this conclusion, that Congress had the right, the question arose whether Congress had the rights that might result from a breach of a condition of appropriation, or only such rights as might arise from breach of a statute; in other words, condition, of course any breach of the condition would be a breach of statute. For, the condition is accepted by the acceptance of the appropriation, it becomes an act of Congress. If, on consideration, upon that condition, it shall be and is hereby appropriated, passes into the form of a statute upon acceptance. This Court is bound to enforce it, and to make such rules or modifications of the rules of practice as the remedy may require. By the term Exposition on said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

But though the statute means but to declare one condition; it declared an obligation; enacted an obligation and a prohibitory law as well. I am of the opinion that it was a statutory enactment, from the limitation that the rule had not been regard it, is not a mere condition. But having reached the conclusion that Congress had the right, I hold further that if the commitment had been passed, in the nature of things, by the acceptance of the appropriation, it would have been a void act, because it was not within the right of Congress to prohibit opening on Sunday.

The portion of the souvenir coin not being a gift, and having gone into circulation finally, Judge Woods declared to be improperly held and not to be returned.

If follows that there has been no legal withholding of any portion of the souvenir coin by the officers named; he allowed to put the government upon the strict proof of its claim. I think that the rule, that a quasi public corporation with franchises cannot be adopted which puts the government in the wrong towards those who have dealt with it in good faith, applies; and it equally applies to those of which these parties may have rights upon the souvenir coin. There was something upon which these parties may rely as an authority; even if there had been a breach to repeal the Act of Congress. I hold, therefore, that the acceptance of the souvenir coin set the seal of ratification upon the adoption of the regulation, and it is effect a forfeiture to all those persons interested under the act.

The next question is the right of the government to a specific performance, the question is one of want of equity in the government's position. The government cannot claim any appropriation from its own souvenir coin, and there is no appropriation to return. The only question is the question of the jurisdiction of this court; and the question arises whether the United States District Court shall be used as an enforcement of a criminal provision. The government, as I hold, has not equity of claim against its right to regulate the occupation of those grounds and buildings which the local corporation now possesses. All that it has is a tenancy; its possession is temporary, but for the purposes of the Exposition.

Of the jurisdiction of the State Court restraining generally the closing of the World's Fair, Fair Directory management, park on Sunday or any other day of the week, he said:

If I am right to respect to possession, then the question has no more to right to pass judgment upon the opening and closing of the Fair than it has to direct any one of its other operations. . . . It is not a question of the United States merely exercising an authority. The question of its exercising authority over ground occupied, according to my view, under a temporary tenancy. If this court is right in claiming that possession, only for the purpose of making it available as a means, I rest upon the report of the Fair Commissioners; that the ground was to be used "for the purpose of holding the World's Columbian Exposition; that the grounds were necessary for the purposes of this Exposition, and should be set apart for its uses," meaning, I take it, as a Fair. "The possession, management, and control are completely within the grasp of the local corporation, and it appears to me that the question of what the government in its possession, regardless of any question arising upon the opening and closing of the park. . . . It is understandable that conflict of jurisdiction shall be avoided as much as possible; that where rights of property, and contractual rights of the people are prayed ought to be granted.

But he does not agree with Judge Woods in regard to the possession of the souvenir coins. They were a gift of the States Government; he looked upon the appropriation as a gift, which it undoubtedly was. If this was the case, then the amount required for awards, diplomas, and so forth, was improperly paid. The several coins which were retained were that they were retained unlawfully, and he therefore held that the fund was partly held in violation that "a court of chancery is not accustomed to make an invalid condition vitiate the conditions attached to the souvenir coin, but to hold the gift good, and the condition void, and as to the question of practical validity that "a court of chancery is not accustomed to forfeit a grant, unless the condition upon which it is granted is enforced and observed."

Please note this matter in full particularly between the State and United States Courts, Judge Stein made and Judge Jenkins.

I need only add with reference to the action of the Court, in declining to grant the injunction. Congress so framed the act as not to set up motives of court not to interfere with, that the money was spent in the way in which Congress directed it. He says, "I do not think the right and jurisdiction of a State Court can be questioned. For questions as between parties regarding personal and property rights, between the parties and the subject matter; there can be no difficulty in the State Courts' taking jurisdiction, nor can there be any conflict in a court of its own jurisdiction for the determination of a question between parties. The right may arise with respect to the same subject matter from different sources, from private undertakings on the one hand and from public legislation on the other. I concur that the complainant's bill should be dismissed. I am therefore of the opinion that the bill be dismissed. I am therefore of the opinion that the bill should be dismissed."

Judge Jenkins, in the course of his opinion, touched upon the question of the power of Congress. He said:

It is said that this legislation by Congress is with the assent of the local corporation, but I am not prepared to concur in that objection. The legislation of Congress extends to all needful regulations respecting the territory of the United States, and this week has nothing to do with the matter of Sunday opening or closing of the Exposition, further than through its legislation. Its primary necessities of the human race as taught us by experience, is a day of rest from labor, one day of the week; nothing more. Whether it is the first or the last is justified by that experience outside of and independent of, any religious command.

We have got therefore to determine whether the Endowment Home, or the more worthwhile agency, the Local Directory, could willfully and voluntarily renounce this condition. I am constrained to hold it cannot. . . . And in this country neither the state governments nor the national government can compel the American people, papal Catholics, Chinese Joss houses, or Mohammedan Mosques, as well as Christian temples, are to renounce their liberty of religious belief and practice, because that would constitute the divine ordinance of government. And, I add, would destroy that very divine authority, and all guilty of bankruptcy and profanity as a violation of religious obligation; and it would be to violate the religious liberty of the American people.

His conclusion in the whole matter is:

It is not an imposition upon any one of conscience or a condemnation of unbelief. It is a purely civil regulation. It provides simply for a day of rest from labor. In this regard there is no limitation as to churches. It provides simply for a civil day of rest. And the further condition of the souvenir coins is that it shall not be replaced by labor that day.

And I must work that all may end. And all those who now read the great daily papers, paid Sunday mails, Sunday newspapers, and Sunday schools and lectures will do well. No Nation may have her Sabbath day of rest.

Judge Grosscup, incidentally, alluded to by Judge Grosscup, incidentally, touched upon Sunday as a day of rest from a civil standpoint. He said, in an opinion, in languages which showed that it was just, and he was not in favor of getting Congress to close the World's Fair on Sunday was the assumption of that day
