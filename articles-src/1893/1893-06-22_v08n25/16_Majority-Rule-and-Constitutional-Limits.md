The opinion seems to be quite general in this country that the majority has the right to do anything that it wishes. "The majority must rule," is an expression often heard. And majority rule within certain well-defined limits is right; but in this country the rule of the majority is limited, or is supposed to be, by written instruments known as "constitutions." Beyond these constitutions even the majority has no right to go. Moreover back of constitutional guarantees is the eternal foundation of inalienable human rights—rights which no government whether of one or of many has any right to invade.
