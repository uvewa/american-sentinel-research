AS in Tennessee, religious persecution is being carried on in Maryland, by means of the Sunday law. One Seventh-day Adventist has been arrested in Carroll County, for husking corn on Sunday; and five others are awaiting trial, on similar charges, one being a woman arrested for sewing on Sunday for *her own* house, of all the peaceful and dignified of the State!

As is related elsewhere in this paper by one of the victims of this persecution, two of the officers concerned refused point-blank to serve the persons accused; and in one instance the brother who made the complaint conspired to have the work observed and took pains to have witnesses on hand to prove it, in order that he might obtain the warrant.

ANOTHER prominent feature in these Maryland cases is, while there are many in that community who violate the law, and many violate it openly and repeatedly, only Adventists are proceeded against, and that, avowedly, not because they do work on Sunday, but because they do work on Saturday. Said one Sunday champion not long since, to an Adventist, after remarking that his neighbors worked on Sunday when it suited their convenience to do it, we wouldn't notice your work or mark it if you did not keep Saturday. The *real* offense of the Adventists is *not* Sunday work.

BUT it has been said, why do not the Adventists retaliate by having the law enforced against their persecutors? Simply because *their* religion forbids them *not* to *seek* revenge. It is written in their law: "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink." "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good." This course is in accordance with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, "who when reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously."

Christ's example is the Christian's rule of life. "He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked." The Christian must obey this rule, or else cease to be a Christian. He can suffer wrong, but he must not do wrong. Nor is this hard to do when the grace of God reigns in the heart. The apostles were beaten for their fidelity to Christ, "departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to preach Jesus Christ." They were not driven by the magistrates to *speak* on *his* name. The same power is in the gospel to-day, and it is still the privilege of the humble follower of Christ to rejoice in tribulations also.

The Saviour warned his followers that they would be called upon to suffer persecution, and said: "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you." And the apostle declares that "all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." "Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived."

But have we not a right to expect that in this, the nineteenth century, men will be so enlightened that persecution will cease? Let the Scriptures answer: "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, ... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away." 2 Tim. 3:1-5.

ENLIGHTENMENT is no guarantee against persecution. Often the most enlightened are the most wicked and the most cruel. It is the grace of God alone that softens the human heart and takes out all desire to coerce others. It is impossible for the true Christian to be a persecutor, but he who has the form of godliness but denies the power of the gospel, must in the very nature of things seek elsewhere for that power he fails to have but which he must wield, and because he senses the aim from whence it alone comes.

THE Lord promises to be with his people in the midst of their persecution, but only when they rely solely upon *his* divine power. Christ can have no coerced followers. His kingdom is not of this world, and neither is the power by which his work is to be carried forward to be derived from this world. The power is in the divine Word and in the Spirit, the Spirit that is in the Word and which makes it effective. It is only in men *not* sure of this that they seek civil power to maintain their doctrines and vindicate their practices.

But can the true friends of Sunday close in the Lord to maintain the fair name of that institution when *his* Word says nothing about it as a sacred day? The very best arguments in its favor are those found in the Scriptures; and the words of the Scriptures, rightly interpreted, by Bible reckoning from *sunset* to sunset, do not apply to Sunday at all. How can Sunday be known in the Word of God by no other name than "the first day of the week"? Is it not the most natural thing in the world that in departing from the truth, men should also depart from the Spirit of truth, and seek by human agencies and human weapons to compensate themselves for the loss of power which they thus occasion? Is departure from the true source of spiritual power—the Lord Jesus Christ? It certainly is. It follows that persecution is the logical result of the substitution of Sunday keeping for the true. The divine Word gives no hint of first-day sacredness, but it tells us explicitly that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."
