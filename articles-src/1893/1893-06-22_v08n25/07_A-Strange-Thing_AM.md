IT has lately been professed Christian that churches that Sunday laws and all other religious laws are wicked, and that they pray to live from the Lord to end them all.

Yet we do not find from the Lord to end them. Or do they say that they are wrong, and have not enough of God's power to undo them, because for it, again, is it because their ministers fail? And if they have ministers who are what whatever the preachers are the people believe to. Let God be true, let truth stand, let them study their Bibles and act their faith, and God will bless them and Christ need no force in spreading the gospel. He only entreated, and that is the minister's, and every Christian's duty, and not to seek to make cruel laws from the civil power to make men obey God.

There is true of the churches who know that the outcries of Sunday laws is the interest of the whole people and the day of the rest, and yet they still say all are ultimately to present themselves. Let the Government step in and make this a religious thing in itself. Not all are ready for this. Can they be Christians and persecutors? For to attempt to force people to be Christian is just the opposite to being like Christ. Persecution is of itself, and has in their will persecute inevitably be the servants of Satan. As Christ said to the Jews, so in mind it is said to those who seek to persecute their fellows—"Ye are of your father the devil, and the works of your father ye will do."

That, surely, there are those who say that religion have let it not keep them. Let such go to Spurgeon, Torrey, and find out for themselves what Sunday observance means to them—but only a holy church of Seventh-day-keepers. If only they could be honest and make up their minds. Only just recently several hundred convictions, only have been arrested and fined in Maryland, because they worked on Sunday as God commanded them; and the arrests were made by members of the same church to which they belonged only a few months ago, and from which they can not obtain satisfaction. I stated that the seventh day was the biblical sabbath, of the first, according to the fourth commandment of the Decalogue. And not only were they persecuted for their conscientious work on Sunday by their own brothers, and yet this is not kept by any religious denomination; not enforcing the law. I say it is just simply keeping of evil. For vengeance is not mine, which I do be right or wrong. "By their fruits ye shall know them."

Sunday laws are certainly evil, and persecution is their inevitable result. To those who are in these persecuting churches, the Lord, who they profess to love, gives the invitation: "Come out from among them, and be ye separate." "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Who will heed its warning and come out and serve the Lord with a true heart?

I am a Seventh-day observer, and that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," I believe with all my heart that the Roman Catholic Church changed the day of worship from the seventh day and the week the Sabbath in the place of the seventh day. And being a Sabbath, I cannot serve that church from which I protest, and I certainly would be serving it if I observed its "holy days." Persecution may come, but I am determined that as long as I serve God I will keep his Sabbath, and as an humble law-abiding citizen of our nation of right compel me to do otherwise. Nothing; not even persecution can separate us from his love. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?" "As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter." "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
