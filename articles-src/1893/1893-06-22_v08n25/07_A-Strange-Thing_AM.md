It is strange that professed Christians cannot see that Sunday laws and all other religious laws are wicked, and that they tend to drive men from the Lord instead of drawing them to him. Or do they see that they are wrong, and have not enough moral stamina to protest against them? Or again, is it because their ministers tell them that Sunday laws are needful, and whatever the preachers say the people think must be right? If they think thus, let them study their Bibles and not their ministers, and they will find that Christ used no force in spreading the gospel. He only entreated, and that is the minister's, and every Christian's duty, and not to be seeking cruel laws from the civil power to make men obey God.

There are those in the churches who know that the outcome of Sunday laws is persecution of those who keep the seventh day of the week, and yet they still petition for them. But the strangest thing is that they still claim the name of Christian. Can they be Christians and persecute? I fail to see how they can, for a persecutor is just the opposite to being like Christ. Persecution is of Satan, and so they who persecute must inevitably be the servants of Satan. As Christ said to the Jews, so must it be said to those who seek to persecute their fellow-men: "Ye are of your father the devil, and the works of your father ye will do."

Then again, there are those who say that Sunday laws will not bring persecution. Let such go to Springville, Tenn., and find out for themselves what Sunday laws have brought upon a quiet, orderly little church of Seventh-day keepers. If they are honest they will soon change their minds. Only just recently several honest, God-fearing men have been arrested and fined in Maryland, because they worked on Sunday as God commanded them; and the arrests were made by members of the same church to which they belonged only a few months ago, and from which they came out because they were convinced that the seventh day was the Sabbath instead of the first, according to the fourth commandment of the Decalogue. And not only were they prosecuted by former brethren in the church, but by their own brothers, and yet this is not persecution. Oh, no. It is just simply enforcing the law. I say it is just simply making men do as I do whether that which I do be right or wrong. "By their fruits ye shall know them."

Sunday laws are certainly evil, and persecution is their inevitable result.

To those who are in these persecuting churches, the Lord, who they profess to love, gives the invitation: "Come out from among them, and be ye separate." "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Who will heed the warning, and come out and serve the Lord with a true heart?

I am a Seventh-day observer, and that because in the Word of God, I read that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord," and because I learn from history that the Roman Catholic Church changed the law of God, and made the first day of the week the Sabbath in the place of the seventh day. And being a Protestant, I cannot serve that church from which I protest, and I certainly would be serving it if I observed its "holy days." Persecution may come, but I am determined that as long as I serve God I will keep his Sabbath as he has commanded me; and no man can of right compel me to do otherwise. Nothing, not even persecution, can separate us from him. "Who shall separate us from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Rom. 8: 35-39.
