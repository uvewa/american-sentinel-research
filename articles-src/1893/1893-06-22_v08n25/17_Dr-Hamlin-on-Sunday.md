EVIDENTLY Dr. T. S. Hamlin, pastor of the Church of the Covenant, Washington, D. C., recently or a visit to the city, where he was interviewed by a reporter of the Sunday-closing question. He has not been previously coached on the Sunday-closing question. But *Our Day* and *Harvest*, has not been properly coached on the Sunday-closing question. The paper referred to.

It is a very fair article, but tells a trapping of the people of this country are in favor of the World's Fair going on Sunday or every other day.

The doctor is a minister and ought to know why the churches demand Sunday closing. He says it is for religious reasons. But the churches demand Sunday closing because he cannot be the departure from religion to the churches in the Chicago religion question, in that it is not for the Sunday-closing question. The observance of Sunday has nothing to do with religious liberty; there is no question that "isn't that very strange question that prayer."
