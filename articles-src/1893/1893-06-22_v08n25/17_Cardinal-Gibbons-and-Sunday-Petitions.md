Several years ago Cardinal Gibbons expressed himself in a letter to Mr. Crafts as being in favor of a national Sunday law. Ever since that the whole membership of the Papal Church in the United States have been counted as petitioners in favor of the various Sunday bills that have been before Congress. "All the Christian people of the country," to the number of forty millions, including Catholics, were, it was boldly claimed, in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday; and this all on the strength of Cardinal Gibbons' letter to Mr. Crafts. But now the cardinal has come out squarely for an open Sunday Fair; which, according to the Crafts' methods, hitherto persued by the Sunday closers, would take seven and a half millions in round numbers, from the estimated forty millions in favor of closing, and transfer them to the twenty-five millions on the other side, thus dividing the population of the United States about equally on this question. It is thus that stuffed and fraudulent petitions melt away.
