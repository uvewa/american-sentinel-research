[The last session of the Reformed Presbyterian Synod was held at New Castle, Pa., early in June. On the afternoon of the 4th, a twenty-minute address was delivered in the Opera house, by Rev. J. M. Foster, a typical National Reformer. The following is a part of what he said, as published in the Christian Opinion, of June 8.]

## The State must receive and apply both tables of the Decalogue.

This Nation should make a constitutional recognition of the authority and law of Christ and give its pledge to serve him, and that will bring down his Spirit and unite us one composite Christian nationality.

It should stipulate, in the compact, that the enemies of Christ be excluded from office and only his friends be made eligible. And the application of Christ's law to incoming foreigners would result in the requirement of these conditions: 1. All who are in sworn allegiance to the Pope, the Endowment House, or the secret oath-bound lodge, could not become citizens without renouncing this extra-American authority. 2. All idolaters, whether in papal cathedrals, Chinese Joss houses, Mormon Endowment House, or Masonic temple, are to renounce their idolatry or be prosecuted as criminals. 3. All who prostitute the divine ordinance of the oath by administering or receiving it without divine authority, and all guilty of blasphemy and profanity are to be judicially punished. 4. All must work six days in the week and rest the seventh. Vagrancy, loafing, idleness, are crimes. All must work that all may eat. And all must rest on Sabbath; Sunday trains, Sunday mails, Sunday newspapers, and Sunday excursions must cease, that the Nation may have her Sabbath rest. 5. Authority in the divine institutions of the family, the Church, and the State, must be respected. Obedience to the just and legal authority is obedience to God. Rebellion against just and legal authority is resisting God. "And they that resist shall receive judgment." 6. Every saloon must be outlawed, and the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor as a beverage made a capital offense. 7. Houses of ill-fame and the "social evil" must be prohibited, and speedy and easy divorce made impossible by a uniform national divorce law. Mormon polygamy must be wiped out. 8. Stock-gambling must be stopped; money-kings and grasping corporations and heartless trusts and syndicates must be subjected to the restrictions involved in the Golden Rule. 9. Falsehood and perjury must be punished with rigor. 10. Discontent, anarchy and lawlessness must be made afraid of the arm of the law which is held over them.
