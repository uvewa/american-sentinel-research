It is stated that the persecution of the Jews has extended to the Russian province of Poland. Five hundred families have been expelled from the Ronda-Gonzowski district alone. All the heads of families thus expelled were engaged in trade and possessed more or less real estate, which they were forced to abandon. But what right have Americans to find fault with the Czar? He is simply trying to unify and strengthen his empire, and in this country religious laws are defended upon even less substantial grounds.
