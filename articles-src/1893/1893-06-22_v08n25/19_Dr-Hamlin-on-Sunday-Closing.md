Evidently Dr. T. S. Hamlin, pastor of the Church of the Covenant, Washington, D. C., recently on a visit to this city, where he was interviewed by a reporter of the Mail and Express, has not been properly coached on the Sunday-closing question. The doctor said, as reported by the paper referred to:—

> It is my firm and sincere belief that a majority of the people of this country are in favor of closing the World's Fair gates on Sunday on purely religious grounds.

The doctor is a minister and ought to know why the churches demand Sunday-closing. He says it is for religious reasons; but Justice Jenkins said in his opinion in the Chicago injunction case, that "the legislation with respect to the observance of Sunday has nothing to do with religion." Very strange question this! Most peculiar day!
