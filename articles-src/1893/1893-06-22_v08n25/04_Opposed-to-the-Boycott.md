The Christian Union has this to say about Sunday and the Columbian Exposition:—

There is a wide and honest difference of opinion in this country respecting the legitimate uses of Sunday. A Catholic and Christian spirit would have endeavored, in arranging a World's Fair, to have secured such a settlement of the Sunday question as would recognize that difference and respect all honest and honorable opinions. Some attempt of this kind was made, such as the notable contribution by Bishop Potter in the Forum. But neither side made much response to this attempt at mediation. The Sunday openers and the Sunday closers arrayed themselves in line for battle, which grew more bitter as it progressed. In our judgment, in this conflict the Sabbatarians made a serious mistake. We said so at the time; and events have confirmed the opinion then expressed. If they had united their forces to secure no running of Sunday excursion trains; to compel the closing of liquor saloons and variety shows in Chicago, and to provide religious services in the park; and had consented to an afternoon and evening opening of the educational aspects of the Fair and the closing of all else, they might not have succeeded, but they certainly would not, as now, have aroused in the foreign portion of the population the hostility to Sunday which has been aroused, and which a quarter of a century will hardly suffice to overcome. They preferred to pursue other methods. They appealed to Congress, and Congress made its appropriation conditional on Sunday closing. When that appropriation was made on that condition, it was the plain duty of the directors to determine whether they would accept the money on that condition. Having accepted the money, the transaction was closed; the mere attempt to reopen it, except by mutual consent, was a dishonest attempt. It is not made less dishonest by a promise to return the money, if there is any money left after all other debts are paid. The directors should have said, officially and emphatically, the honor of the Fair is at stake; our word has been given and it cannot be broken. Men who do not believe in keeping Sunday believe in keeping faith, and they would have responded with acquiescence to such an appeal, or raised the money to release the directors from the bond. Instead, the directors closed the gates, and at the same time allowed the public to understand that they were trying to find a way to open them. The Sabbatarians have been angered by the proposal to open; the anti-Sabbatarians have been angered by the attempt to close; and all men of honor, whatever their Sunday views, if they have given the matter close attention, have been made indignant by seeing their Nation's Fair stained by an act of national dishonor. From Mount Desert to the mouth of the Mississippi, and from Sandy Hook to the Golden Gate, the popular enthusiasm for the Fair has been checked and chilled, and the energies which should have been united in an endeavor to make the Fair a success have been expended in angry battles over the question whether it should be opened or closed on Sunday.

It is not our place to enter into any defense of the managers of the Fair. But one feature of the question seems to have been very generally lost sight of, namely, the fact that the money appropriated did not belong to Congress but to the people; and that while it is safe to say that the people were willing that it should be given in aid of the Fair, it is just as certain that they were not willing that it should be used to bribe the managers of the Fair to observe a religious institution. Even if Sunday were all that is claimed for it, instead of being itself a fraud, so far as its sacred character is concerned, Congress would have no right to use public funds to purchase its observance any more than it would have to bribe other churches to use the prayer book of the Church of England, or to baptize entirely by immersion. It is scarcely reasonable to expect good faith between the briber and the bribed.
