On June 8, a decision was rendered in the United States Circuit Court granting an injunction against the World's Fair Directory and requiring the closing of the World's Fair on Sundays henceforth during its continuance. Of the three Judges sitting in the case, Judges Woods and Jenkins gave opinions in favor of Sunday closing, though reaching the conclusion from somewhat different premises, while Judge Grosscup dissented. Judge Woods held that Congress had acquired a similar jurisdiction over the grounds upon which the World's Fair is situated and the buildings and exhibits placed there to that which it has over the District of Columbia or a Government reservation, and therefore Congress had the right to make regulations, and the Directors of the Illinois corporation, being the agents and servants of the Government, were bound to obey. Nevertheless he says of the Local Directory:

That company was the only financially responsible body connected with this enterprise. The government fixed an express limit to the liability which might be incurred on its account. It necessarily follows that the local corporation is legally liable for all obligations created, whether by the government—whether by the government agencies or by the local corporation itself—within the scope of the general scheme. In fact, the local corporation, as was stated by one of the counsel for the defense, is only another agent of the government. All acts of the government in the way of providing for the erection of buildings, making exhibits—all appropriations made by Congress are in the nature of gifts to this enterprise, one just as much as another. The government agrees or proposes to build certain structures, to make certain exhibits, and to make certain appropriations. They are all gifts to the enterprise.

Judge Woods considers the appropriation of the souvenir coins as a gift with a condition attached, and says:

I do not think it at all permissible to speak of the transaction as a matter of contract. It would be discreditable to the government, and discreditable to the Exposition to be bargaining on any such subject. The fact is that by reason of the enlarged plans and scope of the Exposition, greater expenditures of money were necessary than was in the first instance apprehended. Congress was appealed to give further help, but in the meantime we know that the question of Sunday opening had begun to be agitated. The agitation began early, and yielding to that sentiment, or endorsing it, Congress made a further gift, but coupled with it this condition. The government, without giving a dollar, as I think, had the power at any time to enact this rule, but it had never chosen to do it. It did not choose to do it now, absolutely, but, simply, the occasion calling for further help, it makes it a condition of giving that help that the gates shall be closed. If the government had intended simply a bargain it would have stopped short of using the language that it did. The expression is:

"It is hereby declared that all appropriations herein made for or pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition are made upon the condition that the said Exposition shall not be open to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

If the government had simply meant a condition, whether you call it a contract or a gift, and to have had the rights that might result from a breach of that condition, it would have stopped with the language that I have read. A gift being made upon a condition, of course any breach of the condition would have its legal consequences; but the Act of Congress goes further and says: "If said appropriation be accepted by the corporation of the State of Illinois, known as the World's Columbian Exposition, upon that condition it shall be and is hereby made the duty of the World's Columbian Commission, created by Act of Congress of April 23, 1890, to make such rules or modifications of the rules of said corporation as shall require the closing of the Exposition on said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

Congress went further than merely to declare a condition; it declared an obligation; enacted an obligation upon the commission to adopt this rule. The rule was adopted. Independently of the proposition that the rule had not been repealed, in fact it is quite clear that the rule adopted under such a requirement could not be repealed. No matter if the commission had been present, and they had all voted to ratify the act of the directory, it would have been a void act, because it was not for them to revoke the action which they had been required to take by superior authority.

The portion of the souvenir coins not yet paid over to the World's Fair authorities, Judge Woods declared to be improperly withheld, but says:

It follows that there has been no legal withholding of this money, and the acts of administrative officers cannot be allowed to put the government in the attitude of an unjust withholding of that which it had promised to give. A construction should not be adopted which puts the government in the wrong. I therefore am quite clear that there has been no breach of obligation on the part of the government of which those parties have any right to complain. I should not deem it within their authority, even if there had been a breach to repeal the rule. Congress had the right to make this regulation, and chose, in making this gift, to require the adoption of the regulation, and it is effective in my judgment, notwithstanding the grounds urged for disregarding it.

The next question is the right of the government to seek relief in a court of equity. There is no want of equity in the government's position. The government has an interest in this matter because it has possession of the grounds and for other reasons. The only question is the question of the jurisdiction of the court. If the government has possession then it has a right to protect its possession. It is now an enforcement of a criminal provision. The government has the same right to protect its possession and its right to regulate the occupation of those grounds that it has of this building; (the post office building in the city of Chicago) its title is temporary; its possession is temporary, but for the time being it has the same right there that it has here.

Of the jurisdiction of the State Court which had granted a temporary injunction restraining the World's Fair Directory from excluding the people from the public park on Sunday or any other day of the week, the Judge said:

If I am right in respect to possession, then the State Court has no more right to pass judgment concerning the opening and closing or any other act of management of the Fair or Fair grounds than it would have with regard to the doors of this building. It is not a question of the United States exercising authority over local corporations; it is a question of its exercising authority over ground which a local corporation has delivered into its possession, and of which the local corporation itself had possession, only for the purpose of making that delivery. It is provided in the act of the legislature of the State, as well as in the ordinance of the State Commissioners, that the ground was licensed, or leased, whatever you call it, to the local corporation for the purposes of this Exposition, and that alone. It took possession only for the purpose of devoting it to this use, and therefore the possession and control are completely within the government. On that theory I would have no doubt with regard to the duty of this court, to aid and protect the government in its possession, regardless of any effort of the State courts to interfere. Of course it is undesirable that conflicts of jurisdiction shall arise, and I have no serious fear any such conflict will arise in this case. My opinion is that the relief prayed ought to be granted.

Judge Jenkins did not agree with Judge Woods in regard to the possession of the World's Fair and grounds by the United States Government; he looked upon the souvenir coin appropriation as a gift, but the amount required for awards, diplomas, etc., was a loan on security and the souvenir coins which were retained were that security. This in his opinion did not invalidate the condition attached to the souvenir appropriation, and it was his conclusion that "a court of chancery is authorized to see to it that the condition is enforced and observed."

As to the possible conflict of authority between the State and United States Courts, Judge Jenkins said:

I need only add with reference to the action of the State Court, which is pressed upon our attention, and as to which we are sought through motives of comity not to interfere with, that the Government of the United States was not before that court, and while for one I always recognize the right and jurisdiction of a State Court over a subject properly before it, when it has jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, there can exist at this day no sort of question that the United States of America has the right to use the courts of its own jurisdiction for the determination of its rights, and that a State Court cannot by any proceeding between private parties undertake to adjudicate upon those rights of the government, or by its injunction nullify the rights of the government of the United States. I am therefore of the opinion upon the grounds which I have stated, that this injunction prayed for should issue.

Judge Jenkins, in the course of his opinion, touched upon the question of constitutionality in these words:

It is said that this legislation by Congress is without the power of Congress; that it is unconstitutional; that it seeks to establish religious tests. I cannot concur in that objection. The legislation with respect to the observance of the first day of the week has nothing to do with the matter of religious tests, or the compulsion of a particular religious belief or service. It is founded upon the necessities of the human race as taught us by experience; the needed rest which human beings require from the avocations of six days' labor, and it is justified by that experience outside of and irrespective of any question of creed or any question of religion; and all that the laws seek to do, the laws of the several States which have existed almost from the existence of the States, is to provide for that needed rest and to provide for non-interruption in that rest, and in such religious services as any citizen chooses to indulge in. It is not an imposition upon any one of compulsion in respect to religious belief or in respect to attendance at church. It provides simply for the protection and for the peace of those who may choose to attend church; that they shall not be interrupted by labor that day.

This point of constitutionality was alluded to by Judge Grosscup, incidentally, in the course of presenting his dissenting opinion, in language which showed that in his mind the legislation upon the part of Congress to close the World's Fair on Sundays was the assumption of an unconstitutional power. A portion of the opinion of Judge Grosscup is as follows:—

It is in the nature of American thought and purposes that a commemorative national enterprise should be undertaken and carried on directly by the people with the aid and sanction of the government, but not as a governmental work. Such was the exhibition at Philadelphia, as viewed by the Supreme Court, an exhibition commemorative of the beginning of national history, and therefore a peculiarly national enterprise. The Act of Congress of April 22, 1890, adopted the Illinois corporation as an embodiment of the popular movement, and in connection therewith made provision on the part of the government for the holding of the Exposition. In that act the respective parts of the government and the Illinois corporation, in the creation and the control of the exhibition, were plainly marked. The government, through its commission, was to determine the plan and scope of the Exposition; alot space for, and classify the exhibits, appoint judges, award premiums, and generally have charge of all intercourse with exhibitors and the representatives of foreign nations. To the Illinois corporation was left the duty of procuring and preparing a site and the erection of such buildings as were necessary to suitably house the exhibits. Did Congress thereby intend to include the Illinois corporation as one of its own agencies, and thus create and control the exhibition as a governmental work under exclusive governmental dominion? Plainly not. There is no express term or reasonable implication to that effect. A national commission is created with prescribed powers and duties and put under a mandate to report from time to time to the Government of the United States. If the corporation created by Illinois were a like agency why should not like provisions extend to it? Why should there be no requirement for periodical or final reports? Why should there be no supervision over its agents or finances? Why should there be an express disclaimer of any liability for its debts or doings? Could any other principal repudiate, in advance, the doings and liabilities of an agent within the express scope of his powers? Could the government do so and yet remain just? The proposition contended for involves the assumption of a relation between the government and the corporation, no element of which is found in the language of the statute, and every element of which is contrary to the principles and safeguards of the law commonly controlling such relations. If this corporation is an agent, it is the first known instance in which an agent is bound to pay all the debts of his principal; the first instance in which the principal assumes all the moral responsibility and repudiates all financial responsibility. In my opinion the Illinois corporation and the government entered upon the work of this Exposition, not as principal and agent, but as co-workers, each independent of the other, within the scope of the part respectively undertaken by each, except as the defendant corporation was expressly made subject to the right of control or modification of the government. Within the scope of these respective powers and duties each had dominion, and the dominion of neither was as agent for the other. It therefore follows that the government had no right, derived from dominion or possession, to control the closing of the gates.

Judge Grosscup then recites the terms of the souvenir coin act and the failure of Congress to deliver the full amount of the souvenir half dollars in time to enable the corporation to profit by their use or sale for the completion of the buildings before the opening of the Exposition, and says as to the appropriation and proviso:—

The corporation accepted the proposal; it issued and sold its bonds on the pledge of the gate receipts and passed a rule opening the gates only on six days of the week. I cannot bring my mind to see that the mere acceptance of this proposal released the government from its obligation to completely fulfill its terms. Certainly no such law or logic would be applied to the contract or donation of an individual. The formal act of acceptance may have had the effect of preventing the corporation from rightfully retiring from the arrangement as I say as the government was engaged in fulfilling its promise; but what court was ever told, until this case was argued, that an acceptance by a donee, not of the actual funds of the donation, but only the promise of the donor, foreclosed an inquiry as to whether those promises were redeemed. The acceptance of the condition of a contract or gift implies that the terms of the contract or gift will be fully performed, and is, therefore, not beyond recall on equitable terms, when it is found that the contract or donation will not be fully performed by the party who is charged with its performance.

Judge Grosscup held therefore that, as there had been a breach of contract on the part of the Government by withholding a portion of its appropriation, the corporation was thereby relieved from all legal or equitable compulsion as to the carrying out of the condition imposed. To hold otherwise would be to "sacrifice the substance of justice to the mere shadow of form."

Immediately upon the rendering of the decision of the court, Attorney Edwin Walker, for the Columbian Exposition, took an appeal and asked that the appeal should have the effect of a supersedeas and the gates be thus permitted to remain open until the final decision of the matter upon appeal. This request was denied and the injunction was ordered to issue. Mr. Walker then immediately applied to Chief Justice Fuller, of the United States Supreme Court, who is in the city, and obtained a restraining order, permitting the Fair to remain open Sunday, June 11, and secured also a hearing of the question before the Appellate Court on Thursday, June 15. Chief Justice Fuller will sit on the bench with Judges Allen of Illinois, and Bunn of Wisconsin. The final outcome, as far as Sunday opening or closing of the Fair is concerned, is just as indefinite as at any previous time, but whichever it may be, the matter of real moment, the agitation of the question of constitutional and inherent rights, both civil and religious, is likely to be equally subserved.
