Ford's Store, Md., June 7, 1893.

1893, Bro. Alexander Dodd and myself, of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, at the Steam Boat Company's wharf at Jackson some town, were each, fined seven on Tuesday, June 1.

The farmer, T. F. Ford (my brother), had three other men to see the work done or to be the witnesses against them. They were Samuel H. Ford (my brother), Samuel —— a farmer or a professor of religion to engage in.

We were tried June 1 before the Magistrate, M. Aker, convicted, fined, and the case was sent to the Circuit Court. M. Aker convicted, fined, and acted as counsel in these cases. Under the old system (when this country was under English rule) the officers could not serve.

When the case went before the magistrate we said we would have to pay for it for the bond (as we took an appeal). "I told him that we could not obey that law, and on pay the $2 or go to jail. I told him to his face that I could get no satisfaction, fined of misery says, 'I can't do that,' he told him to his all told together convictions we would go to jail the council could not Anne Arundel County Court convictions.

Also, Sister Hettie Marshall was arrested for sewing on her own premises, on Sunday, April 30th. She was also in formed, by an officer, but the State's witnesses did not appear, so the case was postponed until June 8. I am positive that the State's witnesses can be made to appear, and that matter will be completed. We are building a church, and the devil is getting angry.

In my cross-examination to-day I named certain parties who work every Sunday on oath that they would not break the law of them. Now if they ever ride out on Sabbath or any day for evil they are the ones who always have done, they may speak for themselves. But Seventh-day Adventists are the only ones prosecuted because it is not their religion.

People can readily see that this is religious persecution. For during the years that these people were becoming as strict about their Sunday, these things must not be brought into legislation again. But these goods landed were goods that were sold, damp, and changeable in time and I would sooner be magistrate than Chief Justice of the United States to sit in judgment because there are none that the world.

Can you readily see that this is faithfully as an humble citizen and will try to get those very men who were themselves had arrested. But think, that the last arrested for Sunday were even the one who had to suffer for Christ, as he suffered so much for us! What a terrible responsibility will rest on those who persecute!

The goods landed were goods that were sold, damp, and changeable by time that exists here, they were tumble sacks of husked corn. They were husked on Sunday night, June 5, at 8 o'clock, for if they had not been husked at that time they would be in the warehouses built upon that boat; and I told the officer that he did not intend to do.

the family, the Church, and the State, must be respected. Obedience to the just and legal authority is obedience to God. Rebellion against just and legal authority is resisting God. "And they that resist shall receive judgment." 1. Every nation must be ordered, and the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor as a beverage of human life should be punished with ill-fame and the "social evil" must be prohibited, and equally and every division made impossible by a uniform national law. Mormon polygamy must be stopped. 8. Stock-gambling must be stopped, nurse-kings and grasping corporations and heartless trusts and syndicates must be subjected to the restrictions involved in the Golden Rule. 9. Falsehood and perjury must be punished with rigor. 10. Dissolutely, anarchy and lawlessness must be made afraid of the arm of the law which is held over them.
