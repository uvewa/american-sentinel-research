THE opinion seems to be quite general in this country that the majority has the right to do anything that it wishes. "The majority must rule," is an expression often heard. And majority rule within certain well defined limits is right; but in this country the rule of the majority is limited, or it is supposed to be, by certain inalienable rights, known as "constitutional rights." Beyond those constitutions even the majority has no right to go. Moreover back of the constitutions lie the fundamental, inalienable rights which no government whatever of one of many any right to invade.
