The Independent of Santa Barbara, Cal., expresses this opinion:—

> The World's Fair will do some good in this country anyway. It will go a long way toward freeing the people from the Sunday law bondage in which they have always been. While the people have been gradually escaping, ever since the days of the Connecticut Blue Laws this is by long odds the longest step ever taken. It is an emancipation proclamation as it were. Even a quarter of a century ago no member of a public body like the World's Fair Commission would have dared to make such a proposition.

The effect will be just the opposite to that which the Independent anticipates. "Revolutions never go backward," and a great religio-political revolution is in progress in our land to-day. Whether the Fair is opened or closed on Sunday, a purely religious question has found its way into politics, has been discussed and voted upon by Congress, and argued before courts and been passed upon by judges. It can never again be relegated to the precincts of ecclesiastical councils. "The domain that government invades it dominates; the jurisdiction it takes it keeps."
