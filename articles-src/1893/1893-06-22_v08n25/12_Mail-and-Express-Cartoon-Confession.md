Have you seen the cartoon on the second page of this paper from the Mail and Express, the great self-elected champion of all Sunday legislation? It is a confession that in passing the act closing the Columbian Exposition on Sunday the United States assumed to say to people that they ought to go to church. And yet we are told that Sunday laws are not religious legislation, and do not tend to unite Church and State!
