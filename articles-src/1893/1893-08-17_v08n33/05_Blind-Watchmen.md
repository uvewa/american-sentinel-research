SAYS the republic (Isa. 56:10), speaking of Israel: "His watchmen are blind." However we may regard the application of this language, certainly there are some religious teachers who are very blind to principles in fact. There are some ministers who seem to lack even spiritual guides at the present time. A case in point is found in the following reflections upon the Sunday-school lesson of the last quarterly of the Epistles of Paul and Silas at Philippi, in the *Christian Statesman*. Starting out with the remark that "this lesson looks as though it had been selected especially for the thing," it proceeds to institute a comparison between the apostle's persecution and those who oppose Sunday laws. In this comparison the article there are two things that the teachers would lead us to themselves that the only way we can account for their not seeing this lie, and commending what flattery of their own deliberation, is to apply the vision to the condition of their state of the case. Space will permit us to quote only a small part of this production.

> Such outrages bring as has been done by the courts of the Pittsburgh Sunday papers is charged with counseling the "not-infrequent arrests of hard working-citizens" for violation of Sunday laws, and the proprietors of the papers and religious papers of that city are arraigned in the following forcible and argumentative style:

> Such outrages bring as has been done by the courts in this matter "in the name of religion and good morals" should provoke response in any sober matter.

> At the present time, it is a fact, the State laws against working on Sunday are obsolete and worthless as a law. None of the courts in the county, the inquiry will be into, or are said to be, whether the ancient, frambrish and law-defying methods of proceedings taken to enforce these Sabbath laws by effecting Sunday closings. Such a law invokes military power in their support, and has made any power's writ to bear. . . They do not want to enforce this law!

In the following extracts, with a most suggestive closing paragraph:

> In giving the reasons why the Standists are persecuted in Russia, a correspondent of the *Missionary Review* says:—

> "The worship of Icons and of painted pictures and of prayed-for statues required at certain places, such as crossing a bridge, or gate of a Russian city, in front of any image of the God of Russia; are an everyday hindrance to all Standists. This is one explanation why they churches closed to, and which are observed as an omen of their opposition to all the old power and pomp of the established Church. . .

> In speaking of the earthquake which shook open the prison doors for the following extracts, with a most suggestive closing paragraph:—

> How was where the ministers of the Gospel made righteous but not the instrument of self for their account. "In the exercise of Paul and Silas at Philippi." But the earthquake which opened the prison doors for Paul and Silas might have been sufficient if there had been no jailer who feared God. It was through the jailer that they saw room a forceful fact for a little while. This is the lesson for every Standist.

But the worst enemies of Christianity are among its professed friends, and them
