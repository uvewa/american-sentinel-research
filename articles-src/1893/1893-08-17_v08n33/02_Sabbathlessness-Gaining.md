THE *Christian Statesman* of June 10, 1893, in an editorial, speaking of the Sunday question, says:—

Having passed the boundary line as which the Fair was to have been opened on Sunday, the government might interpose if permitted to wait while the boundaries recede. Their requests are not only not complied with; they are refused, but their boundaries set back. And they are gaining ground. They are obtaining recruits. Sabbath laws are gaining

show of their power to remade the Sabbath every day and more daring. And with the loss of the Sabbath every additional Sabbathless people is a greater mockery and hindrance of that day which is the bulwark of the Sabbath institutions.

And the alarming fact is that this advance of the anti-Sabbath forces is not being met by any proportionate rallying of the forces of the Sabbath. Already Christian people are being drawn into this desecration of the Sabbath or settled down into a tolerance of the Sabbath desecration that during the past winter would have been regarded as impossible.

The answer to this is not difficult; it is simply this: the Sabbath is not—it never was—in the hands of the Government. In all lands, the Christian man, the Statesman leading, are trampling on God's Sabbath all the time. Christ's example is a most mischievous way. They have the religion of the Word of God and are trying to patch a civil statute upon the religion of Jesus Christ. God is grieved by this, and it has no law for them to plead ignorance. Let them try to reform by preaching; it is their nature they try to reform. God is may not say his truth for all. Let his followers acknowledge God's truth remains immoved, and their failure to recognize this truth and maintain it has run against Shall until it begin to find God's ground in its strongest than "National Reform" falsehoods, however dignified, or however many Christian Statesmen, lies the explanation. You be the tree you wish, do by righteous God, trampling on the Sabbath, transferring its sacredness to another day, using mere presumptions to cover your crime, and yet by continuing to violate that same your civil stationing is lightly as you treat God's ever. And will you please remember, brethren, this is God's truth you are treating, not ours. But don't deceive yourselves, God will bless his own cause when all your efforts are defeated—*brethren!*
