THE *Christian Statesman* of June 10, 1893, in an editorial, speaking of the forces of evil, says:—

> Having passed the boundary line at which conscience ceases to be a restraining influence, they now propose to remove the barrier which civil government might interpose if permitted to wield its power in the interest of morals. They therefore deny to civil government a right to the moral domain. And they are gaining ground. They are obtaining victories. Sabbath laws are gradually shorn of their power to restrain the Sabbath breakers. And with the loss of the Sabbath every safeguard to morals is lost. All history proves that a Sabbathless people is a people given up to license and immorality. There has been no exception to the general rule. And the Sabbath is going.
>
> And the alarming fact is that this advance of the enemy is against the most active and earnest endeavors of the Christian people to retain the distinctively Christian features in our national life. Never was the battle waged more vigorously for the Sabbath than during the past year. And never have the enemies of the Sabbath obtained greater victories against the Sabbath. In the face of the combined opposition of the Christian citizens the advance has been made. What is the reason of this? How shall we explain this impotence of the Christian forces, in the great conflict for the maintenance of the Christian elements in our national life? Why these defeats all along the line?

The answer to this is not difficult; it "lies in hand," as the Germans say. Christian men, the Statesman leading, are trampling on God's Sabbath, and Christ's example in a most unchristian way. They have deserted and denied the Word of God and are trying to patch a compromise by false assertions concerning Sunday. God is ignored by them. It is too late for them to plead ignorance. Defeat is upon them, and will follow them until they return to God. It may be hard for them to bear defeat on defeat, but God's truth remains unmoved, and their ship of "Sabbath Reform," falsely named, has run against Sinai until it begins to find that God's granite is stronger than "National Reform" falsehoods, however painted or puttied. Herein, oh, Christian Statesman, lies the explanation. You begin the work of ruin, by disobeying God, trampling on the Sabbath, transferring its name to Sunday, and coining false assumptions to cover your crime, and end by complaining that men treat your civil statutes as lightly as you treat God's everlasting laws. If you are not content, keep on. God can abide the issue as long as you can. But don't deceive yourself, nor ask longer for an explanation as to why your efforts are defeated.—*Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.*
