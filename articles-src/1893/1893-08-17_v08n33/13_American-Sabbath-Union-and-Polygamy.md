SOME one has sent us a paper containing a marked article by the President of the American Sabbath Union in which the position is taken that polygamy is enjoined in the Old Testament, and that, therefore, the Mormon can as plausibly plead that he should be permitted to have several wives as the Sabbath keeper that he ought not to be molested for working on Sunday. For a complete refutation of this sophistry see No. 119 of the Religious Liberty Library, *Review and Herald*, Battle Creek, Mich. Price 3 cents single copy.
