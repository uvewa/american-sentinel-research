In giving the reasons why the Stundists are persecuted in Russia, a correspondent of the *New York Observer* says:—

> The worship of icons and of particular crosses and pictures is also held in utter abomination, and it is this iconoclastic spirit more perhaps than anything else that causes the Stundist to be so detected by the Orthodox Church party. . . . Holy days in Russia are, as everybody knows, absurdly numerous. In addition to Sundays, there are fifty-three days in each year when all public offices and schools must be closed, and which are observed as general holidays. Every Russian, moreover, has his name's day—the day set apart for the worship of the saint whose name he bears. St. John's Day, for example, is observed as a holiday by all the Ivans in the empire. The Stundist sets his face resolutely against these "prandniki," as they are called; says they are relics of heathenism, which they undoubtedly are, and somewhat too ostentatiously for his own peace, he goes about his work on these days as on ordinary days.

Now, the whole Protestant world denounces the persecution of the Stundists in Russia, yet the reasons why they are interfered with are substantially the same that are urged in justification of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists in this country. In the case of the Stundists they "ostentatiously" disregard the Russian holy days; and in the case of R. M. King, in Tennessee, it was said that he "ostentatiously" set at defiance the religious prejudices of his neighbors. He simply worked on Sunday just as on other days, just as he had a right to do and as every man has a right to do, but which religious prejudice does not permit in America any more than it permits the Stundists to disregard the fifty-three holy days dear to the average Russian.
