LAST week, from a number of considerations of Scriptures, we found that the Sabbath question is not a question merely of a day or days; not a question merely as to whether we shall have one day or another. But it is a question as to whether we shall worship the true God or another; as to whether we shall have him, in short, the one true Saviour, or another. It is a question as to whether we shall have the one true power and have him for our Sanctifier, or another.

And this, because the Sabbath of the Lord which he made, the seventh day, he has appointed—this, the Lord has declared is a sign between him and his people; it is a sign that by which they may be kept in such a true relationship to him that they might know that he is the true and living God, the Creator, the Lord our God; and a sign by which they may know that he sanctifies them. He has given the sign that he is the Lord, the true God, the Creator, and he being also the true Saviour—he is also the sign by which they may know the true Saviour; and the rest of the Lord being the sign that men may know that he is God, and as no man can know the mercy of Jesus Christ, it is, when hallowed, the sign of what Jesus Christ is to man.

It is by the power of God manifested in and through Jesus Christ alone, and by the Holy Spirit, that salvation is wrought. And to every one that believeth. Therefore, if I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; Rom. 1:16. "Neither is there salvation in any other." Acts 4:12. "There is no God beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God and there is none else." Isa. 45:21, 22. "And no man knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him." Matt. 11:27. "Hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the Lord your God." And "I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them." Eze. 20:10, 11. This is the meaning of the Sabbath of the Lord; as he made it and as he gave it.

But in the scriptures of the prophets, it is told that there would arise another power, putting itself above God and in the place of Jesus Christ, as the Counselor and Saviour of men. Thus it is written: "That day [the day of the Lord's coming] shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple [the place of worship] of God, showing himself that he is God. Remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things?" And that very thing is in the letter addressed to the Thessalonians. When Paul was at Thessalonica, he had told them these same things. Now, of his visit to Thessalonica we read, "When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews and Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures."

"And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few." Acts 17:4.

Reasoning with them out of the Scriptures he told them of the apostasy and of the development and exaltation of this man of sin above God, putting himself in the place of worship of God, showing himself that he is God. Now, the only Scriptures that they then had, and out of which he taught them, what were, was the Old Testament Scriptures. Where then in these Scriptures is to be found the teaching concerning one who would set himself in opposition to God and above God? This: "Through his policy also, he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many; he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes." "Yea, he magnified himself even to [even against—margin] the Prince of the host." Dan. 8:25, 11. By comparing the phrase "stand up," in this verse, with the same phrase in verse 5, and Dan. 11:7, 8, 4, 7, it will be plain to all that in this verse "stand up" signifies "to reign" as a king. It is seen, therefore, that there would appear in the world a power opposed to Christ, reigning in his stead, putting himself in his place, and even above God, showing himself of God.

Now, everybody knows that there has appeared, and that there still continues, in the world, just such a power as is here described. It is the Papacy. Everybody knows that the head and the embodiment of this power, calls himself before all the world, "Vicar of Jesus Christ." A vicar is a substitute; he therefore is the substitute of Jesus Christ. While as a substitute, the therefore he poses as the antichrist of Jesus Christ. While he claims to be the substitute to rule in it, and to save or deliver it as his "infallible" will shall dictate. And as God is the Saviour and there is none also, and as this power puts itself in the place of God, and stands above God, it follows in itself that this power—this substitute, wall of necessity—put itself in the place of God and Jesus Christ the only way of salvation.

Error on in a slight—any point of essential departure, to become a worshiper of the Catholicism, and in its error for truth and submission to his authority.

Hence the Catholic Church, "is justly called the only *strong* government in the world. To deny its sovereignty is in the same as to oppose Christ, namely, to deny his divinity, and to deny the efficacy of that which proceeds from her is the same as to separate God from Jesus Christ." From 2 Thess. 2:4. And as with the other Epistles of Paul, specially that to the Galatians, we find this, this decision: "Whosoever is separated from Christ . . . ye are fallen from grace." Now upon his opinion his may be, shall he, for this very thing that him is in its the nature more especially the unity of Christ, on any life, but his unto wreath of God in itself unto the truth to those to be in authority.

into salvation; and the Sabbath of the Lord being the sign of this, it follows of necessity that when another puts himself above God and in the place of God and another is manifested unto a proposed salvation, if that other power is to be recognized and maintained, and if it is not recognized as of authority, this sign of the true God and the true Saviour is impossible that it should be observed. As he puts himself above God and in the place of God, and of the Saviour—he is therefore the rival—the substitute instead—of the true God and Saviour; as certainly as he sets up a sign by which he would be known, this sign, in order to mean anything in the way that God would have to be a rival, a substitute also of the true Sabbath, the true sign of the true God and Saviour.

And has this been done consistently? The most "The mark of," the "sign of perdition," "the mystery of iniquity," what is the Papacy, what this—that the substitute of Jesus Christ, has the substituted a sign instead of the sign of God and in the place of the Sabbath and for the Sabbath of the Lord.

> *Ques.*—Had not the Church her authority, she could have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority?*—Abridgment of Christian Doctrine.*

> *Ques.*—Does the Church just prove that the Church has power to institute festivals of precept?*—Abridgment of Christian Doctrine.*

> *Ans.*—By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other festivals commanded by the same Church.

> *Ques.*—How prove you that?

> *Ans.*—Because by keeping Sunday, they acknowledge the Church's power to ordain feasts and to command them under sin; and by not keeping the rest by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power.—*Abridgment of Christian Doctrine.*

Then clearly and surely it is demonstrated from the Scriptures that the Sabbath question, so far from being a question of merely one day or another as such, it is a question as to whether we shall worship and serve God or another; and whether we shall have one Saviour or another; whether we shall acknowledge and worship the Lord of the Lord's power; whether we shall look to Jesus Christ for salvation or to the Papacy; whether we shall honor the true God or his explanation; whether we shall worship the true God or the "substitute" for him. It is a question whether we shall worship the true God in the Glory of God, or that of the man of sin; whether we shall choose the sign that God has set, or the sign which the Papacy has instituted for its whether we shall take the sign of the Most High or the mark of "the mystery of iniquity," "that wicked" "the beast." It is a question as to whether the Sabbath of the Lord shall be observed as he made it, and as he gave it; or whether the substitute, the Sunday, which has been set up by the Papacy shall take precedence of it and whether the observance of the Sabbath of the Lord shall be to God instead, or whether Sunday, that of the Papacy—"shall indeed be observed."

Then it is what the Sabbath question is, and that is what the present is involved in it. And what the churches and Congress of the United States have done in this Sunday legislation, is to fasten upon the Government of the United States this sign of papal authority, and to call upon all the people of the United States to receive and wear this badge of allegiance to the Papacy. In this Sunday legislation, by which the seventh day the Sabbath of the Lord, was intercepted out of his lot, and Sunday in the place of God put into the law, was interpreted into that law instead of the Sabbath which was already there. The laws of the United States have, so far as in them is, taken away from, past the knowledge of the true God and Saviour, and have required that men shall receive and worship the Papacy instead. And it is an abominable piece of business. But they have done it.

That which now remains is for such persons to decide for himself, whether he will do this which the churches and Congress would require him. It is for each to decide for himself whether he will know the Papacy above God; whether he will worship the Papacy or the Lord, and whether he will wear the sign of the Papacy or the sign of what Jesus Christ is to man. And that this may be come more plainly, if need be, we set out two things here side by side.

|---|---|
| What sign does the Lord give? | What sign does the Papacy give? |
| It is the Sabbath. | It is Sunday. |
| Eze. 20:10, 20. | See the authority above. |
| What is the Lord's sign to you? | What is the sign which the Papacy |
| It is to make you holy. | has set? |
| To set you free. To save you. | It is to make you subject to her. |
| And to what end? | To hold you in her power. |
| That ye may know that I am the | |
| Lord. | |
| And what do you know? That the | |
| Lord is your God. | |
| Heb. 4:3, 4, 10, and Eze. 20:12. | |
| Which sign do you choose? | |

What is given? And what did God give? | Which way do you take? Which do you choose? Which do you receive? Which sign do you set to? To which one of these do you look to be saved? How much do you look for the power of salvation? Think seriously of this, and next week, from the doctrine and the history, we shall establish the contrast of the meaning of this substitution of Sunday for the Sabbath of the Lord.
