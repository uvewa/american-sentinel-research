Now that the Sunday closing question has been definitely settled—if, indeed, it is settled yet—all parties to the controversy ought to be satisfied. The advocates of Sunday opening of the World's Fair have secured a legal recognition of their contention that the local directory could rightfully open the Exposition seven days in the week if it chose. At the same time, it has chosen to take such action as appears to be a compliance with the demands of the Sunday closers. Both sides should be satisfied then, the latter because Sunday closing is an accomplished fact; the former because though their principle is conceded, their Sunday patronage of the Fair was not sufficiently large to warrant the incurred expense.

It is a good time now to review the situation and discover its lessons. A few questions are appropriate. Is the Sunday closing of the Fair "a great moral victory," as its advocates claim? It would hardly seem so in face of the fact that no moral reasons are officially assigned for the determination to close. The fact is that it was purely a matter of financial policy that the Fair was closed; Sunday opening did not pay either the stockholders or the patrons who were charged full price for the privilege of seeing half the exhibits closed or covered by their owners.

For Sunday closing to be proved "a great moral victory," it must be shown that Sunday opening was immoral, a thesis that is by no means conceded in Sunday closing. Is it an immoral thing to view the wonders and achievements in the art, science, and mechanics of any and all nations on Thursday? Then why on Sunday? If it be replied, because Sunday is a day sanctified by religious sentiment and worship, the question is immediately shifted from the field of morals to religion; and at this point we are discussing only the morality or immorality of an open Fair. Granted that civil government may legislate upon considerations of immorality, so called, in distinction from religion, there is no showing that such considerations entered into the settlement of the question of Sunday closing.

But it may be urged that the employment of sixteen thousand men in running beer gardens on the grounds every Sunday was certainly an immoral proceeding demanding suppression. Assuredly it was; but no more immoral on Sunday than any other day, and no more immoral inside the grounds than outside. The people who wanted to drink beer or something stronger on Sunday could get it just as easily outside the gates, and without paying the admission fee. It has been thoroughly demonstrated to the shame of Chicago that Sunday closing of the Fair did not prevent this and other nameless forms of immorality. So Sunday closing is certainly not "a great moral victory" in this respect.

But if not a moral victory, is not Sunday closing a great religious victory? It hardly seems that way to one who holds that religion should at least include morality. Even if the Fair had been closed by civil enactment, avowedly for religious reasons, it would scarcely have been a victory for religion—though it might have seemed to favor what some people think is religion. But let it be remembered that that true religion never seeks, nor boasts of, the assistance of civil law; much less when that assistance takes the form of a colossal bribe. Christianity should crimson with the shame of prostitution to think of the pure religion of Jesus in such an attitude!

But there are a few more questions that are pertinent. Who wanted the Fair closed on Sundays? Apparently a large proportion of the membership of nearly all the religious denominations and allied organizations in the land, showing unmistakably the religious interest in the question. Added to these were the Chicago brewers and liquor dealers with few exceptions. Their interest is easily conceived. Then Senator Matthew Quay strangely but piously (?) wanted the Fair closed on Sunday in obedience to "the Book of law," which commands the observance of the rest day of orthodox Jews. And Senator Hawley wanted the Sunday closing provision to pass so that he and other politicians could "come back here" to Congress. Altogether the combination which forced the Sunday closing bribe through the national legislature was not intensely and unanimously either moral or religious. And so again it is not manifest that the final accomplishment of their purpose is a great victory devoutly to be lauded by all good people. An inherently good cause seldom invites such support as this received.

On the other hand, who wanted Sunday opening? Undoubtedly many bad men as well as good ones. Doubtless the motive to maintain an open Fair was largely that of making as much money as possible—just as the confessed reason for Sunday closing now is. Yet the influence and numbers of those who demanded an open Fair was by no means inconsiderable if there is reason to applaud Sunday closing as "a great victory." Yet the writer but recently heard an ardent, and apparently intelligent advocate of Sunday closing, declare that "Nobody wanted the Fair open on Sunday but Seventh-day Adventists and thugs." Well, it must be said that honors are easy between the two sides so far as the adherence of "thugs" is concerned; but the Seventh-day Adventists are certainly peculiar in their attitude on this question. It is frequently stated that the Seventh-day Adventists are in favor of an open Fair, and energetically circulated petitions to secure it; but the facts are different. The only petitions circulated by these people have been to secure a repeal of congressional legislation intended to close the Fair on Sunday. To any one who thinks, this is vastly different than to petition Congress to close the Fair on Sunday. Seventh-day Adventists have from the beginning of the controversy consistently held that Congress had no constitutional right to dictate to the local directory in the matter of Sunday closing; and the decisions of the courts, in none of which they were directly interested, their views have been sustained. The local board has the right which it has exercised in trying both Sunday opening and Sunday closing.

One final query: Is the Sunday question now finally settled in this country? Not at all. The decisions of both Judge Jenkins and Chief Justice Field are merely vindicative of the principle of State rights against congressional encroachment. They do not at all touch the propriety of the original legislation by which Congress sought to bring about Sunday closing in response to the demands of organized religionists. That action stands still unquestioned by judicial utterance and unrepealed as a precedent for religious legislation. And the people who are congratulating themselves upon the accomplishment of this "great victory" are by no means content with it. The vigilant, patriotic lover of civil and religious liberty shall see greater things than this.
