*Chicago Correspondence.*

THE injunction granted by Judge Stein in the Clingman case, enjoining the World's Fair officials from excluding the people from Jackson Park, has proved a serious, and perhaps an unexpected, obstacle in the way of Sunday closing. Judge Stein has not receded in the least degree from the position first taken by him in that case. On Sunday, July 23, the gates of Jackson Park were closed to all persons except those directly connected with the Exposition or carrying passes. This was by order of the Board of Directors, and in direct disobedience to the order of the court. The authority of the State court was entirely ignored; no steps being taken so far as came to the knowledge of the court or the public, to secure the dissolution of the injunction or even to learn the intention of the court as to the matter, or of the views held by the parties to the case under the changed conditions which had come about. In reality this would have only been courtesy, and could have had no positive value in the matter because the injunction had been granted and was on record as a formal act of the court. Nothing but a formal act of the court taken after due presentation of the matter could have nullified it. The parties against whom the injunction was directed were bound to take notice of it. On the contrary, they ignored it entirely. There was no evidence shown that they had even so much as remembered its existence. It appeared, however, as the case developed, that they had remembered its existence, but had carelessly and unwarrantably acted upon the supposition that it was of no authority and that the court would permit its action to be ignored and overridden with impunity.

This was a most remarkable thing for men of high business intelligence and extensive experience to do. It was entirely unwarrantable and met with a severe rebuke at the hands of Judge Stein.

In one sentence the judge solved the entire problem about which so much mystery has been thrown in the different trials of the World's Fair cases, as to who are the responsible and authoritative parties in the management of the World's Fair, namely, the directors. The penalty which he imposed upon five of them of $1,000 each and another of $100 and the Director General of $250, are in direct evidence that the World's Fair Directors are not the agents of the Government of the United States in the matter of the World's Fair, and that the Exposition is not a great eleemosynary institution under the guidance and direction of the United States Government, but a practical business enterprise under the direction and business management of a corporation established under the laws of the State of Illinois, and which is responsible for its acts to the State of Illinois and cannot with impunity override the decrees of a State Court.

This fact has been impressed by the act of the court upon these directors and upon the public most effectually. In sentencing the directors for their contempt of court, the judge very properly remarked that even in ordinary cases, when the facts constituting the breach of an injunction were known to none but the immediate parties in interest, yet even then, when the breach is brought to the knowledge of the court, the law is swift to punish the offender, but in this case the violation of the injunction was as public and as notorious as it possibly could be; more than that, it was by men of the highest standing and intelligence in the community, who of all others should have scrupulously obeyed the law and thereby set an example to the rest.

These facts which are undeniably true, make it not only proper but necessary in a case brought so prominently before the community and the world at large in a matter of so much moment and importance that no mere nominal penalty should be affixed. Bonds were given for the payment of the fines and notice of an appeal filed. It is not supposed that the appeal can be tried before next November. In the meantime, as far as the present status of things is concerned, it appears that in obedience to the injunction, Jackson Park will have to be open to the public on all days of the week.

After all the vicissitudes through which this contest has gone, this is a remarkable and no doubt very unlooked for conclusion, yet so many and unexpected have been the kaleidoscopic changes of the Sunday question as regards the World's Fair that it is not possible to predict from week to week what the outcome may be.

It will be interesting to see what views of this enforcement of law will be expressed by those who were so ready to demand that the Sunday opening faction should yield without objection to the decision of the United States Circuit Court by which the gates of the Fair were closed. At that time they were quick to demand an immediate submission and to accuse of anarchy even those who sought in the regular course of legal procedure to obtain a revision of the ruling of that court. But when that decision was overruled and the gates opened by the decree of a higher court, they forgot their previous advice to others and bitterly and intensely antagonized the decision of the higher court.

In the case of the directory which had thus carelessly put into practice the theory which they had been taught by the Sunday closers, of the valuelessness and lack of authority of the decisions of courts, except as they were in accordance with their wishes and conditions, the judge had here a practical opportunity, and, in the circumstances, was under the necessity of giving an unmistakable lesson of the authority of a decree of the court and the wisdom of obedience. In this whole matter the Sunday closers have convicted themselves of that of which they accused others, and those who unwittingly followed their advice and acted according to their wish have received the necessary penalty. These members of the World's Fair Directory are most unexpectedly and unintentionally the scapegoats of the entire National-Reform-Sabbath-Union-Sunday-closing clique.

The views of the decision of the court in this matter expressed by the city press, are various and suggestive. The Evening Post upholds Judge Stein and says that it is not clear how he could have done otherwise than he did; the Herald characterizes it as "a joke, but a serious joke. The act of contempt was not malicious, and apparently not with deliberate intent. It was a good-natured, total disregard and neglect of the court's order, under the supposition, if they supposed anything, that it never had any force or had lost its force while they were looking some other way." Granting this to be true, would it not, in persons of such prominence in business and financial circles, so well acquainted with all the requirements of their position and of such standing, not only personally but in public capacity, before the community and the world, be as marked a case of contempt as could well be imagined? Certainly, it would, and this apology thus intended to be made for the directors would really militate against them rather than in their favor.

The Inter Ocean makes a similar excuse for the directory and says, "it will be the general opinion that Judge Stein might have vindicated his honor by inflicting very nominal fines upon those directors and authorities of the World's Fair who had ordered the gates to be closed in neglect of his ruling in the Clingman case. The fine of $1,000 seems to savor of the arbitrary." The Inter Ocean neglects to remark that it is not the honor of Judge Stein, personally, that is at stake, but that there was a decree of the court which could not be permitted to be recklessly overridden, and that it was not the personal honor of the judge which was at stake, but the question as to whether the citizens of the State should give due consideration to the decree of the State Court. The Chicago Times entitles its editorial upon the subject "Vindicating the Law," and says: "The court under the circumstances could do no less than was done. It might have done more." And goes on to say that law is nothing unless it is operative against these directors "as well as to the humblest creature that abides within its influence. It is nothing if it does not reach the millionaire as readily as it reaches the man of no means at all. It is nothing if, ignoring classes created by arrogance or prejudice, it does not compel obedience from the highest as from the humblest of citizens. That it is a potency against men of intelligence and of wealth who offend, has been demonstrated by the action of the Superior Court."

The whole effect of this peculiar contest and its surprising outcome should be to teach those who would enforce religion by law, the fallacy of their position, and show them that it is just as possible, in so far as the technical use of legal methods is concerned, to enforce upon them that which they consider irreligion as for them to enforce upon others what they call religion; and consequently every religious question is entirely without the sphere of civil jurisdiction.

Chicago, August 4.
