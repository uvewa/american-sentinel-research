MR. CRAFTS, be of the "new method of petitioning," by which men, women and children are counted once and again many times over as petitioners for his pet schemes, thinks that the reopening of the Fair on Sunday "is not to be feared, notwithstanding that Congress has been heard." "I would," he says, "inflict swift punishment if any second 'contempt' put upon the authority and 'the people's will.'" So he would have Congress not only override the Constitution by making an appropriation directly in the interest of a religious institution, but he would also have that body violate the charter of American liberty by enforcing *ex post facto* law, that is a law imposing a penalty after the commission of the act. Moreover, he would have the legislative branch of the Government usurp the functions of the other two branches of the Government, namely, the judicial and the executive. There is nothing small about this gentleman except his ideas of other people's rights.

WHEN an injunction was sought from Federal Judge Jenkins enjoining the World's Fair Directors from keeping the Fair open on Sunday, on the ground that to do so would impose a financial loss upon the stockholders, because of the religious boycott, the judge held that he had no power to grant a relief in the nature of an injunction and that there was no because it was a question of policy to be decided by the directors, and with which the courts had no right to meddle.

Some people have supposed that in granting an injunction forbidding the closing

of the gates on Sunday, Judge Stein violated the rule thus stated by Judge Jenkins. This is a mistake. This Stein injunction was granted by a State court solely on the ground that Jackson Park in which the Fair is held, being dedicated to the city by a race "is to be open to the people of Illinois for ever," could not be closed to the public on any day of the week by anybody. This is a question over which a United States Court could not possibly have any jurisdiction, and is a very different question from the question presented before Jenkins.

It now seems inevitable that the World's Fair will be a financial failure. The latest estimate places the resources at $31,610,000, and the liabilities at $61,653,000 including the debenture bonds. The best that is estimated is a deficit of $1,710,000. These calculations take in $3,000,000 as an admission collection; for certain, material on the grounds are not counted in the official figures. All outstanding loans cut off $1,000,000 of stock subscribers and city and State are sums of debts. But with the reimbursing the stockholders or taking up the bonds appears to have been abandoned. This is in a large measure due to the general strategy of the times, but it is more than likely that in that the Sunday papers are claiming everything in its sight, and a wholesale gigantic failure will be charged up to Sunday opening. And it is utter disregard of the fact that Sunday is on the Sabbath but is a fraud, the failure of the Fair will be cited as conclusive evidence of the divine displeasure.

WE have received from the publishers, in Lakeside Place, Mich, No. 24 of the "Truth Seeker Library," the same being "Fun Pictures of the World's Fair," by Mr. Putnam. Mr. Putnam is a pleasant gentleman, and so an excellent writer, and we cannot speak of this little work without expressing a regret that one of his talents should waste his time and his talent in fighting something that does not exist. In the one Mr. Putnam misses, because in it justification of the present Sunday opening of the Fair to the Seventh-day Baptists in the community (actually) disregard the Russian holy days; the propriety of that they take it for.

(*In issue of June 29, The Christian Oracle, of Chicago, published by consent a section by Fro. Putnam of the speech of the Minority in the United States Congress. In its issue of July 13, the Oracle takes issue with the sermon, and the following is the review.*)

To this we reply. If the Nation has a right to interfere with the freedom of conscience of a few Seventh-day Adventists, in this matter, it certainly has a greater obligation to protect that right. And it is the inalienable right to protection of his institutions by doctrinal means and without direct from the State, to protect it from the unlawful encroachments of other religions, we would like to know by what authority Congress sought to regulate the matter. In the premises of Paul and Silas at Philippi. If I were a Seventh-day Adventist I would say to the friends in Russia: "Though other religions be above the law, mine shall not be below it." But the question corrections the propriety of the professor's assertion that the nation runs of its own accord "in yelling for the gates open on Sunday." They have been referred to at different places in our columns, as to the real controversy over the terms of the seven thousand school-children which will pass the following resolution of the legislature. They have no chance there as regards the gates themselves, but how many of that nine out of every ten would be in favor of Sunday closing if they lived near the central part of the city and is open on Sunday anyway. There is a considerable Seventh-day Adventist population in Northwestern Ohio, that it was there for at business. But the case of the Fair is closed on Sunday. This was said to give an opportunity to rest the matter hold of civil Sunday and for further Sunday attention as to the effect on his literature some of the strongest.

In speaking of the earthquake which shook open the prison doors for the following of Paul out of the jail, Mr. Putnam says the "defender of Christianity" says the jailer was a superstitious man.

How was where the ministers of the Gospel made righteous, but not the instrument of self for their account. In the exercise of Paul and Silas at Philippi. But the earthquake which opened the prison doors for Paul and Silas might have been sufficient if there had been no jailer who feared God. It was through the jailer that they saw room a forceful fact for a while. This is a lesson for every Standist.

To this we reply, If the Nation has a right to interfere the desire of the community further than to protect each phase of it in the inalienable right to protection of its doctrines by moral means and without direct from the State, to protect it from the unlawful encroachments of other religions, we would like to know by which
