IT is it unquestionably true that the treatment which Sunday receives at the hands of many Christians is the primary source of its weakness. It is equally certain that Christians have betrayed conscientious touching Sunday by their efforts to enlist the claims of the Sabbath. "Saturday." In order to quote conscience for disregarded Christianity does its effect in the world which are fatal to religion regard for any day.

Another reason for the growing disregard for Sunday thus recognized—more of the facts concerning it and its development into Christian history, all of which destroys faith in it, and continues to reject to it. This situation is serious indeed, so far as Sunday is concerned.

In the name nothing of it, is, except that it is a holiday. And unless the holidayism is of the highest it, those in going far and from that contain labor with comfort. Christians have understood all Sabbathcraft in advocating to overthrow "barriers," and to teach the week of rest is gone. The only way to restore a weekly rest is to lead men back to God, and a conscientious regard for his Sabbath. The "American Sab-

bath" can never command respect nor awaken conscience. The world waits for the God-ordained holy day. The choice lies between that and Sunday.—*God's Sabbath Outlook.*
