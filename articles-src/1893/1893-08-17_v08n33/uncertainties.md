# Uncertainties — v08n33 (1893-08-17)

## Associate Editors Names

The masthead lists "CALVIN D. BOLLREE" and "WILLIAM D. BURKE" as associate editors. These names are unusual and likely OCR errors or uncommon variants. The known associate editor for this period is C. P. Bollman; "CALVIN D. BOLLREE" may be an OCR misread of "C. P. BOLLMAN" or similar. However, since this is the OCR text and the original scan is the authoritative source, the names have been transcribed as they appear. This should be verified against the original PDF scan.

- **Location:** 00_masthead.md, associate editors line
- **Second pass completed:** Yes (reviewed OCR text carefully)
- **Transcribed as:** "CALVIN D. BOLLREE" and "WILLIAM D. BURKE"
- **Confidence:** LOW — these names do not match known editors for this period; likely OCR errors for "C. P. BOLLMAN" and possibly another name
- **Reason:** The OCR output shows these names clearly but they are inconsistent with known masthead data

## Article 01 — No Printed Title

The lead article by A. T. J. begins directly with "LAST week, from a number of considerations..." and has no printed title heading in the OCR. This is a continuation article in a series.

- **Transcribed as:** Title derived from content: "The Sabbath Question: The Sign of God or of the Papacy"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the title is editorially assigned, not printed; the article is clearly a continuation of a series on the Sabbath question

## Page 2 — OCR Rendering of Catholic Catechism Quote

Line 91 in the OCR reads: "The Utdhold of Church, instructed by Jesus Christ..." — "Utdhold" is clearly an OCR error for "The Church" (the word "Catholic" or "Church" preceded by "The"). The article itself (on the same page, in the comparative columns) correctly quotes the same passage as "The Church, instructed by Jesus Christ..." This was self-corrected.

- **Location:** Article 01, comparative columns section
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "The Church, instructed by Jesus Christ..."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the correct text appears elsewhere in the same article

## New Author: S. B. Whitney (Article 06)

The article "Blind Watchmen" is signed "S. B. WHITNEY" — this author is not in the known authors list.

- **Author initials used:** SBW
- **Note:** May be a contributor rather than staff member

## New Author: F. W. Howe (Article 07)

The article "The Lessons of Sunday Closing" is signed "F. W. HOWE" — this author is not in the known authors list.

- **Author initials used:** FWH
- **Note:** May be a contributor rather than staff member

## Page 7 — Book Advertisements

Page 7 contains several book advertisements ("Some Valuable Books for Young Men," "The Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation," "Christian Life Series," "Eagle Brand / Boston Roofing Co.," "The Medical Missionary," "Young Peoples' Library," "Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods"). These have been omitted as advertisements/publisher promotional material per instructions.

## Article 08 — Composite Reprint

"The Christian Oracle on Sunday Legislation" is a complex article: it reprints from the Christian Oracle, which itself includes commentary from the Evangel and Sabbath Outlook. The attribution has been set to "reprint" with original_publication "Christian Oracle" as that is the primary source. The embedded Evangel and Sabbath Outlook section ("Outside Its Sphere") is preserved within the article body.

## Page 8 — Subscription Table

The subscription price table on page 8 contains OCR-garbled data (columns merged, prices missing). This has been omitted as boilerplate subscription/publisher information per instructions.
