# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, August 17, 1893 (v08n33)

## General Note

These 300 DPI scans are of relatively poor quality black-and-white reproductions. The text is quite small and many passages, especially in the right columns and lower portions of pages, are difficult to read with confidence. Multiple articles have passages where the exact wording is uncertain. A higher-resolution scan or access to the original publication would be needed to verify many readings.

## Article 01 - The Sabbath Question (Pages 1-2)

### Page 1, Right Column, Bottom Half
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Issue:** The bottom half of the right column on page 1, starting from "Now, everybody knows..." through the end of the column, is very difficult to read. The text about "Vicar of Jesus Christ" and subsequent theological argument about the Papacy contains several passages where words are unclear.
- **Specific uncertainties:**
  - "he therefore is the substitute of Jesus Christ. While as a substitute, the therefore he poses as the antichrist" - the phrasing seems awkward; may be a misread
  - "this substitute, wall of necessity" - "wall" may be another word
  - "the only way of salvation" vs "the only true of salvation" - unclear
  - The passage beginning "Error on in a slight" - this transition seems garbled; the original likely reads differently

### Page 2, Left Column
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- The Q&A section from the "Abridgment of Christian Doctrine" is partially clear but some questions/answers may have slight word errors
- The table/comparison section between Lord's sign and Papacy's sign is formatted differently in the original and some cell contents are uncertain

## Article 02 - Sabbathlessness Gaining (Page 2)

### Page 2, Right Column, Lower Half
- **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM
- The passage from "the answer to this is not difficult" through the end contains several phrases that are hard to read
- "Christ's example is a most mischievous way" - this phrasing seems unusual; may be misread
- "has run against Shall until" - "Shall" may be a different word
- The closing exhortation "brethren!" appears clear

## Article 03 - Chicago Correspondence (Pages 2-4)

### Page 2-3, World's Fair Sunday Opening
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- Multiple long paragraphs with legal language that is difficult to parse at this resolution
- "Director Shandle of $50" - the name "Shandle" is uncertain

### Page 4, Right Column
- **Confidence:** LOW
- This article about Isaiah 56:10 and the Pittsburgh Sunday papers is very difficult to read
- The quoted passages from the Christian Statesman are partially illegible

## Article Boundary Uncertainties

- The exact boundaries between several articles on pages 4-6 are uncertain
- Content about Russian "Standists" appears in both the Blind Watchmen article (page 4) and Persecution Anticipated (page 6); it is unclear if these are the same article continued or separate pieces
- The "Protestant Drummond" heading on page 6 may be a subheading within another article rather than a standalone piece
- Some content on page 8 may belong to articles that started on earlier pages
