THE *Christian Statesman* still insists that Seventh-day Adventists are parties to the Clingman injunction suit. Well that is not strange since the Statesman never misses an opportunity to excite prejudice against Adventists, regardless of the facts. The Statesman is as unscrupulous as a Jesuit or a ward politician. Suppose that Mr. Mason—Clingman's attorney—had among his clients a single Adventist stockholder in the Fair, which however he has not, would the Statesman be justified in representing that "the Seventh-day Adventists" were parties to that suit? An honest man can give but one answer to the question.
