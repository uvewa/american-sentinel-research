MR. CRAFTS, he of the "new method of petitioning," by which men, women and children are counted again and again many times over as petitioners for his pet schemes, thinks that the reopening of the Fair on Sunday "is not to be feared, especially since Congress has been called for August." "It would," he says, "inflict swift punishment if any second 'contempt' were put upon its authority and the people's will." So he would have Congress not only override the Constitution by making an appropriation directly in the interests of a religious institution, but he would also have that body violate the charter of American liberty by passing an ex post facto law, that is a law imposing a penalty after the commission of the act. Moreover, he would have the legislative branch of the Government usurp the functions of the other two branches of the Government, namely, the judicial and the executive. There is nothing small about this gentleman except his ideas of other people's rights.
