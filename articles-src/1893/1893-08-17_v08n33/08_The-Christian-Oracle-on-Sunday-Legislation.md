[In its issue of June 29, the *Christian Oracle*, of Chicago, published by request a sermon by President Dungan, of Cotner University, the subject being the Sunday opening of the World's Fair. The Oracle takes issue with the sermon, and in its editorial columns comments on it in part, as follows:]

We question the correctness of the professor's assertion that the saloon men of this city are "yelling for the gates to be open on Sunday." They have been reported at different times on both sides. At the present time we believe that if the sense of the seven thousand saloon keepers of Chicago were taken it would be found that nine out of every ten would be in favor of Sunday closing. A saloon keeper near the central part of the city said to a friend of the writer, a brother who lives in Southwestern Iowa, that it was better for his business that the Fair should be closed on Sunday. This was said only a short time since, and after he had had an opportunity to test the matter both of Sunday closing and Sunday opening so far as the effect on his business is concerned.

"Has the Nation a right to interfere as the defender of Christianity?" says the professor.

To this we reply, If the Nation has a right to interfere as the defender of Christianity further than to protect each phase of it in the inalienable right to propagate its doctrines by moral means and without direct aid from the State, or to protect it from the unlawful encroachments of other religions, we would like to know which phase of Christianity it is to defend. One phase of Christianity in this country is Catholicism. "It," says the professor, "is in favor of Sunday opening because it is more agreeable to priest and people." Suppose the Government should conclude that the Catholic phase of Christianity in this country would best subserve its purposes as a Nation, it should then decree as "the defender of Christianity," Sunday opening. Or suppose that the Seventh-day Adventist phase of Christianity should become the object of the Government's special protection and favoritism, how would that kind of legislation suit, First-day Protestant Christians? Now we most emphatically deny the Government's right to legislate directly in favor of religious belief, thus discriminating against others. When the State does so she transcends her constitutional limits. If the union of Church and State is the true doctrine toward which we should work, then the views advocated in the sermon at this point are right, otherwise they are erroneous and dangerously so. Such doctrine may suit the Catholics, who are looking forward to the time in the near future when they will have control of this Nation, and then the Nation may interfere all too often as the defender of that kind of Christianity and to the sorrow and injury of Protestantism. The professor's position may do well enough for Spain or Portugal, but it will not do, just yet, for free and liberty-loving America.

If Congress passed the Sunday closing law on religious grounds, it transcended its constitutional prerogatives in so doing, or if it had enacted a law for Sunday opening, for the same reasons, it would have been equally in error. It would, in our judgment, have been far better for Congress not to have legislated at all concerning Sunday observance and thus have left the World's Fair managers and the people free to settle the question themselves. Let religion be free in this country from the entanglements of national and State legislation, except within the limits we have elsewhere pointed out, and Christianity, as it plants itself on primitive apostolic grounds of faith and practice, will be mighty through God in pulling down the strongholds of error and sin, and in making conquest of the world.

The deductions made by the professor are not pertinent. As an abstract question it may be true that "it is as much our right to ask that the law shall shut the gates of the Exposition on Sunday as that we should ask that the law shall require the saloons to be closed on Sunday." But it does not follow that it would be wise to do it. If it were right to patronize saloons during the working days of the week, which our brother will not claim, his argument would be relevant; otherwise it is not.

"In ordering the gates closed on Sunday the law does not force worship," says the professor. And as a parallel to the foregoing we may say, with equal truth, that the gates being open on Sunday does not "force" Sunday attendance. Those who really want to go to church on Sunday will go whether the Fair be opened or closed.

Again he says, "Whether men shall worship on that day, the law says nothing; it simply says that the masses shall not be tempted to leave their places of worship by the action of the Government." With equal pertinence we may say that the State legislates for the establishment of public parks in cities and elsewhere, thereby enabling the people to provide places where they may go at all times, and where they do go by thousands during the summer season. But in providing for such places of resort, according to the professor's reasoning, with no restrictions against Sunday visiting, at which time is the principal attendance, they are tempting the people to "leave their places of worship," and according to the argument are tempting them to sin, in that it is "a temptation to neglect the service that is pleasing to God." The public parks should therefore be fenced and the gates closed on the Lord's day. The argument proves too much and hence proves nothing, so far as the question under consideration is concerned.

Further, the service at the church is not "pleasing to God" except it be from the heart. Those who go to church from external pressure or the force of circumstances and whose hearts are elsewhere, are not pleasing God by such service, and would as well be, and perhaps better, some other place. And we may further say, in connection with the foregoing, that the greater "masses," the irreligious throngs, have no churches from which to be drawn away on Sunday. Will they be endangered by going to such a place as Jackson Park on Sunday? and will society be less secure by their going, if the gates are open and they choose to go?

"Some one says, It is better to have the Exposition gates open on that day than to have the crowds go to the beer gardens and to the saloons. . . . This is based on the idea that we must do one wrong in order to prevent another and worse wrong." Now the professor's reasoning in this paragraph is sound enough for those who admit his premises. But we deny that it is a sin, *per se*, to go to the Fair on Sunday any more than any other day except that in so doing some higher interest or duty may be neglected just as they may on other days. There may be those who are attracted to the Fair on other days than Sunday, when, in going, they are neglecting duties and obligations to others, and through such neglect are sinning.

**Outside Its Sphere.**

It is unquestionably true that the treatment which Sunday receives at the hands of many Christians is the primary source of its weakness. It is equally certain that Christians have destroyed conscience touching Sunday by their efforts to evade the claims of the Sabbath, "Saturday." In order to quiet conscience for disregarding God's Sabbath, they use arguments which are fatal to religious regard for any day.

Another reason for the growing disregard for Sunday is that people have learned more of the facts concerning it and its introduction into Christian history, all of which destroys faith in it, and conscience in regard to it. The situation is serious indeed, so far as Sunday is concerned. The masses care nothing for it, except as a holiday. And unless the holidayism is of the higher type, it injures society far more than constant labor would. Christians have undermined all Sabbathism in attempting to overthrow "Saturday," and hence the work of ruin goes on. The only hope is in such reaction as will drive men back to God, and a conscientious regard for his Sabbath. The "American Sabbath" can never command respect nor awaken conscience. The world waits for the God-ordained holy day. The choice lies between that and ruin.—*Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.*
