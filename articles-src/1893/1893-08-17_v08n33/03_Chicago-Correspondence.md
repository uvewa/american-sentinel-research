WORLD'S FAIR AGAIN OPEN ON SUNDAY.

THE injunction granted by Judge Stein in the Clingman case, restraining the World's Fair officials from collecting the fee from Jackson Park, has proved a worthless and perhaps worse than worthless instrument. The injunction which Judge Stein has not resulted in the least the determination of the Fair officials to have it in that case. On Sunday, July 23, the Fair was open to the public—free to all persons except those directly connected with the Exposition or serving on pay there. It was by order of the Board of Directors that the Fair was thrown open, in the order of the court. The authority of the State court was entirely ignored as being long since so far as came to the knowledge of the case on its public effect, secure the dissolution of the injunction or to learn the intention of the directors of the matter, or the views held by the judge to the one under the changed circumstances. Those considering the matter this would have only been courtesy, and quite a significant saving of time. No matter because the injunction had been directed to a merely preliminary and to a case not yet before the higher tribunal of the court. Nothing but a formal set of acts taken after due presentation of the matter could have nullified it. The parties against whom the injunction was granted were bound to observe it and respect it until it was modified or reversed. On the contrary, they ignored it entirely; there was no evidence shown that they used even so much as a reasonable line of resistance. It appeared, however, as the case developed, that they had reasoned that its existence, but had carelessly and unwarrantably acted upon the supposition that it was of no authority and that the court would permit its action to be ignored and treated with contempt.

This was a most remarkable thing for a court to pass. It was entirely without experience to do. It was entirely unheard of—unparalleled and yet with a reserve it bolts at the hands of Judge Stein.

In one instance the judge solved the enterprise problem about which so much paper may have been thrown in the different trials of the World's Fair case, as to the interposition and authority—interference of a public in the management of the World's Fair, namely, the directors. The penalty which he imposed upon five of them of $1,000 each and $100 of the assistant and Director Shandle of $50, or to direct evidence that the World's Fair Directors are the real agents of the government of the United States in the matter of the World's Columbian Exposition. They are not a great elementary institution under a direct management separate from the United States Government, but a practical business people under the direction and business management of a corporation established under the laws of the State of Illinois, and which is responsible for its acts to the State of Illinois and cannot with impunity override the decrees of a State Court.

This fact has been impressed by the act of the court upon those connected with the public mood effectively. In ordering the directors for their contempt of its authority, the judge very properly remarked that, even in ordinary cases, when the name or the circumstances in the situation were known to none but the immediate parties to the suit, it would be important that the breach is brought to the knowledge of the court; but in this case—a case in the eyes of the world—it was required. And the nature of the injunction was so public and so notorious as it possibly could be, more than this, it was by men of the highest standing and intelligence in the community, who all of them utterly and scrupulously obeyed the law and thereby set an example to the rest.

These facts which are undeniably true, make it not only proper but necessary that the court should act. In a civilized community and the world at large in a degree proportioned to its importance, the case that no more nominal penalty should be affixed. One of the reasons, the payment of the fines and notice of an appeal filed. It is not understood that the appeal can be tried before next November. In the mean time, so far as the present status of things is concerned, it appears that its obedience to the injunction—Jackson Park will have to be open to this public on all days of the week.

After all the vicissitudes through which this contest has gone, this is a remarkable state of the case. The Sunday closing question, yet so many and unexpected have been the developments in this exciting Sunday question as regards the World's Fair that it is useless to predict results from week to week what the outcome may be.

It will be interesting to see what views of this enforcement of law will be expressed by those who were so ready to demand that the Sunday opening factions should yield without objection to the decision of the United States Circuit Court by which the gates of the Fair were closed. At that time they were quick to demand in immediate submission and, it seemed to severely own those who sought to the exercise of common legal procedure to obtain a revision of the ruling of that court. But when that decision was overruled and set aside by the higher court—a court of last resort, they forgot their previous advice of submission so completely that they antagonized the decision of the higher court. In the case of the directory which had this cautiously put into practice the theory they had been taught by the Sunday closers, of the vaingloriousness and lack of authority of the decisions of courts, except as they were in accordance with their wishes and conditions, the judge who had here a practical responsibility, and, as the circumstances, was under the necessity of giving an unmistakable lesson of law authority of a decree of the court and the wisdom of obedience. In this whole matter the Sunday closers have convicted themselves of being at the bottom of the others, and those who unwittingly followed them into contempt of court and its decrees, will have received the necessary penalty.

Those who are most concerned in the victory are most unexpectedly and unintentionally the managers of the National Reform-Sabbath Union-Sunday closing party.

The views of the decision of the court in this matter expressed by the city press, are various and suggestive. The *Evening Post* upholds Judge Stein and says that it is not at all clear how he could have done otherwise than he did; the *Herald* characterizes it as "a joke, but a serious joke. The act of contempt was not malicious, and apparently not with deliberate intent. It was a good-natured, total disregard and defiance of the court's order; and no more. It might, but for the wide public in which the exposition, if they supposed anything, the directors probably supposed that it was a little thing they were looking some other way." Granting this to be so, would it not be, to persons of such prominence in business and financial circles, as well acquainted with the requirements of their position and of their standing, that only it personally but in public capacity, before the community and the world, so marked a case of contempt as could well be imagined. Certainly it would, and this apology thus intended to be made for the directors would really against them rather than for them.

The *Inter Ocean* makes a similar excuse for the directors and agrees mainly with the general opinion that Judge Stein might have been more considerate in inflicting very nominal fines upon those directors and subcontractors of the World's Fair who had ordered the gates to be closed to be applied of fair ruling in the Clingman case. The fines of $1,000 seems to savor of the arbitrary. The *Inter Ocean* suggests the remark that it is not the honor of Judge Stein, presumably, that is at stake, that there was a decree of the court which could not be permitted to be recklessly violated and contemned. The professional honor of the judge which was at stake, but the respect which the good citizens of the State should give due consideration to the decrees of the courts.

The *Chicago Times* entitles its editorial upon the subject "Violation of the Law," and says: "The court under the circumstances could do no less than was done.

It might say does more." And goes on to say that law is nothing unless it is obeyed against those decisions "we will not so far the familiar counsel that we could within its influences. It is nothing if it does not the implication its own mandates. It reaches the man of no means as well. If it is nothing, it governs certain classes by arrogation of prestige, or it is nothing only good deductions from the highest as well as the least court in the land, they are a potency against men of intelligence and distinction far greater than any situation started by the action of the Superior Court."
