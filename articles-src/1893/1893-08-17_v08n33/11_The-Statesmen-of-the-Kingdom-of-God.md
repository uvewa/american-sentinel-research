Those who are willing to labor without the stimulus of any visible reward; whose lives pass while the object for which they labor is too far distant to comfort them; who are willing to earn the misunderstanding of the crowd, and even oppose a seeming good because they see a darker evil lurking behind it, these are the statesmen of the kingdom of God.—Professor Drummond.
