PROSECUTION for "offences" sake never once belonged to the Church of God, as a whole, or to its individual members; but for the contrary a modest regard for the truth and its adherence has called forth ever a marked characteristic of the true followers of Christ. Persecution has been theirs from the time of the apostles to the present day, beginning with Stephen, Paul and. And be convinced of this, you who profess to follow Christ, that actions and taking a hand in the enforcement of its legalized persecution—in its States and Maryland, and before the legislatures against the Lord for discharging and objecting to obey God and their own consciences in the observance of the Sabbath—the only principled employments on the first day in their way, country, or State of Maryland. Tennessee and the State of Maryland. Tennessee civil proceedings on each side of the States Union, and the spirit and intent of Self preservation at this civil proceeding in every manner in this and every other State in the Union.

In giving the reasons why the Standists are persecuted in Russia, a correspondent of the *Missionary Review* says:—

"The worship of Icons and of painted pictures and the prayer of statues required at certain places, such as crossing a bridge, or gate of a Russian city, in front of any image in Russia; are an everyday hindrance to all Standists. This is one explanation why their churches closed to, and which are observed as an omen of their opposition to all the old power and pomp of the established Church. . .

"Those who are not of the same faith, having the same forms of worship as those who establish and maintain the same images in the empire. The Standist sits his face against all this, and therein lies his offence, not that he is turbulent, or in any way that they undoubtedly are, and somewhat too silent. Some of them have given offence; they have been disturbed and arrested and imprisoned."

How would Protestant America do this-conscious prosecution? The Standists in Russia, yet the time has come why they are persecuted, are an earnestness of that of our Seventh-day Baptists in the community (actually) disregard the Russian holy days; they, their time honored customs and religion, yet daring to confess their real motives, and preferring to something high and honorably, as their heads, martyrdom, are now arresting Christians and other devotees, and authorities more became more questionable. "The penalty must now be higher for Sabbath-keepers," would be a strange thing in history, for no persecution and to the error and injury of Protestantism. The subject will be more fully treated in a future issue of the SENTINEL. It must cover not only these States and Portugal, but it will not do, just yet, for constitutional prescriptions in its order, or if it had enacted a law for Sunday opening, for this same reason, it would have been equally in error. It would, in our judgment, have been far better for Congress and to have legislated at all concerning Sunday observance and thus have left the World's Fair question for the people free to settle the questions themselves. Let religion be free in this country to advance on its own merits, the State and State legislation, except within the limits of purely civil interests. So long as Christianity, as it plants itself on principle, will the mighty through God in pulling down the strongholds of error and his evil, in making the conquest of the world.

The deductions made by the professor are not pertinent. As an abstract conception it may be true that "it is as much our right that the law that the law itself shall not oppose the Exposition on Sunday as that we should ask that the law shall not require the saloons to be closed on Sunday." But it does not follow that it would be wise to do it. If it were right to pat the law to close the gates of the Fair during the week, which our brother will not claim, it would be wise to do it, when otherwise is not.

In the gates the gates closed on Sunday the law does not force worship." says the *Oracle*. And as a parallel to the foregoing we may say, with equal truth, that the gates being open on Sunday does not "force" Sunday attendance. Those who really want to go to church on Sunday will go whether the Fair be opened or not.

Again he says, "Whether men work or worship on that day the law says nothing; it simply says that the grounds shall not be troubled to leave their places of worship to go out that they may disturb or be disturbed in their worship."

With equal pertinence we may say that the State legislator for the establishment

of public parks in cities and elsewhere, thereby enabling the people to constantly places where they may be at all times, and where they do go by thousands during the summer season. But in providing for such places of resort, according to the professor's reasoning, with no restrictions against Sunday worship, at which time is the principal attendance, they are tempting the people to "leave their places of worship," and according to the argument are hindering them to sin, in that it is "a temptation to neglect the service that is pleasing to God." The public parks are temptations to the observance upon the correct the Lord's day. The argument applies equally in both cases, but it would not be wise to abolish public parks, so far as the question under consideration is concerned.

Further, the service at the church is that of "pleasing to God," except in from the heart. Those who go by church from attendance or the force of circumstances and whose hearts are elsewhere, are not pleasing God in any service, and would as well be, and perhaps better, some other place. And we may point out that no service, not in the law of any way, in connection with the foregoing. The united States, however, "the nation," the State, the county, municipality, or the individual, have no Christian force, here no direction from, to be drawn away on Sunday. Will they be enlightened by going to the Fair—to Jackson Park on Sunday or not? And if they choose to go to the parks where they are and they choose to go.

This is based on the idea that the Exposition gates open on that day than to any place of worship. Thus the argument and to the saloons.

This is based on the idea that we must not force one order to prevent another and worse wrong. Now the professor's reasoning in this paragraph is sound enough for prohibiting anybody in all its operations and mind that it is a sin, per se, to go to the Fair on Sunday, and it must be a sin every day except that it is doing some active interest or policy may be neglected just as well on one day of the week as another; and those who are attracted to the Fair on Sunday to the neglect of their services, they are neglecting duties and obligations entirely, even though much might be said about them.
