SAYS the prophet (Isa. 56:10), speaking of Israel, "His watchmen are blind." However we may regard the application of this language, seemingly there can be no more marked fulfillment of it, either in principle or in fact, than is to be seen in the case of some who assume to be spiritual guides at the present time. A forcible illustration of this occurs in the reflections upon the Sunday-school lesson based upon the experience of Paul and Silas at Philippi, in the *Christian Statesman*, of July 1. Starting out with the idea that "this lesson looks as though it had been selected especially for the times," it proceeds to institute a comparison between the apostles' persecutors and those who oppose Sunday laws. In this comparison there are some things so manifestly applicable to themselves that the only way we can account for their not seeing this fact, and consequently the falsity of their own positions, is the fact that their minds are blinded as to the true state of the case. Space will permit me to note only a few points in confirmation of this thought.

One of the Pittsburg Sunday papers is charged with counselling "mob law and murder" in opposition to the enforcement of Sunday laws, and the proprietors of such papers and the World's Fair Directory are arraigned in the following forcible style:—

> Such outrageous lying as has been done by the World's Fair Directory and "Sunday paper" proprietors to obscure the real issue, we have never heard in any other matter.

Strongly as these things are to be condemned, if true, the inquiry will arise, How far do they exceed in turpitude the fraudulent and law-defying methods of Sunday law leaders, or the spirit that will oppress the consciences of Christian citizens by enforcing Sunday laws, and even invoke military power in their support, as in the case of the World's Fair.

The following extracts, with a little mental paraphrasing, are still more to the point:—

> The pretended motive, patriotism, philanthropy and piety. These opposers are standing for their city, their time honored customs, their religion. They dare not confess their real motives. They must pretend to something high and honorable. The truth in the premises would hardly commend their efforts. They must therefore hide the real motives under some honorable pretense. The Philippians opposers of the gospel are still at work in Pittsburg and other places. It is the same corrupt old human nature still.
>
> Of course the magistrates have a hand in it. It would be a strange thing in history, to find an open opposition to the work of the gospel, without the civil magistrate taking a part. This seems to be the highest conception of duty, which a city official is capable of reaching. He feels that he is set for the defense of the evil deer, against the work of the gospel. It was so in Philippi. It is so in Christianized America to-day. And having the power they arrest the missionaries. Then they magnanimously, because these unprotected men are helplessly in their power, "lay many stripes upon them and cast them into prison."

In speaking of the earthquake which shook open the prison doors the following truthful words are used:—

> Here was where the enemies of the gospel made their mistake; they left the Lord Almighty out of their account. To the enemies of Paul and Silas it seemed enough to have the magistrate and the lash and the dungeon and stocks on their side, and it might have been sufficient if there had been no God. So it is still. The enemies of Christianity are leaving the Almighty out of their calculations. This may seem a small oversight for a little while, but it is certain to be disappointing in the end.

But the worst enemies of Christianity are among its pretended friends, and these like their Philippian predecessors, are standing for their time honored customs and religion, not daring to confess their real motives, but pretending to something high and honorable, and at their behest, magistrates, in the imitation of the Philippian persecutors, are now arresting Christian men and women and magnanimously laying heavy fines upon them, casting them into prison and confiscating their goods. They seem to think that it is enough to have the law and the magistrate, the jail and the chain-gang on their side, but like the Philippians, they are leaving the Almighty out of their account and are bound to be disappointed; for, in the closing words of the paragraph from which we last quoted. "God will rise up some day to avenge his name and honor institutions. Let us be confident of that. We do not know how long he may wait for men to repent and turn from their sins but he will come for the overthrow of wickedness and the vindication of righteousness by and by."
