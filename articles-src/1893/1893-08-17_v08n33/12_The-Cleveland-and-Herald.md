The *Cleveland* and *Herald* is now said to even have thousands of papers, but it is hard to believe that the following editorial note published by its editor in 1891, was not continued by himself. The legal warfare over the Sunday question in connection with the World's Fair is not ended. The main religion forces engaged have dropped out, but the Seventh-day Adventists, aided secretly, it may be by a few, are keeping up the agitation for Sunday opening of the rest of the week. It is from them to the fact that the material interests of the Columbian Exposition Commission are on the same side, with the people who looked only at the money side of the question that was without the aid of the section of the directors of the Fair, but the Adventists are not so many to yield a point. They propose to stick out but their own ideas of the true issue to the entire Christian day of rest and religious service, no matter what the result may be to the World's Fair or to the question of civil authority. It is such exhibitions of unreasonableness which make multitudes of men of women impatient of the disseminated and religious corporation service.

The Adventists have had absolutely nothing to do with the litigation having for its purpose the opening of the World's

Fair on Sunday. Adventists have insisted from the first that the Government had no right to require the closing of the Fair on Sunday, and they have likewise insisted all along that the directors were the proper persons to decide whether the Fair should be open or closed on that day. They have made no appeal to any court on the subject, nor will they do so. It would be a good thing if the secular press would give the public a little less misinformation. We believe it was one of our great humorists who said he would rather not know so much as to know so many things that were not true. People who rely implicitly on the newspapers for information are sure to have a good deal of the latter kind of "education."
