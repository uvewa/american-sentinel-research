WE have received from the publishers, 28 Lafayette Place, this city, No. 33 of the "Truth Seeker Library," the same being "Pen Pictures of the World's Fair," by Samuel P. Putnam. Mr. Putnam is a pleasant gentleman, and an excellent writer, and we cannot speak too highly of his "Pen Pictures," except in one particular, namely, the hostility to Christianity which he plainly exhibits several times in this otherwise exceedingly meritorious pamphlet. "Pen Pictures" is well illustrated, is written in Mr. Putnam's happiest descriptive style, and notwithstanding the objectionable feature which we have mentioned, is well worth the price asked for it (25 cents). It would not be a bad hand book for expectant visitors, who have sufficient stamina not to be influenced by what Mr. Putnam does not know about Christianity.
