Now that the Sunday closing question has been definitely settled—at least, it is a settled yet—all parties to the controversy ought to be satisfied. The advocates of Sunday opening of the World's Fair have secured, a legal recognition of their contention that the local directory could rightfully open the Exposition all the days in the week if it chose. At the same time, it has chosen to take such action as should open the Fair on Sunday without the mandate of the Sunday closers. Both sides have won; and both sides have lost.

But Sunday closing is an accomplished fact; for it became before, though their purpose is concerned, their Sunday patronage of the Fair was not sufficiently large to pay to run the interest expressed.

But there is need now to review the situation and discover its lessons, for a few questions are appropriate. Is the Sunday closing of the Fair "a great moral victory" as the advocates claim? It would hardly seem so in the face of the fact that the most practical reason on effectually closing it is that it is unprofitable. Nor is the fact it was satisfactory a matter for more than this. It was purely a forced Sunday opening of not say other the was charged full price the privilege of seeing half the exhibit closes or covered by their canvasses.

For Sunday closing to be proved "a great moral victory," it must be shown that Sunday opening was a demoralizing; that is by no means conceded in Sunday closing. It is an immoral thing to view the wonders and achievements in the art, science, and mechanics of any age and period, simply because the day happens to be Sunday? If it is replied, been, how can the thing that day and to see the same sights on Monday? It is replied, been, how can the act be moral and worthy, this question is immediately shifted from the fact of morality to religion; and at this point we are discussing only the morality or immorality of the act of viewing and inspecting the contents of an open Fair. Granted that civil government may rightfully upon consideration of immorality, so called, in distinction from religion, there is no showing that such consideration entered into the settlement of the question of Sunday closing.

But it may be urged that the employment of sixteen thousand men in running beer parlors on the grounds for Sunday was certainly an immoral proceeding deserving suppression. Admittedly it was; but no more, and no more on Sunday than any other day; and no more criminal than on any day in the week. The people who wanted to drink beer or some stronger beverages would easily go and find it as easily outside the gate, and without paying the admission fee. It has been thoroughly demonstrated to the wonder of Chicago that Sunday closing of the Fair did not prevent this and other causation of kinds of immorality. So Sunday closing is certainly not "a great moral victory."

But if not a moral victory, in set form, they did gain a great religious victory. And herein begins the lessons that may well be heeded by every one who holds that religion should at least include not only civil government, ascendancy for religious principles. It is the principle of every victory of religious—religion in itself must or whether it covers success—for her over civil authority. Every success in religion has this evil: in itself not merely that it is a religion in politics but the boatmen of sects, the administration of civil law, much less when that institution takes the form of a colonial herbe. Christianity should crimson with the shame of persecution to think of the pure religion of Jesus as such an artificial thing.

But there are a few more questions that are pertinent. Who wanted the Fair closed on Sundays? A practically a large proportion of the membership of nearly every Protestant church and religions organization in the land, showing unmistakable symptoms that it was their intention. Added to these were the Chicago saloon-keepers, who made no secret of their options. Their interest is easily concealed. The churches went at the matter strangely but plainly (!) wanted the Fair closed on principle, to obey a "higher Book of law," which constrains the observance of the yearly of orthodox Jews. And Senator Hawley wanted the Sunday closing premises to grow so that he and other politicians could "come back here." In Congress. Altogether the combination that prevailed for Sunday closing before Congress the national legislation was not one to inspire confidence in civil government legislation. And so again it is not making character when we recognize that their purpose is a great victory more favorably to be looked at by any persons.

It is it not to be denied that Sunday had generally good causes million invites in support of this extreme measure.

On the other hand, who wanted Sunday opening? Undoubtedly many but men as well as good ones. Doubtless the intention to salvation an open. It was not largely of that of making as much money as possible, and the confused, reason for Sunday closing not yet. Yet to the eternal satisfaction and number of those who demanded an open Fair it stands to its and the benefit of all: if there is reason to applaud Sunday closing, there is equal and greater reasons to applaud Sunday opening. We the writer but recently heard an ardent, and, sincere, intelligent advocate of Sunday closing, declare that "Nobody wanted the Fair open on Sunday but Seventh-day Adventists and thugs." Well, it must be said that issues are many between the two

like their Philippine predecessors, are standing for their time honored customs and religion, yet daring to confess their real motives, and preferring to something high and honorably, at their heads, martyrdom, the imitation of the Philistine predecessors, are now arresting Christian and devotees and magistrates levying heavy fines upon them, casting them into prison and confiscating their goods. They seem to think that it is enough to have the law and the magistrate on their side, and the people outside, but, like the Philippians, they are apt to develop before and through, on the other side, to be found to be disrespectable; for, in the closing words of the lesson portion, which we last quoted, "God will rise up to some day to avenge his saint and honor institutions. Let us be confident of that. We do not know how long he may wait for us to repent and turn from their sins but he will come for his vengeance" in this respect.
