Persecution for opinion's sake never belonged to the Church of God, as a whole, or in its individual membership. On the contrary a tender regard for the conscientious scruples of other men, was ever a marked characteristic of the true Church, of every genuine disciple of Jesus from the time of the apostles to the present day. Read the epistles of St. Paul and be convinced of this, you who by your attitude, or by your words and actions are taking a hand in the religious persecution going on in Tennessee and Maryland, and being waged against those few faithful Christians who to obey God and their own consciences rest on the seventh day, and follow their peaceful employments on the first day of the week, contrary to the resurrected Blue Law code of Maryland, Tennessee and other States, but not contrary to, but in exact harmony with both the letter and spirit and intent of our Federal Constitution, which is or ought to be supreme in this and every other State in the Union.
