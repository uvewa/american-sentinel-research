TORONTO has no Sunday street car service, and a good many people who do not want to remain at home all day, but who have no other means of conveyance, not owning carriages, and not being able to hire them, are demanding that the various transportations companies be permitted to accommodate the people on Sunday as on other days. We condense from the Toronto World of July 28, some account of a meeting held the previous day in the interests of this movement.

Among those present at the meeting were a number of ladies, including Miss Joussaye, President of the Working Women's Protective Association; Miss Hepburn, Vice-President of the Trades and Labor Council. Dr. Larratt Smith presided. He thanked the meeting for making him chairman. He had lived in Toronto many years—from the time when it contained only four churches and was a strip along the water front, until now it had a frontage of ten miles and three miles deep. The time had certainly come when our citizens should be able to get around on Sundays as well as week days. [Cheers.] He had his own horses and carriage, and his man-servants and maid-servants, and could get to church by employing these; but he would prefer to allow them to rest and to go by the cars. But while he had these advantages there were many others who had not—[hear, hear]—and was he going to deny to others what was the poor man's horse and carriage—the electric car? No! [Hear, hear.] "What I have—the means of getting about—others want, and I shall let them have it." [Hear, hear.]

## SYMPATHIEERS WITH THE MOVEMENT.

The president read a number of letters from sympathizers with the movement unable to be present.

C. J. Campbell, Assistant Receiver-General, wrote:—

> I am leaving town to-day at 4 o'clock, otherwise I would certainly have been present in support of a movement that has my warmest sympathy. I am ready to assist in any way I can to secure the running of street cars on Sunday.

Mr. Joseph Jackes, of Jackes & Jackes, barristers, writes:—

> I am quite in accord with the Sunday car movement, and hope it will be successful. I consider the car service quite as necessary as the gas or water service, or the delivery of milk.
>
> It seems to me that the opposition to the Sunday car service comes from a class that pay no taxes and contribute nothing to the expenses of the city, and yet enjoy all its advantages.

## AN ASSOCIATION ORGANIZED.

Dr. John McConnell moved, and J. B. Leroy seconded, this resolution:—

> That this meeting of citizens declares in favor of a Sunday car service for the city of Toronto, and hereby organizes for the promotion of the election on August 26 next, under the name of "The Sunday Car Association," and invites the co-operation of all citizens favorable thereto.

In moving his resolution, which was carried amidst cheers, Dr. McConnell congratulated the association in securing for presiding officer a man who, during his entire lifetime, had been identified with good works. [Cheers.] This spoke volumes for the success of the Sunday car movement. A case which had come under his notice a few days ago afforded him a lamentable opportunity of proving what a benefit Sunday cars would be to the poor. A citizen, resident at the extreme west end of the city, received word that a friend was seriously ill in the hospital. He went to a livery and was told that it would cost him $2.50 to drive to his destination. This was more than he could afford to pay and he was perforce compelled to walk the entire nine miles, and this was only one of numerous cases which might be cited. Those who prophesied all sorts of evil from the running of the cars, did not know whereof they spoke. He lived in the vicinity of Hyde Park, and knew that the working classes who came there were orderly and well behaved. It was an insult to people, and especially to workingmen, to say that because they couldn't afford to hire a carriage and spent ten or fifteen cents going to Hyde Park by cars they were bound to come home drunk. [Applause.] Bishop Sweatman's testimony with regard to the behavior of people at the Island on Sunday was a sufficient answer to the charges of desecration of the day.

Miss Joussay, President of the Working Women's Protective Association, stated that the working women needed the cars as much as the men or more. If the men found it difficult to pay for a carriage, it was doubly impossible for the women to afford it at their lesser wages. The talk of beer gardens following in the wake of Sunday cars was simply untrue. It was an insult for one class of people to think they were better than others.

Miss Hepburn, Vice-President of the Trades and Labor Council, agreed with Miss Joussay. Many women worked from 7 in the morning until 6.30 at night all the week through, and at present there was no means of transit for them to get out into the parks on Sunday. She was satisfied there was no person who considers the question from the position of labor or of working women but must be in favor of the cars.

After other short speeches the meeting adjourned. The committee will meet early next week, and be ready to report to the public meeting a few days later.

But while there is a strong sentiment in Toronto in favor of Sunday cars, there is also much opposition from the churches. The same evening that meeting referred to was held, the Sunday people got together and condemned the movement in strong terms. After an organization was effected, Mr. S. C. Biggs was introduced and started out with the assertion that the running of street cars on Sunday is "contrary to the will of God." He contended that the Sunday street car could not help the poor, for they were already too low down to make use of them. He claimed that at least twenty-five per cent. of the city of Toronto received charity during this last year.

F. S. Spence urged his friends to start out at once and hire up all the conveyances they could for the 20th of August the day the election is to be held, for he felt sure that if they did not that their opponents would not leave them a single rig to take their voters to the polls. He also saw Toronto, after the fated 20th of August, plunged in all the horrors of the worst features of the American Sabbath, with the additions of the wickedness of gay Paris, the bull fights of Spain and the despotism of Russia.

The Toronto World says, editorially, in advocating Sunday cars, it is fighting a battle on behalf of three-fifths of the citizens of Toronto. It seems that the remarkable objection has been raised that Sunday cars would increase Sunday drunkenness. To this the World says:—

> What we say is, that there is no connection between Sunday cars and Sunday drinking. We want British Sunday cars and the Ontario liquor law as it now is enforced. And the best of all proof that there is no connection between the two is that they have cars on Sunday in Philadelphia, Boston, Albany and other cities and no sale of liquor; that they have Sunday cars in England and a limited sale of liquor, and cars in Rochester and a free sale of liquor. All going to show that there is no relation between the two.
>
> There was a time when Denver was the wildest city on this continent; street cars came on Sunday and now it is eminently respectable. But we do not see any connection between these two, though we have more reason to infer it in the one case than in the other.

The World also makes short work of the claim that Sunday cars would increase the hours of labor. On this point the World argues, "there has been for many years back, and there is at the present time, an agitation for securing fewer hours' work per day all over England. The workingmen of that country are apparently able to look after themselves. But in their efforts to better their position do we find them demanding the cessation of Sunday cars? The antis in Toronto pretend to believe that Sunday cars here will make a slave of the workingman, but still, in England, where they have these cars in every city, the workingman has as yet made no move to destroy this slave-maker. The workingmen over there are acting more rationally. They are petitioning and insisting on the government to make eight hours the legal work day. And their persistent action in this direction is already bringing forth good results. Manchester, as we know, is a great labour centre, and they have Sunday street cars there too. In spite of the existence of these Sunday cars we find that in February last the proprietors of the Salford Iron Works decided on reducing their workmen's hours of labor from 53 to 48 per week without reducing the wages."

The World certainly has the argument on this score, as well as on several others. The contest will be watched from this side the line with interest.
