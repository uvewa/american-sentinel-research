Every one has to Broadway street car service, and a good many people did not want it, the extra cars to running on Broadway, but have no other means of conveyance, and pay carriage, and adding a help to all their views, then, are demanding that the various transportation companies be permitted to accommodate the people on Sunday as they do on "pay" for the gates of the Toronto World of July 7, some account will be given of this by the matter of interest at this movement.

Amongst those present and the meeting, all the leading labor leaders. Mr. Joinseph, President of the Working Men's Council, presided. Miss Jennie Jones, Vice-President of the Trades and Labor Congress, also addressed the meeting. He thanked the meeting for the opportunity to take up this matter. He had lived in Manchester, the read itself in many years—from the time when it commenced only on the Sundays, and we cannot deny the truth of it, we have also along the water front, until only it was only a frontage of a few miles and about seven miles. One thing had certainly come to pass, to them it was sufficient in their case. Amongst them they were most devout around on Sundays as well as any of the others. They attended their religious service, and his mere-other and mail-carriage, and could get along without a single street car or anything of the kind, to allow them to rest and to go for its own the two and a half miles so as to be present at the meeting to hear what was being said. There were many others who had not—over. As the chairman mentioned, this could and what was the poor man's holiday of his own. But they had not got far further into it: "What I have—the Sabbath rest of the world—that is what I hold, and all is mine. Let it remain." Let all its items have. Let it have; the injunction as it has it to be, let the city let it have now, all this.

The president read the following resolution. That as a committee of one be instructed:

C. O. Clemish, Assistant Receiver General, wrote,—

> I regret that on account of a 4 o'clock, observance I would certainly have been present to the meeting. I sympathize heartily with the movement for the running of street cars on Sunday.

Mr. Joseph Jacobs, of Jacobs & Jacobs, barristers, writes,—

AN ORGANIZATION ORGANIZED.

John McConnell, and R. L. B. Lowry secured, this resolution:—

> *Resolved*, That we petition the Council to submit a by-law to the citizens to establish a Sunday car service for the city of Toronto, and that such by-law be voted upon by the citizens on August 26 next, under the name of "Toronto Railway Company Street Railway Service."

In moving his resolution, which struck the meeting with favor, Mr. McConnell, who has been a successful in securing the active lifetime, has been identified with good works. The church and the only thing for the success of the Sunday car movement. A man who had considered his notices a few days ago afforded him a handsome opportunity of proving what a benefit Sunday cars would be to the poor. A citizen residing at the extreme east end of the city, received word that a friend was seriously ill in Brockton. He went to a livery and was told that it would cost him $2.50 to drive to his destination. This was more than he could afford to pay so he was compelled to have paid to walk the entire nine miles, and he found when he got there that many all sorts of evil from the running of the cars come rather from the want of them. He lived in the vicinity of Hyde Park, and saw the faces of those workers who came there more orderly and well behaved. It was no insult to people, and secondly, workingpeople, to say that because they couldn't afford to hire a carriage and spent 50 or 65 cents each getting to Hyde Park they were going to come drunk. (Applause.) Bishop Sweatman's teachings with regard to the capacity of the people at the Islands on Sunday was a sufficient answer to those of the clergy who maintained objections.

Miss Joinseph, President of the Working Men's Protective Association, said that the working women needed the cars as much as the men or more of them. She found it difficult to pay for a carriage, it was almost impossible for the women to afford it at their lower wages. The talk of beer gardens following in the wake of Sunday cars was simply untrue. It was an insult to our class of people to think they were better than others.

Mrs Halpence, Vice-President of the Trades and Labor Council, agreed with the foregoing sentiments. "I know for a fact," it is the morning work of this town. A good many of them are working men. It is the morning work, and it present at these working men they have to go and walk out into the park on Sunday. She was entirely in favor of the measure whether viewed from the position of labor or of working women but must be in favor of the care.

The other short speeches the meeting adjourned. The committee will meet early next week, and to ready to report to the public meeting a few days later.

But while there is a strong sentiment in Toronto in favor of Sunday cars, there is also much opposition. Reports were that the same evening that meeting referred to was held, the Sunday people go to gather and consider the question. It was a strong force. After an organization was effected, Mr. S. C. Biggs was introduced

and started out with the assertion that the running of street cars on Sunday is "contrary to the will of God." He contended that the Sunday street car could not help the poor, for they were already too few down to make use of them. He claimed that at least twenty-five per cent. of the city of Toronto received charity during the winter.

F. S. Spence urged his friends to start an active canvas of the voters so that they anew they could for the 6th of August which the proposed law should be cast. He felt sure that if they did not that their opponents would beat them in a simple struggle to take their voters to the polls. He also wrote Toronto, after the fund 18th of August, plunged in all the horrors of the worst features of the American Sabbath, with the addition of the wickedness of gay Paris too. He told the full of Spain and the desolation of Russia.

The *Toronto World* says, editorially, in advocating Sunday cars, it is fighting a battle on behalf of three-fifths of the of the more Toronto. It must be added that no remarkable objection has been raised that Sunday cars give intemperate Monday working. To this the *World* says:—

> There is no necessary connection between beer cars and Sunday cars. The test of all positions in the case is a test of precedent as it is now in existence. And the test of all pool other places in its accordance is found in the condition of places which have a Sunday car service—London, Buffalo, Rochester, Detroit, Albany and other cities and no side of any community in which a Sunday car service produces any increase of drunkenness and a few sites of liquor. All giving it going. But do they produce it? The *World* is not a beer organ.

> There was a time when Denver was the wildest city in the United States, but even Denver in its wildest days had Sunday cars. We could not see any connection between these two, though; we may have seen it before it is the case, and it may be after it.

The *World* also makes short work of the claim that Sunday cars would increase the hours of labor. On this point the *World* argues, there has been a reduction of hours, and there is at the present time an agitation for further reduction. Eight hours' work per day all over England, Scotland, France, and Belgium, all of whom apparently able to look after themselves. But in offers to better their position, do we find them demanding the cessation of Sunday cars? The anti-Toronto pretend to believe that Sunday cars here will make a slave of the workingman. How is it in England, where they have these things in every city, the workingmen have as yet made no move to destroy this slave. The working-men over there are securing more rationality. They are petitioning and insisting on the government to give them eight hours per day and no more and at full wages and proper treatment. And their persistent action in this direction has been surprisingly successful in Manchester, as we know, is a great labor center, and there is at the present time three too. In spite of the existence of Sunday cars we find so far, in February last the proportion of the Sheffield Iron Works decided on reducing their workmen's hours of labor from 60 to 48 per week without any decrease of wages.

The *World* certainly has the argument on this score, as well as on several others. The contest will be watched from this side the line with interest.

It is reported from Rome, that the German Government has intimated to the Vatican that the German Emperor and government would have no objection to a law providing for the return of the Jesuits to Germany.
