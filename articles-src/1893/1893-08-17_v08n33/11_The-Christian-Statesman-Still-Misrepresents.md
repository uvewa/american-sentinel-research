"ATT. the great daily newspapers of the city give our special notice," says the *Christian Statesman* of *Works.* The statement is quite long, but will the *Mail and Express* take kindly to it? If that paper goes to Sunday siding and is it not therefore one of the signers?

The *Christian Statesman* Robinson still notes that Seventh-day Adventists are parties to the Clingman injunction against the Fair to no demand upon the Sabbath. Since the gates were open the Salvation misses an opportunity to excite prejudice against Adventists, regardless of the facts. The *Statesman* is as inscrutable as a man—a want politician. Suppose that Mr. Mason—Clingman's attorney—had among them those acting as a stockbroker and holder in the Fair, which however he has not, would the *Statesman* be justified in representing that "the Seventh-day Adventist parties to that suit? If so an honest man can no less can be to his own.
