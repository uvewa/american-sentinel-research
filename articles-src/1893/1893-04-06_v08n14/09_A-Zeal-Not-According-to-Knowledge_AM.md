Men are often led to do that which seems to them right, but in the sight of God is wrong, and contrary to the Golden Rule. Especially is this the case with those who are zealous for a certain religious dogma. We learn that Paul was very zealous for the law of Moses, and when the Christian Church came into existence, he did all in his power to persecute those who composed it. The church at Jerusalem was scattered far and wide through his persecution. In this he thought he was doing God service. But was he? "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Paul treated others far different from what he would wish to be treated himself. But his zeal blinded him in this respect; he could not see the wrong he was doing others. He evidently believed in doing evil that good might come. Did good come out of it? No, but there came a time when he was stopped in his mad career, by the hand of Him who is always so ready to convince men of their error, especially those who know that they are going contrary to the Word of God.

As Paul was going on a journey to persecute some of those who believed and acted contrary to his religious views, he was stopped by a voice which said to him: "Saul, Saul, why persecutez thou me?" Paul then realized the wrong he had been doing both to God and to his fellow-men. It was God who had spoken to him, and convinced him that he was doing wrong; that he was interfering with that right which He had given to all men—the right to worship him according to the dictates of conscience.

But this persecution was not the worst thing that was to come to the Church. Some time after, she ceased to follow God and the Golden Rule, and so, of course, lost that power which He alone could give her—the power of the gospel of Christ. She mingled with the heathen around her, and finding that she had lost that power which gave her life and strength, she joined herself to the State, and sought aid from the civil power. The only aid that could be had from that power was the same as it gives to-day—religious laws to compel men to worship as the Church dictates.

What was the result of these religious laws? Persecution for conscience' sake. They who would not do as those wicked laws said, were punished, or rather persecuted, and so that free moral right to worship God as conscience dictated was taken away. The Church fell farther and farther away from Him who had established her, until her garments were dyed with the blood of those who would not follow her wicked ways. Religious laws can never convince men of sin. There is no power in them to keep from sin. The gospel of Christ—"Christ and him crucified"—is the only thing that can give men the power to overcome sin.

But those who are asking for religious laws can not see this. Their zeal blinds them so that they can see no other power than the State. They find that it is useless to call upon God for power, for he does not hear them so long as they are going contrary to what he has taught. We have many instances in God's Word showing that it is wrong for the Church to join hands with the State; and also instances showing that it is wrong to obey a law interfering with the rights of conscience. What is the Church doing today? Or I might ask, What has she done? Has she not joined hands with the State in this country? She has, and is seeking laws to compel men to observe a religious dogma—laws compelling men to keep Sunday as the Sabbath, which is contrary to the command of God.

The fourth commandment says, "the seventh day is the Sabbath;" the State says, "the first day of the week is the Sabbath." This will bring persecutions, for there will be those who will not obey this command of the State. Why? Because it is in direct opposition to the command of God. It is also in direct opposition to the Golden Rule and the spirit of Christ. Those who are asking for these laws would not like to be compelled by civil law to keep Saturday as the Sabbath. They would be the first to rebel against such a law, but when seventh-day observers rebel against Sunday laws they are astounded. There is no more justice in a Sunday law than there would be in a Saturday law. Sunday laws are evil, therefore they can make men no better.

Many to-day who are clamoring for religious laws are not like Paul. When he was convinced of his error he turned to the Lord. But the religious zealots of today, when convinced still cry, "More laws! More laws!" But why more laws? Because they find, as did those in the fourth century, that they have lost the power of God, because they are not teaching the gospel of Christ. They must have power, and so they appeal to the State.

Would Christians seek religious laws to convince men of sin? No, they would use the means which Christ has given them—his gospel. He did not persecute; if they would be Christlike, they will not. They who are Christlike will be persecuted, they who are unlike Christ will persecute, for our Saviour said: "If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you."

It is only when professed followers of Christ have become selfish and fallen from Him that they ask for religious laws, and so persecute those they see are still loyal to God and to his law.
