The Tennessee Exemption Clause.

The *Nashville Banner* publishes a letter from Senator Blodgett, of Tennessee, in answer, in substance, to the contentions of the SENTINEL against the Sunday law, which the senator has interpreted. It is therefore somewhat personal. After quoting the bill,—which has been here reprinted in the SENTINEL, Senator Blodgett says:—

It is neither fair while the bill is intended to protect certain classes of Christians in their peculiar "religious observance" but not to interfere with the peace, quiet, or religious rights of those who have been in the habit of observing another day as the Sabbath, or who worship on Sunday. And that while it will give to these classes the right to observe the seventh day and exempts them from the general operation of its provisions, it can do no harm, or wrong to any class or sect, nor infringe on the rights of conscience, nor make anything compulsory. If so, then with what liberty loving Christian person can object to an arrangement which while protecting all classes under the constitution, in placing all sects or classes of Christian people on an equal footing, leaves each one to his own form of worship?

It should be remembered that the Sabbath, or the Lord's day, is by authority of the fourth commandment God himself set a day of rest, upon finishing his work of creation. This is recognized by all Christian peoples, and all well known fact that, in accordance with the acknowledged will of his Creator—whatever the religious practice of a nation—must always be a day of rest, the days were originated through God's creation of the world, and that the observance of the sabbath days set apart for rest and worship and that labor is for future generations. Therefore it can not be a just grievance to anybody to have a just groundwork upon which to base their religious belief, and there is not a law in existence but what must rest for its existence and enforcement in carrying out the teachings of the Bible and the will or the law.

As in the case of this matter, whatever the Senators religious views may be, whether Baptist or Adventist, and are very well stated from that standpoint, and are very real, but as there are others who can not conscientiously agree with his conclusions, and who entertain equally and even more positive convictions as regards a matter that they themselves, and not the Senator, have a right to decide, his argument on this particular point is conclusive.

No senator has no right to doubt their being as loyal citizens as himself,—and that they certainly would be just as great a sin as it would be for the State of Tennessee to prosecute and punish those citizens for following their convictions and observing a day of rest. It may be said by some that the Sunday resting was already established and in existence in this Government before any such scruples in regard to the matter, but probably not before the existence of those who have religious scruples and convictions about observing it.

It is therefore clear that the Supreme Court decision and the Sunday closing act of Congress were not only contrary to the laws of the State, upsetting an authority that did not and could not of right legislate on the subject at all. Not only by those of these are not the means of another, but they were unacknowledged as well, being contrary to all actual piety and to all true Christianity. Those who were clamoring the Christian thing, and the whole course is destructive of the best interests of the Masonic Lodge.—*Pythias.*

It is therefore true that the Supreme Court Session and the Sunday closing act of Congress were not only contrary to the laws of the State, upsetting an authority that did not and could not of right legislate on the subject at all. It may be said by some of those who are so much opposed to this law that has been enacted, not to apply to regulations, certain to newspaper establishments and some avoidable avocations with impunity, regardless of the Sunday act, but, where good people, good Christians, and good citizens, have been prosecuted by and other persecutions for simply observing the Sabbath of the Bible, and who in conscience believe that in so doing they are following the only standard in accordance with the will of God? Will some one be kind enough and fair enough to consider this testimony for it, or to hear enough to answer this question?

It may be seen by reference to the third section of its definition of rights, our State constitution, with which to the section I confine, entirely forbidding the levying of any tax, or appropriations, upon any class or sect of people in regards their religious belief.

Upon the whole, I see no good reason why any intelligent, conscientious citizen, who respects and seeks after the truth, whatever his religious persuasion or creed minority, be deprived of such rights. It is a proper protection, and by no means an infringement, and if the whole body of citizens will only give to other citizens like consideration with the principles of our free Government and the principles of Christianity, there is no danger. And the Legislature, and all legislatures, simply because they have the power to do it.

This bill is so kindly in its intent, and conceived by motives so worthy, that it is an altogether inadequate task to point out its true mistakes the recountenance of the situation, and fails to cover the absurdity of the act. But that has already been done in two instances in previous issues of the SENTINEL.

The advocacy of the bill by the honorable senator, as just given, shows how his actual premises are so secured against the helpless from the persecution of those who interest themselves behind an unjust law. The sympathy for those who are suffering wrong, and the desire to prevent further injustice, is so unmistakably revealed and the sincerity of the motives of the friends of right and justice is so obviously revealed at all the means proposed to reach the desired end—of insuring perfect justice to all individuals, or sects or denominations. The enemies should be stripped of all external interests and influence, and considered solely as a principle. First, that it must be shown that there can be no proper enforcement of a Sunday law that does not protect certain classes of Christians in their religious rights. The legislation as it now is and in earnest should protect all men in their natural rights irrespective of whether they are Christians or not Christians. In the nature of things it is impossible for civil government to legislate upon the religion or lack of religion of the citizen and his religious belief remains in God. If the State takes upon itself to legislate about what is "regularly and judicial cognizance it must discriminate in its favor of a certain class of religion, and must discriminate against certain citizens who hold their religion in some form different from that which the State legislated.

Under these circumstances I can not see upon what principle men who have a single religious object to see that only carries out the determination to protect all classes of all sects or classes of Christian people on an equal footing, leaving each to his own form of worship.

In this there are, unfortunately, three errors: first, not all those in the State who love liberty will desire liberty for all races, not all in a Christian's share; second, it is not the intent and purpose of the constitutional provision in question to place all sects and classes of Christians on an equal footing, but to place all citizens on an equal civil basis without reference to their religious opinions; third, this law does not place all sects and classes on an equal religious footing, for it does not require that the observance of Sunday shall at once be their very duty to do it, or to right to carry on their occupations on days when they are not resting from religious motives, this "peace and quiet" of others upon the Sunday. There is no Sabbath, so that it might be said that indirectly there is a fourth consideration in which this exemption is inadmissible from the point of view of equal justice to all. That is this: in the benefit of this exemption act each one must give an account of his faith in an excuse proclaimed after arrest. That the Tennessee law in its present form which made it possible for every first-day keeper to rest and worship on both the seventh day and only need explain the infringement of his rest and worship of Sunday. The constitutional provisions, I say for the first day of the week. If the act is correct, it is equal also that they cannot enforce upon all parties. None can be constituted a religious expert to pass upon the faith and justify upon all. It is not a subject upon which any court can examine; to ask what legislators or courts have a right to introduce. The only purpose and the end result of the law is to which this exemption clause.
