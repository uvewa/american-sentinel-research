THE Florida Recorder published at Orlando, Fla., contains, in its issue of March 21, an account of the assault upon Eld. L. H. Crisler, the Seventh-day Adventist minister, at Grand Island, in that State, on March 18. It seems that the attack was made upon Mr. Crisler in the village post-office in the presence of six or eight men. The man who attacked him was under the influence of liquor at the time but showed by his language that he was acting under the instigation of others. It was a case of aggravated assault. Mr. Crisler's assailant first ordered him, with many oaths and curses and threats of the use of the shotgun, to leave the place; then when Mr. Crisler turned away to get his mail at the post-office window he was felled by a blow on the head with a hammer and kicked while down.

In response to his appeal for help one of those present disarmed his assailant. With the blood spurting from the wound made in his head by the blow from the hammer Mr. Crisler started away but was followed and knocked down by a second blow, his assailant was then drawn away by the crowd that had watched the attack.

The injury done to Mr. Crisler, though serious, does not prove to be dangerous; this his many friends throughout the country, to whom his personal qualities have endeared him, will be pleased to learn. The following personal paragraph is from the account of the affair in the Florida Recorder:—

> Mr. Crisler is an elder of the Christian denomination which teaches that Saturday is the Sabbath. He is a very bright, intelligent man, full of enthusiasm for his work and an earnest convincing speaker. He is well known in this city where he has made his head-quarters for several years with his wife and family, most estimable people.

The attack was the outcome of this White Cap notice previously given Mr. Crisler:

> We the organized White Caps, of Grand Island, hereby notify the Rev. Mr. Crisler to leave this place by next Monday morning or stand the consequences which shall surely follow. Take heed lest ye be caught!

From the persecution in Tennessee under cover of the law to this White Cap outrage in Florida is but one step. Is this to be the development of the Christianity of this Christian Nation?
