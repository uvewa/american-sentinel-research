THE sanctity of that New Jersey camp-meeting village by the sea, Ocean Grove, is gradually encroaching on its worldly watering place neighbor, Asbury Park. The Common Council of Asbury Park, in consideration of the claim that the selling of Sunday newspapers in Asbury Park disturbs the Ocean Grove camp-meeting, some fifteen hundred or two thousand feet away, has decreed that no newspapers shall be sold on Sunday within one block of the bridges connecting the worldly village from its sanctified neighbor. Ocean Grove will yet have to put a Sunday embargo upon all within its limits, shut its gates and raise its drawbridges, to protect its denizens from the contamination of Sunday desecration.
