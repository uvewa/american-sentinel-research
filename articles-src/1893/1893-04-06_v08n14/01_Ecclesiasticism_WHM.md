Ecclesiasticism is the human substitute for the divine government of the Church. The history of ecclesiasticism is the history of heresies and schisms, of persecutions and inferences, of the rack and the stake. It is a tale of the development, of blood, of fire, and the sword. It is a story of the substituted frenzy of human diabolism on the one side, and the patient suffering of the direct agonists of which the human frame and mind are capable, on the other.

Paganism is the epitome of earthly and infernal evil as expressed through religion. But for the religious worship, which has fed itself on human lives here that it may feast on eternal death hereafter. Paganism is all. It is false throughout. It is the work of the devil, from first to last. There is in it no modicum of truth; for all its falsehood is but the drapery in which it is clad to hide its truth, fed, and his subjects are himself made blind.

How then do paganism and ecclesiasticism differ? If it is true that everything shall bear fruit of its kind and that we may know them by their fruits, and the products of the one are the very products of the other, differing only in the degree of development, then that both are from the same source, the fruits of the same spirit.

Envying and strife, war and slaughter, the desire to conquer and to kill, and to be conquered and his promotion as a booty of the victor,—these are not the fruits of righteousness; for the fruit of righteousness is "peace," "sown in peace of them that make peace." That which cometh by oracle deed is not the wisdom from above, for that is peaceable, gentle, and full of mercy, long suffering and kind. But that wisdom which is not from above is earthly and devilish. Of all these crimes against man and sins against God paganism is guilty; and so has been, and so is to-day, ecclesiasticism; by the same spirit and of the same name and by the order of ecclesiasticism.

In paganism Satan rules without an intermediary; in ecclesiasticism he rules by that human agency which he has found so traitorous to its kind and to God as to accept his delegated authority and undertake to be second in that dominion by which it is the intention to be first. Either case, then, the ruler is the same, and that being so, the government must be similar; the regulations of allegiance, the oaths of office can not be different. They are not different; they are the same. They only vary as the method and degree of an evolution which in social life, political institution, and that variation is truly true of either form of satanic government.

The rule of Satan in the pagan world is supreme, his subjects render him a hopeless, and in hopeless and unquestioning obedience. It is his aim to seek abolition everywhere, but he is always a usurper and hence it is that ecclesiasticism is never content until it has enthroned itself in its despotism. All forms of ecclesiasticism are from the same source, and they all have the same purpose, and they all and must ripen into one common type, which, whether the name of Christian be retained or not, will be the same antichrist. He who has staked an eternity and the third place in heaven upon his effort to win eternal supremacy will brook no rival and great or equal, and no other, will rule his own.

It is the ultimate philosophy of every truth that all things resolve themselves into either one good or evil, that there is in the last event no other content than between Ormuzd and Ahriman, the forces of right and wrong. This is a legitimate deduction. Then is also divine authority for it, for He Himself has said that they who are not for him are against him. If this be true, as the human mind has acknowledged from all time, it is inevitable that the discrimination must be made. Each factor in the fight must be for him: What say ye of Christ, whom say ye that he is? By this and by their fruits must all be proved that that which is good may be hold fast.

As the ultimate event there can be but the two principles, good and evil, so there are but the two supreme representatives of these antagonisms; and those two beings are God and Satan. From the beginning the fiat has gone forth, "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve." "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve." The emissary of the chieftain of every supreme human crisis that now exist in these last days must be found for himself so many evil devices, and Satan, having developed all his supernatural subtleties, is coming down with all deceivableness such as compel every man of every character to themselves. It behooves every man, then to ask, What is truth? What is righteousness, What is peace? For God is the God of peace, and Satan is the god of war. Where is equal justice to all men without respect to person or character? For God is no respecter of person; but Satan is the god of every sect and of every faction. What does the conduct of Jesus Christ come to in the flesh, for the salvation of souls? For they are sons of God, but that deny that Jesus came in the spirit of antichrist. Where are they that have been the communicants of the faith of Jesus? For at that last day they shall stand on the right side of the great Judge, the good on the right, and the Lamb; but as for the ungodly and the wicked let God shall then do?

There is but one name by which men may be saved. It is not the name of any sect or denomination. It is not by protesting against the errors committed under cover of another sect, while preserving the same errors of one's self in history, while neglecting to pick the beam from their own eyes. It is not by declaring boldly against the errors of others, while failing themselves to walk with humility and meekness in the steps of the Master. If this is so, as it is, where will they be who are striving earnest among for the mastery? Who are contending to control as another, not giving a righteous example by two to preach the word, to warn the world, to heal the sick, and bring the gospel to them that hunger for God as a message of joy to the world. Where?
