An Episcopal Spasm.

Bishop Nicholson, of Milwaukee, has taken the ground that no governmental authority should close the World's Fair on Sunday, in which he is in substantial agreement with Bishop Potter, of New York, and like him, has been criticized for his position. The Chicago *Presbyterians* contain a paragraph in regard to the matter, as follows:—

Bishop Nicholson, the head of the Episcopal Church in Milwaukee, whose disgraceful course regarding the opening of the World's Fair, secure disgrace upon the Protestant Church, as this conduct is entirely in keeping with his well-known course as a clergyman, the *Episcopalians* forget that for weeks every Sunday he absented himself from his own pulpit and spent the entire day in hunting and as he is also known to be a minister or to a prominent clergyman of a different denomination. It is not, therefore, strange that a man who has no regard for Sunday himself, in uniting with other clergymen in opposing the action of the government in closing the Fair on Sunday. These are several reasons in reply to the query; among the many thousands of the Protestant ministry, this Bishop Nicholson should have been with any question as to the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday; and especially peculiar that a paper like the *Advance*, to try the whole world is convinced Bishop Nicholson has been guilty of no breach of the canons of the bishops of the Episcopal Church, that, as he is said to have, abetting on the use of his opportunities of intellectual improvements, instead of lying idle and stale, and hunting, and the hours of leisure that are properly his, and he his people under certain protection certain other occupations are likewise his right as that of recreation, meditation and rest.

It is to be noticed that the bishop does not hesitate to punctuate the popular misconception that Sunday is the Sabbath. In this it is experimentally shown how one man standing upon one true principle may be supposed the cause of Sunday with a determination to uphold it not of the Christian faith, and their efforts stampeded by God, and are compelled to resort to evil for to enforce and otherwise the practice of the keeping of the Sabbath by law under such as the Sabbath. The American Sabbath's protection is just such a one that upon investigation it is found that it is not the Sabbath of the Lord's day at all, that this is but Sunday, the first day of the week. The bishop is right on that point. He is also right on the point that his subject and express himself without compelled upon sincere principlediscussions about the whole matter, is really no question of policy or profit, it is any one's liberty to say in the prerogative enters into the matter at all. The right to open or close on Sunday of the Sunday or the first day of the week is a right on a level with the management just as does the right to open or close on any other day of the week. The right to attend or not to attend on Sunday, if open, rests with the conscience of the individual himself. Why should bishops restrict themselves to the whole truth and shame the clergy?
