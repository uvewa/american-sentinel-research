THE Oregonian says: "It is useless to continue, as many clergymen do, the protest against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, for the great body of the people want it open on Sunday, and it will be opened on that day." We have no objection, but see no grounds for the opinion. The probabilities are strongly the other way. Too many of those who wanted the Fair open on Sunday, or who, at least, did not want it closed by act of Congress, pooh-poohed the idea that Congress could be induced to legislate concerning a religious institution; and not until it was too late did they awake to the real issue. A year ago their protests might have been heard and heeded, but now the case is different; the law is upon the statute books and Congress is not in session, and so could not repeal it if it would.
