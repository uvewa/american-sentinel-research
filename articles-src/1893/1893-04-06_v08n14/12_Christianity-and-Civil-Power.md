Which He had given to all men—the right to worship him according to the dictates of their conscience, without molestation. But this persecution was not the worst thing that was to come to his Church. Some time after, she ceased to follow God and the Golden Rule, and so, of course, all that power which He alone could give her—the power of the gospel of Christ. She mingled with the kingdoms around her, and falling also she had lost that power which gave her life and strength, she joined herself to the State, and sought aid from the civil power. The evil and this evil could be had from that power was the same as it gives to-day—religious laws to oppress man to worship at the Church instead.

What was the result of these religious laws? Persecution for conscience' sake. The inquisition,—"heretics," as they were called, were punished, or rather persecuted, and those who from honest inquiry put God as convenience dictated was taken away. The Church fell farther and farther away from Him who had established her, until her garments were dyed with the blood of those who would not follow her man made laws. But force can never convince one of sin. There is no power to convert but by the only power of the gospel of Christ—"Christ and him crucified" is the only message to tell fallen man that the power of God.

But those who are asking for religious legislation in this country are as blind to see so that they can see no other power to compel men to do right but that of force, or laws to call upon God for power, for an obedience rendered through fear of punishment is going contrary to what he has taught. The persecution of all those Christians who show that it is wrong for the Church to join hands with the State, is another instances showing that it is wrong to obey force wherever they can use their conscience. What is the Church doing today? Has she not joined hands with the State in this country? Has she not asked of laws to compel a degree compliance from all men with the wishes of her membership, contrary to the command of God.

"If the blind leaders, say "the Sabbath is the Sabbath!" the State will say, "the first day of the week is the Sabbath." This will bring persecution, for there will be those who will not obey this command of the State. Why? Because it is in direct opposition to the command of God. It is also in direct opposition to the Golden Rule and the spirit of Christ. Those who are asking for these laws would not like to be compelled by a law to observe the Sabbath themselves. They would be the first to rebel against anything of this sort. Then who are those who as rebel against Sunday laws they are not compelled thereby? If we must keep Sunday then there would be in a Sabbath. Sunday laws are well, however they may make men no better.

Many to-day who are clamoring for religious laws are not like Paul. When he was persecuting the followers of the law in the Lord. But the religious zealots of today, who continue still cry "More laws! More laws!" But why more laws? Because they fail, as did those in the fourth century, that they have lost the power of God, because they are not where God can trust them with it. They have power, and so they appeal to the Christians most seek religious laws because of the power of it. No, they fail to see the messes which Christ has given them, in his growth. He did not say if they would not obey us, let us compel—if they would to Crucifixion, they will not. They who are Christians will be persecuted, they who are unlike Christ will persecute, for God our Saviour said, "If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you."

It is only when professed followers of Christ have become apostates and fallen from Him that they ask for religious laws, and to persecute those they say are not willing of God and to his law.
