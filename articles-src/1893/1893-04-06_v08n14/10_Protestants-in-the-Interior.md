PROTESTANTS IN THE INTERIOR.

The Protestants in the Interior of Russia, thousands, and hundreds of thousands, incessantly, of colonists, are divided into two classes, those using the German, the other in Southwestern Russia, and those in the cities of Russia. They use chiefly the German language. In Siberia the settlers, however, many Protestants scattered throughout the country are all in the land of Siberia. On the Volga there are about 250 Protestant congregations with 200 pastors. Among the German colonists every three steps into a paradise. In the Caucasus there are about 130 small congregations, and Protestant congregations in Petropolsk, in 54 cities and 250 large towns, outside the cities in the Baltic regions also. In all the Interior Protestant congregations the leading faith is the Methodist faith. The great bulk of them subsist upon the laboring, the assessment from 7 to 5 per cent only. The majority of the Protestant communities, particularly in the Crimea and in Siberia, have greatly prospered. The stundists frequently have returning from their Orthodox neighbors, and the interior is flourishing.—*Prof. Geo. H. Schodde, in N. Y. Independent.*
