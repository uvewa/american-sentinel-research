GERMAN LUTHERANS.

The three Baltic Provinces of Kurland, Esthland and Livonia have, since 1823, constituted a solid phalanx of Lutheranism in the Russian empire. They formerly only two hundred thousand now are estimated; but these constitute the wealthy, the educated and leading classes. The ministry, almost to a man, have received their training at Dorpat University and they remain in touch and tone with the theological methods of religious life and thought in the Fatherland. The traditional rights of the Protestant and its churches are to be preserved by all the rulers that have managed their destinies, have been broken only by Nicholas I and Alexander III. Under the rule of Nicholas I these Protestants enjoyed greater religious liberty than they did under the Kings of Sweden. Especially were Catherine I. and Alexander II. favorable to the cause of religious liberty, and the bulk of the congregations and members have all along been on good terms with their pastors and the nobility. Movements have from time to time been made to make a serious break between pastor and people, have failed. Several were abolished there nearly two generations before This was done in the rest of the empire. This was accomplished in 1848, and twenty years later peasants were allowed to buy property. The material and educational advancement of the population is greater than that of any other citizens in the empire. The University of Dorpat ranks with any in Germany. The social position, governing of the professions in the community is of the best kind, and the general control of the Higher Consistory and the synods is excellent. The total of the congregations is 316, with 143 pastors. The number of church edifices is something over 316; thus the church sittings are about 1,175. The Baltic Protestants are very wealthy in church property, and fairly in the present prosecution of believers.
