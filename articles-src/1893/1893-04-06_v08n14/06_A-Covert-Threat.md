A Covert Threat.

As the time approaches for the opening of the World's Fair those who have so vigorously enforced the closing of the gates on Sunday with so much success, have begun to speak with still greater stridency those who in their fear, that, after all, the best efforts will be in vain, and that the Fair remain open seven days in the week, after the manner of the exhibit which has been had. Is the "Pearl of Days" so dim and shadowy that it will vanish with the opening of the gates?

In the interests of the Chicago Exposition was to make the Fair a success, the sooner this miserable Sunday closing business is settled the better, and the opinion of the editorial department of the American Sabbath Union is watching every attempt the Sunday closing continue submitted to the legislatures. The management of the exposition may or may not be friendly to the Sunday closing, but it should in the case that by any secret evasion of the law of its acts, or by any opposition to the Sunday closing, the people of America have had in a national protest, the moral effect of which will be felt in every nook and corner of the land. We ask that there will be no occasion for the fear, and there is no threat, or any of the rest.

This is a covert threat. It is as much as to say, "Open the gates on Sunday and the American Sabbath Union will see to it that the Fair is a failure." The earnest, solemn, utterance of this kind, and its bold, Appeal to the courts may still give opportunity for the opening of the gates of the Exhibition on Sunday, for the opinion of the right of Congress to close them is more than questionable.

It really makes no appreciable difference whether the World's Fair is open or closed on Sunday. The principle of the right of the people to the control Government, in religious matters has been already acted upon by Congress. This decree is now a precedent in legislation which can never be overcome if the actual obedience of the World's Fair to that be no a matter of compliance from a small moment. Disobedience to the decree would not rehabilitate the Government. There is now positively no remedy. Liberty has been stabbed at the foot of her own altar, and all the oceans of the world not wash away the blood-guiltiness from the hands of this Government. But it may be of interest that the Fair should remain open on Sunday as a matter of curiosity just to see what these threats of the American Sabbath Union are worth, how many would stay away, what measures they would take to injure the Fair, and how far they would succeed; but the advantage or non-exercise of an individual circumstance is really of very little importance when the principle of civil justice and religious equality has been subverted, and the United States made subject in this form a course which can result in nothing but religious tyranny.
