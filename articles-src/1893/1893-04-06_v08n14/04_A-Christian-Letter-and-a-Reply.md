A Christian Letter and a Reply.

The *Chicago Mail*, Feb. 7, 1893, published a Christian letter criticizing the Sunday laws, which is a fair representation of the most advanced religious thinking upon a large class of liberties which had been suppressed; to which the *Mail*, which is steadily fighting it by an earnest advocacy of all men's rights, replies. It is not in the power of the world's history to talk about Sunday as the Sabbath of the fourth commandment and get away with it. Any one who has investigated the case know that it is not.
