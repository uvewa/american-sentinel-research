A RECENT cable despatch to the World gives the interesting bit of information that "New-fashioned Sunday people, with ideas of their own on short sermons, have to thank the young German Emperor for siding with them. He has taken a strong personal interest in the management of Church affairs, and by an imperial announcement has decided how long sermons should last. Of late ministers have been preaching only about fifteen minutes, but the Emperor declared that even this was too long, and ordered that at the inauguration of Nazareth Church, which was made a solemn ceremonial event, the sermon should not last more than six minutes. So hereafter six-minute sermons will be the rule."

Is there not in this a valuable hint for the United States? Now that Congress has entered upon a career of religious legislation, and interested itself in religious matters to the extent of championing the Sunday cause, might it not with equal propriety prescribe the length of sermons in this country? Certainly it would not be difficult to find a "civil" basis for something of this kind, or at least to discover somewhere in the colonial charters precedent for it. Surely the length of sermons might be limited as a sanitary measure or police regulation. Sitting too long in church might possibly be shown to cause spinal disease, while sleeping in public as one is apt to do under a long sermon is indelicate, and so subversive of good morals. Clearly the German Emperor has done only his duty to his people, and Congress ought not to long hesitate to follow his example. Now that the United States has undertaken to ape the Church and State countries of the Old World in the regulation of religious matters let there be no hanging back or shirking,—Congress should do its duty fearlessly, and let no preacher guilty of long sermons escape.
