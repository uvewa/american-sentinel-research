W. A. Colcord, who has just been conducting an institute for instruction upon the relation of civil government to religion in Denver, Colo., with an attendance of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty students, will, during the first weeks in April, give similar instruction at Boulder.

The question of Sunday labor has again been brought into prominence in Toronto, Canada, by the decision of a magistrate there, in the case of the delivery of milk by a driver, employed by a livery, etc., driving through the streets on Sunday. It would seem that in Toronto, who do not own their carriages must walk.

Col. Elliot F. Shepard, President of the American Sabbath Union, and editor of the *Mail and Express*, died at his home, in this city, on the afternoon of February, 24. His funeral was entirely peaceful, resulting from the administration of other preparatory to performing the ceremony.

The Florida Legislature published at Atlanta, Fla., continues in the lessen of March 1, an account of the assault upon Mr. L. H. Cruiser, the Seventh-day Adventist minister, at Grand Island, in that State, on March 15. It seems that the attack was made upon Mr. Cruiser in the village post-office in the presence of six or eight men. The man who attacked him did so under the influence of liquor at the time but showed by his language that he was a vent under the cognizance of the villagers. It was a case of aggravated assault. Mr. Cruiser's assailant first ordered him, with many oaths and curses and threats of the use of the shotgun, to leave the place; then when Mr. Cruiser turned away to get his mail at the post-office window he was felled by a blow on the head with a hammer and kicked while down.

In response to his appeal for help none of those present dispatched his assailant. With the blood spurting from the wound made in his head by the blow from the hammer Mr. Cruiser staid away but was followed and knocked down by a second blow, his assailant was then drawn away by the crowd that had watched the attack.

The injury done to Mr. Cruiser, though serious, does not prove to be dangerous; this his many friends throughout the country, to whom his personal qualities have endeared him, will be pleased to learn. The following personal paragraph is from the news of the affair as given by the *Recorder*:—

Mr. Cruiser is an elder of the Christian denomination which teaches that Saturday is the Sabbath. He has a wife and an absent our minister, and is known for his work and an earnest one working hard for his sect which he represents. He has made his land quarter for several years with the people among whom he lives and works. The attack was the outcome of this White Cap motive previously given Mr. Cruiser.

The organizer, whose clear, if broad, manner the reader may have noticed, would hardly note the *Rec.* Cruiser to have this place for next Sunday morning and at some time of the services which shall easily follow. Take bad lost from the proceedings to Tennessee under cover of the law to this White Cap outrage in Florida is but one step. Is there not in the development of the Christianity of the Christian Nation?

A recent cable dispatch to the World gives the interesting bit of information that "New-fashioned Sunday preachers, who, instead of relying upon the attraction and merits of their own or short sermons, have to think to the young, the means for Evangel of the masses, are making many converts in this country." He has also a strong personal interest in the management of the Christian Church, and by an impartial decision must have that he has decided how long sermons should last; if the law ministers have been preaching about fifteen minutes longer than his Emperor had directed. Thereupon his Imperial Majesty said: that the sermons was too long, and ordered that at the suggestion of the famous Nazareth Church, which was to make a solemn ceremonial event, the sermons should not last more than six minutes. So hereafter strictures are ministers will be the rule.

Is there not in this a valuable hint for the United States? Now that every State has entered upon a course of religious legislation, and interested itself in religious matters to the extent of championship of the Sunday cause, might it not with equal propriety prescribe the length of sermons in this country? Certainly it would not be difficult to find a "civil" basis for a restriction of this kind, or at least to discover somewhere in the colonial charters precedent for it. Surely the length of sermons might be limited as a sanitary measure of police regulation. Sitting too long in church might possibly be shown to cause spinal disease, while sleeping in public seems in apt to do so under a long sermon is indecorate, and so subversion of good morals, all of which any ruler and an Emperor has done only his duty to his people, and Congress ought not to his hesitate to follow his example fought.

The Oregonian says: "It is useless to continue, as many clergymen do, the arguments for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, for the great body of the people would it open on the other hand, and it will be opened on that. We have it in no objection, but see no grounds for the other way. The politicians are strongly the other way. Too many of those who at least, did not want it closed by act of Congress, but pooled the idea that the votes could be induced to legislate in favor of setting a religious institution; and not a little too late, too did they see and know the real issue. A year ago their protests seemed to the nation that evil was in the facts the cause was at the same time for a session, and so could not repeal it in the same session."

We have received many inquiry relative to how to obtain a report of the hearing by the House Committee on the Chicago Exposition, held in Washington, last January. The report is free—at least it costs its office for "the Captivity of the Republic," published by the National Library. This pamphlet of no less than 10 pages and will give you not only a complete account of the hearing but a great more that is of interest relative to Sunday laws by Congress of the United States, and put up to it. In contains much matter which is found published nowhere else.

The sanctity of that New Jersey camp-meeting village by the name of Ocean Grove is gradually encroaching on its worldly watering place neighbor, Asbury Park. The Common Council of Asbury Park, in consideration of the claim that the selling of soda water on Sundays in Asbury Park disturbs the Ocean Grove camp-meeting, have solemnly agreed and passed an ordinance, that its sale has decreed that no newspaper boy may cry his papers on Sunday. With none of the bridges connecting the worldly village from its sanctified neighbor. Ocean Grove still yet have to get a plank walk-way apart and within its limits, with bars, gates and rules in its characteristic fashion that its denizens from the contamination of the outer world.

That the United States has undertaken to ape the Church and State countries of the Old World in the regulation of religious matters let there be no longer question for shirking. Congress should do itself fearlessly, and let no preacher guilty of long sermons escape.
