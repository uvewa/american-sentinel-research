# Uncertainties — v08n14 (1893-04-06)

## Article 01: "Ecclesiasticism and Paganism" (WHM)

- **Issue:** The article begins with "ENVEING and strife" (page 1, second column). "ENVEING" appears to be an OCR error or scan artifact for "ENVYING." Transcribed as "ENVEING" (preserving as-is per fidelity rules).
- **Confidence:** LOW — context strongly suggests "ENVYING" but the OCR reads "ENVEING." Flagged for review against original scan.

## Article 16: "Death of Col. Elliott F. Shepard"

- **Issue:** The text reads "resulting from the administration of other preparatory to performing the operation of lithotomy." The word "other" appears to be an OCR error for a drug or anesthetic name (e.g., "ether"). The original likely read "ether" (a common anesthetic of the period).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — contextually "ether" is near-certain, but the OCR clearly reads "other."
- **Transcribed as:** "other" (preserving OCR text as-is per accuracy rules; likely "ether" in original)
- **Confidence:** LOW — recommend verification against original scan.

## Page 8 Header

- **Issue:** The running header on page 8 reads "Vol. 8, No. 11" rather than "No. 14." This appears to be a printing error in the original issue, not an OCR artifact. Not transcribed.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — OCR clearly shows "No. 11" but all other issue identifiers confirm this is v08n14.

## Article Attribution: Alfred Mallett / Alfred Mallet

- **Issue:** The author of article 09 signs as "ALFRED MALLETT." The known authors list includes "Alfred Mallet(?)" as an uncertain variant. The OCR here clearly reads "MALLETT" (two t's).
- **Transcribed as:** "Alfred Mallett"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — consistent with known variant; the extra 't' may reflect original spelling.

## Article 07: Source attribution

- **Issue:** The article "A Lawyer Gives His Impressions of the Tennessee Adventists" is introduced with a bracketed editorial note identifying the source as an interview with James T. Ringgold published in the Baltimore Sun. The article body text begins with "THREE Seventh-day Adventists" (capitalized, likely original formatting).
- **Transcribed as:** reprint from Baltimore Sun with the bracketed introduction preserved.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

## Page 7 items — "Rome Rule for America"

- **Issue:** The dateline "Belfast, Ireland." follows the author signature "FRANCIS HOPE." This is a location, not a second author. Transcribed as part of the article body following the author signature.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

## Skipped items (not transcribed as articles)

- Subscriber notice ("ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it...") — boilerplate publisher information.
- Request for clippings with full information — editorial housekeeping notice.
- How to obtain "The Captivity of the Republic" — advertisement/order information.
- Advertisements (Battle Creek Sanitarium, Smith's Dictionary, Civil Government and Religion pamphlet, Scientific American, etc.) — pages 7-8 advertisements.
- Fisherman's outfit advertisement and news clipping labels (OCR artifacts from image recognition) — not article content.
