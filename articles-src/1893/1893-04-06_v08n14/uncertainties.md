# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, April 6, 1893 (v08n14)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from 300 DPI PNG scans of the original pages. The print quality varies across pages, with some areas being notably difficult to read due to the small typeface used in the American Sentinel and the quality of the available scans.

## Page 1 — "Ecclesiasticism" (WHM)

- **Location:** Column 1, paragraph 1
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Transcribed as:** "persecutions and inferences"
  - **Confidence:** LOW — the word "inferences" may be "infamies" or another word; the type is small and slightly blurred

  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Transcribed as:** "hopeless, and in hopeless and unquestioning obedience"

## Page 4 — "A Lawyer Gives His Impressions of the Fair"

## Overall Assessment

This issue presented significant challenges due to:
1. Very small typeface throughout
2. Some ink bleed and inconsistent print quality
3. Dense columns with minimal spacing
4. Several articles with complex argumentation requiring careful parsing

Many passages have been transcribed with best-effort readings where the text was not entirely clear. The overall structure and content of all articles has been captured, but individual words and phrases throughout may benefit from verification against a higher-resolution scan.
