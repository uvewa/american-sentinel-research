THE Chicago Mail, for Feb. 7, 1893, publishes an anonymous letter touching Sunday laws, which is a fair representative of a large class of literature which goes forth to aid Sunday observance, but which is steadily injuring it by an unavoidable reaction. It is too late in the world's history to talk about Sunday as the Sabbath of the Bible. Men who have investigated the case know that it is not. Here is the letter:—

### A TENNESSEE YAWP.

The following anonymous letter was received yesterday with the Tennessee postmark on the envelope:—

The reasons assigned for opening the Columbian Fair on the Lord's day are:—

1. For the benefit of the workingman.
2. In the interests of education.
3. To prevent the patronage of saloons.

But the real reasons are:—

1. It will make business for the railways.
2. It will make business for the saloons.
3. It will increase the sale of Sunday newspapers.
4. Tickets of admission can be sold and money made on all days of the week.

This is what the Lord has to say about it. It is old, but still valid, and has the sound of One who speaks with authority: "Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."

### ONE WHO LOVES THE AMERICAN SABBATH.

Our esteemed correspondent hails from Tennessee, where, we understand, they put men who observe the Sabbath on the Sabbath day, in jail for plowing on Sunday. When "one who loves the American Sabbath" will point out that portion of the Scripture which authorizes the observance of the first day of the week as a Sabbath, and will give a reason, any reason, for calling it "American," instead of Swiss or Huguenot or Puritan or Scotch, we will be glad to shake hands with him on a common basis of enlightenment.

Then if he will explain the immorality that lies concealed in the carrying of passengers for pay by the railroads, or in the purchase of a Sunday newspaper, or how business will be increased for the saloons when the people are in Jackson Park, where there are no grog shops, instead of loafing about the town where there are thousands; or where the evil is behind charging for tickets of admission, we will believe that this man who sends anonymous communications is possessed of some instead of lacking in knowledge of the traditions of these United States, which have never known intolerance in matters of religion without scotching it.

The heading chosen by the Mail as quoted above is not elegant, but it is expressive. "Yawp," as a synonym for "yelp," indicates a "boast," or a "cry of fear." Anonymous writers for newspapers usually combine both these elements. They are likely to be braggart cowards, posing as brave reformers. We quote the above to show how reactionary and destructive are the false claims which the advocates of Sunday make in its behalf. Any man who quotes the fourth commandment as authority for Sunday or talks about "Nehemiah's Sunday law," poses under false colors. The friends of Sunday show either ignorance or wilful misrepresentation; with most of them, we think, it is ignorance. They have accepted traditional notions as biblical truths, and so continue to "wrest the Scriptures," and handle the word of God deceitfully. This is an affront to truth and ultimate suicide for the cause of Sunday.
