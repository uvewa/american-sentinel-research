The Seventh-day Baptist General Conference, which met at its General Conference last August, adopted the following paragraph as a statement of the positions the society holds in this matter, namely:—

The Seventh-day Baptist General Conference gives as a statement of its positions the following paragraph which was introduced and passed at its General Conference last August. The conference is composed of about 10,000 members. It has forty-five delegates and several hundred churches. Its membership is composed of 10,000 members, seventy-one pupils in its college, seven academies, and the attendance of fifty pupils; and as a matter of fact is in substantial and practical harmony on most points with the principles of the AMERICAN SENTINEL and also its basis on the Sabbath question. Being Sabbatarians, the Seventh-day Baptists are divinely appointed and only Sabbath, is at the same time advocates of the rights of all Sabbaths of civil institutions and all civil or legislative requirements regarding Sunday. They thus combine Sabbath observance and has combined against legislating. Now the Seventh-day Baptist Conference adopted resolutions upon this subject:—

*Resolved*, That we reaffirm our long-standing position upon the principles of religious freedom and the entire separation of Church and State; and urging in prayer "in the name of religious liberty and the non-interference of Congress, directly or indirectly, in religious affairs." The General Conference also adopted resolves declaring that for such work the denomination through its denominational societies, and urging them of the need of a wider work of the denominations, deprecating the unwise and injurious legislation upon the subject, and recommending as the only remedy for the correcting of the "apostasy from the Sabbath" its culture, in its duties of a reconstruction of the and propagation and education, both by precept and example, to exercise a careful discrimination between the right and the wrong, not only in Sabbath observance, but also in all matters of thought and action. A committee has been appointed to present addresses on this seventh-day doctrine of the Sabbath to the general motto of other denominations.
