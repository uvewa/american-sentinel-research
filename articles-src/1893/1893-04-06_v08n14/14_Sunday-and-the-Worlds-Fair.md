Sunday and the World's Fair.

Sunday openers are pulling along three ways just now, hoping that some one of their schemes will come to something. It is held that of opening the Fair seven days a week.

(1). It is proposed to bring suit against the Government for interfering with State rights.

(2). It is said that the management has $600,000 of the two and one-half million dollars appropriated by Congress for coin as a memorial dollar, still in their hands not collected, and the result of the management has now been unlocked, and consequently the managers of the Fair can afford to return the money in the contract to close the Fair on Sunday.

(3). The Board of Directors, within a week, passed a resolution to place the matter before the Illinois directors to take definite action thereon.

The 3 bills have been introduced into the Illinois legislature, the object of which is to have it opened, getting the State itself to a very that. This bill was offered by Mr. Crafts.

All corporations or companies incorporated as or organized under the laws of this State and which exhibit the products of agriculture, the mechanical or liberal arts, or any union, in cities of more than fifty thousand inhabitants, operated or maintained by such corporation, shall display such exhibit as have been or as may be hereafter contracted for, for not less than six consecutive days of the week and not over seven days each week; provided, however, that on no day of the week shall any exhibitor be compelled to take charge of or attend to his or her exhibition and that any exhibitor under the supervision of the management of such corporation may cause his, her or its exhibition to be closed and secured to the visiting public on Sunday. Violation of this act shall be a misdemeanor by every officer of the corporation responsible for such violation.

It is held that since the World's Fair is a State corporation and since the circuit court of the United States has held that such corporations this bill, if passed, will in effect offer every opportunity in opening the Fair on Sunday. It is expected to offer a remedy on days in a week. Whether it will have this effect or not is not very clear.
