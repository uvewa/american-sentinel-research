Now that the Protestant clergy have usurped governmental power and control, and are ready to join hands with Rome in order to enforce their religious dogmas, the people of America should ponder well the following words of the historian, Froude:—

> Every true Catholic is bound to think and act as his priest tells him, and a Republic of true Catholics becomes a theoracy administered by the clergy. It is only as long as they are a small minority that they can be loyal subjects under such a Constitution as the American. As their numbers grow, they will assert their principles more and more. Give them the power and the Constitution will be gone. A Catholic majority, under spiritual direction, will forbid liberty of worship, and will try to forbid liberty of conscience. It will control education, it will put the press under surveillance, it will punish opposition with excommunication, and excommunication will be attended with civil disabilities.

Some of these principles that Rome will assert are thus set forth by Dr. G. F. von Schulte, professor of Canonical Law at Prague:—

The Pope has the right to give countries and nations that are non-Catholic to Catholic regents who can reduce them to slavery.

The Pope can make slaves of those Christian subjects, whose prince or ruling power is interdicted by the Pope.

The Church has the right to practice the unconditional censure of books.

The Pope has the right to annul State laws, treaties, constitutions, etc., and to absolve from obedience thereto.

The Pope can release from every obligation, oath, vow, either before or after being made.

The execution of papal commands for the persecution of heretics causes remission of sins.

He who kills one that is excommunicated is no murderer in a legal sense.

This is what the National Reformers are ready to gladly join hands with to advance their aims. How long will it be before that scripture is fulfilled which saith that they will "Cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed"? Rev. 13:15.

FRANCIS HOPE.
