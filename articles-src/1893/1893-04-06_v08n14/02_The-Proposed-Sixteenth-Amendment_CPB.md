The proposed Sixteenth Amendment is again attracting a good deal of attention and provoking a good deal of discussion from the fact that Monsignor Satolli has been asked to give his views concerning it. The proposed amendment reads as follows:—

> No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used for the purpose of founding, maintaining or aiding by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking, which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

There are two things which this amendment would prevent should it become a part of the fundamental law; (1), the setting up of any denomination to be the State Church; and (2), the appropriation of public money for the support of denominational schools. Both these objects are desirable, and, as far as it goes, the proposed amendment is good; but there are also two very important things that it would not do; (1), it would not prevent "sects having control of legislation" from passing laws in aid of their own peculiar practices and dogmas; and (2), it would not prohibit the use of public funds for religious purposes under State supervision, provided no denomination or ecclesiastical organization was the beneficiary.

That the proposed amendment would not prevent sects having control of legislation from legislating in a general way in their own favor, is evident from the interpretation put by a United States court upon the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty in Tennessee. The constitution of that State provides that "no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship." The question at issue under this constitutional provision was the right of the State to require everybody within its borders to observe the first day of the week by refraining on that day from all secular labor and business. The view taken of this by the United States Circuit Court in the case of R. M. King, was that the constitution of Tennessee does not guarantee freedom of religious belief in the sense that a Seventh-day Adventist, Seventh-day Baptist, or other observer of the seventh day, "might set at defiance the prejudices, if you please, of other sects having control of legislation in the matter of Sunday observance, but only in the sense that he should not himself be disturbed in the practice of his creed; which is quite a different thing from saying that in the course of his daily labor, . . . he might disregard laws made in aid, if you choose to say so, of the religion of other sects."

There is good reason to believe that this opinion was not announced until it had been submitted to at least a portion of the Supreme Bench of the United States, and approved, unofficially, by the highest judicial authority in our land. This gives the opinion great significance. The Tennessee guarantee of religious freedom is certainly not less ample than is the provision of the Federal Constitution on the same subject, nor is it less broad and definite than the proposed Sixteenth Amendment. If, therefore, there is in the constitution of Tennessee nothing which in the opinion of either State or Federal judges prevents those sects having control of legislation from making laws in aid of their religion, there is certainly nothing in the proposed amendment that would prevent such legislation, provided it did not go so far as to establish a single sect to the exclusion of others, and did not appropriate money in aid of ecclesiastical organizations.

That this view of the proposed amendment is not visionary, nor the result of an unreasoning prejudice, is evident from the fact that its promoters themselves have defined its scope about as here indicated. It would not, they say, "prevent the passage of laws for the protection of the Christian Sabbath," nor would it interfere with the giving of "Christian instruction" in institutions supported by State funds, but not under sectarian control. It would not stop the employment of chaplains in legislative halls, nor in the army and navy, nor interfere in any way with any "Christian feature" of our Government, but is simply designed to prohibit the setting up of any ecclesiastical establishment as the State Church or giving public funds for the support of any denomination. At the close of a hearing, held April 12, 1892, by the House Committee on the Judiciary to consider this proposed amendment, Rev. James M. King, the secretary of the association by which the amendment was framed and by which it is being urged, was asked if extending to the several States the provisions of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution would not require the repeal of all laws bearing on religion, such as the belief in a God as a qualification to testify as a witness, laws against blasphemy, and laws requiring Monday observance. Mr. King replied that it would not, as it was designed solely to prevent the appropriation of money for sectarian purposes. Which simply means that it is designed to exclude from the public crib, the Roman Catholics without in the least interfering with the giving of that colorless thing known as "unsectarian religious instruction" at Government expense. This is what it is intended to mean, and there is little hope that our courts would give it any broader application. The Supreme Court has already virtually nullified our national guarantee of religious freedom by declaring that "there is no dissonance" between the Church and State charters under which this country was settled and the First Amendment to the Constitution. And there is, therefore, little hope that the proposed Sixteenth Amendment would ever be held to rehabilitate the once grand charter of American religious liberty, now degraded to the level of the greed and bigotry of the seventeenth century.
