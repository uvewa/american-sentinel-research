As the time approaches for the opening of the World's Fair those who have advocated the enforced closing of the gates on Sunday with so much success, have begun to speak with still greater intensity than before, in the fear that, after all, their victory may be a barren one, and the Fair remain open seven days in the week, despite the congressional legislation which has been had. In the "Pearl of Days" column of the Mail and Express this is said:—

> If the directors of the Chicago Exposition wish to make the Fair a success, the sooner this agitation ends the better for all concerned. We wish it distinctly understood, however, that the Union [American Sabbath Union] is watching every adverse movement on the part of those who would annul the Sunday closing condition enacted by the last Congress. The managers of this society propose to resist such efforts by all lawful means. If it should be the case that by any secret evasions of law the gates should be opened, the American Sabbath Union will, without doubt, be called upon to lead in a national protest, the moral effect of which must work serious disaster to the Exposition itself. We trust that there will be no occasion for this, for there has been no truer friend to the Columbian Exposition, from the beginning than this same society.

This is a covert threat. It is as much as to say, "Open the gates on Sunday and the American Sabbath Union will see to it that the Fair is a failure." The eventual outcome of the matter is even yet, in doubt. Appeal to the courts may still give opportunity for the opening of the gates on the Sundays of the Fair while the question of the right of Congress to affix any such condition is under litigation. It really makes no appreciable difference now whether the Fair is open or closed on Sunday. The principle of the right of interference by the central Government, in religious matters has been assumed and acted upon by Congress. The decree is now a precedent in legislation which can never be blotted out. The actual obedience of the World's Fair to that is but a matter of comparatively small moment. Disobedience to the decree would not rehabilitate the Government. There is now positively no remedy. Liberty has been stabbed at the foot of her own statue, and whole oceans can not wash away the blood-guiltiness from those who have done the deed. It might be of interest that the Fair should remain open on Sundays as a matter of curiosity just to see what these threats of the American Sabbath Union are worth, how many would stay away, what measures they would take to injure the Fair, and how far they would succeed; but the enforcement or non-enforcement of an individual circumstance is really of very little importance when the principle of civil justice and religious equality has been subverted, and the United States committed in fact to a course which can result in nothing but religious tyranny.
