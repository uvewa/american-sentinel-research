One Who Loves the American Sabbath.

We have recently received a communication from "One who loves the American Sabbath," from which, where, we understand, they put man in the place of God, and which speaks of the Scriptures; of the Sabbath "rest" on Sunday. When "one who loves the American Sabbath" shall learn from the Scripture which authorizes the observance of the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath of the Lord, he may perhaps find in the Scripture a grievance, and reason, for calling it "American," and keep it to himself, or, if he wants to, he be glad to divide hands with him on a common platform.
