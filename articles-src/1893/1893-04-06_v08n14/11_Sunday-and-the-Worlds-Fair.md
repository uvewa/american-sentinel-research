SUNDAY openers are pulling along three lines just now, hoping that some one of their schemes will secure the desired result of opening the Fair seven days in the week.

(1.) It is proposed to bring suit against the Government for interfering with State rights. In this some steps have already been taken.

(2.) It is said that Congress broke faith with the Fair Directory in taking over $500,000 of the two and one-half millions for other purposes than was first stipulated, and consequently the managers of the Fair are released from their part of the contract to close the Fair on Sunday. The Board of Control at a meeting last week, passed a resolution to place the matter before the directors, and ask them to take definite action thereon.

(3.) A bill has been introduced into the Illinois legislature, the object of which is to secure an opening during seven days in a week. The bill was offered by Mr. Mitchell, of Cook County, and provides that:—

> All corporations or companies incorporated under or by virtue of any general or special law of this State and which exhibit the products of agriculture, works of art or industry, or the products of nature, in cities of more than fifty thousand inhabitants, for a period of more than two months, and whose main buildings are located on public property, shall display such exhibits as have been intrusted to their care for the purpose of exhibition for seven days each week; provided, however, that no such company or corporation shall be compelled to keep any machinery in motion on Sunday; nor shall any exhibitor under the supervision of any such incorporated association or company be compelled to attend to his or her or their exhibits, or cater and attend to the visiting public on Sunday. Any violation of the act shall be punished by a fine of from ten to fifty dollars.

It is held that since the World's Fair is a State corporation and since the United States Congress has nothing to do with such corporations this bill, if passed, will compel the Fair directors to hold the Fair open seven days in a week. Whether any or none of these schemes will effect anything remains to be seen.
