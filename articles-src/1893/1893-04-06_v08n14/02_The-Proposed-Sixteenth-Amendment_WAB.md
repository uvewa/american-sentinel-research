The Proposed Sixteenth Amendment.

THIS proposition of Senator Blair is attracting a good deal of attention on account principally—it would appear— of the fact that Monsignor Satolli has been sent to this country.

The proposed amendment reads as follows:—

No State shall pay any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use the property or credit, or any revenue of the State, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services or otherwise, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking, which is wholly or in part under the control of any such church, denomination or society.

There are two things which this amendment proposes: (1), that no State shall do a part of the fundamental law; (1), the setting up of any denomination, to be the State Church; and (3), the appropriation of public funds for the support of sectarian or denominational schools. Both these objects are desirable, and so far as it goes, the proposed amendment is good; but there are also two very important things that it would *not* do; (1), it would not prevent sects having control of legislation from which certain citizens suffer because of practices and dogmas; and (5), it would not prevent the use of the State and its religious purposes under State appropriations. And, yet, this fifth undesirable and objectionable organization was the beginning of all.

Yet the proposed amendment would only prevent sects having control of and legislating from legislation in a general way in their own favor, leaving it to future interpretation put by a United States upon the constitutional guarantees of religion in Tennessee. The constitution of that State provides that no human authority can, in any case *whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience;* and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship. The question at issue under this constitutional provision was the right of the State to require everybody within its borders to observe the first day of the week by refraining on that day from all secular labor and business. The true token of this by the United States Circuit Court in the case of R. King, was that the constitution of Tennessee does not guarantee religious freedom in this regard and held that a Seventh-day Adventist, Seventh-day Baptist, or other observer of the seventh day, "might set at defiance the prohibition;" if you please, of other sects having authority under that constitution, against Sunday observance, but only in this sense that no penalty could lawfully be imposed for the practice of his creed; which is quite another thing. But for the proposed amendment this is a very nice and liberal course of its daily labor, in matters of religion, with an entirely proper right of choice simply having been made it, and if I choose to say so, of the religion of other people.

There is good reason to believe that this opinion was not announced until it has been submitted to at least a portion of the Supreme Court of the United States, and approved, specifically, by the highest judicial authority of our land; which gives the opinion great significance. The Tennessee guarantee of religious freedom is certainly not less than that in the provisions of the Federal Constitution on the same subject. But it is more than doubtful, better protection to the individual desirable than the proposed Sixteenth Amendment could be. For, while the constitution of Tennessee nothing more than that the supreme or the Federal judges prevents those sects having legislative authority from making laws in aid of their religion, there is certainly nothing in the proposed amendment that would prevent such legislation, a single sect to the exclusion of others, and it did not apportion taxation to any of all ecclesiastical organizations.

That this view of the proposed amendment is not visionary, nor the result of an unreasoning prejudice, is evident from two things: First, the courts of this land have defined its scope about as here indicated. Second, that the original intent of the passage of laws for the protection of religious belief was never intended to interfere with the giving of "Christian instruction" in institutions supported by State funds, but not under sectarian control. Second—the very presence of these chaplains in legislative halls, not to mention the army and the navy, point the way with any "Christian feature" of our Government; it is simply designed to prevent the selling out of our institutions and an establishing as the State Church any single denomination, to the exclusion of any denomination. At the close of a certain hearing before the Senate and House Committee on the Judiciary, to consider this proposed amendment, also James M. King, the secretary of the association by which the amendment was framed and by which it is being urged, was asked if it extended to the several States the provisions of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution: Would it require the repeal of all laws bearing on religion, such as the belief to hold on a qualification to testify or a witness, laws against blasphemy, and laws requiring religious observance? King said plainly that it would not, as it was designed to protect educational institutions and the money for sectarian purposes. Which simply means that it is designed to exclude from the public earth, the Roman Catholic religion in the most direct manner,—the giving of that colorless thing known as "unsectarian religious instruction" in government agencies. This is what it is intended to mean, and there is a little hope that our courts will give it any broader construction—having, as they have, already virtually nullified our constitutional guarantee of religious freedom by declaring that "there is no dissonance" between them. With this country we could see the First Amendment, or the Constitution itself amended, so as to make it conform to the proposed Sixteenth Amendment and the proposed Sixteenth Amendment proclaimed the supreme law of the land, charter of American religious liberty, not one word of the present law upon the subject would be changed.

The Supreme Court has already said, what some of the inferior State and county courts have decided that common law is the basis of our jurisprudence; and in no courts, by any amount of decisions can courts ever make "this a Christian country in the legal sense." "As religion test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." *Justice Story* says of this clause that it was "intended to cut off forever every pretense of any alliance between Church and State in the national Government." The treaty with Tripoli, signed by George Washington, President, and Timothy Pickering, minister, says that "the Government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion."

Of treaties, the Constitution itself says that they shall be "the supreme law of the land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby." Eze. 20: 20 and up above says the "supreme law of the land" directs that "Congress shall make no law." Jefferson said of this in that "the common law has no existence as a distinct designation"; and that "the common law is the mother of all the parties" and is subject to the law relating to the principles of common law." So says Government by common law that it overrides the "supreme law" of common law, because State Christianity overrides one of the most sacred principles of the equality of all religion. The Supreme Court virtually has declared this, and it has nothing more to be forced upon. But "this State is to be emphatically rejected for it does not represent that section of our common law, but contrary to the principles of any common law." And the constitution of Ohio says "that all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of conscience. No human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with rights of conscience." As religion is a matter of the conscience, so far as the individual and the Creator, of obedience or disobedience, without restraint, leaving each one the freedom of mind to enter the one or the other, it is one of the principles of our Government, that the Government, "in the true American idea, has no concern with religion," is the true American idea, the only one that is in the broadest sense consistent with the principles of that religion is as follows: the theory of the protection of civil governments is to protect all in their natural rights—freedom of conscience—and this is the limit of all civil governments.
