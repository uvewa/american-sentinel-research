The Protestant Church in Russia.

It is manifestly the determination of the Russian authorities to crush all religious freedom in that vast empire within the breadth of the vast empire. The interest of Czar Victor—against "the teaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ of our time, one church," has been received in an audience never before acceded in his peculiarity as the Protestant churches in the Baltic Provinces that suffered. As the highest intellectual and spiritual force these represented the most progressive and the most stubborn opponents of the Russian advance. When Protestantism took root in the special era of those high in State church authority, and the propaganda against her evidence is being relentlessly carried on. More than one-half of her old rights and privileges have been withdrawn, and her schools taken from her, and even the great Dorpat University is now in the hands of the enemy. Livonia is a prison in which some measure of suppression and persecution. Then is this pursuit a part of the madness, and the state of affairs is even worse that it was when the last Convention of the Evangelical Alliance took it up, and through England presented a petition for his Protestant subjects. Those treaties which for a century have guaranteed to the Protestant churches in Russia a matter of special privileges.

The Protestants have flourished as a church in Russia, entirely distinct in their character from the Roman Catholic Protestants in St. Petersburg; in the Baltic Provinces the strong and conservative elements. The first and last groups are the descendants of settlers, chiefly from Germany and Lutherans, invited to settle in Russia by Peter the Great, and Catherine I., and promised full religious liberty. The group also counts mostly of Lutherans and Livonians, although such are holding classes, the aristocratic Luthenians, and professional men, are made up of Germans. These are so Russian Protestants.

PROTESTANTS IN ST. PETERSBURG.

The Sectarians came originally from all parts of western Europe, and at first, in the time of Peter the Great, constituted a single congregation. As their numbers grew, they divided into separate congregations, according to language and nationality, although there are now more than ninety thousand Protestant Christians in the Russian Metropolis, of whom the great bulk are Lutherans. They are organized into twenty-five congregations, in a variety of languages. Of the ministers of these congregations fifteen are Lutherans, seven are Reformed, and the rest belong to different churches, the disparity between the Lutherans and the Reformed finding explanation in the fact that in a number of cases two congregations, differing in languages, make use of the same house of worship. The Protestant clergy in the Russian metropolis number thirty-two. Such congregations there averages 4,286 souls; there is one church for every 5,000 and one pastor for every 4,413.

The increase in the number of churches and of the clergy in the last thirty years has been noteworthy, and is in advance of the growth of the Protestant population, which during the same period has shown that its pastors has increased twenty per cent., and the churches fifty per cent., the seating capacity of the churches has increased; in addition, since 1862, the Lutherans have been enabled, by means of voluntary subscriptions to build, in addition, ten mission stations in the suburbs, served by the same number of pastors. Every Sunday, Protestant services are held in St. Petersburg in nine languages,—namely, German, French, English, Dutch, Russian, Finnish, Swedish, Esthonian, and Livonian. These congregations are totally independent, and enjoy a greater degree of self-government than they do in some of the States of Europe. In this regard they are not to be compared with the Congregational and Baptist Churches of the United States.

All the St. Petersburg congregations have legal officers that, among other things, serve in the place of the modern place of a man's residence does not decide who is to administer a church, that the directly or indirectly, the congregation sustains a relation to its people it cannot evade, and these again are answerable chiefly to the congregations. Some of the congregations are possessed of so much property and the income from this source about entirely covers their expenditures. In other cases the members contribute according to their ability. No aid is received from the State. All are and have a liberal tendency toward all the ministers. Educational work is carried on by them on a grand scale; and they have also private institutions doing a like work. In the esteem of the public the Protestant churches hold a high place, and the status of Protestant pastors are very respectable, socially. Among the Russian intelligentsia the Protestants compose the thinking portion of the Established Churches, and by them, the Lutheran system is keenly appreciated as compared with the spiritual barracks of the Orthodox Church and the immoral lives of its clergy.
