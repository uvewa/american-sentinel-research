THE Seventh-day Baptist Church reported at its General Conference a net gain during 1892 of one hundred and three members. It has foreign missions in Shanghai, China, with thirty church members, seventy-one pupils in the schools, and an average Sabbath school attendance of fifty pupils; and a mission at Haarlem, Holland. While in harmony on most points with the orthodox churches, this church occupies a peculiar position on the Sabbath question. Besides holding to the seventh day as the divinely appointed and only Sabbath, it opposes all recognition of Sunday as a Sabbath of civil institution and all civil legislation respecting Sunday observance, and has contended against legislation to enforce Sunday closing of the Chicago Exposition. The denominational tract society adopted a petition to Congress on this subject, asking it "not thus to enter upon the work of legislation concerning religious questions;" expressing the belief that such a law would be contrary to the principles of religious freedom and the entire separation of Church and State; and urging its prayer "in the name of religious liberty and the non-interference of Congress, directly or indirectly, in religious affairs." The General Conference adopted resolutions declaring the work of "Sabbath reform" to be the distinctive work of the denomination, deprecating the prevalence of loose views and practices on the subject, and recommending as the only remedy for the growing evil of "apostasy from the Sabbath" the cultivation in children of a sensitive conscience, both by precept and example, to exercise a careful discrimination between the right and the wrong, not only in Sabbath observance, but also in all matters of thought and action. A committee has been appointed to present addresses on this seventh-day doctrine of the Sabbath to the general courts of other denominations.
