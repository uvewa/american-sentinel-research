The Supreme Court has decided that this is "a Christian Nation." And some courts have decided that common law is based upon the Christian religion. But no courts, by any amount of decisions can ever make white black. The Federal Constitution declares, "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." Justice Story says of this it was "to cut off forever every pretense of any alliance between Church and State in the general Government." The treaty with Tripoli, signed by George Washington, and by an Ex-Congregationalist minister, says that "the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion."

Of treaties, the Constitution itself says that they "shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby." Thus the Supreme Court, in that decision, exalted itself above the "supreme law of the land" in saying that this is "a Christian Nation." Jefferson said of this idea of Christianity being recognized as part of the common law in the mother country, "that it came to be recognized contrary to the principles of common law." In this country, Christianity forms no part of common law, because State Christianity has been superseded by religious liberty—that is equality of all religions. The principles of Christianity were never made to be forced upon men. For this reason to engraft religion upon the common law was not only contrary to the principles of common law, but contrary to the principles of Christian religion as well. The constitution of Ohio says "that all men have a natural and an indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of conscience; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience." As religion is a matter of the conscience, a matter of one's relation to the Creator, of obedience or disobedience; and as the Creator left the will of man without restraint, leaving each one to choose for himself it must be clear that the ideas of the founders of our general Government, that the Government "is in no sense founded upon the Christian religion," is the true American idea. And it is the only one that can be made consistent with the principles of that religion and the duty of the State. The province of civil governments is to protect all in their religious rights—freedom of conscience—and this is the limit of all earthly authority in matters of religion.

It is therefore clear that the Supreme Court decision and the Sunday-closing act of Congress were not only contrary to the best interests of the State, usurping authority that did not and could not of right belong to Congress or the Supreme Court, but they were unchristian as well, being contrary to all and every principle of Christianity. Those who were clamoring for that decision were asking for an unchristian thing, and the whole course is destructive of the best interests of the State and of the Church.
