BISHOP NICHOLSON, of Milwaukee, has taken the ground that no governmental authority should close the World's Fair on Sunday, in which he is in substantial agreement with Bishop Potter, of New York, and like him, has been criticised for his position. The Chicago Tribune contains a paragraph in regard to the matter, as follows:—

> Bishop Nicholson, the head of the Episcopal Diocese of Milwaukee, in a published card in defense of his position in favoring the Sunday opening of the World's Fair, scores clergymen who, he says, in their impetuosity in seeking to close the Exposition forget that for weeks every summer the doors of their churches are closed on Sunday. Bishop Nicholson takes issue on the subject in reply to a prominent clergyman of a different denomination, who asks why the church in the Milwaukee Episcopal Diocese did not come out and take a strong stand with other churches in opposing the opening of the Fair on the Sabbath. The bishop gives several reasons in reply to the query, among which is that the Sabbath alluded to, according to the Bible, is Saturday, and he never knew that there was any question as to the closing of the Fair on Saturday. Then he says that the matter is entirely one of individual opinion so far as the Christian world is concerned. Bishop Nicholson's individual opinion is similar to that held by most of the bishops of the Episcopal Church, that, as he puts it, "looking to the greater good done the greater number, considering the larger moral safety and the opportunities of intellectual improvement to the indiscriminate hordes who shall gather about Chicago, by all means open those Exposition gates and let the people under certain prudential restrictions have the free use of its marvelous displays on that day of recreation, meditation and rest."

It is to be noticed that the bishop does not hesitate to puncture the popular misconception that Sunday is the Sabbath. In this it is experimentally shown how one error leads to another. Those who have espoused the cause of Sunday with a determination to uphold it as God's Sabbath, find their efforts unsupported by God, and are compelled to resort to civil law to enforce the observance of the "American Sabbath." The American Sabbath could not be God's Sabbath, and upon investigation it is found that it is not. They come on different days of the week. The bishop is right on that point. He should be just as clear on the whole subject and express himself without compromise upon the correct principle throughout the whole matter. In reality no question of policy or profit, to any one, properly enters into the matter at all. The right to open or close on Sunday should rest with the management just as does the right to open or close on any other day of the week. The right to attend or not to attend on Sunday, if open, rests with the individual just as on any other day of the week. Why should bishops restrict themselves to a half truth? Why not speak the whole truth and shame the clergy?
