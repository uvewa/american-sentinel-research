ECCLESIASTICISM is the human substitute for the divine government of the Church. The history of ecclesiasticism is the history of heresies and schisms, of persecution and intolerance, of the rack and the stake. It is a tale of the dungeon, of blood, of fire, and the sword. It is a story of the satiated frenzy of human diabolism on the one side, and the patient suffering of the direst agonies of which the human frame and mind are capable, on the other.

PAGANISM is the epitome of earthly and infernal evil as expressed through humanity. It is the religion of devil worship, which has fed itself on human lives here that it may feast on eternal death hereafter. Paganism is a lie. It is false throughout. It is the worship of the father of lies. There is in it no foundation of truth, as there is in him no truth, for he is all falsehood and evil personified, and his subjects are himself incarnate.

How then do paganism and ecclesiasticism differ? If it is true that everything shall bear fruit after its kind and that we may know them by their fruits, and the product of the one is similar to the product of the other, differing only in the degree of development, then we may justly draw the conclusion that both are from the same source, the fruits of the same spirit.

ENVEING and strife, war and slaughter, the desire to conquer and to kill, and to take the conquered and his possessions as booty due the victor,—these are not the fruits of righteousness—for the fruit of righteousness is peace, "sown in peace of them that make peace." That which counsels to such deeds is not the wisdom from above, for that is peaceable, gentle, and full of mercy, long suffering and kind. But that wisdom which is not from above is earthly and devilish. Of all these crimes against man and sins against God paganism is guilty; and so also have they all been done in the name and by the order of ecclesiasticism.

IN paganism Satan rules without an intermediary; in ecclesiasticism he rules by that human agency which he has found so traitorous to its kind and to its God as to accept his delegated authority and undertake to be second in that dominion in which Christ refused to be first. In either case, then, the ruler is the same, and that being so, the governments must be similar; the requirements of allegiance, the oaths of office can not be different. They are not different; they are the same. They only vary as the varying development of the intellectual and social life requires, and that variation is equally true of either form of satanic government.

THE rule of Satan in the pagan world is supreme, his subjects render him a terror-stricken and unquestioning obedience. It is his aim to seek absolutism everywhere, thus he is always a usurper and hence it is that ecclesiasticism is never content until it has enthroned itself in a despotism. All forms of ecclesiasticism are from the same original stock, and they will again merge into one common type, which, whether the name of the original be retained or not, will be the same antichrist. He who has staked an eternity and the third place in heaven upon his effort to win eternal supremacy will brook no rival and grant no equal. He, and no other, will rule his own.

IT is the ultimate philosophy of every people that all things resolve themselves finally into either good or evil, that there is in the last event no other contest than that between Ormund and Ahriman, the forces of right and wrong. This is a legitimate deduction. There is also divine authority for it, for He himself has said that they who are not for him are against him. If this be true, as the human mind has acknowledged from all time, it is inevitable that the discrimination must be made. Each factor in the fight must be called up and the "shibboleth" put to him: What say ye of Christ, whom say ye that he is? By this and by their fruits must all be proved that that which is good may be held fast.

As in the ultimate event there can be but the two principles, good and evil, so there are but the two supreme representatives of these antagonisms, and these two beings are God and Satan. From the beginning the fiat has gone forth, "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve." The necessity for this choice devolves upon humanity none the less now that in these last days man has found out for himself so many evil devices, and Satan, having developed all his supernatural subtleties, is coming down with all deceivableness such as might lead astray the very elect themselves. It behooves every man, then to ask, Where is peace? For God is the God of peace, and Satan is the god of strife. Where is equal justice to all men without respect of persons? For God is no respecter of persons; but Satan is the god of envy as he is of strife. Where are they that confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, for the salvation of souls? For they are of God; but they that deny him are of the spirit of antichrist. Where are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus? For at the last day they shall stand with him on the sea of glass, and sing the song of Moses and the Lamb; but as for the ungodly and the wicked what shall their end be?

THERE is but one name by which men may be saved. It is not the name of any sect or denomination. It is not by protesting against the errors committed under the name and authority of any hierarchy while neglecting to pick the beam from their own eyes. It is not by declaring loudly against the errors of others, while failing themselves to walk with humility and meekness in the steps of the Master. If this be so, as it is, where will they be who are striving among themselves for the mastery? Who are organizing to combat one another,—not going forth two by two to preach the word, to warn the world, to heal the sick, and bring the gospel to them that hunger for God's last message of joy to the world. The inner purpose of every secret oath-bound organization is known to God. It can not be concealed from Him,—nor from those who serve him in truth,—that their purpose is not to serve God, and that whatever their purpose they can not by the use of such means serve the God of peace. It makes no difference what these organizations may call themselves; whether they be Roman Catholic, to further the denominational interests and temporal power of Roman Catholicism,—or whether they be avowedly Protestant with the expressed purpose by every possible discrimination in temporal and civil matters, and social affairs, to circumscribe the influence and reduce the business and political prestige, and success, of the Roman Catholic because of his Catholicism; or whether they be like these organizations which profess no sectarian or denominational bias but are willing to join hands with all to secure enforced obedience to the requirements of a legally accepted religion,—all these are of one kind. Their methods and purposes are not those of the God of peace and justice. It is the final expression of a civilized paganism and a highly developed ecclesiasticism in a last desperate alliance to fight the battles of Satan against God and his goodness.
