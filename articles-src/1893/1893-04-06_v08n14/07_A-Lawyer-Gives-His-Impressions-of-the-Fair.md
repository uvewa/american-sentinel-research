A Lawyer Gives His Impressions of the Fair.

[Mr. James T. Ringgold, of the *Baltimore Bar*, who recently visited Texas, for the purpose of examining into that section of the country, was in Battle Creek, Mich., on Sabbath, Jan. 14, where he expressed himself as follows:]

These Seventh-day Adventists, by the way, are the most remarkable people I have ever encountered. Their communities embrace about 35,000 members, and they have a fine college at Battle Creek, and a great sanitarium. I was at Battle Creek on one of their Sabbath days. Neb. They occupy a unique position in respect to the Sunday Sabbath question. These Sabbatarians, as the Hebrews, object to compulsory idleness on the first day of the week, as a requirement of civil law, on the score of its inconvenience to them when coupled with the requirement which they obey, not the rules of their religion. But they have not even an external conformity to this regulation of civil law. If a citizen has not even an external conformity to this practice, in some localities, in a church, and it is a sin, that it is the manifestation of the "mark of the beast" in the forehead or the hand, which is manifestation or consent. I do not agree with them, nor can this that belief makes the civil requirement lighter or less hard to bear in its pressure upon these people. In fact, they do not believe in physical idleness at all; they say the commandment recognizing the Sabbath, the Deity's "rest," which is the only commandment regarding the Sabbath, says to keep it "holy," and a man should keep Saturday "holy," says a not unjust logical thinker; and should "remember the Sabbath day" all the week, in order that he may not by physical exhaust corrections, that when it comes he would be able to give one clear day of grace of mind and body to keeping the day "holy," by the service of his Lord in the doing of good works; and that to spend it in vacancy is just how misinterpretation of the holy day that it is to utilize it as a mere physical holiday or bodily rest station.

All this strikes me as very logical, and I confess that I am free to say that what is known as the "holiday theory" of a compulsory holiday is preposterous and ought to be kept "far out of court" when it once gets to be fairly settled before the legislature. Now, the Sabbatarians, there are those, as Mr. Linderbloom, in his work on "Limitation of the Police Power," observes, who would have us believe that the fourth commandment itself was a purely secular regulation, based on the discovery by Moses of some secular investigation in the relations of man health and longevity on one side and labor on the other, which was known to the Hebrews. The Seventh-day Adventists, however, point out that Paul's words "to keep it holy" plainly show that the Hebrew Sabbath is a rule that was religious altogether, and if "kept at all, as such, it must not be kept as a day of physical idleness, but rather as a day of mental and studious exercise, only of a different sort from that in which other days were engaged."

What makes them so wonderful to me is this: that they are one of the finest organizations I ever heard of which understands religious equality, utterly irrespective of the effects of legislation to any individual freedom. They would have a Sunday law, but they demand a restraint from it. They do want a State legislature to submit to a national bureau legislature to which to submit an amendment. With no doubt all States, and then exempting them from its operation—saying that the products of each sect and denomination shall produce legislation. The Congress will itself be the World's first real test of just such a question, which shall test the principle of Congress and the States; and it will be agreed on that it is so opposed just as sure as it is that it has been and will continue. Let me then proceed to say in the words of the master; to them, if the day was to be "recognized as the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, it must be by some act of religion and cannot be by an act of any civil authority. It cannot be by legislation in any other way whatever.

I trust that in this reasoning I have been carefully and thoroughly consistent; and thoroughout that I can lastly get the effect of the discrimination that must and that gave the lie to the wisdom of the discrimination which is a wrong that our civilization could only exist with indifference. The Seventh-day Adventist represents the position of a mere passive virtue of the American constitution of active and Christian questions. With the broad doctrine that no two religions will live exactly alike. The absolute and constant separation of the Church from the State, and no appropriation of its funds and the cutting out of all traces of a union between the civil and the religious power of the great words with the Master, "Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's."

Thus, when I was endeavoring to reach an agreed statement of facts in one of the Sunday-closing cases, the attorney who actually refused to permit an admission of the fact that they were Seventh-day Adventists, saying in any religion that was not in their case, whether or not the closing was of their rights as American citizens. Whether or not this distinction of modern religionists is altogether new to the courts or not, I think it is worth some serious study on the part of judges. Let me add that I heard but one testimony against the Seventh-day Adventist. Everyone agrees that the adoption of their distinct improvement in this matters and their intelligence is far beyond what I am among those who join them. For it is certain that the men who keep a different Sabbath entirely on their own will, voluntarily, without any cause, no earthly occasion will become a Seventh-day Adventist, who does not sincerely believe himself bound not only by a Scriptural command, but a milt.

For working on Sunday—for not working, Sunday seem to be instigated by a few, so far as keeping the law is concerned, and the way, object strongly to appearing at any of their prosecutions. Since then we like to add that presiding Judge Swiggart of Tennessee, and Attorney General Lea, who represented the State, has my hearty thanks for his gentlemanly and courteous conduct in the proceedings. All these cases were won by the defense, but the victory was a barren one to some respects, as we have not yet secured what we desire in Tennessee, as well as and so elsewhere in the land, in which we are told from the tribunal of last resort's definite ruling in favor of religious liberty. As for the restrictions to compulsory idleness and gloom on the first day of the week.
