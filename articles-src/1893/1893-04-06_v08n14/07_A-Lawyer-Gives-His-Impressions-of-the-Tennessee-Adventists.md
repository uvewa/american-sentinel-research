[Mr James T. Ringgold, of the Baltimore Bar, who recently visited Paris, Tenn., for the purpose of defending the persecuted Adventists, was interviewed a few days since by a reporter of the Baltimore Sun, to whom he expressed himself as follows:—]

THREE Seventh-day Adventists, by the way, are the most remarkable people I have ever encountered. . . Their communion embraces about 35,000 members, and they have a fine college at Battle Creek, Mich., and another at Lincoln, Neb. They occupy a unique position in regard to Sunday work. Other Sabbatarians, as the Hebrews, object to compulsory idleness on the first day of the week, as a requirement of civil law, because of its inconvenience to them when coupled with their observance of Saturday under the rules of their religion. But the Seventh-day Adventist believes that the application of the fourth commandment to Sunday is antichristian, and that, to show even an external conformity to this practice, is more than an inconvenience—that it is a sin, that it is the manifestation of the "mark of the beast" in the forehead or the hand, which is mentioned in Revelation. Right or wrong, you can see that this belief makes the civil requirement of Sunday idleness a peculiar hardship on these people. In fact, they do not believe in physical idleness at all, as the real purpose of the Sabbath. They say that the Deity's "rest," which is the only reason given why other than Hebrews should keep Saturday "holy," was not a physical rest, . . . that we are to "remember the Sabbath day" all the week, in order that we may not so physically exhaust ourselves, that when it comes we shall be unable to give our best energies of mind and body to keeping the day "holy," by the service of Deity and the doing of good works; and that to spend it in secular labor is no more a desecration of the holy day than it is to utilize it as a mere physical holiday for bodily relief and recuperation.

All this strikes me as very logical, and you perceive that it completely destroys what is known as the "holiday theory" of our Sunday laws. Of course the idea of a compulsory holiday is preposterous enough in itself to be "laughed out of court" when it once gets to be fairly argued before the American people. Nevertheless, there are those, as Mr. Liedewaurr, in his work on "Limitations of the Police Power," observes, who would have us believe that the fourth commandment itself was a purely secular regulation, based on the discovery by Moses of some mysterious connection between human health and longevity on one side and idleness for one day in seven on the other. The Seventh-day Adventists, however, say, and say rightly, as I think, that the words "to keep it holy" plainly show that the Hebrew Sabbath was a religious institution altogether, and if "kept at all, as such, it must not be kept as a day of physical idleness, but rather as a day of earnest and zealous exertion, only of a different sort from that in which other days are spent. The Seventh-day Adventists also say, and say rightly, as I think, that our civil Sunday is, like Moses' Sabbath, a religious institution altogether, and that it involves the union of Church and State, just as did the Hebrew day. To this instance of the union they are no more opposed in principle because of its oppressive operation upon them than they are to all other instances which do not directly affect them at all, as State appropriations to sectarian schools, etc.

What makes them so wonderful to me is that theirs is the only religious organization I ever heard of which understands and consistently supports the idea of religious equality, utterly irrespective of the effects of inequality on its own interests. They would have no Sunday law, but they refused a recent invitation from the Tennessee legislature to submit an amendment to the Sunday law of that State, exempting them from its operation—saying that to support the amendment was to admit the principle of such laws. They told Congress that if the World's Fair was to be opened at all on Sunday they demanded that it be opened just as on other days, and that the matter had no interest for them, if the day was to be "recognized" by stopping the machinery, or in any other way whatever.

All this seems to me so charmingly consistent and thorough that I can hardly admire it enough. These men have in fact given the lie to the wisdom of the ages, which has always assumed that toleration could only exist with indifference. In fact they have elevated toleration from the position of a mere passive virtue of self-restraint into the firm rank of active Christian qualities. With them it is the doctrine that no true religious life can coexist without the absolute and total separation of the Church from the State, and that not to strenuously advocate the rooting out of all traces of a union between the two is to be false to the command "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's"

Thus, when I was endeavoring to reach an agreed statement of facts in one of their recent cases for purposes of appeal they actually refused to permit an allusion to the fact that they were Seventh-day Adventists, saying they would accept no ruling based in anywise on the fact, even if it were relevant, because their only defense was of their rights as American citizens. I say that this attitude of mind in zealous religionists is altogether new to me, and it is as astonishing as it is new. Let me add that I heard but one testimony respecting the character of these men. Everyone agrees that the adoption of their creed has been followed uniformly by a distinct improvement in the manners and ways of the least educated and advanced among those who join them. One party volunteered the expression of his wish that everybody who owed him money would become a Seventh-day Adventist, "so he could collect his honest dues without a suit."

The cases against them for working on Sunday seem to be instigated by a few, no doubt perfectly sincere fanatics, who, by the way, object strongly to appearing as witnesses in court against them. I would like to add that presiding Judge Swiegart was a model of judicial courtesy and acumen, and Attorney General Lewis, who represented the State, has my hearty thanks for his gentlemanly and considerate conduct in the prosecution. All the cases tried were won by the defense, but the victory was a barren one in some respects, as we have not yet secured what we desire in Tennessee, as well as elsewhere—a case in which we can get from the tribunal of last resort a definite ruling in what are believed to be insuperable objections to compulsory idleness and gloom on Sunday, by law established.
