Rome Rule for America.

Now that the Protestant clergy has once urged governmental peace and control, and are ready to join hands with Rome in a common crusade against the liberties of the people of America should ponder well the following list of Roman Catholic *Proverbs:*

Every true Catholic is bound to think and act as his priest tells him, and a Republic of true Catholics become impossible. No man has the right of freedom of conscience, nor can he practice religion where he can be loyal subjects under such a Constitution. They are bound to believe that when they will assert their principles more and more. Once obtain the power and the Constitution will be but a scrap of paper. The Roman Catholic religion, will forbid liberty of worship, and will try to control and oppress their fellowmen. Protestantism of every form has no more rights than do any pagan and will punish opposition with excommunication, and must deal with all who dare to oppose as it shall choose.

Some of the principles that Rome will assert are thus set forth by Dr. G. F. von Schulte, professor of Canonical Law at Prague:

The Pope has the right to give countries and nations to Catholic princes, to depose non-Catholic rulers who refuse them to slavery.

That the Pope has the right to annul all the decrees, laws and ordinances of those Christian subjects, whose prince or ruling power is interested. The Pope has the power to annul all the additional courses of books.

He has the right to annul State laws, traditions, constitutions, oaths, etc., and to absolve from obedience.

He has the power to release from every obligation, oath, vow, either before or after being made.

The unprincipled of a pagan commander for the permission.

He who kills one that is excommunicated is no murderer in a legal sense.

This is what the National Reformers are ready to gladly join hands with to advance their aims. How long will it be before that scripture is fulfilled which saith that they will "Cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."
