It has been repeatedly intimated by representatives of the Sunday closing movement that the judgments of God might be visited upon the Fair in case it were opened the whole time. Nathan, as a punishment for breaking the Sabbath. Opening on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday. "Times" three hundred thousand people visited the Fair, and even the dreaded cholera as a very possible retribution.

These suggestions are not direct prayers for disaster, although the expressions that God might visit his wrath upon the Nation by means of these calamities, is evidence that such punishment in the mind of the preacher, could right to be visited, and that if they were God, they would sweep the land with the besom of destruction.

However, suggestions have now developed into actual prayers for vengeance as follows: Rev. M. A. Gault, editor of the *Christian Statesman*; Rev. Wm. Weir, one of the editors of the magazine *Pearl of Days*, Rev. W. F. Crafts, are among those who have recently written to the *Christian Statesman* of June 3, referred to, and may be found in the *Christian Statesman* of June 3, 1893.

Six months hence we will be able to declare by the evidence of the facts whether it be the will and act of the Lord Jesus Christ back on the gates closed and shalt not be opened, or no.

A just paraphrase of this American Sabbath Union petition would read as follows: Arise, O Lord, doom the Fair! Punish them with pestilence, with cholera, or famine, or with the deadly plague, only close it!

Why doom the Fair? Forsooth, because it has desecrated the Sabbath—the day it has decreed his Sabbath! By its being opened on Sunday, the first day of the week, in violation of the command which says, "In every day is what is the Sabbath, the Lord thy God."

Of these strange things in connection with the history of religious persecution, namely, that the persecutor has invariably per persecuted upon wrong premises. It has always been a dogma for which there was no foundation in fact or in a correct scriptural doctrine that a socialized "desecration of the Sabbath" was an act at variance. That the Sunday-closing representatives admit this among a scriptural command for Sunday observance, the following will show. In "Pearl of Days" (subtitle "Sabbath"), a publication issued by the American Sabbath Union, and written by a vice president of the Union, we find the following strange admission:

Our opponents declare . . . We are not satisfied to say there is nothing in the New Testament about keeping Saturday instead of Sunday. We ourselves observed instead of the seventh we must have a well-grounded reason, otherwise we stand convicted.

And yet in the face of this fatal admission, the organ of the American Sabbath Union publishes a petition of one of its editors, imploring the Lord Jesus Christ to "close" the Fair because it is opened on the first day of the week.

In Isaiah 8, N. C., published by the department of Sabbath observation of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, edited by Mrs. J. C. Bateham, Painesville, one of the editors of the *Christian Sabbath* confesses:

Question 4—If Jesus wished the day changed, did he not have a good reason?

*Answer*—A command to celebrate the resurrection must clearly change the Sabbath. I question the wisdom of such direction. That the first day should be so spoken of as "the Lord's Day" . . .

According to their own admissions, these two organs of the Sunday closing movement, and yet the United States troops are petitioned for to shoot down the gates. Lord Jesus Christ is asked for divine vengeance upon the Fair because it is open on the first day of the week.

Again, the following dialogue took place between an American Sabbath Union representative and an ardent Sunday closer, one Mr. Crafts before a bill for a national Sunday law was pending:

Mr. Johnson—I think that no one can find any authority for Sunday observance in the Bible, and it was not observed as a day of rest and worship until the fourth century.

Chairman—You do not wish us to understand you to advocate a day of rest?

Mr. Johnson—Oh, yes sir; after the fourth century or the early part of the fourth century. Let me say for argument's sake, that it was observed all through the Bible.

The Chairman—Don't you think that is the law of Nature?

Mr. Johnson—No; now you come and change the proposition. You may as well claim that the two days are the—

The Chairman—When did he do that and by what authority?

Mr. Johnson—It was not done by the authority of the Scripture. I don't think that Christ had any authority for changing the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. On the first day of the week, the day the Lord rose from the dead, and that is the sole authority for Sunday observance. But that does not give authority to say the Lord's Day is the Sabbath.

The Chairman—Yes, sir; after the changing . . . the day the Lord rose was the first day after the resurrection.

Dr. Johnson has no authority for saying any day after Christ was manifested constituting the main purposes, "for the record says it was "after six days" and not after seven days, and for worship; since they said "for fear of the Jews"; and the next appearance was eight days later, for the sake of the unbelief of Thomas, not to institute a Sabbath. The chairman, that the American Sabbath itself, prays for the fair in the Lord Jesus Christ to close—not the gates of the Fair—with his cholera scourges, the plague for a desecration of the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, because "he has doomed his Sabbath." It is desecrated—how? By its being opened on Sunday, which is declared to be the Christian Sabbath—by the authority of "a few of these persons being observed as days of religious worship after the resurrection," but all in the face of the direct command of God, beginning with the Fourth Commandment, the greatest of Sinai, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

Once more. Here is the consistent testimony of the two most prominent publications in favor of the best essay on the Sunday question, "Our opponents . . . we are not satisfied . . . we must have a well-grounded reason, otherwise we stand convicted," (Nos. 1, p. 175, 1877).
