WHILE early all classes are excited and the preachers are eagerly demanding the Fair be kept closed on Sundays and for fear that it will convince open, the observers of the Sabbath of the Lord quietly notes the significance which will surely illuminate great truth on this great question; and on the seventh day while the thousands are enjoying the beautiful things at the Fair grounds and many other Christians are introducing the busy streets, to give themselves and undisturbed to his humble worship. The Seventh-day observers worship in different colors of things. The name of the people that responsibly keep his doctrine on the seventh day. The Sabbath of the Lord is a great institution, one of the oldest of God Himself. . . .

Of the Sunday immediately following his Sabbath of rest, he goes quietly (as everybody else) out to the Exposition to view some of the wondrous works of God, or he is washed up and down from an ocean of labyrinths of wonders, he can but simply praise his Redeemer God whose hands made them all.

He is greatly surprised to see no one drinking nor drunkards, which Sunday closing advocates are so knowingly afraid of. And he is not less surprised to see neither oneself nor hear any riotous doings anywhere and the greatest. All is peace, quietude. He is surprised and comprehends how and in what the greatest concern of the pleasure in seeing others enjoy the entertainment with every manifestation that they do not choose to be there himself. The foregoing were no pretentious thoughts in Chicago on Sabbath and Sunday, they at last said.

JOHN C. ROAMS.
