THE closing by government of public exhibitions on Sunday is an injustice to the people that can readily be seen by anyone who will carefully consider the question. Secondly has this become recognized, that recently not only the leading museums, art galleries and libraries of England are open on Sundays, but those in many towns of continental Europe, and others in provincial towns opened on one day, is merely one of the many illustrations of vagaries of Sunday legislation. One thing however is evident, and that is, that it is unfair to close these institutions, which are supported by the people, on the only day when the majority can view them; and by the working classes it is largely deprived of serving of benefit that which they can find to keep it open; not merely their right, but because in such institutions the people have just as much right to attend church; and the one class has no more right to close the institutions and to deprive the others of their freedom of action than the other class has to close the churches, and so deprive many of their privileges. So teaches the Golden Rule of Jesus. It works both ways.

That the opening of such would increase some compulsory labor and much extra expense is no valid reason for closing the Fair without any hesitation in fact. Facts show that their attendance of worship is much larger, and those who attend are more orderly and require less police supervision than on the days where slain. Take for example the two Sundays already since the opening of Sunday at the World's Fair; had these people been turned loose on the streets of Chicago the results would have been very different. In England a picture gallery that an attendance of ten thousand in four hours only required five willing attendants, whose only "labor" is to walk about. The following from Professor Fowler, Director of the London Natural History Museum, is to this point:

I am glad to say that the majority of the trustees are in favor of opening the museum, and personally I am strongly in favor of such opening. Many of them are so reasonable as to say, let us give them a chance, and take them turn at attending, even without extra salary, preferring such occupation to inaction and weariness. Others, we write ladies or do any of the usual and innocent amusements of the people until the day is spent for nothing. Some prefer going to a museum for a few hours, and then walk back again. People who think this can be done without work, like taking a walk somewhere else; so that they say their attendance is no religious exercise. As a matter of fact, a few men go on guard and attend the rooms in turn would only fall on each man perhaps once in every eight, instead of having a Sunday off to come up in the court at half an hour.

And all such places that can be easily kept on Sunday are worked on the same plan, and the attending workmen, while having a full day off during the week. All this can be done by proper management, and done in not in any way oppress the workers or deprive them of their liberty.

Even a correspondent to the Christian *World* makes the following admission in regard to the People's Palace, which is open Sunday:

We looked in one Sunday to see and judge for ourselves. . . . It struck us at once that things were being run with admirable efficiency and a good business-like and close and sharp management. All was very orderly and quiet, and the visitors were being paid to the various items of a thoroughly British entertainment. We marked the quiet and solemn faces. The arrangements were excellent for sight finding. The total number of visitors was, we were told, fifteen thousand, including a large number of women, girls, and children. . . .

The novelist, Walter Besant, writes—

There is no more beautiful, no more religious thing than to see the People's Palace on Sunday morning—between church and dinner, at the time when the respectable do nothing but rest, or walk. There is nothing which more raises the soul of the working lad than to look upon beautiful things. It is not only the soul of the adult that is kept in touch. There is another kind of soul, starved, and wretched, and miserably sad, wearied, and worshipped, and this personage is our growing youth of both sexes. When two gentlemen have a host of sympathy and instinct, for both holds that this Sunday pleasure places their craft in danger. So a resolution was passed denying the opening of such places to be "detrimental to religion."

Mr. Besant continues—

No. There is no sight more beautiful still at this time, than a visit to the free reference library on the Sunday evening. They are quiet, self-educated men and women. They are not in company: they are fitting their minds with opportunities for their children. Never is such a class so serious. And anyone who refuses them this in the name of what they call religion, would send these men and women out into the streets, where they would have no opportunity of resisting the evil the ranks of the fallen, and to subject the children to the very same temptation.

Yet this is the very thing the Sunday law bigot is striving to do. He would rather have them quite unseldom thrown up, and the young turned adrift, where all have everywhere best at his religious affairs. By these people thus spending Sunday at the Fair in harmless, no rightful claims of others infringed; those who believe Sunday keeping to be right steps aside on their way, and go to meet those or even know of those extra religious exercises. According to their own testimony, and the only faith that can be truly genuine, is one that is given freely.

That is what it ought to be. When religion, and good morals are really promoted, then law-enforcing crusade is found to come, and we have simply been a matter of the grossest intolerance; and that the efforts of the people are not so much in the interest of morality and godliness as they are in the interest of the ecclesiastical combination.

FRANCIS HOPE.
