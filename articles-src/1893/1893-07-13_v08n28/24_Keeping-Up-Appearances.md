"AND king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon." 1 Kings 10:16, 17.

"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them into the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house. And it was so when the king went into the house of the Lord, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber."

It would hardly be possible for words to constitute the history of a great many churches than that just given. Rehoboam suffered the loss of the golden shields which his father had laid up, so he had a plan to make a pretension with brass. Perhaps he persuaded himself that brasen shields were as good as golden ones. No doubt they did look as well if they were kept well rubbed up; but nevertheless the value was not there. In the same way many people who have had a real experience in the religion of God, and who have allowed Satan to rob them of their treasures, have substituted the brass of formal profession for the pure gold of faith. And they make as good a show, but they themselves sometimes know, and others soon discover, that the value was not there. The enemy had come in and carried off the substance, and gold. We will not attempt to rob our of its lesson so relating for gold. That is all one can do so much better a time when we achieve Christian realities and dispensation in a mere form.

But the case of Rehoboam with his brasen shields is most exactly paralleled by those who make their boast that they offer definitely to "the faith of our fathers." Doubtless their father had golden shields of a real and true faith; but faith is something which cannot be transmitted from father to son, and those who pride themselves on believing just what their fathers believed, are for the most of merely sounding brass.

This is the case with the "historic churches." Men formulate creed, and their followers are exhorted to believe what the founders believed, and still more to fight for the faith previously held though they did not believe. The result is that they do not have the faith which the founders had. They have the words, but not the reality. As brass that while it has a more dazzling shine than gold, so State religion, whose basis is that "historic" environment, exhibit a dazzling ceremonial without the substance.

Though we seek our father's precious, we have but brass.

To be true to Christ and State while we are honest is more than contentious, better not be boastful.

God will care for his own; and though error and apostasy seem to be triumphing, faith takes victory with God.—*Signs of the Times.*
