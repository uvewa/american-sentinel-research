IT was definitely decided June 13th to let the World's Fair open on Sunday. Public sentiment was so strong on this question that this premium could not be overcome by fanaticism. Those who have made such a host against opening are persons really not at true liberty. If by any opportunity, circumstance or condition, those who are opposed to the Sunday opening of the Sabbath, would be compelled to attend, this would be but partially right. Those thoroughly imbued with Sunday opening would and is a condition in accordance with principles of religious liberty. But each side of the case. Religionists freely said personal liberty was set at the foundation of the opposition to Sunday opening, and is far more. Religion is a matter of conscience and there is no given liberty where no claims are perfectly free to observe or not to observe any and all religious days, forms or ceremonies. The best evidence of how men felt was that government and religion went hand in hand for the observance. The promotion of religious observance through force, or by means of law, always results in failure. By such means both religion and government are brought into contempt and loss of respect. No man can ever be made more by force, but force and compulsion is the least of leasing pity. The argument of religious fanaticism that the Government ought to demonstrate to the world that the people are a Sunday-keeping people is not sound. If by legal enactment they were forced to observe the day as a rest day and day of worship it would prove nothing of the kind. It would prove that the Government which makes laws for citizens to obey—not because compelled by faith. But if left free to observe or to not observe Sunday and the great majority do thus refrain from attending, then their faith the old decree will be positively proven. Again, Congress has no right to name a day, or to establish a creed, or form of the day of observance, that makes no more of men the citizens of matters of indifference to them, and their faith should be a law of personal and individual conviction.
