ALL Sunday laws are religious legislation. Common sense tells us that if we are under any obligation to keep Sunday as a Sabbath day, it is a religious obligation, and that only. For in the nature of things, from a secular standpoint, we are under no more obligations to our neighbors to refrain from work on Sunday than on Monday. The United States Constitution says in the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

There can be no other meaning to this than that each citizen shall have a right to believe in, and act out any religion he may see fit, or no religion if he chooses. Again, Article 14, constitutional amendment says: "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."

Now when any State makes any law in regard to religion and enforces it on any citizen of the United States, that State is violating the Constitution in two points. First, in making an unconstitutional law, and second, by enforcing an unconstitutional law.

If Congress and our different State legislatures can do this thing in open violation of the Constitution, not only of the United States, but of nearly every State in the Union as they have done, where is our liberty? Can they not with the same propriety prohibit free press, free speech or any other right which the people hold dear as life? Not only this, but the National Reform Association knows full well that all such legislation is in open violation of the Constitution. For as before stated, they have been clamoring for the last thirty years for a change in the Constitution so they could legislate on such religious questions. So they know now when asking for Sunday laws that they are unconstitutional, and they are asking our law-makers to make laws that are contrary to law; and then while lobbying in our Congress, howl anarchy at those who oppose such lawless legislation.
