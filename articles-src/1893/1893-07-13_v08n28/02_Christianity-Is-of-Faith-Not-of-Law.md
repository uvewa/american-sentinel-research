CHRISTIANITY is of faith, not of law. "For whatsoever is not of faith is sin." And "Christ is the end of the law . . . to every one that believeth." "If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain." "Therefore by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin." "But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, . . . even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe, for there is no difference."
