The advocates of a State-bolstered Sunday never tire of picturing the unhappy condition of California without a Sunday law; but occasionally some one whose testimony they dare not discredit, tells the truth about California, much to the discomfiture of the "Civil Sabbath" theorists. In his book, "The Sabbath for Man," Mr. Crafts states it as a foundation principle that a "nation cannot be preserved without religion, nor religion without the Sabbath, nor the Sabbath without laws," but according to Mr. Crafts' own testimony, Sunday—which Mr. Crafts calls the Sabbath—is preserved in California without law.

In 1885 Mr. Crafts published his book, in which he relates that in order to obtain a world-wide view of Sabbath observance, he corresponded with more than two hundred persons residing in nearly every nation of the world. One of the questions which he asked was:—

> Where have you seen the best Sabbath observance?

To this, a San Francisco pastor responded:—

> Among the Christian people of California.

Mr. Crafts' question and the San Francisco pastor's answer to it are found on page 95 of his book before referred to. On the preceding page occur these words:—

> Both laymen and ministers say that even in California the Sabbath is, on the whole, better observed and Christian services better attended than five years ago.

"Five years ago," from the standpoint of 1885, was three years before the repeal of the California Sunday law. Therefore, taking into consideration all that Mr. Crafts said upon this subject, we concluded that according to testimony published in his own book, California had in 1885, when the State had been without a Sunday law for two years, better and more general Sunday observance than it had under a Sunday law.

Nor have the conditions changed since that time. In 1890, five years after Mr. Crafts published his book, and seven years after the repeal of the California Sunday law, "Holloway," a correspondent of the New York Observer, wrote to that paper as follows, of Sunday observance in San Francisco:—

> True, there are some drawbacks here as there are in all the cities of our land. Attractive as the city is, and in its main features very desirable as a place of residence, yet the good people who have come from the East regret the absence of some things with which they have always been familiar. There are no Sabbath laws in California and no recognition of it on the statute books of the State. Labor of all kinds can be carried on without hindrance, about may remain open for the transaction of business as on any other day of the week, places of amusement may be open without interference from the authorities, while noisy demonstrations can go on as usual. But while there is the absence of all Sunday laws we must not draw the conclusion that there is no respect paid to the Lord's day. Truth compels us to state the fact that San Francisco is a Sabbath keeping city. The drift is plainly in that direction. The moral sentiment of the people is largely in its favor, and with very rare exceptions you will find as much order and quiet in the streets as in some of our most favored Eastern cities. Those who knew California twenty years ago, now witness a far different order of things. The mass of the people respect and keep the Lord's day. No merchant of any respectability keeps his store open on the Sabbath. The wharves are deserted. The Italian fruit dealers in many localities close up their places of business, and even in the Chinese quarter of the city there is some recognition of the fact that this one day calls for a regard to decency and order, if not for religious reverence.

According to "Holloway," Sunday work and business was in 1890 on the decrease even in the largest city in California, instead of being on the increase as it would have to be to sustain Mr. Crafts' theory that a day of rest cannot be maintained without law. But how is it in other parts of the State, and at the present time—ten years after the repeal of the Sunday law? The Observer furnishes us at least a partial answer to this question also. In "Editorial correspondence from California," in the Observer of June 29, 1893, "Augustus" says:—

> We were at Pasadena on Easter Sunday. Sunday dawned bright and mild, and by ten o'clock the streets were full of people on foot, on horseback and in wagons and carriages from the surrounding country, going to the churches. Presbyterian and Methodist and Baptist and Episcopal, all large and handsome houses of worship, were thronged with people, and during the services a New England Sabbath stillness pervaded the place.

> This Sabbath was well kept at Pasadena, and all the churches were places of spiritual rest and joy.

The fact is, that if the people in any given community want to keep Sunday, or any other day, they can do it just as well without law as with it; and if they do not want to keep it no amount of law will compel them to do so. The theories of the Sunday law advocates and the facts do not harmonize any better in California than they do in New York, where less regard is paid to Sunday with a Sunday law than there is in San Francisco without any such law. It is too bad that the "best people of the country" cannot get into line with truth.
