*Chicago, July 4.*

THERE is no real satisfaction to any true American patriot or well-instructed Christian than in the opening by the Board of Directors of the World's Fair on Sunday. It is what the AMERICAN SENTINEL and the *Times* have contended for from the first. What we have contended for from the beginning is that the United States Government had no business to legislate in the matter. The question was a religious question, legislation upon which is forbidden, by the Constitution. The Supreme Court by its previous interpretation upon the First Amendment which directed the principles of the Supreme Court interpretation to practice by defining religious controversy and establishing Sunday as the Sabbath as far as an earthly government could do it; and in that act Congress, at the behest of its devoted partisans, committed this Government to religious legislation.
