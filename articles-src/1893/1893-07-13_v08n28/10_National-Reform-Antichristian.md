REGARDING the earnestness and sincerity of National Reformers, their works speak. But that they are sincere and earnest on the wrong side of this issue we firmly believe. That Sabbath breaking, irreverence, vice of every description and super-absounding iniquity is everywhere prevalent and increasing are matters of divine prediction as well as obvious facts. But National Reformers instead of helping them are increasing iniquity. They are not working in Christ's way. Note the following:—

1. They claim that civil government has the right to enforce morals, by which they mean and say God's law "God is a spirit, or spiritual," and his "law is spiritual." (See John 4:24; Rom. 7:14.) But civil government can take account only of overt acts, while moral or spiritual matters pertain to the heart and motive. God's law is not obeyed unless it is obeyed from the heart. He who looks upon a woman to lust after her is in God's sight a transgressor of the seventh precept of his law. Matt. 5:27, 28. He who hates his brother is a murderer. 1 John 3:15. None but those whose hearts are renewed by God's Spirit can keep the law. Love alone can secure obedience to the law of love; but civil law can neither produce love nor compel obedience to the law of love. It will compel men by torture and otherwise to say that they are obedient and loyal, but it cannot make them so; it only makes them slaves and hypocrites.

Civil government can compel men to be civil; it can do no more. When it attempts to enforce morality as embodied in God's law, it is worse than a failure; it produces hypocrites, mocks God and makes a farce of his religion.

2. When government attempts to enforce morals, it must have some tribunal to say what the true standard of morals is. Shall the State decide it? or shall the church? And if so, what church? The tribunal which does this assumes to speak for God. And by what right has any human tribunal to exalt itself to God's throne? Who has delegated to humanity the right to decide any one's duty to God? The power which God foresaw would attempt to so speak for him, he calls "the man of sin," "the mystery of iniquity," "that wicked." 2 These, 2:4-6. The principles of God's truth are ever the same. The profession of a church does not change its character; and any church or confederacy of churches, any man or set of men, any government whatsoever, which will attempt to enforce what it may call God's laws, upon the consciences of others, will become by that very act a part of the mystery of iniquity.

3. All that any set of men can enforce as Christianity is simply and only their conception of what Christianity is. They set up their puny opinion of Christ for what Christ is. They crystallize that opinion into law, and say, "See what Christ is, what he requires of you." This is all Rome did in her bloodiest days. It was always for God and his church, God speaking through his church to the governments of the world and to the people. But millions of "the whitest of the saints of God" have died as heretics by the hand of those who thought they were doing God service.

4. Christ's name in the Constitution would not make it Christian any more than it makes a man Christian so call him so. Worse than this, it presents to the world all the inequalities, the injustice, the imperfections and the iniquities of the government as of Christ. It professes his name and denies him by works. He sends out his ambassadors, his Spirit, to persuade men to submit to him and find peace, but the government which professes his name in its fundamental law seeks to compel men to do God's will. Thus did Rome and the "Christian" governments which owned her sway. They counted those who died at their hand heretics; but how did God count them?

5. That the interpretation of God's law by earthly governments would be contrary to that law is evident from the present attitude of our Government on the Sabbath question. The fourth commandment of the Decalogue, which National Reformers wish enforced, does unmistakably and obviously enjoin the observance of the seventh day, and thousands of first-day observers believe this to be so, and thousands of other Christians so believe God in this respect as to obey just what he says. But the government in its self-appointed vice-gerency declares that Sunday is the Sabbath; and National Reformers wish law to enforce the day still more rigidly, regardless of those who oppose, who are as conscientious as they, and who realize accountability to God as fully, but who also hold that civil government has no power to enforce religious, spiritual or moral obligations.

But to those very principles the Government has already committed itself, and we would have no hope, judging from the history of the past, that its steps will be retraced. We know from the Word of God that they will not be. But to God alone men are responsible.

In the language of Lowell:—

> Though we break our father's promise, we have nobler duties first;
> The traitor to humanity is the traitor most accursed;
> Man is more than constitutions; better rot beneath the cod
> Than he true to Church and State while we are doubly false to God.

God will care for his own; and though error and tyranny seem to triumph, ultimate victory rests with God.
