"And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon." 1 Kings 10:16, 17.

"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak, king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all; and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed them into the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house. And it was so, when the king went into the house of the Lord, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber." 1 Kings 14:25-28.

In these passages of Scripture there is contained the history of a great many people's experience. Rehoboam had suffered the loss of the golden shields which his father had made, but he kept up appearances with brass. Perhaps he persuaded himself that brazen shields were as good as golden ones. No doubt they did look as well, if they were kept well rubbed up; but nevertheless the value was not there. In the same way many people who have had a real experience in the things of God, and who have allowed Satan to rob them of their treasure, have substituted the brass of formal profession for the pure gold of love and faith. It made as good a show, but they themselves were conscious, in spite of themselves, that the value was not there. The enemy also knows the difference between brass and gold. He will not attempt to rob one of his brazen substitute for gold. That is why one has so much easier a time when he allows Christian reality to degenerate into a mere form.

But the case of Rehoboam with his brazen shields is more exactly paralleled by those who make their boast that they adhere closely to "the faith of our fathers." Doubtless their fathers had real faith, and held much truth. But faith is something which cannot be transmitted from father to son, and so those who pride themselves on believing just what their fathers believed, are the possessors of merely sounding brass.

This is the case with the "historic churches." Men formulate creed, and their followers are careful to believe just what the founders believed, and still more careful not to believe anything which they did not believe. The result is that they do not have the faith which the founders had. They have the words, but not the life. As brass will make even a more dazzling show than gold, so State churches, whose boast is their "historic" succession, exhibit a dazzling ceremonial in place of the substance.
