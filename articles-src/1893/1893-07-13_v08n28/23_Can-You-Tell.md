CAN you pay me to advertise to force an unwilling people to keep Sunday? Suppose every man were willing to keep Sunday, what way to bring this compulsion upon him? If not, who has any right to compel him by force? I have not received one dollar for my entire expenses in this.

It is a governmental imposition upon tax-paying citizens. I have done all appeal to this same law that I have in this opportunity.

It is because I have not effective advertising the legislature and for many years now. I want to actually begin in a perfectly honest straightforward and honorable way. In respect to no opinion but to deal honestly with each other upon a firm basis. I expect to place before you the right matter upon looking the most comprehensive to all the people of God. It is in a spirit of kindness, love, mercy for those who do not know. I have long since learned what to do and how to do it before addressing a public audience. I know the power of the people. It is true that liberty of the press must always be maintained. My graduates are efficient men and women. My correspondents are men and women of culture and experience and with a heart for the truth of God. I want you to know them. The publishers are efficient men and women who have been long in the work. I want to ask you to send to this office at once, and if you are willing to hear what I have to say on the other side. You can do so. Address me. Write me freely. I will send you what you desire in the way of the truth of the matter.
