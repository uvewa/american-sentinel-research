THE United States having failed in its attempt, through the courts, to secure the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the enforcement of the Sunday closing proviso attached to the World's Fair appropriation, Ex-Postmaster Gen. Wanamaker, through the corporation name, Wanamaker & Brown, has begun a suit asking for an injunction against the Sunday opening of the Fair. This suit was heard June 29, by Judge Jenkins of the United States Circuit Court. Also, Edwin Walker appeared for the Seventh-day Adventists, and for A. H. Brown, Gen. Green B. Raum, of persons connected with the Corporation; and D. McKinnon Cleland, and Commissioner Massey for the United States Government; an injunction was based on the representation that they were stockholders in the Columbian Exposition to the amount of $5,000 and that their interests were jeopardized, and the values of their stock depreciated, by the action of the directors in opening the gates on Sunday; and held that the Sunday opening was in violation of law, their remedy only lay in obtaining an injunction which should require the directors to comply in all things with the provisions of the law.

For Wanamaker & Brown, of the complainants, filed a brief and asked Judge Jenkins to inquire what law was meant. Counsel Burns then read from the converted coin act, upon which the Judge remarked that he did not call this a law, but that it was a gift upon a condition, and while the condition had been violated, no law had been broken. As the case was brought upon strictly equitable legal grounds, there was very little scope for the expression of moral and religious sentiments. Nothing was urged to bear upon the matter with any force, except the charge that it was the moral sentiment of the people of this country revolted against the outrage of the Sunday closing proviso attached to the souvenir appropriation. Judge Jenkins reminded him that that was a phase of the question that had no bearing upon technical points raised in the pleadings.

The entire forensic was occupied in the consideration of this matter and the case was adjourned for Attorney Walker against the World's Fair corporation, Cleland, Raum, and Commissioner Hundley, for Wanamaker & Brown. Judge Jenkins took the case under advisement and will render his decision July 5, 1893.

The public has taken to interest what it really is in this case, it being universally understood and being told that the foundations of the matter by the Court of Appeals have been disturbed, that appropriate action may be taken in the premises. The National Reformers think that during this week, despite all the attempts which have been made to close the Sunday opening, if not greater, results in the furtherance of the cause of legal action, and the importation of observance of religious forms have been actualized greatly, by the present condition of things, that would have been gained had the Fair been strictly closed in the terms of the proviso of the appropriation attached to the souvenir coin passage. They themselves, of course, do not see this fact. They are in a measure conscious of what it is that is likely to secure their purposes in securing the strict religious observance of the day according to what they consider a correct and Christian standard. The fact must be told in the face of these things, the nature of man, of natural biblical history, the nature of prophecy, and of all things, although they are not aware of it. They should know that the only thing they can possibly accomplish is a superstitious religious observance. They know this fact. This is no increase. This is increase, all that ever will be, will be compelled to the making in the matter of true religion. No one can be truly religious that is compelled by the influence of a body of religionists. And in this connection it is well to notice the progress of every other attempt to compel the observance of a day, in the history of the whole world, upon all who should attend. The attention was this in the interest of religion, for the observance of a day apart by religious good feeling. And these acts of Congress have not been respected, but failing in respect to it the experience is a clear one. Those who had taken upon this plan that the needs of the effort to a greater degree by opening to the spiritual course, the people and the Congress and the body of religionists, and the Congress of the United States, by these experiences decided that the people and the Government would be benefited most by reverently respecting a certain day apart. And their Fair management surprised that they read from the time of the World's Fair management, at large, and certain courts of the United States, have decided that these same religious convictions and reverential feelings will be better observed by an entirely open course. According to their own admissions those experiences were the result that the body of religionists, and the people, and the World's Fair corporation have found the most effective way through which religious teachings are improved to be respected.

A particular example of this was given last Sunday in the observance of "Patriotic Sunday," in Festival Hall on the Fair grounds. The past week the chaplains of the United States army have been present at the Art Institute and one or the series of congresses belonging to the World's Fair Congress Auxiliary. Last Sunday they had charge of the services at the Fair grounds. The hall was partially filled with a scattered assembly. Upon the platform were gathered army chaplains, and behind them were the Indian boys and girls from the Lincoln Institute at Philadelphia. The exercises were opened by the bugle call of the "Assembly." After prayer and reading of the Scriptures, two brief addresses upon the topic of "American Institutions" were made, after the singing of "America," and the exercises were closed by the bugle call of "Retreat," sounded by a captain of the regular army, who also led the singing.

And when the last trump shall sound "taps" and the whole Sunday movement is closed down to their test, those Sunday advocates and those Sunday soldiers of the cross shall have marched their last march, the most surprised people in these United States of America.
