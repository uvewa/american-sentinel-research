THE advocates of a State-bolstered Sunday seem yet to be utterly blind to the condition of California without a Sunday law. And this notwithstanding their own testimony they dare not disregard, is in denunciation of the "Civil Sabbath." Let them read the following:

"Five years ago," from the standpoint of 1865, was three years before the repeal of the California Sunday law. Therefore this "Holloway" Sunday and work business was in 1890 or some years that has been extended, instead of being on the increase as it would be if we to maintain. "Col. Croft's theory that a day of rest cannot be maintained without law." "But how is it that in other parts of the State, and the interior of a whole community, after the repeal of the Sunday law?" The Observer furnishes us at hand a partial answer to this question also. In "Editorial correspondence from California," the same issue of June 15, 1893, "Argentina" says—

"There are no stanzas or signs of Sunday violation visible. . . . The streets were full of people on foot, on horseback, on bicycles, and some in carriages, going to the churches. Freshly cleaned, and well dressed, the passengers were dressed in their Sunday best, the churches were thronged with people, and during the services a beautiful stillness pervaded the atmosphere and all the churches were places of spiritual rest and worship.

The fact is, that if the people in any given community want to keep Sunday as an other day, they can do it just as well without as with law. If they do not want to keep it no amount of law will make them do so. So the theory that the Sunday law advocates and the facts do not harmonize any better in California than they do in New York, where the records is paid to Sunday with a Sunday law than there is in San Francisco without any such law. It is too bad that the people of the country can't be let alone with truth.

Where have you seen the best Sabbath observance?

To this, a San Francisco man said—

The Christian people of California.

Dr. Crafts—Mr. Crafts quoted the San Francisco pastor's answer to it; it was found on our streets the best observance of any class.

The preacher could not suppress these words—

Mr. Crafts—Best observance despite the law of the Sabbath is on the whole, better observed here than in States that are under the influence of Sunday law.

"Five years ago," from the standpoint of 1865, was three years before the repeal of the California Sunday law. Therefore his taking and considering all, the contrast is clearly with California. And Mr. Crafts said upon this subject, in his argument for a National Sunday law, and published in his own book, *California church* having had a Sunday law for two years last session, and had Sunday greater Sunday observance than with a Sunday law. And under a Sunday law.

Yet these are the conditions that have existed since that. In 1890, five years after Mr. Crafts has taken up his arguments, the *New York Observer*, wrote to that point as follows, of Sunday observance in San Francisco:

Yes, there are some draw-backs here as there are in every city. . . . San Francisco is a cosmopolitan city, and in its main features very desirable as a place of residence. Religious people who come here are
