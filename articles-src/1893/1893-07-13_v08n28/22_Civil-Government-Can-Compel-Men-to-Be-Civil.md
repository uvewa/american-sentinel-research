Civil government can compel men to be civil; it can do no more. When it attempts to enforce morality naturally as embodied in God's laws, it is worse than a failure, it produces hypocrisy, mocks God and secures a form of his religion, not a force.

2. When government attempts to enforce religion, it must have some definite form to say what the true standard of morals is. Shall the State decide it? or shall the church? And if so, what church? The tribunal which does that assumes to speak for God, and to establish itself as his authorized tribunal to exact fidelity to God? But who authorized the State or the church the right to decide any one's duty to God? The power which God bestows would not tempt one to speak for him, he calls "the man of sin;" "the mystery of iniquity," "that wicked." 2 Thess. 2:4-6.

The principles of God's truth are ever the same; the professions of a church does not change the characteristics; and any church or confederacy of churches, any man or set of men, any government, ecclesiastical or political, which will attempt to enforce what it may call God's laws, upon the communities of others, will destroy by that very act, as Christianity is simply and only their profession of Christianity; exactly as did Rome in the Dark Ages. Because men set up their very opinion of Christ for what Christ and his true religion may clearly come into law, and say, "One that is all Romans did in four bloodiest days. It was always for God and his church, God speaking through his church to the government of the world and to the people. But millions of "the witness of the saints of God" have had a fearless testimony of those who thought they were doing God service.

We would not make it in Christianity any more than Rome and the "Christian" government would it not be. Would not make it, because that would be to say that the imperfections and the injustice of the government of Christ. If professors see the nature and deeds done by their laws, he sends out his ambassador, his Spirit, in persuasion, to submit to him and give them peace, but they encountered with the phrase that same in the fundamental law made to compel men to do God's will. Then did Rome and the "Christian" governments which owned her say, "Don't persecute the people," what would have been the result? how did God react then?

We assert that a religion that would be by earthly governments would be contrary to his that living before the supreme audience of our Government on the Sabbath question. The fourth commandment of the Decalogue, which National Reformers well endowed, clearly and substantially and vigorously enforces the observance of the seventh day, and thousands of first-day observers believe this to be so, and thousands of other Christians so believe God in this respect as to obey just what he says. But the government in its self-appointed vice-gerency of Christ substitutes Sunday for the Sabbath; and National Reformers with law establish this, and enforce it rigidly, regardless of those who oppose, who see as consciencious as they are, and realize accountability to God as fully, but who also hold that civil government has no power to enforce religions, spiritual or moral obligations.

But to those very principles the Government has already committed itself, and we
