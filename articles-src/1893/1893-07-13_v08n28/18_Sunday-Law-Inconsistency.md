THE advocates of a legal Sunday are never consistent. In the first place, the Mail and Express, while denouncing Sunday papers, employ reporters to gather news on Sunday for the Monday paper.

Another inconsistency is in the way they talk about the World's Fair. The Mail and Express of the 3rd instant says:—

> Another Sunday at Jackson Park has added additional emphasis to the glaring fact that the holding of the show on the people's day of rest does not have the sympathy of the people. Only 47,754 persons paid admissions inside the gates, and 2,414 of this number were children, who entered at half rates. Those who came to the Exposition saw but little of it; in fact, but few of the visitors made an attempt to see the displays in the grounds proper.

It would appear to anybody other than a National Reformer that the fact that on Sunday twenty-eight State and thirteen national buildings are closed, and a large number of individual exhibits are covered, is sufficient reason why the people do not go to the Fair on that day. They are charged full price for considerably less than half the show, and it is not strange that the working people, especially, who know the value of money by knowing what it costs, refuse to pay fifty cents merely for the privilege of paying additional fees to the various side shows on Midway Plaisance.

It is very evident that the slim Sunday attendance is no index of the sentiments of the working people relative to Sunday closing. Nor does it indicate a general regard for the day. Let the same conditions prevail on any other day of the week, and who cannot see that the attendance would be even smaller than it is on Sunday? Sunday opening may be a failure, but not because the people have so much regard for the day; it is because only a small part of the Fair can be seen on that day, and nobody cares to pay for looking at closed buildings and covered exhibits.

By securing the closing of so many buildings and the covering of so many exhibits on Sunday, the National Reformers have made it impossible for the working people of Chicago to see the whole Fair without the loss of a day's wages in addition to the entrance fee; and now for them to assume that because the people do not rush to the Fair on Sunday by the hundreds of thousands is in perfect keeping with the assumption that the day is sacred, and that to go to the Fair on it is sin.
