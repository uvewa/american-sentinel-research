OF THE REMARKABLE TELEGRAM SENT TO THE PRESIDENT, May 27, by Joseph Cook, W. F. Crafts and A. H. Plumb, demanding that troops keep the Fair gates closed on Sunday, the Evangel and Sabbath Outlook says: "The tone and spirit of this Christian (?) message to the chief executive is more nearly allied to the Spanish Inquisition than it is to Christ's Spirit, or to the gospel of peace. It sounds like the insane raving of men, who, having played a loosing game, reach for their 'hip pockets' for arguments. It is well if Christianity can be saved from such defenders. When 'Sunday-closing,' or any measure which Christians urge in the name of religion, must be attained at the point of the bayonet, Christ and the gospel of peace are relegated to a far distant 'back seat.'"
