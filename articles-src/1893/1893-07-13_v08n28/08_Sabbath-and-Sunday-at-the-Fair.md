WHILE this vexing question of closing up the Fair on Sunday is filling the minds of the people and the columns of the papers and agitating the brains of the preachers, it is very interesting to spend a Sabbath and Sunday in Chicago.

At this period of the contention the subject is the common topic on the cars, on the street corners and in restaurants as well as around the family circle. The preachers maintain their same old position, determined to accomplish their end against all reason and common sense, while the masses of intelligent men and women demand the privilege of seeing the Fair on this most favorable day. I heard an influential capitalist say—and he repeated it with indignation—"The preachers are united with saloon-keepers and keepers of ill-famed houses for the purpose of catching the people."

While nearly all classes are excited and the preachers are angrily denouncing the Fair for being open Sundays and for fear it will continue open, the observer of the Sabbath of the Lord quietly notes the agitation which will surely disseminate the truth on this great question; and on the seventh day while many thousands are enjoying the beautiful things at the Fair grounds and many other thousands are thronging the busy streets, he goes unmolested and undisturbed to his humble place of worship to commune with his God.

On the Sunday immediately following his Sabbath of rest, he goes quietly (as everybody does) out to the Exposition to view some of the wondrous works of God. As he wanders up and down those avenues and labyrinths of wonders, he can but praise the beneficent Creator whose power has made them all.

He is greatly surprised to see no drinking nor drunkenness, which Sunday-closers have so confidently affirmed would be rife. And he is no less surprised to neither see nor hear any riotous doings anywhere within the gates. All is peace and quiet; and I cannot comprehend how any man but a maddened bigot could fall to find pleasure in seeing others enjoy the ennobling atmosphere of the Sunday Fair, if he does not choose to be there himself.

The foregoing were my experiences and thoughts in Chicago on Sabbath and Sunday, June 17 and 18, 1893.
