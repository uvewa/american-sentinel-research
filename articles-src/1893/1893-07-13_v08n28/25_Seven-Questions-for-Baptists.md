*Dear Brother—I am a Baptist and a Methodist, to call your attention to the following, as a reasonable review of your points in your history, which it seems to me is logically and fairly open to you to consider:—*

1. When did God specially raise up the Baptists and the first coming of our dear Lord as the Baptists' own testimony?

2. When has God especially said to hold on to the light of truth, as Christ desired them, from the days of John the Baptist to 1845, and for that time only?

3. When did God call them his chosen and peculiar people?

4. What body of Christians in the world, since the days of the apostles, comes nearest to our world-honored national Christian organization? And that if they listen to us the precious religious convictions that we have sailed to our shores—to obey them?

5. Who was it, that, in 1841, God especially called to bring the great proclamation of the Sabbath to the attention of Christendom, which messages powerfully shook America and Europe—causing them to look for the second coming of Christ, as there was not at that time any such announcement from empire to empire?

6. What body of Christians, who next to the Baptists hold and practice most closely the distinctive principles of the Baptists?

7. Where, in the Scriptures, do we find that Christ or any of his apostles ever kept Sunday, or ever gave any authority for keeping Sunday instead of the Sabbath of the Lord?

E. J. DRYER.
