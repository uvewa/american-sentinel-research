ALL Sunday laws are religious legislation. Common sense tells us that if we have not any obligation to keep Sunday as a Sabbath day, it is a religious obligation. Common sense tells us that if it were, things, from a secular standpoint, we are not bound, religiously. No man ought to be compelled to refrain from work on Sunday more than upon any other day. The National Constitution says in the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

There can be no other meaning to this than that each citizen shall have the freedom, in faith, and act any religion he may desire, or be religious or be irreligious. Again, Article XIV constitutional amendment says: "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."

Now why any State makes any law in reference to Sunday at all, any more than any other day, if it is at the dictation of the religious class, and if it is upon religious grounds, the whole procedure and the law itself is in direct and flagrant violation of the Constitution, and this, in two points. First, in making an unconstitutional law, and second, by enforcing an unconstitutional law.

If Congress and our different State legislatures can do this thing in open violation of the Constitution, not only of the United States, but of nearly every State in the Union as they have done, where is their boasted free government? One day yet will be when the people properly predict that Jesus, free speech, or any other right which the people hold dear. Not only this, but the National Reform Association knows full well that they are working in direct and open violation of the Constitution. For as before said, these leaders have stated that for the last thirty years for a change in the Constitution so that they can handle the much religious questions. So they know now when asking for Sunday laws that they are unconstitutional, and that they are asking our lawmakers to make laws that are contrary to law; and their lobby actions in our Congress, governments and States, those who oppose anti-Sunday legislation.
