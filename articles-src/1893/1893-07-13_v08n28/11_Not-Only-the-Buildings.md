"not only the buildings but also Jackson Park."

"I look upon the move as high treason against God's divine government and the accepted laws of the land, and in this respect I voice a half-million people of Indiana, of whom a large per cent. will abandon their attendance at the Fair, if its gates are open on the Lord's day."

"Your tenth request—"

"And that the Prohibition Party of Iowa, in State convention assembled, do most emphatically protest against such action [the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday], and that we ask President Cleveland in the use of the power vested in him to enforce the law of Congress to prevent such opening; also, we enter our indignation against the Government of the United States."

"In Wisconsin, when the mayor of the place refused to prohibit a prize fight on the Sabbath, the governor ordered the troops to take possession of the stages and grounds, and bayonets prohibited pugilism. Let our Federal President command order. Let . . . President Cleveland order the U. S. troops to guard the gates of the Fair, already closed, and keep them closed if need be."

By an evidenced presented in these cases, it is as plain as A B C to everybody that Christianity and the Sunday are two entirely different and separate things. The one is Christianity, the other is not Christianity; and each one or the other is destruction. These are the two ways; which way are you in favor?
