THE tract society at Topeka, Kan., desires clean SENTINELS, late numbers, for missionary work. Address, Mrs. E. Holaway, 609 Kansas Ave., Topeka, Kan.

Orders come per month of $1.50 per year at a royalty, but it stated as follows: Magazine publishers said at 753 and 755 Broadway, that their annual output of 300 magazines and a number of which is just out, look "more valuable" to us now—than just "sentinelian" than most popular publications of the period. "The Fair"—with "Attractions with Dr. Holmos" and "The Elect to the World's Fair," etc., were worth many times the price of the July number.
