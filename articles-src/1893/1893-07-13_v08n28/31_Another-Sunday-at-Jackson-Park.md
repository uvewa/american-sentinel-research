ANOTHER Sunday at Jackson Park has added still tidings to explain the plain fact that the holding of the show on the people's day of rest does not have the sympathy of the people. Only 67,394 persons paid admission inside the gates, and 3,141 additional free admissions to the grounds as against more. Those who came to the Exposition are but from the immediately surrounding locality. It is significant of how small an attendance do attempt to see the displays in the grounds proper.

It would appear to anybody other than a National Reformer that the fact that on this Sunday twenty-eight State and thirteen national buildings are closed, and a large number of individual exhibits are uncovered, is sufficient reason why the people do not go to the Fair on that day. They know that the buildings are closed; and less than half the show, and it is not strange that the working people, sensible people, who know the value of money by knowing what it costs, refuse to pay fifty cents money for the privilege of paying additional fees to the various side shows on Midway Plaisance.

It is very evident that the slim Sunday attendance is no index of the sentiments of the working people relative to Sunday closing. Nor does it indicate a general regard for the day. Let the same conditions prevail on any other day of the week, and who cannot see that the attendance would be even smaller than it is on Sunday? Sunday opening may be a failure, but not because the people have so much regard for the day; it is because only a small part of the Fair can be seen on that day, and nobody cares to pay for looking at closed buildings and covered exhibits.

By securing the closing of so many buildings and the covering of so many exhibits on Sunday, the National Reformers have made it impossible for the working people of Chicago to see the whole Fair without the loss of a day's wages in addition to the entrance fee, and now for them to assume that because the people do not rush to the Fair on Sunday by the hundreds of thousands it is in perfect keeping with the assumption that the day is sacred, and not to go to the Fair is in the nature of worship.

On the remarkable telegram sent to the President, May 27, by Joseph Cook, W. F. Crafts and A. H. Frank, demanding that troops keep the Fair gates closed on Sunday, the *Recorder* and *Sabbath Outlook* says: "Any time and effort by a Christian (!) message to the chief executive is more nearly allied to the Spanish Inquisition than it is to Christ's Spirit, or to the gospel of peace. It sounds like the insane raving of men, who, having played a losing game, reach for their 'six-pookers' for argument. Is it well if Christianity can be saved from such defenders. When Sunday-closing or any measure which Christians urge in the name of religion, must be attained at the point of the bayonet, Christian and the gospel of peace are relegated to a far distant class."
