THE Sunday movement is altogether force and not of faith at all. They worked steadily for thirty years to get a national Sunday law, and everywhere they had power in State Sunday-laws where there are none, and the rigid enforcement of them with increased penalties where they already exist. This is entirely a part of the political daily history and the public records of the whole country in the last few years that no particular quotation is needed; for all know that it is so. Their whole cry is, "Law, law, law," and for "the salvation of the Nation."
