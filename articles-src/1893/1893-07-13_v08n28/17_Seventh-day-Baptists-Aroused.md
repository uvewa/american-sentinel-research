THAT the Seventh-day Baptists are becoming aroused to the duty of the hour as never before in the history of this country, is evident from the tone of their papers. The Evangel and Sabbath Outlook is doing valient service for liberty of conscience; and even the Sabbath Recorder is catching the spirit, and seems to realize that the battle is joined. On another page we publish a ringing appeal to Baptists by a correspondent of the Recorder. Let the good work go on until every Sabbath keeper in the world is fully aroused and joins in exposing the claims of the false Sabbath, and denouncing the usurpations that are practiced in behalf of a man-made institution.
