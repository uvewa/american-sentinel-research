*Resolved*, That we do hereby pledge ourselves and each other, that we will, from this time henceforth, refuse to vote for or support for any office or position of trust, any member of Congress, either senator or representative, who shall vote for any further aid of any kind to the World's Fair, except upon conditions that it be closed on Sunday. *

"If temporary injunction is impossible to-day, let proclamation and troops hold gates closed until obtained." †

"The First United Presbyterian Church of Boston, distributed from its directory and communion, appeals to you to suppress selling milk, prohibit saloons, Sabbath-breaking farmers, and to guard the gates next Sabbath with the troops, if necessary." ‡
