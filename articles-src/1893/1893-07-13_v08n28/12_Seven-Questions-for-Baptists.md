Dear Brethren:—Allow me, a converted Methodist, to call your attention by the following questions, to some important points in your history, which it seems to me logically call upon you to keep pace still with the advancing light:

1. Whom did God especially raise up to herald the first coming of our dear Saviour?—John the Baptist.

2. Whom has God especially used to hold up the light of truth on Bible baptism, from the days of John the Baptist to our own?—The Baptists.

3. Whom did God bring to America in 1631, and who for daring to advocate true Christianity and religious freedom, was banished from the colonies in 1636, and afterward died in Rhode Island about 1683, a holy man and a Christian patriot?—A Baptist, Roger Williams.

4. What body of Christians did God especially use to introduce the First Amendment to our world-honored national Constitution, which amendment has secured to us the precious religious liberty enjoyed by us, and by the people of all nations who have sailed to our shores?—The Baptists.

5. Who was it, that in 1844, God especially used to herald the great proclamation of the second coming of our Saviour, which message powerfully shook America from ocean to ocean, and Europe also from empire to empire (for there was not a missionary station on the globe where the second coming of Christ was not preached)?—A Baptist farmer, William Miller.

6. What Christian body has God especially used for more than one thousand eight hundred years of the history of the Christian Church—yea, from the cross of Calvary to the present hour, to hold up before the God-forgetting world the light on the question of the Bible Sabbath?—The Sabbath-keeping Baptists.

7. Finally, whom does God especially call to-day to stand in the gap, teaching the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and restoring to its God-appointed place the hallowed day of his own rest?—You, the Baptists.

Dear brethren, are we able to drink of the cup, and be baptized with the baptism?

"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, . . . and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."

—Chas. E. Sturdevant, in the Sabbath Recorder.
