THERE is no real satisfaction to any true American patriot or well-instructed Christian in the opening by the Board of Directors of the World's Fair on Sunday. It is no real satisfaction to the Signs of the Times. What we have contended for from the beginning is that the United States Government had no business to legislate in the matter. The question was a religious question, legislation upon which is forbidden by the Constitution. But the Supreme Court placed an interpretation upon the First Amendment which virtually annulled it, and Congress reduced the principles of the Supreme Court interpretation to practice by deciding a religious controversy and establishing Sunday as the Sabbath so far as an earthly government could do it; and in that act Congress, at the behest of the churches, committed this Government to religious legislation. The independence, avarice, or defiance of a few local directors (to whom the matter really belongs) will not alter the status of the case, nor undo the evil work of Congress. Nothing will undo this evil work but a total and absolute repeal and repudiation of all Sunday legislation on the part of Congress. But will Congress do this?—No; the body is too much under the control of the churches. This Government has taken her first steps in the path of the Papacy, according to the prophecies of God's Word, and the inevitable results will soon follow.
