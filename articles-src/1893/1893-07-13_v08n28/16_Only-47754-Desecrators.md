Is it only paying admission to the World's Fair that constitutes "desecration" of Sunday? The Mail and Express seems to think so, for in its issue of July 3, it says, "Only 47,754 desecrators," on last Sunday; yet it presently tells of 16,385 free admissions to the grounds on the same day, making the total number of visitors 64,139, including, evidently, from the details given, at least one reporter for the "leading evening paper," the only great and original religious daily, whose "piety" consists in advertising Piper Heidsieck Sec, and demanding Sunday laws for other people.
