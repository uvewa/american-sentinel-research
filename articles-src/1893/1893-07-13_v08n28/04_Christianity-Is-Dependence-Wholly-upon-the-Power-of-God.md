CHRISTIANITY is dependence wholly upon the power of God, manifested through Christ, by his Spirit alone; not upon the power of man, manifested through government, by the sword or the bayonet. "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth." "Your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." "Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men." "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds." "And I will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses nor by horsemen." "This is the word of the Lord, . . . saying: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts."
