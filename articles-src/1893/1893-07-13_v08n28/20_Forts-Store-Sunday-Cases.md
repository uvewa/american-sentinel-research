JUST AS WE ARE CLOSING UP THIS NUMBER OF THE SENTINEL, WE ARE INFORMED FROM FORT'S STORE, Md., that the case against Hettie Mansfield, arrested for sewing on Sunday, failed, owing to the non-appearance of the witnesses for the State. July 3, Mr. Geo. W. Marvel was tried, and though none of the witnesses would swear that the work done was not a "work of necessity," he was promptly found guilty. The other case, that of Mr. Atwood Bryan, was taken under advisement for one week.
