NEGOTIATIONS are said to be in progress looking to a union between the Greek and Roman churches, so that the Pope will be "the head of both." "And all the world shall worship him [the papal beast, Rev. 13:8], whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
