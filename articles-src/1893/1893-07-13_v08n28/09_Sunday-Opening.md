It was definitely decided June 25th to keep the World's Fair open on Sundays. Public sentiment was so strong on this question that the pressure could not be overcome by fanaticism. Those who have made such a howl against opening are perfectly free not to attend. If, by any possibility, circumstance or condition, those who conscientiously uphold the sanctity of the Sabbath, would be compelled to attend, and their liberty of conscience thereby interfered with, Sunday opening would not be in accordance with the principle of religious liberty. But such is not the case. Religious freedom and personal liberty were not at the foundation of the opposition to Sunday opening, but the reverse. Religion is a matter of conscience and there is no religious liberty unless all are perfectly free to observe or not to observe any and all religious days, forms or ceremonies. The doctrine of Christ himself was that government and religion were, or should be, separate and distinct. The promotion of religious observances by legal enactment cannot result otherwise than in failure. By such enactments both religion and government are brought into contempt and lose respect. No man was ever made pious by force, but force has the effect of lessening piety. The argument of religious fanaticism that this Government ought to demonstrate to the world that its people are a Sunday observing people, is not sound. If by legal enactment they were forced to observe that day so far as the Fair is concerned, it would prove nothing of the kind. It would be said that they observe the day because compelled by law. But if left free to observe, or not observe Sunday, and the great majority do then refrain from attending, that they hold the day sacred will be positively proven. Again, Congress had no right to name a day, a religious day, to be observed. That is religious legislation. Many Christians hold that Saturday is the Sabbath, and they have all the proof, from a Bible standpoint, on their side. Sunday was a heathen festival day, incorporated into Christianity to hold those sun-worshipers who became Christians, and who would not agree to give up their day. It was a concession to heathenism—a compromise day. When Congress took it upon itself to decide which is the proper day for Christians and all others to observe and keep holy, it went considerably out of its latitude and over-leaped the boundaries laid down by the Constitution. There will be one bad result, however, of Sunday opening. The Presbyterians will withdraw their exhibit. This will very probably crush the Fair! Whenever a religion pleads with government to put legal props under its structure, it is an acknowledgment that religion is greatly in need of those props—that it can no longer stand of its own strength. If, however, it were true that props were needed, they would do no good if put up by legal enactment for the reverence, that solidifies the structure, would vanish, and it would then the sooner tumble to ruins. Religious fanatics, in connection with this World's Fair Sunday question, have, in the undue and intemperate zeal of religious blindness, done the cause of Christianity and Sunday observance irreparable damage. Their fanaticism has injured the cause they pretended to espouse. The better class of Christians opposed all legislation to mix religion and government; that is, they contended that government has no right to establish a creed, or form or day of observance; that matters of this kind are matters of individual conscience, and that conscience should be free. That is the true principle of civil and religious liberty.
