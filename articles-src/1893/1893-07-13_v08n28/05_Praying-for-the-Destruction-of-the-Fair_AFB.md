It has been repeatedly intimated by representatives of the Sunday closing movement that the judgments of God might be visited upon the World's Fair, or even the whole Nation, as a punishment for opening the Fair on "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." These parties have suggested tornadoes, cyclones, and even the dreaded cholera as a very possible retribution.

These suggestions are not direct prayers for disaster, although the suggestion that God might visit his wrath upon the Nation by means of these calamities, is evidence that such punishment in the mind of the predictor, ought to be visited, and that if they were God, they would sweep the land with the bosom of destruction.

However, suggestions have now developed into actual prayers for vengeance as appears from an article from the pen of Rev. Wm. Weir, one of the editors of the Christian Statesman, which organ is the mouth-piece of the American Sabbath Union. The following is the quotation referred to, and may be found in the Christian Statesman of June 24:—

> Six months hence we will be able to declare the doings of the Lord as we cannot now. Let us wait and see if the Lord Jesus Christ hath not doomed the Fair that has doomed his Sabbath.—Arise, O Lord, plead thy cause.

A just paraphrase of this American Sabbath Union petition would read as follows: "Arise, O Lord, doom the Fair; doom it with a cyclone, with flames, flood, or famine, or with the deadly plague, only doom it."

Why doom the Fair? Forsooth, because it "has doomed his Sabbath." How has it doomed his Sabbath? By its being opened on Sunday, the first day of the week, in violation of the command which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

One of the strange things in connection with the history of religious persecutions, is that the persecutor has invariably persecuted his victim for non-conformity with a dogma for which there was no scriptural support. This modern persecution for a so-called "desecration of Sunday" is not an exception. That the Sunday-closing representatives admit the absence of a scriptural command for Sunday observance, the following will show. In "Pearl of Days" leaflet (No. 3), a publication issued by the American Sabbath Union, and written by a vice-president of the Union, we find the following sweeping admission:—

> Our opponents declare, "We are not satisfied with these inferences and suppositions; show us where the first day is spoken of as holy, or as being observed instead of the seventh; we must have a direct and positive command of God." We admit there is no such command.

And yet in the face of this fatal admission, the organ of the American Sabbath Union publishes a petition of one of its editors, imploring the Lord Jesus Christ to "doom" the Fair because it is open on the first day of the week.

Again, in leaflet No. 3, published by the department of Sabbath observance of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, edited by Mrs. J. C. Bateliam, also one of the editors of the Christian Statesman, we find the following:—

Question 6.—If Jesus wished the day changed, why did he not command it?

Answer.—A command to celebrate the resurrection could not wisely be made before the resurrection occurred. He probably gave his own disciples such direction afterwards, "when speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom."

According to their own admission, there is but a "probably" in support of Sunday sacredness, and yet the United States troops are petitioned for, to shoot down the Sunday visitors at the Fair, and the Lord Jesus Christ is asked to reak vengeance upon the Fair because it is open on the first day of the week!

Again, the following dialogue took place between Dr. Herrick Johnson, another American Sabbath Union representative and an ardent Sunday closer, with Mr. Blair, before a Congressional committee, having a bill for a national Sunday law under consideration:—

Mr. Johnson.—I think that no one who accepts the Bible doubts that there is one day in seven to be observed as a day of rest.

The Chairman (Senator Blair).—Will you just state the authority?

Mr. Johnson.—Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work.

Chairman.—Is there any other?

Mr. Johnson.—There are references to this law all through the Bible.

The Chairman.—Now you come and change the Sabbath day to which the Lord refers.

Mr. Johnson.—That we hold was changed by the Lord himself.

The Chairman.—When did he do that and by what language?

Mr. Johnson.—There was a meeting for worship on the first day of the week, the day the Lord arose, and seven days after there was another meeting for the same purpose, and then it is referred to as the Lord's day.

The Chairman.—After the change?

Mr. Johnson.—Yes, sir; after the change.

The Chairman.—It is based, then, upon two or three days being observed as days of religious worship after the resurrection?

Mr. Johnson.—Yes, sir.

Dr. Johnson has no authority for saying "seven days after there was another meeting for the same purpose," for the record says they met "after eight days," and then not for worship, since they met "for fear of the Jews." But granting that all this be true, for the sake of argument, we have the American Sabbath Union praying for the Lord Jesus Christ to "doom" the Fair with the cholera scourge, the deadly cyclone, or some other dire calamity, because "it has doomed his Sabbath" by keeping open on the first day of the week, which is declared to be the Sabbath, upon the authority of "two or three days being observed as days of religious worship after the resurrection;" and this too, in the face of the direct command of God, uttered with his own voice, amid the awful grandeur of Sinal, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

Once more, Rev. A. E. Waffle, who won the one thousand dollar prize offered by the American Sunday School Union, for the best essay on the Sunday question, has this to say upon the same subject (pp. 186, 187):—

> "Up to the time of Christ's death, no change had been made in the day." And, "So far as the record shows they (the apostles) did not, however, give any explicit command enjoining the abandonment of the seventh day Sabbath, and its observance on the first day of the week."

Again we call attention to the petition of the American Sabbath Union for divine vengeance upon the Fair, because it is open on the first day of the week!

These fatal admissions might be multiplied indefinitely, but these are sufficient to base a petition to the American Sabbath Union, asking them to postpone further appeals for retribution, at least until they find some direct command of God pronouncing a curse upon innocent amusements and instructive exhibits enjoyed upon the first day of the week.

If a lack of time is pleaded as an excuse, it is suggested that Father Enright, of Hartford, Kansas, will generously remunerate them for the time expended. In the Hartford Weekly Call of February 18, 1883, Father Enright published the following challenge which he has repeated frequently since that time:—

> The Bible commands you to keep the Sabbath day. Sunday is not the Sabbath day; no man does assert that it is; for the Bible says, as plainly as words can make it, that the seventh day is the Sabbath, i.e., Saturday; for we know Sunday to be the first day of the week. Besides the Jews have been keeping the Sabbath unto the present day. I am not a rich man, but I will give one thousand dollars to any man who will prove by the Bible alone that Sunday is the day we are bound to keep.

Less praying for the Lord Jesus to doom the Fair because it is open on Sunday, and more biblical research is now in order.
