JUST as we are closing up this number of the SENTINEL we are informed from Fords Store, Md., that the case against Hattie Mansfield, arrested for setting on Sunday, failed, owing to the non-appearance of witnesses to the alleged offense. Mr. Geo. W. Marvel was tried, and though none of the witnesses would swear that the work done was not a "work of necessity" he was promptly found guilty. The other case, that of Mr. Arood Ryas, was taken under advisement for one week.
