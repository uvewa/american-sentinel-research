CHRISTIANITY is freedom of choice, not compulsion. "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not." "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life." "Whosoever will may come." "Come unto me all ye that labor . . . and I will give you rest." "Let us reason together, saith the Lord." "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve."
