THIS Sunday movement is dependence wholly upon the power of man, manifested through law and by force alone; not upon the power of God manifested through Jesus Christ by his Spirit.

"What is it we want to do here in this land? It is to compel" the question that is perplexing the supporters of the Sabbath. — "From present appearances relief can be looked for only at Washington."

"In this third fight . . . Attorney-General Olney . . . with . . . President Cleveland, must be our chief reliance." *

In a Sunday-law speech made in the Baptist Church, Cortland, N. Y., Sunday afternoon, June 18, 1893, "Rev." Addie A. Albion, State Secretary of New York, said: "In all the contests the right arm of power is the executive; . . . the President of the United States, the Governor of a State, the sheriff of a county, the mayor of a city, are the ones in whom executive power is lodged."

To Hon. GROVER CLEVELAND,

"Dear Sir: As God in his providences now gives you the highest office in the United States, we appeal to you in this Godless endeavor to destroy the friends of God and of good government and the union and the power of diviness and the mission of our Christian American Sabbath on the other, to use all the power that has been delegated to you in the position you now hold, to keep and to close the gates of the World's Fair on its Sabbath."
