Chicago Correspondence.

THE United States having failed in its attempt, through the courts, to secure the Sunday closing of the World's Fair and the enforcement of the Sunday closing proviso attached to the World's Fair appropriation, Ex-Postmaster Gen. Wanamaker, through the corporation name, Wanamaker & Brown, has begun a suit asking for an injunction against the Sunday opening of the Fair. This suit was heard June 30, before Judge Jenkins of the United States Circuit Court. Attorney Edwin Walker appeared for the World's Fair; and for Wanamaker & Brown, Gen. Green B. Raum, of pension office notoriety, Major C. H. Blackburn, D. McKinzie Cleland, and Commissioner Hundley. The plea of the petitioners for an injunction was based on the representation that they were stockholders in the Columbian Exposition to the amount of $5,000 and that their interest was jeopardized, and the value of their stock depreciated, by the action of the directors in opening the gates on Sunday; and, holding that the Sunday opening was in violation of law, their remedy lay in obtaining an injunction which should require the directors to close on Sunday and comply with the provisions of the law.

The continual reiteration by the counsel, for Wanamaker & Brown, of the phrase, "enforcement of the law," led Judge Jenkins to inquire what law was meant. General Raum then read the souvenir coin act, upon which the Judge remarked that he did not call that a law, but that it was a gift upon a condition, and while the condition had been violated, no law had been broken. As the case was brought upon entirely technical legal grounds, there was very little scope for the expression of moral and religious views and sentiments, or to bring them to bear upon the matter with any force. When General Raum remarked that the moral sentiment of the people of this country revolted against the evasion of the Sunday closing proviso attached to the souvenir appropriation, Judge Jenkins reminded him that that was a phase of the question which had no bearing upon technical points raised in the pleadings.

The entire forenoon was occupied in the consideration of the matter and the court was addressed by Attorney Walker, for the World's Fair corporation; General Raum, and Commissioner Hundley, for Wanamaker & Brown. Judge Jenkins took the case under advisement and will render his decision Friday, July 7.

The public has taken no interest whatever in this case; it being universally understood and believed that the decision of the matter by the Court of Appeals would supercede all other action which may be taken in the premises. The World's Fair is open seven days in the week, despite all the attempts which have been made to close it by law; yet equal, if not greater, results in the furtherance of the cause of legal religion and the superficial observance of religious forms have been attained possibly, by the present condition of things, than would have been gained had the Fair been strictly closed according to the terms of the proviso and the expectation of those who secured its passage. They themselves, of course, do not see this fact. They are in a measure ignorant of what it is that they themselves purpose to accomplish. They are clearly unaware of the impossibility of securing the strict religious observance of Sunday in this or any other country from a correct and Christian standpoint. They seem to be blind to the fact that in this, history, the nature of man, biblical teaching, and prophecy, are all against them, although they are not aware of it. They should know that the only thing which they can possibly accomplish is a superficial and hypocritical veneer of pretended religious observance. This they have gained. This in an increasing degree, is all that they ever will gain, and its progress is marked in the matter of the Sunday opening of the World's Fair. Impelled by the influence of a body of religionists, Congress committed itself to the attempt to compel the observance of a religious form at the World's Fair and upon all who should attend it. The action was taken in the interest of religion, for the observance of a day set apart by religions belief and feeling. That action of Congress has not been respected, but in failing to respect it the opposite course has been taken upon the plea that the same interests would be better subserved, and the needs of religion be met in a greater degree by opening than by closing. The case now stands, that as one body of religionists, and the Congress of the United States under its influence, had decided that the people and the Government of this country must religiously and reverently respect a certain day by a particular form of observance, the World's Fair management supported by the people at large, and certain courts of the United States, have decided that these same religious interests and reverential purposes will be better subserved by an opposite course. According to this, the World's Fair is open on Sundays, and sacred music and religious addresses are presented there for the benefit of the people, and the World's Fair corporation becomes, one day in the week, a medium through which religious teaching is supposed to be presented to the people.

A particular example of this was given last Sunday in the observance of "Patriotic Sunday," in Festival Hall on the Fair grounds. The past week the chaplains of the United States army have been assembled at the Art Institute as one of the series of congresses belonging to the World's Fair Congress Auxiliary. Last Sunday they had charge of the services at the Fair grounds. The large hall was partially filled with a scattered assembly. Upon the platform were gathered army chaplains, and behind them were the Indian boys and girls from the Lincoln Institution at Philadelphia. The exercises were opened by the bugle call of the assembly, and the audience arose and sang "America." After prayer and reading of the Scriptures, an address was delivered by a captain of the regular army, who closed by saying:—

> And when the last trump shall sound "taps" for all the nations of the earth, our flag will still be there, borne sturdily aloft amid the wreck of matter and the crash of worlds by the veterans of the Regular Army and Navy Union of the United States of America.

The audience then sang, "Nearer My God to Thee," and the bugler sounded "taps." Addresses were also delivered by Chaplain Bateman, of the United States army, and Dr. Akins, president of Duval's Veteran Cavalry Association. The services closed with the "Star Spangled Banner," and the benediction by Chaplain Allen Allensworth.

The superficial, national, Christianity which is now in vogue throughout the country, and continually growing in the favor and acceptance of larger numbers of American citizens, was extremely well exemplified by "Patriotic Sunday" at the Fair. Although apparently in antagonism to the interests and views of the religious element of the country which considers itself orthodox, and is striving for the legal enforcement of religion, the religious exhibit of the Regular Army and Navy Union of the United States of America at Festival Hall, did not differ in purpose or effect from the general movement for a national religion. It was indeed rather a perfected result, in small measure, of the attempt to nationalize a form of religion. It was an example, in little, of the preaching and practice of national religion. Those who have sought so earnestly, and fought so bitterly, to close the World's Fair gates on Sunday, would indeed be surprised to find their plans and wishes better served by its opening than by its closing. It is not at all improbable that they will find this to have been the case.

Chicago, July 3.
