# Uncertainties — v08n28, July 13, 1893

## Masthead Associate Editors Names

- **Location:** Page 1, masthead
- **Issue:** The associate editors are listed as "CALVIN F. BOLLMAN" and "WILLIAM N. MUKER." The known editors are C. P. Bollman and W. H. McKee.
- **Second pass:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "CALVIN F. BOLLMAN" and "WILLIAM N. MUKER" — preserved exactly as OCR output
- **Confidence:** LOW — These are almost certainly OCR errors for "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" (though his first name is usually given as just C. P. Bollman) and "WILLIAM H. McKEE" (McKee, not Muker). However, per project rules, these were preserved exactly as they appear in the OCR. The masthead file reflects this as-printed text.
- **Note:** Articles authored by W. H. M. (article 03) confirm McKee as associate editor; his article is attributed WHM per known author list.

## Article 05 — Author Surname

- **Location:** End of article "Praying for the Destruction of the Fair," Page 4
- **Issue:** Author is printed as "A. F. BALLINGER." The known author in the list is A. F. Ballenger (AFB).
- **Second pass:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "A. F. BALLINGER" in body of article; attributed to AFB (A. F. Ballenger) in YAML
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "Ballinger" vs. "Ballenger" is likely an OCR or printing variant. The initials A. F. and the context of the article strongly match A. F. Ballenger. However, the article body preserves the name as printed.

## Article 06 — Quotation Anomaly

- **Location:** Page 4, "Closing Places of Interest on Sunday," Walter Besant second quote
- **Issue:** The phrase "There is one eight more beautiful still" appears to be garbled — likely "There is one sight more beautiful still" or "one thing more beautiful still."
- **Second pass:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "There is one eight more beautiful still" — preserved exactly as OCR output
- **Confidence:** LOW — "eight" is almost certainly an OCR error for "sight" or "thing." Preserved without correction per project rules.

## Article 08 — Author Initials

- **Location:** Page 5, "Sabbath and Sunday at the Fair"
- **Issue:** Author given as "J. OEL C. ROGERS" — this is not a known contributor.
- **Second pass:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Author name preserved as "J. Oel C. Rogers"; attribution set to explicit with author field populated; author_short left blank as initials are unclear.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — Name appears to be a genuine external contributor, not a regular Sentinel staff member.

## Page 2 — Footnote Numbering

- **Location:** Page 2, bottom
- **Issue:** The OCR shows "¹ Letter printed in Christian Statesman" and "² Wilbur F. Crafts' speech..." as footnotes. A third footnote marker "³" appears in the body text referencing Wisconsin/troops, but was listed as "†" in the original article on page 1. The OCR mixing of footnote styles (†, ¹, ², ³) suggests the original used a mix of symbols and numbers.
- **Second pass:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Footnote markers preserved as they appeared in OCR output for article 01.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Page 3 — Running Header

- **Location:** Page 3 header
- **Issue:** OCR shows "VOL. 8, NO. 25" in the running header area for page 2, which should be No. 28. This is an OCR artifact from the running header and was excluded from transcription.
- **Second pass:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Not transcribed (correct issue number 28 used throughout)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — This is clearly a misread of the running header; the cover page and page 4 header both correctly show "Vol. 8, No. 28."

## Article 10 — Poetry Transcription

- **Location:** Page 6, "National Reform Antichristian," Lowell verse
- **Issue:** Line 3 reads "better rot beneath the cod" — likely "sod" not "cod."
- **Second pass:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "better rot beneath the cod" — preserved exactly as OCR output
- **Confidence:** LOW — "cod" is almost certainly an OCR error for "sod." Preserved without correction per project rules.

## Page 8 Date Header

- **Location:** Page 8 header
- **Issue:** OCR shows "NEW YORK JULY 13 1993" — year should be 1893, not 1993. This is an OCR artifact from the running header and was excluded from transcription.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — Simple OCR error; the correct year 1893 is used throughout.
