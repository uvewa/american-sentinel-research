THAT the Seventh-day Baptists are being accused on account of the duty of the home of their country, is evident from the tone of their papers. The *Recorder* and *Sabbath Outlook* is doing valiant service for liberty of conscience; and the *Sabbath Recorder* is catching the spirit, and seems to realize that the battle is joined. On another page we publish a ringing appeal to Baptists by a correspondent of the *Recorder*. Let the good work go on until every Sabbath keeper in the world is fully aroused to defend and maintain the claims of the false Sabbath, and the denouncing the usurpations that are practiced in behalf of a man-made institution.
