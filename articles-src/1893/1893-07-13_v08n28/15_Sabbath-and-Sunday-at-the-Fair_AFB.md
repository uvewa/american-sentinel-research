WHILE this week the question of closing the gates on the Sunday opening at the Fair, the people and the columns of the papers and agitating the brains of the preachers, it is very interesting to spend a Sabbath and Sunday in Chicago.

give any explicit command requiring the observance of the seventh day Sabbath, and the observance of it is for the Bible and the Bible alone, on the fourth command given at Sinai, at the hands of God himself. If it is proper for the government of human law to command that all persons shall abstain from labor on the first day of the week, it is equally proper that government by human law shall command the observance of the Sabbath, the seventh day.

Again we call attention to the petition of the American Sabbath Union for divine vengeance upon the Fair, because it is open on Sunday.

These facts of admission might be multiplied, but enough has been cited to show that to issue a petition to the American Sabbath Union, telling them to implore Godfathers for retribution, at least until they find some direct command of God pronouncing a curse upon innocent amusements and instruction activities enjoyed upon the first day of the week.

If a lack of time is pleaded as an excuse, it is suggested that Father Enight, of Kankakee, Kansas, will generously make some remarks for the time expended. In the *Hartford Courant* of May 18, 1893, Father Enight published the following challenge which he has repeated frequently since that time:—

The Bible commands me to keep the Sabbath holy. Nowhere does the Bible command me to keep Sunday. I recognize the authority of the Bible. The Seventh-day Adventist must be, and is, I say, a Saturday, i. e., Saturday; for we know Sunday is not the Sabbath. I am a poor and ignorant man, and I do not consider myself competent to discuss this question. I am not a rich man, but I will give any Sabbath observance, besides what be to keep Sunday, that they cannot refute.

We are praying for the Fair because it is open on Sunday, and for more biblical observance.

A. F. BALLENGER.
