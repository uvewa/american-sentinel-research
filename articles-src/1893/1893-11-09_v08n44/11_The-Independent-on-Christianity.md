The *Independent*, of October 26, publishes an article by Lady Henry Somerset, with the title "What it is to be a Christian." In the article Lady Somerset, in speaking of the Christ's ministry, says, "it was as a perennial preacher as acknowledged, said, and a social anarchist; that Jesus was regarded by the cultivated and educated of his day," whose preaching was of idle appreciation which would do as had others before. Among the cultivated and refined, wealthy, powerful and worldly his words were always taken unworthy of credence. To-day, however, to be a member of the church means the opposite of all that Christ met with, home, love and honor, added reputation and business opportunities, a luxurious pew and a noble eulogy with which to depart in the odor of sanctity. "Christ's membership is now too often considered an excellent insurance, providing a basis of comfort and consideration in this world, and the freedom of eternal happiness hereafter." So Lady Somerset sees that there is an inconsistency here, but does she, and thousands others, the people to-day have not precisely the same pharisaical class in the nineteenth century that there was in the first? Is not the rich laboring under the same deceptions, guilty of the same and covering itself with the same cloak of religious profession? Are not those who constitute the popular church of to-day taking the same course as did the popular church in Christ's time? When he comes again will they be any more ready to receive him?
