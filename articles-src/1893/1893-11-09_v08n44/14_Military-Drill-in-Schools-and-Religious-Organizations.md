THERE is a movement on foot to give the pupils of the different high schools throughout the country a military drill and organization similar to that which is in vogue in the public schools of Washington, D. C., and some colleges, under an instructor detailed from the regular army. The Woman's Voice, of Boston, deprecates this as distracting the minds of the students from their studies, but says:—

> We agree most fully with those who believe a trained army should be in readiness to ward off the attacks of the Romanists who are drilling and preparing to take possession of the United States Government at no distant day. Doubtless these boys will be called on in the near future to defend the public schools, perhaps by force of arms.

So this is the purpose of all this organizing, is it? Are the promoters of the military organization of the Sunday school pupils and children of the churches looking forward to such exigencies as these also? It is time that the attention of the Peace Society was called to this matter. But, indeed, it is time that those who are promoting all this military organization in public schools, and Sunday school and church, and the dozen and one Protestant and Catholic societies, should be asked, and should ask themselves, what it is they mean, and what master they serve? whether it is the God of peace or the god of war!
