[Conclusion of a thesis by T. J. Van Horn of the University of Chicago.]

It remains to consider—

Third—The influence of puritanism on nineteenth century Christianity.

1st. Much of the rationalistic and skeptical tendencies prevalent in nineteenth century Christianity were set in motion by the inconsistencies in Puritan legislation. The fact that they made an unwarrantable use of the Bible in civil matters, their unfortunate theory that the Old Testament theocracy was the form of government for all people, at all times, and in all grades of development, this literalistic and rigid interpretation of all parts of the Bible, led to the opposite extreme in all these particulars. The influence of the Bible over the thought and lives of men has, consequently, been weakened and its authority questioned. Ellis, in his "Puritan Age in Massachusetts," has unconsciously furnished an illustration of this fact. He has made a study of Puritan legislation and exhibits strong tendencies to rationalistic thought. I quote his observation on the Puritan's conception of the Bible:—

> Duty, the object of life, and the Bible, its rule, was their rule. To most of them it was their only book. Buried long in an unknown tongue it came to them with all the freshness of a revelation, producing effects upon them very different from those mentioned upon a nineteenth century adult reader. We read the Bible in the light of commentators, who have established rules of interpretation well suited to the modern mind. This inconvenient passage is a figure of speech; this monstrous law condemning witches or idolaters to death was intended only for a special time; the teachings of the Saviour are not to be taken literally, for our society could not continue under such a construction: but the passages which conform to our ideas of right and propriety, which sustain our theological systems, and which enable us to live the life which is agreeable, whether they are found in the Old or New Testament, in the simple goppels or in the philosophical letters of St. Paul, have no figurative meaning and were meant for all time.

The extreme rationalistic method of treating the Bible, which we can see Mr. Ellis has in mind, in this subtle comparison between the Puritan and the modern system of Bible interpretation, is only a revolt against the stringent, literalistic method of the Puritans which everywhere crops out in their religious legislation. It is but a step from this to the entire repudiation of the Bible as a divinely inspired book, and the Ingersolism of to-day. It has been said that Christianity has suffered more from its professed friends than from its avowed enemies. Who will say that much of the skepticism and infidelity so prevalent in religious thought is a result of undue rigor in doctrine and discipline of the honest but mistaken friends of Christianity? How many of those lost in hopeless skepticism will testify that they were driven from the faith by the sombre and repelling aspects of Calvinistic doctrine and discipline enforced in their childhood home. How many have been all but attracted by the absurdities and inconsistencies read into the Bible by those who have studied it more to prove a doctrine or a theory than to find the truth.

2nd. The influence of Puritan legislation is observed again in the question of amusements which is one of the ever recurring topics in our religious gatherings and in Christian literature. To the Puritan, life was a solemn thing. They tried to impress this view upon all by their laws against popular sports and frowning upon pastimes of all kinds. Christian festivities, dancing about the May-pole on the village-green, were grievous offenses, and gaiety and lightness or any expression of exuberance of spirits, was out of harmony with the grave responsibilities of life. Mr. Gladden's illustration of a Highlander, walking through the streets of Edinburgh, who reported that he saw, on the Sabbath, men and women walking along the streets and smiling as if they were perfectly happy, and added, "It was an awful sight!" is in point here. Perhaps he is too severe in saying that "Every word otherwise than severely and sadly uttered seemed to pierce like a sword through them. If any man were pleased their manner was fervently with sighs to repeat those words of our Saviour Christ, 'Woe be to you that laugh now, for ye shall lament.'" This severe habit of looking upon life among the Puritans has left an impression upon Christian life and thought still discernible. The minds of men still living are haunted with the unhealthful restraints imposed in childhood against innocent amusement. Is it unfair to assume that the excessive indulgence in amusements among American people is the result of a reaction against unwise methods of restraint used in an earlier day? But even yet the world has not recovered from the feeling that Christianity is a sombre thing.

3rd. Again, turning our attention to the Christianity of to-day, it requires a microscope of no great magnifying power to detect elements of puritanism in our Sunday legislation. Attention has already been called to the fact that the colonial Puritans, no less than the English Puritans, felt especially called upon to protect and defend the sanctity of Sunday, and also that a large part of their legislation was directed to this end. Very early in the history of the Puritan movement in England the Sabbatarian controversy took an important part. The question involved was, whether the Jewish idea of the Sabbath, which they insisted upon, could be transferred to the first day of the week. The argument of Nicholas Bound, however, turned the tide of popular sentiment in favor of the view that a specific day of the week was not required in the Decalogue, and therefore Sunday might be observed as the Sabbath. A large minority, however, pointed out the inconsistency of this view. How much this fact may have influenced so much legislation to enforce respect for the first day of the week as a sacred day, I will not attempt to say. Certain it is that its influence in our times is evidenced by the laws enacted and printed in the statute books of nearly every State in the Union, and much of the puritanic intolerance has been exhibited in their enforcement.

Much has been said and written in our day to palliate the cruelty which was sometimes inflicted by the Puritans in the enforcement of their laws, as if such a thing were unknown among us. Yet, under the Tennessee Sunday law, four Christian men, in that State, in June of the year 1892, were imprisoned for working on Sunday. Three of these, after having been imprisoned forty-three days, were marched through the streets of Paris in a chain gang, and put to work shoveling on the common highway. Two years before this, R. M. King, whose case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, but suddenly terminated by the death of the defendant, was fined seventy-five dollars and costs for performing his usual farm work on Sunday.

Persecutions from a similar cause have arisen under the Sunday laws of Pennsylvania within recent years. Some of these cases would have aroused even in old Puritan Salem something of the indignation which arose upon the whipping of Obadiah Holmes. The inconsistency of imprisoning the Tennessee Christians for peaceably working their farms on Sunday was made more glaring by a train load of laborers passing, to their work, on successive Sundays, the place where they were imprisoned. In the minds of people disposed to be tolerant, the persecution of these men would seem the more inexcusable, since they were men who conscientiously observed the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath. Especially since the constitution of the State declares that—

> All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship.

It would not be difficult to show still further the injustice done to these men, and to point out the inconsistencies involved in the whole question of Sunday legislation. In this review we can learn at least one practical lesson. Shall it not be the old, and yet imperfectly learned lesson of religious liberty? The Puritans groped towards it, but blinded by their narrow and erroneous idea of maintaining, at whatever cost, their control of State, never learned it.

As we have seen, the dogmatism of thought revealed in their legislation; the cynical attitude towards amusements which their enactments engendered; in short, the fundamental error at the root of their legislation tended to break down all religious restraint and the higher idea of true religious liberty was obscured. All can see the fundamental error of the Puritan was in his interference by civil enactment, with that freedom of conscience which he claimed for himself. In the light of their history, the lesson should be plain to us. Yet what we have seen of modern Sunday legislation leads us to ask if nineteenth century Christians have not yet higher ground to reach with reference to liberty of conscience. The lesson seems yet imperfectly learned, that civil legislation cannot enforce respect for any day as a Sabbath; that if that respect is secured at all it must arise from the consciences of men, awakened and quickened by divine truth.

Even if it were wrong to work on Sunday, the Church is only increasing the distance, already too great, between it and the masses, by raising its voice in the name of religion for civil law to enforce rest on that day. "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." It is yet the sacred duty of the Church in the last decade of the nineteenth century to perfect the lesson begun and so imperfectly understood four hundred years ago,—Freedom of conscience and the complete separation of Church and State. To enthrone in the hearts of Christ's followers the true import of those words of the Great Teacher:—"My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight."
