THE objects of the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, as declared by its constitution, are three in number, although the article containing them masses them as one general proposition; first, to protect the common schools and "other American institutions;" second, "to promote public instruction in harmony with such institutions;" third, to prevent the use of public money for sectarian purposes.

THE league deals, then, with the State, the Church, the common schools, and "other American institutions," and it is its intent to promote the cause of the public schools "in harmony with such institutions," and to conserve the public funds solely for civil uses. Into this proposition there enters an unknown factor, "other American institutions" and "such institutions," which utterly destroys the possibility of any definite understanding of what the league intends to do, or what it may or may not do.

But, eliminating this unknown quantity and assuming that the purposes of the league are to protect the public schools, and to prevent the appropriation of public funds to sectarian uses, let us see what these two objects, viewed in the light one of the other, will require of those who espouse them. They will require an accurate discrimination between the sphere and authority of the Church, and the State; because the public school is a State institution, and sects and denominations are ecclesiastical.

WILL it follow from this, then, that the league has set itself to distinguish and follow the accurate line of separation between Church and State? It must come to this or adopt a subterfuge by claiming that funds may be appropriated for general religious uses, but not distinctively in the interest of any particular religious denomination or sect. But it cannot be denied in any reasonable use of the English language, and an understanding of its origin and growth, that the followers of Christ, professing the Christian religion, constitute the Christian sect among the different religious sects of the world. The league is, therefore, committed to the defense of a secular school and a secular State.

THE supposition, derived from this rational view of the objects of the league, is strengthened by the fact that under the auspices of the league a proposed amendment to the national Constitution has been offered in Congress, which applies the terms of the First Amendment to the Constitution, in reference to religion, to the States separately, with an elaboration specifically prohibiting the use of public money for or in behalf of any sectarian institution or organization. The adoption of this amendment, and its interpretation in good faith, would require of every State government what the Constitution requires of Congress a distinctively secular Government, without alloy.

It is true, that, adapting the words of the First Amendment to the national Constitution, this amendment which the league proposes reads, "No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," and then, with the pause of only a comma, runs right on to specify in legal terms the prohibition of the use of State money or credit for or in the interest of any church, religious denomination or society, etc. To claim that the broad and universal prohibition contained in the first two phrases are conditioned and restricted to the particulars which follow would be a subterfuge utterly unworthy of such as claim to be honest men and worthy citizens. Is it to be believed for one moment that Wm. Allen Butler, Rev. James M. King, and the many other gentlemen of this league whose names are even better and more favorably known in the legal, business, and religious world, would lend themselves to any such deceptive use of time honored language and expression of constitutional principle, as that would be? If they have not, this proposed amendment means what it says,—that every State shall be held to the same strict avoidance of the subject of religion in its legislation which the First Amendment to the Constitution imposes upon the Congress of the United States.

IN the nine questions, referred to at length, in the first article of the previous issue of this paper, as propounded by the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, to the delegates to the New York State Constitutional Convention, the first answers to this supposition fully, and is in complete accordance with the correct theory of the entire separation of Church and State; partially stated in the objects of the league, and unreservedly put forth in its constitutional amendment. That which is asked of the citizens of this State, in that question, is needed from every person in this country, a definite and intelligent defense of the "principle of the separation of Church and State," and a willingness to help in "securing definite constitutional safeguards to perpetuate the separation of Church and State," and also an active interest in "correcting the legislation which has arisen in violation of that principle." But having asked a question which presupposes, and requires, are pudiation of all Church and State affiliations, another is immediately put, in the second query, which would be totally unnecessary and cumulative, and which the questioner would have omitted, if the full scope of the first question had been intended or understood. The query to the candidate is, whether he is in favor "of preventing the application of public funds or property for the benefit of sectarian instruction." etc.

WHY should this question have been asked of one who had just answered the previous question, either affirmatively or negatively? There is no middle ground in this matter, it is either a separation of Church and State or a union of Church and State. The one who has just declared that he holds that the "principle of the separation of Church and State must be sacredly observed" can no more favor the use of public funds for sectarian or religious instruction than he can uphold the enforced reading of the Bible in the public schools; or the establishment by the State of a course of theological training as a requirement precedent to graduation from its schools; or the compulsory submission by private and parochial schools to a State supervision of the forms of theology which may there be taught. To ask this question, immediately after one that comprises all of which this is but a small part, either supposes that the person who is being questioned is so ignorant of the bearing of the question asked him, and the scope of his reply, as to render all his answers equally worthless, or else it proves that the questioner himself is ignorant of the fact, that he has asked a question which involves the whole of that of which the second query is but a part.

Again it is asked of the candidate whether he believes it is "wise for controverted religious claims to be settled by political majorities." This is no different from asking a man, who has just expressed himself as unalterably opposed to the interference of the State in religion, whether he thought it within the proper sphere of congressional decree, to legislate that the first day of the week is the Sabbath which is designated as the seventh day in the commandment; or that the World's Fair must, in obedience to that legislative interpretation, be closed on Sunday. Does the National League for the Protection of American Institutions suppose in these questions that the candidates to whom they have been put are ignorant of the scope of the first question and of its constitutional amendment? or, is the ignorance on the part of the league? or, if it is not ignorance, is it duplicity? and does it intend only the separation of one church from the State and the joining with the State of such church or religion as the league favors?

Another question is as to whether convicts are guaranteed by the State constitution "right of choice" in the religious instruction to be provided at the expense of the State. This does not ask whether it is proper for the State to undertake the religious instruction of convicts, but takes it for granted that it is part of the business of the State to do this, and then asks whether the convict has the right of choice as to the theology which the State should teach him. Here the league has fallen into its own trap,—has convicted itself without recourse. No more positive proof could be had than the simplicity of the unconsciousness of this acknowledgment, that the league itself is in favor of one instance of the union of Church and State, in the religious instruction by the Government of all inmates of State institutions. The league, therefore, of course, favors the State employment of chaplains in legislative bodies, and in the army and navy. Yet this is the league which holds that the strict "principle of the separation of Church and State must be sacredly observed by the national and State governments"! There are several other inconsistencies in remaining questions just as glaring, but this is sufficient.

From this it is impossible to avoid the conclusion, either that the National League for the Preservation of American Institutions is ignorant of the first principles of the separation of Church and State which it thinks to espouse, or else it is utterly insincere, and only desires the separation from the State of that form of religion which it wishes to antagonize. Perhaps here is the solution of the problem of the unknown quantity, and the indefinite factor, "other American institutions" is found.
