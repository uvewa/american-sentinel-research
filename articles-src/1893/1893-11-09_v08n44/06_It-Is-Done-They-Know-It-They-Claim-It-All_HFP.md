At the "Episcopal Jubilee" of Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop Ireland is reported as saying: "The times are solemn. At no time since the establishing of the Christian era did changes so profound and so far-reaching occur." This is similar to what the National Reformers said concerning the Supreme Court decision,—"This is a Christian Nation." Of it they said: "It is the weightiest, the noblest, the most tremendously far-reaching in its consequences, of all the utterances of all that sovereign tribunal." And so it is, and the Catholics recognize it with all the rest. They see all they could ask, and now claim all as their own.

At the reception given to Mgr. Satolli in July last, at St Paul, Hon. C. D. O'Brien in the speech of reception said:—

> We have here a temporal democracy, resembling in its sphere the spiritual democracy of the Church, which recognizes and fosters the spiritual rights of each individual Christian. . . . This is why the Catholic Church is so vigorous and progressive in the United States: . . . you have with you in your work the entire and irresistible force of American public opinion.

From the standpoint of so-called National Reformers, and all that they are accomplishing, this is so.

They claim the Republic. In regard to the waves of socialism, communism, etc., he said they would be "sustained and driven back by the protecting cordon of American Catholics, who in behalf of their religion and this, their Republic, will ever stand in the forefront of the conflict to receive them."

They see a union of Church and State. In the reply of Mgr. Satolli, he said: "Your institutions are in accord with the essential spirit of the church and her constitution. In pursuing my mission I find that I am acting out the very essence of your social and political life, and that I can be a good citizen because I am a good Catholic. Hence, I conclude that the Church and the Republic are made for one another and should walk hand in hand."

This union is just as close as they desire it. At the banquet recently given to Cardinal Gibbons, he said: "Church and State run in parallel lines, with no conflict with each other. The Church elevates the State, and the State protects religion. We would be sorry to see religion and the State any closer than they now are."

They see an unparalleled growth of the church in this country, under our Constitution, and they know its significance. Mgr. Satolli continued: "Time will show, very soon, I trust, that the church, from the enjoyment of the liberty guaranteed to her in this land, shall make progress such as she has not known in other times and lands. . . . And this mutual benefiting shall be clear evidence to all and in our own days that security for the commonwealth is in friendly contact with the church." So it will be that this Nation will be an example to other nations in the exalting the papal church to her position where she will say, "I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow."

They contemplate these sudden changes in the almost daily events with evident satisfaction. Said Cardinal Gibbons, on the occasion before referred to, "There is no country on earth where the difficult problems of Church and State are so successfully solved as in the United States."

And they are making the most of the situation, for, according to the Christian Statesman, they are sending missionaries "direct to Protestants and put before them the claims of the church and the need of membership." According to the Protestant American, which quotes Catholic papers, "Protestants are going over to Rome by the thousand. One bishop reports receiving one hundred, another five hundred, and Cardinal Gibbons says that ten per cent. of all he confirms are Protestant converts."

If Protestants cannot see as much in these things as Catholics do, it is only because they are stupified by the "wine" or false doctrines of the mother church.
