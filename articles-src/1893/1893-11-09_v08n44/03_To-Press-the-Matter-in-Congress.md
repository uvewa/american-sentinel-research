THE National Reform Association has sent out a call for a national convention, to be held in Allegheny, Nov. 14, 15, 16, at the First United Presbyterian Church, on Union Avenue. Of that call the *Christian Statesman* says: "The assembling of a national convention is, that the World's Fair has 'demonstrated the insufficiency of the Christian sentiment of our country,'" but has shown "also that this 'sentiment' is not strong enough to maintain itself without the provision of an express statement in the fundamental law of the land. To devise means to secure and expression the convention is called. The religious laws of the country, as they now are, are the only available foundations for the purposes of the 'National Reformers,' for they say: 'Our existing religious laws and usages, as they now stand, are not sufficient to protect the Sabbath. They have been annulled by the decision of the local courts and State Courts, or even our highest national courts, and the World's Fair has been opened on Sunday, notwithstanding the action of Congress to secure a commercial Sunday. The question becomes to the Christian sentiment at present as it has never before been—that the country has been stirred by the struggle for the Sabbath, has been quickened by the Supreme Court decision. It is high time the Christian sentiment of the United States be crystallized in some definite form.'"

The field secretary of the association, H. H. George, follows with the contention, "that the special purpose of the gathering at this convention, and for money."

City. The object of the meeting, as set forth in the call, was to have a permanent organization, representing the union of all evangelical denominations whose present, except Episcopalians and Roman Catholics.

The representatives of the ministry were the Rev. John Hall, Presbyterian; the Rev. David J. Burrell; the Rev. Edwin McBee, Baptist; the Rev. A. H. Bradford, Congregationalist; the Rev. C. W. Halliday, Presbyterian; and the Rev. John L. Scudder, Congregationalist. Letters were received from many others.

Dr. Stoddard presided and announced the purpose of the meeting. He said that national reform was necessary and that it could best be effected through an organization as the political parties for the correction of the political situation, the legislation they demanded. He was an his voice, a man of earnest opinion.

Politicians have been, for some time, aware that an organization was about to be formed which might blow them safely before the storm; and the churches and the evidences of political Christianity have taken for years a one-sided book filled with the study of all influences. If the entrance of religious and religious senses as a ruling factor the politics of the country is to become permanent, to the people of this country, it will only be because they have failed to listen, or was informed by the new teaching of plain object lessons which have been before them.

William Wily, writing of his work for the National Reform Association in Western Pennsylvania, says—

His work in this is to try by the convention to arrange to press the long Sabbath agitation of the political Sabbath at its various points which have been urged on their attention.

Will this convention, or this one, or any other body of men, be able to accomplish what many able men have tried? Not. It will not be brought to a conclusion until every knee shall bow, before the Lord of the Sabbath. Then will those who are bringing together this cause of laws, State and national, for the enforcement of the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, be ready to adhere, every day when he shall lay up in what authority they assume to enforce a Sabbath and will learn the Sabbath, and when they ready when He shall ask them for what cause, they neglected to remember that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, but have not been the first, and at the same time have both held and compelled others to obedience to the same error?
