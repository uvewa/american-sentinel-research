As a mass meeting of professors of "Christian Citizenship" it was intended to be in New Jersey. It was intended to establish a perfect organization as such throughout the State, not only as a religious body but as a religious political party. As an earnest beginning they proposed after the convention to appoint a committee of three, these three in each county, and these local and national committees of way and manner and means of influencing all primary elections, and political morals, and secure control of party nominations for the legislature and should be desired to that end.

A resolution was passed to the effect that it is the duty of all Christian citizens to demand upon the party platforms and assembly conventions, and support only those who will present the demand to these bodies, and to secure men of integrity.

It is a mass meeting representing all denominations in a great State for Christian citizenship.
