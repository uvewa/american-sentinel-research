At a mass meeting of professors of political Christianity held lately in Jersey City it was determined to establish a permanent organization, to be the nucleus of a religious political party. As an earnest of the spirit which is to inspire this new party, and the methods which are to be used, every church in the city was asked to appoint a committee of three; these different committees to unite as one general committee of ways and means by which to advance and enforce commercial, social, and political morals, and secure the passage of such acts by the State legislature as should be desired to this end.

A resolution was framed in the form of a demand upon the Democratic and Republican county and assembly conventions, and a committee of three appointed to present the demand to these bodies. This is the wording of the resolution:—

> In a mass meeting representing the Christian sentiment of the county, it was unanimously resolved that we demand the nomination of a candidate for sheriff whose record shall command the support of all good citizens, and who shall be opposed to racetrack gambling, illegal liquor selling, and every other form of public vice, and that we do further demand from candidates for assembly in the several districts that they shall be pledged to the repeal of the vicious legislation of last winter which has disgraced our State.

However just the cause, and whatever the reason for righteous indignation which this assemblage of professed "Christian voters" may have, and it is very certain they are not entirely unreasonable in their indignation at the legal protection of civil disorder which they have seen among them, still they are not justified, and nothing can justify them, in appearing in a civil matter and demanding to be heard, and to be obeyed, because of their religious profession, or because they represent any religious body, or bodies, as such. The only plea which they can properly make as a ground for requiring a hearing for themselves is their individual citizenship, or that they are regularly authorized to represent citizens as citizens, not as Christians or Mohammedans, or Roman Catholics, or Buddhists, or Presbyterians, or Confucianists, or Methodists, or under any other religious name. To make the demand by virtue of any one of these titles is in fact no more unreasonable in principle than to make it in the name of Christians. The heritage of human rights is equal to each, without distinction, whatever creed he profess, or if he profess no creed. The assumption of superior authority by virtue of some divine privilege is the basis upon which the tyranny of man over his fellows has always rested. Such tyranny can be exercised by a political party as readily as by an imperial despot. Let the promoters of religious politics stop and think whether they are willing to take the responsibility for the results.
