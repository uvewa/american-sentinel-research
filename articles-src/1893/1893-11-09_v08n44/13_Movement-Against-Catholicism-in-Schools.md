THERE is a movement on foot to give to the pupils of the different high schools of the country an anti-Catholic literature and organization similar to that which is being circulated in Montreal and Boston. In this matter the public schools in Washington, D. C., and some colleges, under the same influence, are also mentioned.

The *Woman's Voice*, of Boston, says that an anti-Catholic matter which bars the students from their studies, but says— "we rather desire to make them familiar with it in relation to wisdom out of the anti-Catholic sentiment of its charges, and against them."

As this is the purpose of all the organs, is it? Are the promoters of the movement prepared to face the fact that pupils and children of the churches look upon these matters of religion as these. It is thus that the attention of the children has to be asked upon this subject. But, indeed, it is true that those who are anti-Catholic are in the very relations to public schools, and Sunday schools of all denominations and all religious and Catholic societies, should teach all and should all be tolerant, when it shall be asked upon this, when it comes, whether it is the Word of God or the voice of man?
