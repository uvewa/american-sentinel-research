SOMETIME ago a Cleveland paper reported Wilbur F. Crafts, when organizing a Sunday League in that city, as saying:

Since Elliott F. Shepard died the cause has greatly lacked for financial aid, but we are going to organize a "third House" in Washington that will bring the right sort of pressure to bear on Congress.

This harmonizes remarkably well with the different utterances in the article, on another page, entitled, "To Press the Matter in Congress." It has been evident for a considerable time that the promoters of religious law have been planning to bring, if possible, still greater influences to bear to attain their ends than ever before. Their experience with Congress in the World's Fair Sunday-closing question taught them, as they have not hesitated to say, that they could control congressmen and intimidate them by political means into obedience to their requirements. This, then, is the first result of their councils made public,—the establishment of a "third House," at Washington, similar, of course, to that which the Roman Catholics have had in successful operation there for several years. So, however successful this may prove to be, it can only be an imitation of that which the Romanists have done before them. No doubt, too, as the specialty of this "third House" will be to seek the national enforcement of a Catholic institution,—Sunday,—it will receive a cordial welcome and hearty proffer of assistance from the already established Roman Catholic lobby.
