WILL Jesus yoke up with the police court to fit men for heaven? Are police officers labourers together with God? Shall human prejudice and weakness sit in judgment upon moral questions and men's Protestantism? Let us recognize no plan to force men to dark our dark and bloody ages when they lost their dearly hallowed lives.
