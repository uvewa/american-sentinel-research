The objects of the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, as defined by its constitution, are three in number, but the articles of its constitution which amplify them make them six general propositions, first, to protect the common schools and "other American institutions"; second, "to promote public institutions in harmony with such institutions"; third, to prevent the use of public money for sectarian purposes.

The league deals, then, with the State, the Church, the common schools, and it is its intent to promote the cause of the public schools "in harmony with such institutions," and to conserve the public funds solely for their use. Into this proposition there enters no unknown factor; "the American institutions" and "such institutions," which utterly destroy the possibility of any double understanding of what the league stands for, or what it may or may not do.

But, eliminating this unknown quantity and assuming that the purposes of the league are to protect the public schools, and the public funds from sectarian raids and frauds to sectarian use, let us see what these two objects, viewed in the light of the other, will require of those who undertake them. They will require an accurate knowledge of the relationship and authority of the Church, and the State; because the public school is a State institution, and sects and denominations are ecclesiastical.

We infer from this, then, that the league has not tried to distinguish and follow the constitutional line of separation between Church and State? It must come to this or adopt a subterfuge by claiming that funds may be appropriated for general religious uses, but not distinctively in the interest of any particular religious organization or sect. But it cannot be denied in any reasonable use of the English language, and an understanding of its origin and growth, that the followers of Christ, professing the Christian religion, constitute the Christians not among these different religious sects of the world. The league is, therefore, committed to the defense of a secular school and a secular State.

That suggestion, derived from this neutral view of the objects of the league, is strengthened by the fact that under the auspices of the league a proposed amendment to the national Constitution has been offered in Congress, which applies the terms of the First Amendment to the Constitution, in its relations, to the States separately, with an elaboration specifically prohibiting the use of public money for or in behalf of any sectarian institution or organization. The adoption of this amendment, and its interpretation in good faith, will require of every State something very near the Constitutional requisites of Congress of a distinctively secular government, without alloy.

It is true, that, applying the words of the First Amendment to the national Constitution, this amendment which the league endorses reads, "No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," and then, with the pause of only a comma, runs right on to specify in legal terms the prohibition of the use of State money or credit for or in the interest of any church, religious denomination or society, or sect. To claim that the broad and universal prohibition contained in the first two phrases so confined and restricted in its particularism which follow would be a subterfuge utterly unworthy of such an issue, to be honest men and worthy citizens. It is to be believed for no moment that Wm. Allen Butler, Rev. James M. King, and the many other gentlemen of this league whose names are even better and more favorably known in the legal, business, and religious world, would lend themselves to say such deceptive use of time honored language and expression of constitutional principle, as this would be if they have not, this proposed amendment means what it says,—that every avoidance of the subject of religion in its legislation which the First Amendment to the Constitution imposes upon the Congress of the United States.

In the nine questions, referred to at length, in the first article of the previous issue of this paper, as propounded by the National League for the Protection of American Institutions to the delegates to the New York State Constitutional Convention, the first answers to this assumption fully, and in its complete accordance with the correct theory of the entire question of Church and State. Clearly stated in the objects of the league and unreservedly put forth in its constitutional amendment: That which is asked of every citizen of this State, in that question, is needed from every person in this country, a definite and intelligent defense of the principle of the separation of Church and State; and "such a willingness to 'securing definite constitutional enactment' as perpetuates the separation of Church and State," and also an active interest "in correcting the legislation which may be in violation of that principle." But having asked a question which presupposes and requires a repudiation of all Church and State affiliations, another is immediately put, in the second query, which would be totally unnecessary and cumulative, and which, the questions being asked at all, calls for the full scope of the first question that had been intended and understood. The query to the candidate is, whether he is in favor of "an instruction to the committee to include in its report for the benefit of sectarian institutions."

We ask should this question have been asked of one who had just answered the previous question, either affirmatively or negatively? There is no middle ground on this matter, it is either a separation of Church and State or a union of Church and State. The one who has just decided that he holds that the "principle of the separation of Church and State must be honestly observed" can no more favor the use of public funds for sectarian or religious instruction than he can uphold the enforced reading of the Bible in the public schools; or the establishment of religious instruction to be provided at the expense of the State as a requirement precedent in graduation from the schools; or the compulsory subscription by private and parochial schools to a State supervision of the forms of theology which may there be taught. To ask this information of a candidate shows that comprises all of which this is but a small part, either supposes that the person who is being questioned is so ignorant of the bearing of the question asked him, and consequently is an unsafe repository of the answers equally worthless, or else it is put with the intent of ascertaining whether the candidate, that he has asked a question bearing upon the matter actually is and the second query is but a part.

Again it is asked of the candidate whether he believes it is "wise for controverted religious claims to be settled by political majorities." This is no different from the other. A man who has declared himself as unanimously opposed to the interference of the State with religion, unless he thought it within the proper sphere of the State to force everybody to keep the first day of the week in the Sabbath or to designate as the sacred day in the churches, the political majorities must necessarily control, in obedience to that legislative instruction, as there would be no more use for the National League for the Protection of American Institutions. Such is the class of questions that the candidates to whom they have been put are ignorant of the scope of the first question and of its constitutional amendment; or, is the ignorance on the part of the league? or, if it is not ignorance, has the league deliberately in mind only the separation of one church from another church, and the equal protection of each church or religion as the league understands them?

As to whether religious exercises or culture are guaranteed by the State constitutions, that does not necessarily imply that instruction to be provided at the expense of the State. Now the question naturally is, is it proper for the State to undertake the religious education of its citizens? for it takes it for granted that it is part of the business of the State to look after the moral welfare of its citizens, and this involves whether the convict has the right of choosing his own creed, or which the State should teach him. Here the league has fallen into an error, but an error which is a very natural one, and which it makes not without resources. No more positive proof of the unconscious drift of this acknowledgment, that the league itself is in favor of that very thing from which it proposes to protect the State; viz., the interference of the State, in the religious instruction by the introduction of religious exercises and institutions. The league, therefore, of course, favors the presence of Christianity in our legislative bodies, and in the army and navy. Yet while it is in this very thing they favor, the delegates are asked to insist that the strict "principles of the separation of Church and State, must be honestly observed by the national and State governments," which question they answer in the affirmative in remaining questions just as glaringly, but with a difference.

From this it is impossible to avoid the conclusion, either that the National League is ignorant of the first principles of the constitutional theory of government, or that its position is equivocal, and that it expects from the State that form of religion which suits its own convenience. And here is the solution of the problem of the religious question, and the demand for "other American institutions" to be
