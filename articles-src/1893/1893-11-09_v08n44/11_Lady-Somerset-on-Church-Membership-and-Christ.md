The Independent, of October 26, publishes an article by Lady Henry Somerset, with the title "What is it to be a Christian?" In this article Lady Somerset, in speaking of Christ's ministry, says, "it was as a peripatetic preacher an acknowledged fanatic, and a social anarchist that Jesus was regarded by the cultivated and educated of his day," whose preaching was of idle superstitions which would die as had others before. Among the cultivated and refined, wealthy, powerful and worldly wise his words were strange tales unworthy of credence. To-day, however, to be a member of the church means the opposite of all that Christ met with, home, love and honor, added reputation and business opportunities, a luxurious pew and a noble eulogy with which to depart in the odor of sanctity. "Church membership is now too often considered an excellent insurance, providing a lease of comfort and consolation in this world, and the freehold of eternal happiness hereafter." So Lady Somerset sees that there is an inconsistency here, but does she, and do others, see the parallel too? Is there not precisely the same pharisaical class in the nineteenth century that there was in the first? Is not this class laboring under the same deceptions, guilty of the same sins, and covering itself with the same cloak of religious profession? Are not those who constitute the popular church of to-day taking the same course as did the popular church in Christ's time? When he comes again will they be any more ready to receive him?
