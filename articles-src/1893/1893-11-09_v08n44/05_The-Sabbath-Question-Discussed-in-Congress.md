THAT the Sabbath question is the living question of the day, especially among professing Christians, will be denied by no one who is in touch with the times and familiar with religious influences, will not, but a few years ago the multitude of a variety of denominations felt quite confident that the Sabbath question had been settled long ago, and that they might take their ease, vacations, and, as their return, find their Sabbaths unchallenged by any claims of the seventh day. They entertained no fears that any one would enter the fold and the sheep into any other folds.

But of late years many of those populations of shepherds do not feel such perfect security when hearing their flocks for any great length of time, for fear on their return they might find a few which have been induced to stroll in the green pastures of God's Word, and in the cool time return to feed on in fresh again. And even when the pastors themselves are at ease the question sticks out through all about the Sabbath and the change comes up for consideration, whether in or out of pulpit cool, among themselves and other nonobservers of the seventh-day Sabbath.

A discussion of this nature occurred in Brooklyn, N. Y., August 13th (1893, it being introduced by a prominent first-day keeper, thus his own question) in a paper entitled "The Transference of the Sabbath."

His conclusion taken by the gentleman with regard to the Sabbath,—that the Sabbath of the Law, the seventh day, has never changed and ever transferred in any way to the first day,—were clear, compact, convincing, and the argument so advocated, was wholly based on the Bible. At its conclusion the lecturer showed clearly and conclusively that Christ kept the seventh-day Sabbath, mentioning or intimating one word during all his ministry that it ever would be

turned, or turned the tide of popular sentiment in favor of the view that a special day of the week was not required in the Decalogue, and therefore Sunday might be observed as the Sabbath. A large minority, however, yielded the inconsistency of this view. How much this fact may have influenced us, much legislation to enforce respect for the first day of the week as a sacred day, I will not attempt to say. Certainly the influence in the controversies in the last quarter of our own time, no court finds in evidence by the laws was enacted for the Sabbath of the Lord, existing in every State in the Union, and much of the enforcement of Sunday was written in their enforcement.

Much has been said and written in our day to palliate the cruelty which was sometimes inflicted by the Puritans in the enforcement of their laws, as if such a thing were unknown among us. Yet, under the Tennessee Sunday law, four Christians men, in that State, in June of the year 1892, were imprisoned for their faith. Three of these men, having have improved forty-seven days, were marched through the streets of Paris in a chain gang with common felons, and, on going the county highway. Two years more, one of their number having been acquitted by appeal to the Supreme Court of the State, and the indictment being quashed, by the death of the defendant, was fined and put to labor making cakes of coal for refusing his usual farm work on Sunday.

Persecution from a similar cause have arisen under the Sunday laws of Pennsylvania within twelve years. Some of these causes would have arisen even in old Puritan Salem of centuries of the including laws which arose upon the misguided following the Salem Holloram. The incompatible imprisoning the Tennessee Christian for peaceably working their farms on Saturday were punishing those men for silently and laborers passing, to their work, on succeeding days was more difficult to be comprehended or impressed. In the minds of people disposed to think things over, the actions of these men would seem the more inextricable, since they were men who conscientiously observed the seventh day of the week according to the fourth commandment and the constitution of the State allowed it.

All men have a natural and indubitable right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience, and that no human authority can in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.

It would not be difficult to show still further the incidental reference in these remarks, and to put before the inattentive listeners to the whole question of Sunday legislation as a religious institution, with at least one practical lesson. Shall it not be asked, is there in this country, one or more of these witnesses, witnesses to the lesson of religious liberty? The Puritan groped towards it, but blinded by false narrow and erroneous idea of maintaining, at whatever cost, their courts of State, never learned it.

It must be seen, the dogmatism of thought revealed in their legislation; the cynical attitude towards themselves by which their earnestness engrossed, it makes the fundamental error at the root of their legislation tended to break down all religious restraint and the higher idea of reverence for God and his Word. We can see the fundamental error of the Puritan conception of legislation was the same sentiment, with that freedom of conscience which, he claimed for himself. In the

light of their history, the lesson has much plain to us. Yet what we have seen of modern Sunday legislation leads us to ask if nineteenth century Christians have not yet higher ground to reach with reference history of conscience. The insensations yet imperfectly learned, that civil legislation cannot enforce respect for any day as a Sabbath; that if final respect is secured at all it must arise from the conscience themselves.

If, and it would seem, we might readily think, if the churches would quit its old practice, the Church is only increasing the animosity of the worldly against itself and themselves, by raising its voice in its usurpation of religion by the use of the law every day. "Beware therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and and to God the things that are God's." It is yet the simple duty of the Church to tell the people of the nineteenth century by precept and example, that Saturday is God's holy day begun, and so inspire its observance and demonstrate the completeness and propriety of its observance of Church and State. To cultivate in the hearts of Christians following the true Master to recognize in the words of the Teacher—"My kingdom is of this not of this world." Having learned this, then would my severest fight.

At the reception given to Mr. Crafts by a lady last, at St. Paul's M. E. O. I V[?] in the epoch of reception said:

I want to say that there is nothing in its sphere the spiritual democracy of the world, the brightest political light of this century. * * * The strongest reason why the Catholic Church is so vigorous and aggressive, is because, of whatever they may say of the leaders of the National Reformers, and all that they are entitled to consideration.

They claim the Republic. In regard to the sentiments of the Roman Church, he said they would be "sustained and driven back to the propaganda of American Catholics; who in behalf of themselves and this, our Republic, will ever stand in the forefront of the battle."

They see a union of Church and State, In the part of Mr. Crafts, he said,—"Your institutions are in accord with the moral spirit of the church and her civilization. In pursuing my mission I find that I am cutting out my own escence of sectarianism, for it must be obvious that I can be a good citizen because I am a good Catholic. The two are one. The Catholic Church and the Republic are made for one another and should walk hand in hand."

All men have a natural and indubitable right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience; no human authority can in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and that no preference shall be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.

This is the article as it is read, right? This principle is just as clear to day as it was then. At this banquet recently given by Colonel Gibbons, he said: "Church and State can exist peaceably, but not interfere with each other. The Church hierarchy of Rome knew this in the earliest centuries. We would be sorry to see religion and the Church legislated.

Mr. Crafts said: The Roman Catholic Church sees an inseparable growth of the church in this country, under Constitutional amendment.

Mr. Sabiti continued: "Nothing will show the people of any country so well the enjoyment of the liberty guaranteed by the Constitution as a well constructed church, and as she has not known and ought not what the difference has been in the matter of the education, "We have nothing to believe shall be clear evidence to all and to our country that real security and all the morals is in it, and purely in it, and the benevolence is in it purely in it. It is not that it will in that little time pass. It will be an example to other nations in the enabling of a people of this country than so when she will say, "I ask as a quite, and independent, a fair and square chance."

They accordingly thus three words of the Church, and State, and its government, and the elevation before referred to, "There is no danger in this land from the union of Church and State"; meaning, of course, of Churches and State are so far apart, that there is no peril of this nature, and they are making the most of the situation. Therefore, as in the case of the Statesmen, they are sending missionaries abroad, who hold the mission theory before them the claims of the church and the claims of the nation. According to the period *American*, which quotes Cardinal Gibbon as follows: "America offers more to Rome by the thousand. Our foreign population presses over the boarding lines, one hundred, and Catholics one of each one hundred, forty-five per cent. of all conference of the union.

If Protestants cannot do as much in the United States as Catholics, it is because they are stupefied by the "wise" or "religious" legislation of Puritanism.

Concerning Ohio. Annual Conference, Methodist Episcopal Church.

These petitions come from the conferences of the Church.

Now, and for all coming time the Methodist church or church body to pass judgment upon this question as a political matter, whether to give direction to it, or make demands such as have been made, must bring upon its head the just condemnation of every thinking man. And if I were to say to an American Congress, "you must do this," what would the answer be? The answer would be: "This is the separation of Church and State; that each within its appropriate sphere is entirely independent and supreme; they never lay its hand on government, and the Government never interferes with it or its members, in their several religious rights. Any member of any denomination in the land has the same right to petition, as a citizen, and to exercise in full his civil rights as such, and not invoke the powerful name

The right of petition carries with it immunity from all that belongs to the representatives as a right. And this I say, with an entire regard for the conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian, Baptist, and every other denomination in which I live. It is composed of a large and patriotic body of intelligent American citizens. These gentlemen, in their representative capacity, have shown through their organizations the deepest concern.

I would like to know, sir, upon what theory we can question this right of petition in particular? We are discussing the relationship between a great republic and the rights of all its citizens. We are not discussing any question as to the merits of our obligation—and we are standing here in the halls of Congress, debating with these petitions before us from millions of American citizens, exercises the men of our own Nation who have said through their organization that they leave to regard. This material, presented by these, is something that invites the most courteous reception, but they are not an ordinance of legislation, but simply an expression of opinion. I challenge any man to point to a single petition from any church organization that used any menaces and did not make them known to us. There is no political influence connected with it, but the church organization that has sent its money and their philanthropy have sent forth to every land in the world, were here simply exercising their Constitutional rights. You will have a great curiosity to see what the statement that was made is.

Now, let me make another statement in the copy of this sort of legislation in his pocket, nor used any man to my good friend, the man [Mr. Geary] as a part of it, and undertake to teach the man from the State of California about the question for which he has worked, is to ask for himself or he should remark to the missionary; "Now, you are in my territory, and I want none of you."

Mr. Speaker, what source in the United States has any man a right to call upon to deliver here an expression of opinion upon such a matter as this? I would like to know. And the most respectable element from the most of the brightest intelligence, men of the highest patriotic standards of the country. It is not right for a man to be petitioned upon a question of this sort except as of a citizen, and that he does, each having his own independence. Is it not right for a man to sign our title to the name of a Christian Nation, not through the practices of these men; those men who built up the country, who made it what it is, and the world was his parish, have gone forth to the four corners of the world to preach the Bible.

I do not believe that the gentlemen from China or Siam or Turkey or wherever they come from, with the bitterness which is implied in its legislation against a people with whom they are in direct contact, and I appeal to the better spirits of the Constitution in this referring; a hearing is all that was asked.

He said it was an adjured fact that there are 56,000 Seventh-day Adventists in this country, and all of these favored; not one educated man among them. There are 10,000 Seventh-day Baptists in this country, and these that only one really educated man, and he, Dr. Lewis. Can it be possible, and he, that he on the one hand all the learned, scholarly, educated, cultured, philosophical, etc., throughout Christendom, are wrong on the Sabbath question, and these few uneducated Seventh-day Adventists be right? The idea of such a thing was absurd. How can an uneducated Body's an idea is preposterous!

In reply to this, the gentleman, not Mr. Crafts, Dr. Hiscox, the author of the Baptist Manual upon which it is based, after Mr. Crafts: "When you talked about those Sunday-day Adventists, a slight but significant observations action within me, and it cut, a deep, they, within my heart. It is not possible for ignorant men to be right and have the truth as it is possible for learned men to err in it? Is it possible for learned men when men to be in error; and even such wise men as you and I may make mistakes, as doubtless we have done today. God teaches ignorant men the truth always as in all ages by what means."

He also said that the acknowledged scholars of the world and many of the most learned men and churches and hundreds of Bible proof on their side of the argument. There was no point this assertion of Mr. Crafts was squarely met by reference to them, for they most assuredly had the law and the testimony on the side by facts, as well.

After a few other remarks made in continuation of the truths stated in his paper, to which Mr. Crafts never even referred, nor found occasion to criticize.

By the appearance and actions of many of the audience who were present, it was very apparent that all the truth uttered in this regard was not accepted, and by more quite a little of the dramatic spirit was shown.

First comes one who has done a great deal on the various subjects, was in great earnest, on his marble-piece to bring about a public sentiment that should convince; and also to give evidence clear and overwhelming of the utter impropriety and even one jot or tittle of the law passing
