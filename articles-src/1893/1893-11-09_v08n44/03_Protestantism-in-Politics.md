An exchange, which devotes itself to an open and virulent antagonism of the Roman Catholic Church, its methods, and its members, publishes the following, evidently without a thought that these are Roman Catholic methods which are being espoused by professed Protestants. Some of these anti-Catholic papers and organizations expressly state that they antagonize Catholicism only as a political and not as a religious organization. Will they be consistent now and antagonize so-called Protestantism wherever it aspires to political organization and control?

A Christian political mass meeting was held recently in the Second Presbyterian Church in Jersey City. The object of the meeting, as set forth in the call, was to form a permanent organization of Christian voters. Ministers of nearly every denomination were present, except Episcopalians and Catholics.

The representatives of the ministry were the Revs. Daniel Halloran and C. E. Little. Methodist; the Revs. Cornelius Brett and C. K. Wick, Reformed; the Rev. Edwin McKinn, Baptist; the Revs. Henry C. Cronin, James McKelvey, and J. W. Hathaway, Presbyterian; and the Rev. John L. Scudder, Congregational. Letters were received from several other ministers.

Dr. Scudder presided and announced the purpose of the meeting. He was fully convinced, he said, that if the Christian people of the community had as thorough an organization as the political parties they could dictate nominations and get whatever legislation they demanded. We have an Irish vote, he said, a German vote, a Catholic vote, and a rumseller's vote. Now let us have a Christian vote.

Politicians have been, for some time, trimming their sails to catch the religious breezes which might blow them safely into their desired political havens. The evidences of political Christianity have been for years an open book offered for the study of all citizens. If the entrance of religion and religious issues as a ruling factor into the politics of the country is a surprise to the people of this country, it will only be because they have failed to see and understand the clear teaching and plain object lessons which have been before them continually.
