There were five Sundays in the last month of the World's Fair; and the attendance upon those days was as follows, 48,375; 88,050; 82,276; 138,011; 146,821. Out of the twenty-six Sundays of the World's Fair period, the Fair has been closed during four. In the six different phases in which the matter has been brought before the courts, in only one instance was the right of Congress to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday upheld, and the decision to that effect was immediately reversed as to its every detail by a higher court. And yet those who sought the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by Congress, and by the courts, are claiming a great victory. The fact is, it has been as complete a Waterloo, so far as legal enforcement is concerned, as any cause ever suffered. In the line wherein they sought success there has been ignominious defeat. But it has been a great success where they do not care to publicly acknowledge and boast of it. Their agitation has aroused the heretofore dormant bigotry and fanaticism of hundreds of thousands, and intimidated many more by the power for financial harm which they have shown themselves able and willing to exercise. This is the victory which has been achieved; one not to be proud of, certainly; but a victory.
