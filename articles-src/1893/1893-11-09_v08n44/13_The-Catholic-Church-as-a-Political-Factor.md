The Minneapolis Journal thinks that "if no more serious disaster were possible to this country than the increased prosperity of the Catholic Church, we would be fortunate indeed." If the Romish Church were prospering only as a church, it would be small concern to the country, but it is as a political factor that the Catholic Church is developing most rapidly, hence its power for evil.

"The men who fear Catholicism," says the Journal, "are those who are living in the text books of the schools, and who are filled with the same spirit which they imagine regulates the conduct of the Romish priests." The Journal is mistaken; the men who fear Catholicism are the men who live in the present, and who are observing the signs of the times as they are seen at present. Only the criminally indifferent can fail to be alarmed at the rapid progress of papal principles not only in the United States but in the world to-day.
