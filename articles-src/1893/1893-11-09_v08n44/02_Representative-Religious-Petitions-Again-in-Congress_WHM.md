On October 11, in the House of Representatives, a bill to amend the Chinese Exclusion Act, extending the time granted Chinamen in this country for registration, for a period of six months after the bill should be passed, was called up, and resulted in considerable reference to religious subjects. As an evidence of the progress and development of congressional and political religion, some paragraphs from the Record are worthy of note and are here reprinted.

Upon the reading of the bill by the clerk of the House, Mr. McCreary arose and spoke; in the course of his address saying:

I have in my hand a bundle of petitions sent by annual conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the States of Ohio, Indiana, Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Kentucky, Illinois, Oregon and California, most of them asking for the repeal of the Geary act, and some asking for an extension of time for Chinese registration. These petitions represent hundreds of ministers and hundreds of thousands of members.

This brought up the question of representative petitions from ecclesiastical bodies and Mr. Geary, of California, in his speech immediately following, said:—

I have before me a petition which I want to read.

To the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington, D. C.:

The five Molons Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, assembled in Jackson, Iowa, on the 19th day of September, 1888, composed of 325 ministers, representing 40,000 church members, respectfully petition your honorable body to immediately repeal the act passed on the 5th day of May, 1888, known as the Geary law. We make this earnest petition, first, to the ground of justice and fair doubt, to whom trustagreement, the Chinese now in the United States are entitled to the same trust, and then to the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation. The provision that they shall register and take out certificates to assure their continued residence here, producing the testimony of a white witness to their right to be here, requires of mutilation of them an impossibility, and yet subjects them to imprisonment and deportation if they fail to comply with the requisition. This requirement made of them alone, in contraindication to all other foreigners in the country, is a palpable violation of the treaty.

The second clause of the petition tells us that the Methodist Episcopal Church—not the American Methodist Episcopal Church alone—has some $400,000 invested in China, and is also represented there by a number of missionaries.

Petitions in form similar to this have been sent here from many of the religious conventions that have met this summer; petitions apparently prepared at the same place and issued from the same source.

It did not matter whether the Methodists or the Baptists or the Episcopalians or the Presbyterians wished to petition, they all used the same blanks. There was about this a concert of action which was peculiarly suggestive. But the only purpose for which I refer to this petition is to show the character of the statements which have been circulated throughout the country, describing the efforts and operation of this law.

Mr. McCreary of Kentucky. Will my friend allow me to make a single statement at this point? I hold in my hand—and it is justice to these people that I should refer to it—one of these petitions from the members of the annual conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church of sixteen States in the Union. I will only read the indorsement of one of these petitions:—

Central Ohio Annual Conference, Methodist Episcopal Church; 200 ministers, representing 40,000 members sat for the repeal of the act of May 3, 1888, known as the Geary law.

These petitions come from the conferences of sixteen States.

Mr. Geary. Mr. Speaker, what right has any church or church body to pass judgment upon the action of any American legislative assembly, to give directions to it, or make demands such as this? What right has any church in this land of ours, speaking from its pulpit or church door, to say to an American Congress, "you must do this," or "you must do that"? I supposed that in this land of ours, the line was sharply drawn between Church and State; that each within its appropriate sphere must be supreme, but that the Church must never lay its hand on government, and the Government must never interfere with the Church. [Applause.] Remember, I do not deny that every churchman in the land has the same right to petition given to every other citizen of this country, but he must petition as a citizen, standing upon his rights as such, and not invoke the powerful name of church behind him. [Applause.] The members of the congregations as citizens have the same rights as other citizens; but the Church, as such, has no right to interfere in the political affairs of this Nation.

If there is one thing more than another which all true Americans have approved the declaration of, it is that there must be no union of Church and State, and no invasion of the province of one by the other. This principle is as old as the foundation of the American Commonwealth. It has been the experience of men in the past, that whenever the Church has had the right of interference in matters of government human liberty has suffered from the union, and the men and women who settled on the shores of the Atlantic and laid the foundations of the Republic had experienced in the older lands from whence they came the evils and dangers of such commingling of affairs. They had experienced persecutions under religious governments, and it mattered not what the faith of that government was, the attendant results were always the same. Protestants could not forget the persecutions of the Huguenots by the Catholics, or Catholics forget the persecutions and sufferings of Catholics and Protestants at the hands of Protestants. All alike are simply evidence of the truth of the conclusion that human liberty suffers under the union, and that the government that will maintain human rights and insure freedom to all must be free from religious interference by any sect.

Both Church and State have their appointed task in the improvement of human society; each within its own sphere must be supreme. Let the Church perform its grand work in the improvement and the betterment of mankind, teaching the faith handed down by the fathers, bringing men in closer relationship with Divinity if it will; teaching the necessity for the application of truth and love in the affairs of the human race. Let it go abroad wherever it may; minister to the wants of the poor and the suffering: drive sorrow from the hearthstone, and ameliorate the condition of suffering humanity wherever it may find it. Let it, within its sphere, be absolute and supreme, permitting no interference by the government in its exercise of faith, but when it reaches the borderland that separates Church matters from temporal, there it must stop.

The Church in this country has no right to criticise, condemn, or pass judgment upon the acts of an American legislative body, and is without the power to make demands that must be respected by this Government. This is the unwritten law of the land. There was a day in the world's history when priests and bishops could point their finger and make colors tremble, when the demands of Pope and cardinal were respected by governing bodies the world over, but that day, happily for the human race, is past, never to return. In this land such a power was never recognized, and there is no room here for religious associations claiming the right to interfere with the political affairs of the people.

The Protestant churches in the United States under the leadership of misguided zealots have permitted themselves to make an exhibition of their desire to interfere in political matters that I know on sober reflection the great mass of the American Church will condemn, because I do not believe that it is their wish or intent to establish a precedent that may be used in the future to justify the interference of all other churches in the political affairs of this country, because if we concede the right of interference to a Protestant bishop or minister we must concede it to the Catholic Pope and bishop and priest, and I do not think that the great mass of the people of the United States, the masses of the Protestant churches especially, are willing to concede the right of papal interference with the political affairs of our people.

What would they think and what would they do if to morrow or the next day the learned archbishop of the Catholic Church for the State of New York should mount his pulpit, and denouncing an act of Congress, call on his people to use their political rights in behalf of the policy dictated by the church; demand that they should insist on the repeal of a statute because it was hostile to the interests of the church or interfered with some religious work that it was engaged in? Why, from every Protestant pulpit in the land, from the lips of every American, would go up a condemnation of that interference on the part of the papal representatives, and we would have the grim old specter of the Pope seeking to dominate this Government paraded through the land, and what an intensity of feeling would be exhibited by these same ministers at the apparent impudence of the Catholic clergymen seeking to do the very same thing that they have been doing from all their pulpits in the last few years. The Protestant Church must be consistent, or it must admit the exercise of this, to them, dangerous power by the papal church.

I may offend some good people in these statements, but I am satisfied that I speak the wishes of the great mass of the American people of all churches, who, profiting by the experience of the race in years gone by, jealous of their rights, fearing the interference that in all other lands has spread misery and suffering upon the people, are satisfied with existing conditions of Government, and with the maintenance of a just equilibrium between the Church and State. I say that hereafter, and for all time to come, there must be no intermingling of the powers of the one with the other, no union of Church and State in any way or manner; that hereafter the Church, as church, must abstain from interference in any way, shape, or manner with the political affairs of this Nation. [Applause.]

On the taking up of this same bill on the succeeding day, Mr. Hitt, of Illinois, while addressing the House, said:—

Mr. Speaker, there was mention made on yesterday by the gentleman from California [Mr. Geary] of certain petitions from various parts of the country sent by churches. One has been sent to me by 7,000 members of the Methodist Church and their pastors in the State of Washington, the conference being held at Seattle. I deemed it due to those men to have their petition brought before the American Congress, and I have presented it, as shown by the Record of yesterday. I was astounded when that intelligent gentleman yesterday, referring to these petitions for the repeal of the Geary law, spoke so harshly of the interference of the Church in politics.

I did not know that this bill was mere politics; I thought it was legislation [laughter], and I did not know that belonging to a Christian Church, or being associated in Christian fellowship, disqualified men for taking an interest in the honor of their country and in public morality. [Applause.]

I brought that petition in here and I think it should be treated with all the respect due to the petitioners and due to that sacred right of petition, long ago in memorable days vindicated and gloriously secured on the floor of this House by John Quincy Adams, a right which I hope will forever remain unchallenged, the right of every American citizen, whether he be Christian or pagan, whether he be a member of a church or an atheist, the right of petition, the right of prayer.

Mr. MAJICHER. Did Mr. Geary on yesterday challenge the right of a Christian as a citizen to petition, or did he question simply his right to petition as a member of a church?

Mr. HITT. Mr. Geary is present and can probably speak for himself.

Mr. MAJICHER. I thought he was not present.

Mr. HITT. Mr. Geary's statement was very clear. He spoke of "ecclesiastical" and Church interference, and I have spoken of the subject in general terms, as he did. My colleague on the committee [Mr. Geary] and myself have discussed these and many questions together in committee.

Mr. GEARY. If the gentleman will permit me, I think he has now fallen into error. I distinctly said this: That a member of a church as a citizen had the same right of petition as any other citizen, but that he had no right to come to this body backing himself up with the power and might of his church organization.

Mr. HITT. To that I reply that a whole church association has the right; that I had the honor to present to this body, and I believe almost every other member here presented during the last session of Congress, petitions from churches as churches in reference to the question of closing on Sunday the great Exposition in Chicago. This is the first time I ever heard that it was wicked for churches to ask for the repeal of a law that violated moral law or to take an interest in public affairs. [Applause.]

Mr. Hitt was followed by Mr. Johnson, of Indiana, who occupied his time, five minutes, with the presentation of a petition from "The Religious Society of Friends," and remarks thereon. Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio, then said:—

Mr. Speaker, I have not before me the language of the gentleman from California [Mr. Geary] in which he denounced, as I understood it, criticised certainly, the conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church which have seen fit to memorialize Congress on the subject of this pending legislation. To me it was an amazing exhibition on the floor of the House of Representatives. The Constitution of the United States, as the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Johnson] has said, guaranties to the people of this country this right; and it goes farther than that, it forbids Congress to so legislate as to abridge that right. Not only that, Mr. Speaker, but by the usage of Congress and by the common understanding of all of us, the petitioner who comes here respectfully to express his opinion is not to be criticised in his absence, and his motives are not to be condemned.

The right of petition carries with it immunity from unjust and unreasonable criticism.

I hold in my hand a memorial from the Ohio conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the representative body of that great church in the locality in which I live. It is composed of a large number of ministers. It was presided over by a most distinguished divine, a bishop of the church. These gentlemen, in their representative capacity, represented 40,000 members of that great and enlightened church.

I would like to know, sir, upon what theory we deny to this body of men a respectful hearing? We are discussing the relationship between a great Christian Nation, our own—Christian upon our own allegation—and a heathen nation—heathen upon our allegation—and we are standing here in the light of the nineteenth century drawing a line of distinction against the other nation, while we are criticising the men of our own Nation who have a right under our own Constitution to be heard. This memorial, presented by them, is couched in the most respectful language—no criticism of Congress, no undue condemnation of this legislation, but simply an expression of opinion.

That great body of Christian gentlemen would have fallen short of their duty if they hold these opinions and did not make them known to us. They speak of the great body of men whom their money and their philanthropy have sent forth to Christianize the heathen in foreign lands, and I take no stand, especially on this legislation, but would have a great curiosity to see what the disciples of the ancient faith of the Chinese would say to the Christian coming into their midst with a copy of this sort of legislation in his pocket, and the speech of the gentleman from California [Mr. Geary] as a part of it, and undertake to teach the doctrine of the lowly Nazareme to the benighted heathen. I think the Chinaman would have great force if he should remark to the missionary, "You had better go to the United States, to the heathen at your own doors."

Mr. Speaker, what source in the United States has a higher right to speak to Congress and to deliver here an expression of its opinion upon such a subject than the Methodist Episcopal Church? I know many members of this conference, men of the highest intelligence, men of the highest patriotism, of the highest piety, men who have never entered upon a question of this sort except as citizens of our common country, expressing their views and opinions upon a great question involving our title to the name of a Christian Nation, such as this. They are the men who, following the leadership of John Wesley, who proclaimed that the world was his parish, have gone forth in the spirit of their Master to do their duty to all mankind.

I do not believe that the gentleman from California intended to attack this great body of men with the bitterness which is implied in his language. I have, therefore, risen, sir, merely to call the attention of the House to the invasion of the spirit of the Constitution in thus refusing a hearing to a respectable petition before Congress. [Applause.]

On the continuation of the same discussion the following day, October 13, Mr. Hooker, of Mississippi, said:—

Now, the honorable gentleman from California [Mr. Geary] read the resolutions of an assemblage of the Methodist Church held in this city during the present year; and allusions have been made in this debate to resolutions of various religious denominations throughout the country on this subject. The gentleman said, "This is the Church interfering with the State!" Why, sir, the very treaty to which the gentleman referred—the treaty which was amended in its terms by the bill which the House passed at his instance—that very treaty itself stipulates for religious freedom in China and religious freedom for the Chinese in America.

The gentleman talks about this being an interference by the Church with the State, an interference by religious bodies with affairs of legislation. I have yet to learn, Mr. Speaker, that because an assemblage of men chance to be gentlemen and Christians, therefore they have not the right to petition the Congress of the United States on any subject they may select. You members who sit here on this floor, go back home and tell your Methodist, and Presbyterian, and Episcopalian, and Catholic constituents that you have refused to consider a petition upon this important subject because it comes from a body of men calling themselves gentlemen and Christians, and you will hear the echo of the answer when next November comes.

They have a right to petition. If they feel honest, conscientious convictions on this subject, it is their duty to petition; and I do not know any enlightened set of men who ought to be listened to with more patience, at least, and more respect by the Congress of the United States, whether here or in the other branch. The right of petition is a sacred right of the American citizen. Does a man lose it because he belongs to a Christian organization? Or does an organized body lose this right of petition because it is interested in Christian work?

Sir, you have now in China missionaries of the great denominations of this country. They have gone there and planted the cross of our Saviour, and they have made converts—not a great many, possibly; still they have made converts. Does the honorable gentleman from California mean to say that he intends to restrict the power of the Almighty to have the cross of our Saviour carried into all lands, whether savage or civilized? Does he mean to say that the Saviour, who died upon the cross, did not die for the 450,000,000 of Mongolians in China, constituting one-third of the human family? Are they to be excluded from the plan of redemption on account of the color of their skins or the almond shape of their eyes? This is a new doctrine to come from a Christian Representative!

It will be noticed in this discussion that Mr. Geary distinctly said, without derogating in the least from the Church or its rights as an organization, that the churchman's right of petition was as a citizen and not as a churchman, and that he had no right to invoke the powerful name of his church to influence legislation. Those who, in referring to this, have supported Mr. Geary invariably recognized this just and correct discrimination. Those, however, who have opposed him in regard to these petitions, without exception, show themselves to be afflicted with that mental blindness,—common to all National Reformers, and by which they and their kind can always be recognized,—which makes them unable to appreciate any distinction between individuals and corporations or organizations. To them a corporation or a State is just as much a "moral person" as the individual citizen. One affirmed that to him it was an entirely new thought that there should be any impropriety in churches influencing legislation as churches; while another desired to know "what source in the United States has a higher right to speak to Congress and to deliver here an expression of its opinion upon such a subject than the Methodist Episcopal Church?"

But, perhaps, Mr. Hooker, of Mississippi, touched the vital point of the matter with most, when he reminded the members upon the floor of the House that if they went back to their Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, and Catholic constituents with the record of having ignored a religious representative petition, they would "hear the echo of the answer when next November comes." The association of the names of the denominations made here is as suggestive as the threat is characteristic.

This discussion of the relation of religion and the churches to Congress and its legislation was prolonged still further, but other notice of it will be deferred until next week.
