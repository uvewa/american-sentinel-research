THERE were five Sundays in the last month of the World's Fair and the attendance upon days was as follows, 48,578; 88,000; 82,774; 138,001; 146,441. Of all its twenty-six Sundays during the World's Fair period, the Fair has been closed during four. In the six different orders in which the matter has been brought before the courts, in only one instance was the rail right for Congress to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday sustained. The whole question has been immediately reversed as to its every detail by a higher court. And yet those who sought the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by Congress, and by the courts, are claiming a great victory. The fact is, it has been as complete a Washington in the World's Fair Sunday cases, as any cause could ever suffered. In the law victories they sought success there has been ignominious defeat. But it has been a great success where they do not care to publicly acknowledge and love it. Their agitation has aroused the hereditary dormant bigotry and fanaticism of hundreds of thousands, and intimidated the more liberal, to such an extent that many they have shown themselves able and willing to exercise. This is a victory which has its value achieved; one not to be proud of, certainly, but a victory.
