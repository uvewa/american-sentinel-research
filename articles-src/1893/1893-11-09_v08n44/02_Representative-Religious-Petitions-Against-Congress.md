On October 11, in the House of Representatives, a bill to amend the Chinese Exclusion Act, extending the time granted Chinamen in this country for registration, or a period of six months after the bill should be passed, was called up, and resulted in considerable reference to religious petitions.

As an instance of the extent of the progress and development of congressional treatment of religious petitions, extracts from the *Record* are worthy of note and reference.

Upon the reading of the bill by the clerk Mr. Hitt, of Illinois, obtained the floor to speak; in the course of his address saying:

I have on my hand-desk here a large number of petitions from representatives of the annual conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church from all over the country, and from prominent citizens, Senators, and Members of Congress of the United States, representing the churches, most of them asking for the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act and the policy of treaties of exclusion against China, and for liberty of Chinese registration. These petitions represent millions of people.

This brought up the question of representative religious petitions before Congress, and Mr. Geary, of California, in his speech, said:

I have before me a petition which I want to read.

> To the Referee Committee of the Methodist Episcopal Church, 13th congress of 6th delegation, representing all the Methodist Episcopal conferences in the United States:
>
> We hereby the undersigned members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, believing in common with all Christian people everywhere in the separation of Church and State, and that neither the Church or the State can mix in matters of the other without demoralization and corruption of both. We make this earnest appeal to the 6th delegation congress to ask all Methodist ministers and laity to absolutely refrain from taking any part in the movement to secure the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion laws, and in this connection we earnestly assert that the petitions sent to Congress from conferences were never authorized by, and are not representative of the several churches. The petitions that they were adopted by a standing vote—and are really only the expressions of a few men who happened to be present, and not the membership of the Methodist Church, which as a body, is a popular tribunal of fact.

This petition is not from the Methodist Episcopal Church—not the American Board, which does its work in China and is interested in China, and is also represented from China, but is represented so broadly from many of the religious conventions that this alone would attract attention, and is represented by the most reputable members.

It did not matter whether the Methodists or the American Board are represented, so far as the right to petition, they all are free to petition, and of course they have the right. But the only purpose for which these petitions were used was to bring them peculiarly suggestive. But the only purpose for which these petitions were used was to bring them before the country, and its effects and the country has seen it.

I would not be far from the truth if I said that the greatest number of these petitions, signed by the most intelligent, most of the highest patriotic Americans, a good many thousands of them, petitioned upon a question of this sort except as at the dictation of the politicians as their representatives before Congress. We acquired our title to the name of a Christian Nation, not through the practices of these men; those men who built up the country, who made it what it is, who conquered everything that stood in the way, in short, who brought the world was his parish, have gone forth to the four corners of the world to preach the Bible.

I do not believe that the gentlemen from China or Siam or Turkey or wherever they come from, are in sympathy and accord with the bitterness which is implied in its legislation against a people with whom they are in direct contact, and I appeal to the better spirits of the Constitution in this referring; a hearing is all that was asked.

On the continuation of the same discussion the following day, October 13, Mr. Hitt was followed by Mr. Johnson,—

Now, the honorable gentleman from California was not justified, in my opinion, in making the reference he did. These petitions have been coming in during the present year; and alliances have been made in advocacy of such rights and privileges, from missionaries throughout the country on this subject; and I submit in all seriousness that this is a respectable and representative constituency to which the gentleman referred—the treaty question, and the disposition of the people toward the Chinese. The position that people shall stipulate for religion freedom in China and the proper protection of our missionaries.

The gentleman talks about this being an interference of the Church with the State. I want just to learn, Mr. Speaker, that because an individual is a member of a church he should not petition the Congress of the United States on any public question. That is what it amounts to.

Mr. Hitt. To that I reply that, a whole church or denomination, as such, has no more right to say to an American Congress, "you must do this," than a masonic order, as such, has to do so. That is the true American principle of the separation of Church and State; that each within its appropriate sphere is entirely independent and supreme; they never lay its hand on government, and the Government never interferes with it or its members, in their several religious rights. Any member of any denomination in the land has the same right to petition, as a citizen, and to exercise in full his civil rights as such, and not invoke the powerful name

of the congregations as bludgeons to make this matter all the more impressive before the name of millions of members, who have no voice or interest in such matters.

There is one thing more than another which all American churches have approved the declaration of the Constitution of the United States on the civil rights of man. This principle is as old as the churches themselves, and it embodies the spirit of Christianity, of common justice, and of civilization.

The Church has had the right of interference in matters of State, and in this country there were of our fathers, earnest men and women who relied on the provisions of this Constitution, men who came from old civilized nations in Europe, and from elsewhere from whence they came the evils and dangers of a union of Church and State.

These churches have a right to say, and they have spoken out what the faith of that government is. But when these churches speak in Congress, Protestantism could not forget its historic motto, "freedom of conscience."

There is a significance in this that rebukes Protestantism at the hands of Protestants. All alike must bear the rebuke and profit by the example of the government that will maintain human rights, protection against any discrimination, and that maintains and protects its citizenry against religious interference by any sect.

Let the church take care of its own charges, in its own sphere must be supreme. Let the Church carry on its vast charitable work untrammeled. But when it lays the unhallowed hand of a great denomination upon the State, it sows corruption, not worthy for the application of truth and love in the highest of all services, and a violation of the simple fundamental principle upon which the country and the adjoining derive serves from the beginning to now in the keeping of the union, feeling constantly wherever it may find it. It is a mission of all and of all mankind. It goes forth to all the world and preaches the gospel, the confession of faith, but when it reaches the border, where it trespasses on the rights of the citizen, there it has committed an infraction of civil law.

The Church in this country has no right to call upon Congress for any legislative action. It is not an American legislative body, and is without the right to press its claims in ways and forms foreign to the spirit of the Republic.

I care not what church it may be; it is a separate tribunal. There was a day in the world's history when no voice was raised against the union of Church and State. When Martin Luther stood up, Pope and cardinal were responded by presenting their influence for their punishment and suffering; and that great spirit that moved through the human race, in past, never to relent. In this land the voice was raised for freedom of conscience, which through the Constitution guaranteed the right of the church not to interfere with the political affairs of the State.

The Methodist Episcopal Church, organized under the leadership of misguided outside have carried petitions to Congress, all unauthorized by its membership. But let us ask the question when on other reflection the great mass of the membership of that great denomination cannot believe that it is their wish or proper to interfere directly in this matter by using the church? If any good intention lies behind, let us accept it in that spirit but it cannot be held as a proper course with the affairs of this country, because if we conceded to them the right of representation as an organization, we should have at once to establish the function of religious and political representation of a union between Church and State, of religion and policy, and I do not think that the American people are prepared for it. The members of the Protestant churches especially, are not ready for it. They will not stand a union of Church and State.

What would they think and what would they say, if, instead of the Methodist Episcopal Church it was the Catholic Church for the State of New York that sent its petitions in the name of thousands of its members, as a great organization? If the Jesuits in behalf of the policy dictated by the Propaganda, and all the great Catholic orders, were to petition the Congress of the United States, in the interest of the church or interfered with some religion or policy, there would be a very different feeling from the one now expressed. I know that every Protestant pulpit would have been ablaze with indignation. They would have been conservative, and we would have the grind old spectre of the union of Church and State raised up in its most hideous deformity, and that would have been the feeling of all; indeed the great national religious bodies have been doing from all their pulpits in the broad land, and they would have had very great effect, for it is in attack the exercises of this, to attempt to enforce the will of the church in political matters, makes a monstrous and dangerons precedent.

Regarding the relation of religion and the churches to Congress and the legislation of the country, of which we shall give other notice of it will be deferred until another opportunity.
