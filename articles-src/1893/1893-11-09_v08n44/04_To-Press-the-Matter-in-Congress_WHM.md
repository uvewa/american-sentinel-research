The National Reform Association has sent out a call for a national convention to be held in Allegheny, Pa., Nov. 14, 15, and 16, in the First United Presbyterian Church, on Union Avenue, of that city. The claim of this call for the assembling of a national convention is, that the contest as to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair has "demonstrated the overwhelming strength of the Christian sentiment of our country;" but has shown also that this "sentiment" is not strong enough to maintain itself without the assistance of an express statement to the fundamental law of the land. To devise means to secure such an expression this convention is called. The religious laws of the country, as they now are, it seems, are quite insufficient for the purposes of the "National Reformers," for they say:

> We have had actual proof that our national laws, as they now stand, are not sufficient to prevent great enterprises like the World's Fair, or State Courts, or even our highest national courts, such as the United States Appellate Circuit Court at Chicago, from transforming our American Sabbath into a continental Sunday. Political wisdom and Christian patriotism alike dictate that something must now be done to give permanent expression to the Christian sentiment at present so thoroughly aroused. The whole country has been stirred by the struggle for the Sabbath, And now that the victory has been won, let the fruits be secured. Let the Christian Sabbath sentiment of the United States be crystallized in some appropriate and permanent national and legal form.

The field secretary of the association, H. H. George, follows with two columns of intense appeal for attendance of delegates at this convention, and for money, for, as he says,—

three to five thousand dollars will be needed for the distribution of literature beforehand, and sending a committee to Congress after the convention is over to press the matter there. Some heroic men are struggling to make it [this convention] the grandest success of any such meeting that has ever been held in this Nation. You have all taken a deep interest in the Sabbath discussion for the last two years. You must not let it drop now. Don't you know that if the matter ends here, the agitation will cease and the country will be where it began two years ago? There must be an advance step. The agitation must be clinched by sensational action.

William Weir, writing of his work for the National Reform Association in Western Pennsylvania, says:—

Especially has the purpose of the convention to arrange to press the long Sabbath agitation of the country to a conclusion in the enactment of a national law securing the Sabbath to every citizen, been urged on their attention.

Will this convention, or this association, or any other body of men, be able to press this long agitation to a conclusion? No! It will not be brought to a conclusion until the second coming of Him who is Lord of the Sabbath. Then will those who are striving to secure the enactment of laws, State and national, for the enforcement of the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, be ready to answer to Him when he shall ask them by what authority they assume to enforce a Sabbath rest? And what answer will they have ready when He shall ask them for what reason they have neglected to remember that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, but have observed the first, and at the same time have both taught and compelled others to obedience to the same error?
