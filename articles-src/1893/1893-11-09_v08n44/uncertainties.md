# Uncertainties — v08n44 (1893-11-09)

## Article 02 — "Representative Religious Petitions Again in Congress"

- **Location:** Page 1-3, petition text quoted by Mr. Geary
- **Issue:** The petition text contains garbled or OCR-corrupted phrases: "to the ground of justice and fair doubt, to whom trustagreement" — this appears to be corrupted OCR of original petition language about treaty rights and fair dealing. The sense is that the Chinese are entitled to fair treatment under treaty.
- **Transcribed as:** reproduced as-is from OCR source, preserving the apparent corruption
- **Confidence:** LOW — the original petition text likely read something different; the OCR has clearly introduced errors here ("trustagreement" is not a word)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the sense of the passage suggests original may have read something like "to whom by trust agreement" or similar treaty language

## Article 02 — Mr. Grosvenor's speech

- **Location:** Page 3, Grosvenor's speech
- **Issue:** "teach the doctrine of the lowly Nazareme" — "Nazareme" appears to be an OCR error for "Nazarene"
- **Transcribed as:** "Nazareme" — preserved as it appears in OCR source; likely a scan artifact
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly should read "Nazarene"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes

## Article 05 — Van Horn thesis (p. 5)

- **Location:** Footnote on page 5
- **Issue:** "*Gladden, Applied Christianity, pp. 252, 253." — this appears as a footnote in the original. It is retained in the article text as it appears.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — clear footnote reference

## Article 05 — Tennessee constitution quote

- **Location:** Page 5
- **Issue:** "indefeasible" is transcribed from OCR as "indefensible" — the original Tennessee constitution text uses "indefeasible"
- **Transcribed as:** "indefeasible" — corrected from likely OCR error "indefensible" based on knowledge of the actual constitutional text
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — corrected based on context and known legal language

## Article 08 — Hebrew word note

- **Location:** Page 6-7, F. C. Gilbert article
- **Issue:** The original contains Hebrew characters which the OCR could not reproduce. The footnote states: "Our correspondent, who is an educated and converted Hebrew, has inserted here the original Hebrew characters, but as we have not the proper type, we use instead their translated equivalent, which he gives." The OCR renders the Hebrew word as "* (Nazer)."
- **Transcribed as:** "* (Nazer)" — retained the asterisk placeholder as it appears; the original had Hebrew script
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the note itself; the asterisk represents missing Hebrew characters

## Article 09 — "Will Jesus Yoke Up" quote source

- **Location:** Page 8
- **Issue:** This appears as a stand-alone quoted passage with no attribution. It may be a quote from an external source or an editorial aphorism. No author is identified.
- **Transcribed as:** editorial attribution
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## General note on page 8 editorial items
