[The following is a concise statement of the relation of Protestants and Roman Catholics to the Government finances, by a correspondent of the Legal American.]

WOULD it not be well to give a few facts regarding the use of public money for sectarian purposes?

In the year of 1885 a "Bureau of Catholic Missions" was established at Washington, D. C. The chief design of this was to "push Catholic schools upon the Government as earnestly as possible." In September of this same year, this same bureau secured from the commissioner of Indian affairs, Mr. Adkin, the following statement:

> The Government should be liberal in making contracts with religious denominations to teach Indian children in schools established by these denominations. It should throw open the door, and say to all denominations. "There should be no monopoly of good work. Enter, all of you, and do whatever your hands find of good work to do, and in your efforts the Government will give you encouragement out of its liberal purse." In other words, the Government, without partiality, should encourage all the churches to work in this broad field of philanthropic endeavor.—Congressional Record, of July 25, 1890, p. 8341.

The door was thrown open at once, and the Catholic Church entered with a number of professed Protestant churches to secure the governmental "encouragement" thus offered. In the five succeeding years they made the following record of drafts upon the people's money, as shown by the Congressional Record above quoted:

In the year 1886—Catholic $118,343 | All others $109,906

In the year 1887—Catholic $194,635 | All others $169,679

In the year 1888—Catholic $221,169 | All others $155,095

In the year 1889—Catholic $347,672 | All others $183,000

In the years 1889-90—Catholic $356,767 | All others $204,993

Total for Catholic schools $1,138,786

Total for all other denominations and all other schools $821,683

But President Harrison, with General Morgan as Indian Commissioner, determined to stop these appropriations, and let the churches support their own missionary work. But the administration was forced to make confession before the Senate, by Senator Dawes, that "it found it impossible to do that;" and "that it was impossible to retrace the step." Finding "it was impossible," it was determined to allow no increase. But the Catholic Church ignored the wishes of Congress, and secured the increase she desired for the year 1890, of $44,000.

Seeing that the Catholics were getting the lion's share, as they always do, the Protestant churches raised the cry of "thief." But this was in bad taste, coming from those who had shared the plunder, and established a precedent.

Nearly all the Protestant churches have now changed their mind, and concluded to take no more "encouragement" from the Government. But what can they say? The Catholic Church says: "We have not changed our mind. You once said it was the right thing for Government to do. We agreed with you. And we believe it still. You opened the doors. We entered together. And now we shall keep the door open." And so millions of dollars of the people's money is being used for the advancement of sectarianism. And to this extent does Rome rule the Nation. And still Protestants sleep on and vainly imagine that she is becoming Americanized.
