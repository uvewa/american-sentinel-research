In the course of an extended notice of a lately published work by Judge Charles P. Daly, entitled "The Jews in North America," the New York Sun says:—

> It is commonly said that Lord Baltimore made religious freedom the basis of his colony of Maryland, Judge Daly points out that the freedom was limited to those professing to believe in Jesus Christ and was accompanied by a proviso that any person who denied the Trinity should be punished with death. Maryland, therefore, was no place for Jews and the rigorous exclusion of all professors of the Jewish faith was maintained for a long time after the war of independence. As late as 1819, although John Adams, Jefferson and Madison united in expressing their condemnation of the intolerant restriction, the legislature refused to abolish it. A few years afterward, however, the provision was repealed.

In a pamphlet, published in 1876, by Rev. B. F. Brown, containing the substance of a lecture delivered by himself in Baltimore, upon the early religious history of Maryland, the position was taken and supported that Maryland never was a Roman Catholic colony, and that the "Act of Toleration," of the assembly of 1649, was nothing other, at the most, than the political measure of a Roman Catholic nobleman under pressure of a Protestant majority,—necessary to the maintenance of his position in authority.
