In an address before the House of Representatives, on Chinese exclusion, delivered Oct. 13, Hon. James G. Maguire, of California, referring to the previous remarks of his colleague, Mr. Geary, said:—

> I make the same objection to the attempts of these religious bodies to reinforce their perfectly proper personal petitions by appeals to the power and membership of their respective churches. I deny that any religious conference in this country, or any religious association in the United States, represents or is authorized to speak for the political sentiments or political opinions of those who constitute the membership of their churches. I deny that any annual conference of two hundred ministers has a right to control, or does control, or does represent, the political sentiments of the sixty-four thousand members of its faith.

These objections to this kind of petitioning are sound and sensible, and they apply with just the same force to all that wholesale "representative" petitioning which frightened the Fifty-second Congress into that piece of unconstitutional legislation for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, which will be its shame to the end of time.
