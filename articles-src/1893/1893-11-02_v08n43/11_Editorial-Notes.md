NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 2, 1893.

DURING the November term of court, in Oakland, seven Seventh-day Adventists, of Queen Adams and Kent Counties, are to be tried for Sunday labor.

A TELEGRAPHIC news item of Oct. 23, is to the effect that the Grand Jury of Baker County, Alabama, has indicted sixty persons for voting on Indian languages, and that a test case will be made. The entire list of existing religionists left room for things are the flying straws which show the direction from which the storm is coming.

THE Congregational Club of Cleveland, Ohio, has undertaken to suppress all Sunday observance in that city, and has appointed a committee to confer with other organizations and adopt some plan by which to secure the strict observance of Sunday. The "other organizations," with which the committee is to confer, are probably the Law and Order League and the municipal police.

THE municipal election in Newport, New York, last week resulted in the working the election of the *Mail and Express*, turned upon the Sabbath question. The qualification of one candidate for Mayor was that he was "a church member," a man and would continue in the work, almost legally, of "closing up the unnecessary places" of business on Sunday." The appearance of the "Christian party" in politics is not confined to New Jersey.

THE "Sabbath Association," of Maryland, base their resolution:—

*Resolved*, That as respective committee of the Maryland Sabbath Association invites the attention of all Christians that it has a reasonable cause in this State, where the Christian Sabbath was first made law and as on the occasion of the first national Lord's-day convention. It asks all the friends of the Lord's day to come to the matter, under direction of the president of the association.

*Resolved*, That the ministers of the various denominations of the State of Baltimore authorize them members at a meeting to take place in the "early autumn," as in November or December meeting, as may best serve the cause.

How would it do for these resolutions to use as a campaign with which to illustrate their subject the seven cases of seventh-day observers' list. Sunday and the law observance in Maryland, during November. The commandment reads, "Six days shalt thou labor" the first-day observance law of Maryland compels the seventh-day observer to disobey the injunction to labor six days, or else ignores the commandment by reasoning that every day is the Sabbath of the Lord. Will the ministers of Maryland advise the "Sabbath Association" and American Sabbath Union to continue to strive against God in this matter of his commandment?

IN an address before the House of Representatives, on Chinese exclusion, delivered Oct. 13, Hon. James G. Maguire, of California, referring to the previous promises of his colleague, Mr. Geary, said:—

I make the same objection to the attempts of anti-Chinese agitators to declare the privileges and membership of their respective churches. I don't believe that religious convictions, prejudice or sentiment is authorized to repeal the political contract the membership of their churches. I deny that any organization or class of men have the right to repeal the political sentiments of the day or generate upon the political conduct of any citizen.

These objections to this kind of petitions, however, to the man who opposes them here, with just the same force to all that wholesale "representative" petitioning which frightened the Fifty-second Congress into that piece of unconstitutional legislation for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, which will be its shame to the end of time.

THE attendance at the World's Fair on Sunday, Oct. 15, was 87,574, and on Sunday, Oct. 22, reached the number of 140,- 859. Such a Sunday attendance as this together with the fact that the great World's Fair is now an assured financial success, despite the enormous initial expenditure that was made, and also in consideration of the remarkable clemency of the World's Fair itself, from loss by storm, from destructive storms which have swept the country so generally, and the unusually pleasant weather and comfortable temperature which that section has experienced during the continuance of the Fair, would seem to show that the Sunday closing doctrine, who proclaimed it, that if the Fair opened on Sunday, should be classed among the false prophets.

IN the course of an extended notice of a lately published work by Judge Charles P. Daly, entitled "The Jews in North America," the *New York Sun* says:—

It is commonly said that Lord Baltimore made Maryland a free colony in point of religion. It is true that Lord Judge Daly pointed out that the "Act of Toleration" of 1649, while purporting to extend religious freedom to all believers in Jesus Christ only extended it to those that professed faith in the Trinity, and who denied the Trinity should be punished with death and confiscation of their property, and that Jewish faith was maintained for a long time after the first settlement of Maryland. While posing upon their condemnation of the intolerant and bigoted colonists of Virginia. Within a few years afterward, however, the provision was changed.

In a pamphlet, published in 1876, by Rev. R. F. Burns, he combating the substance of a lecture delivered by himself in Baltimore, upon the early religious history of Maryland, this position was taken and proved that Maryland never was a Roman Catholic colony, and that the "Act of Toleration," of the assembly of 1649, was nothing either, as the truth being the political measure of a Roman Catholic colonist under pressure of a Protestant majority,—necessary to the maintenance of his position in society.

In connection with this matter we have also seen the matter on page 343, entitled "Money for Sectarian Purposes."

The fact and statistics in reference to national and municipal appropriations for the support of sectarian institutions of the emphasis most forcibly the warning which the SENTINEL has been forced to give as to the tendency in which this country is moving. Rome does already rule the Nation. Not the Roman Catholic Church is strong enough to meet her alone. Those who, as it were, calling themselves Protestants, methods which they use as to become themselves Roman Catholic in spirit, and in everything but name—which amount to them only as a cloak and a deception. Those who call themselves Protestants, and who profess to stand for the defense of liberty against Rome and its tyranny— Catholicism is a great political organization, and as they make an exact copy of their latest energy and make of Protestantism a great political organization. The true method of these facts of the land is a sure apostrophe of the masses and the justice of the biblical denunciation of the beast and the image to the beast.

It was the radical mistake of the Puritans, that so enthroned in the establishment of this country. The mistake from which the nation has not yet recovered is their mingling and identifying civil and religious jurisdiction, and children attending secular education, and of such attendance, as for more earlier on that account, that the attendance of their children upon schools would contribute in due proportion to the civil welfare of the State.

"Thoughts" on the part of the Protestantism Churches, backed by "the ministers of Maryland advise the Sabbath Union for such an alliance between the secular and the religious sentiments as shall be irresistible." And this Protestantism along on the same lines and for the same purpose, Mrs. Sedall, to show that "Romanism, which the Puritans are constantly taught to be mean—"

A coming scheme, a crafty plan of the strictest wedge to secure a national religion by the instructions given by natural and studied teachers, in building denominational schools with his character. As a starter, Dr. Pond is now bending all his forces in an attack upon the right to labor.
