THE *Chicago Herald*, of May 28, quotes from the pastor of the Ashland Avenue Methodist Church, as preaching the following words to his Methodist congregation the day before:—

It is sometimes urged against Sunday observance that the Sabbath of the old dispensation was Saturday, not Sunday. Granted that this is true, is it still good for the day as well as for the man, that the law of the Sabbath is for all time, and not the seventh day shall be observed as the Sabbath; that the principle of the Sabbath is above the day. The substance of the Sabbath is universal, except that which is strained and forced by interpretation.

Everything considered, Mr. Miller's claim is entirely groundless. There is no legal ground on which Sunday observance rests, a closely allied position. "We Christians," more Roman Catholics, are able to show Methodists and so slow to bring grave charges, because they present the theory by false evidence.

Testing Mr. Miller's words at each point, and that the change of observation was against the Methodists, with per-
haps the exception of one or two minor and formal points, it will prove his view is to be entirely unsupported.

Compare with this statement from the SENTINEL that has been previously published in these columns. The Roman Catholic says: "You will tell me that Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath, but that the Christian Sabbath has been changed to Sunday. Changed! but by whom? Who has authority to change an express commandment of Almighty God? When God has spoken and said, Thou shalt keep holy the seventh day, who shall dare to say, Nay, thou mayest work and do all manner of worldly business on the seventh day; but thou shalt keep holy the first day in its stead? This is a most important question, which I know not how you can answer. You are a Protestant, and you profess to go by the Bible and the Bible only; and yet in so important a matter as the observance of one day in seven as a holy day, you go against the plain letter of the Bible, and put another day in the place of that day which the Bible has commanded. The command to keep holy the seventh day is one of the ten commandments; you believe that the other nine are still binding; who gave you authority to tamper with the fourth? If you are consistent with your own principles, if you really follow the Bible and the Bible only, you ought to be able to produce some portion of the New Testament in which this fourth commandment is expressly altered."

Will I observe the day God commanded, or the day man has appointed in its place? Will I call upon the governors of the States to enforce observance of a day, and whether the reasons for its observance are civil or religious?
