[Continuation of a thesis by T. J. Van Horn of the University of Chicago.]

To one who has studied the history of criminal legislation it will appear that Puritan legislation in general was a decided improvement upon previous codes in its spirit of humanity. Bancroft says, "A crowd of offenses was at one sweep brushed from the catalogue of capital crimes." But when we remember that in the name of religion about fifteen crimes were punishable by death, we at least get some idea of the cruelties of legislation preceding this age. We feel like justifying the remark of Ellis, that "The only possible attraction which an historical student in these days can find in rehearsing the policy and rule of puritanism in early Massachusetts, and the only relief of which he can avail himself in facing its repelling feature, is in the attempt to trace the chronological and philosophical relation in puritanism in the development of theories, beliefs, and experiments in human society and government."

We cannot hope to answer the question, what has been the influence of this legislation upon subsequent generations with anything like mathematical precision. So many causes have been acting and reacting: so many streams of influence have converged to color our present religious life: that it would be difficult to say what would be distinctly Puritan. There would be little dissent, however, from the proposition, to which I have already alluded, that there are many things of genuine worth in the moral and religious life of America to-day which are an heritage, more or less direct from puritanism. But we are to distinguish between the influence of those sterling qualities of honesty and integrity of purpose exhibited in the lives of these men, and the influence of their legislation which was the expression of what was abnormal in their religious life. It is true that the laws enacted by the people are expressive of the moral character of the people. But the Puritans revealed in the application of their laws to human society, a total misconception of the relation of the Bible to civil government, and the true method of its application in the suppression of evil. The system of legislation prescribed for ancient Israel, although the best which, in the state of development, God could make use of, was not the ideal system.

It was the radical mistake of the Puritans to attempt to apply this system, which God alone knew how to use, to people in a more enlightened age.

It would be pleasant as panegyrists have done, to dwell only upon the bright side of their life and its influence: but ours is the more sombre task of dwelling on the influence of their legislation. Let us consider, first, its direct influence:—

What, then, must be the effect upon the general public of seeing a man sitting in the stocks for what the civil authorities regard as a violation of the Lord's day? What must be the effect upon the mind of one in whom there remains a spark of the spirit of liberty on seeing a man banished from his home and forced to flee in the middle of winter into the wilderness for daring to deny the immortality of the soul: or openly condemn or oppose the baptism of infants: or "purposely depart the congregation at the administration of that ordinance:" or the "ordinance of the magistracy"? What reproach must be brought upon the cross of Christ among non-Christians by seeing the authorities, his professed followers, whipping through the streets at a cart's tail, even so offensive characters as the Quakers doubtless were then? By an enactment in the name of religion, fining a person heavily for keeping them over night or even attending their meetings: by seeing them even tried and executed as capital criminals. What bitter prejudices must be engendered against religion in the minds of those outside of the church, by being deprived of the privileges of citizenship, on account of not being able to conscientiously join in church relationship with the Puritans, and yet be compelled to pay his assessment for the support of the preacher established among them! How ample the opportunity for criticism of the religion of Christ when its avowed adherents, basing their authority upon God's word, impose the penalty of banishment for the persistent denial of a doctrine so utterly unscriptural as infant baptism; and a fine for carrying a burden, or traveling on Sunday, concerning whose sanctity the Bible is entirely silent. Yet, that which, on prior grounds, we conclude must have been the influence of these things, is confirmed by what the influence upon public sentiment actually was when Roger Williams was forced to flee from the colony for teaching doctrines out of harmony with the established creed; when Anne Hutchinson and Wheelwright were banished; when Dunster was deposed at Harvard; when a storm of indignation arose in the colonies and in England over the fine of forty pounds, twenty pounds, and five pounds respectively, imposed upon three persons, and the cruel whipping inflicted upon one of them, who would not pay his fine, for holding a private meeting for preaching and administering the Lord's Supper. It affords some relief to know that many in the court opposed these severe measures; but this could not check the prejudice excited against Christianity by their cruelties, nor stay the tide of popular hate which was rising against puritanism and hastening its overthrow.

Second, its decline:—

History has entered its protest against the aim, such as the Puritans had in view, of setting up a kingdom of God on earth by civil power. Christ himself has said, "My kingdom is not of this world," and it was a wide departure from the Christ method when the Puritans attempted to force men to be good. Consequently, we should expect to see the reaction which took place in England upon the fall of puritanism there and the restoration of Charles II. Let us call Green to witness:—

> In an instant the whole face of England was changed. All that was noblest and best in puritanism was whirted away with its pettiness and its tyranny in the current of the nation's hate. Religion had been turned into a system of political and social oppression, and it fell with their fall. Godliness became a byword of scorn: sobriety in dress, in speech, in manners was flouted as a mask of the detested puritanism. Butler, in his "Hullibras," poured forth insult on the past with the pedantic buffoonery for which the general hatred, far more than its humor, secured a hearing.
>
> Duelling and raking became the marks of a fine gentleman, and grave divines winked at the follies of "honest fellows" who fought, gambled, swore, drank, and ended a day of debauchery by a night in the gutter. Life among men of fashion vibrated between frivolity and excess.
>
> Lord Rochester was a fashionable poet, and the titles of some of his poems were such as no pen of our day could copy. Sir Charles Sedley was a fashionable wit, and the foulness of his words made even the porters of Covent Garden pelt him from the balcony when he ventured to address them. The Duke of Buckingham is a fair type of the time, and the most characteristic event in the duke's life was a duel in which he consummated his seduction of Lady Shrewsbury, by killing her husband, while the countess, in disguise as a page, held his horse for him and looked on at the murder.†

Green admits that it is easy to exaggerate the extent of this reaction. Yet there was a similar reaction in Geneva following Calvin's rigid discipline; and we are not surprised to find that historians assign, as one of the causes of the gross immorality and grossness which prevailed in New England early in the 18th century, the reaction against puritanism. The stormy political aspect of the times; the immigration of a new class of inhabitants; the Half Way Covenant; and new currents of sentiment from the Old World under the influence of the rising spirit of radical inquiry, are the four causes, assigned by Dorchester,‡ of the decline of puritanism in New England. The last of these was owing, in some degree, to the reaction against the hyper-Calvinistic mode of thought so characteristic of puritanism. While the Half Way Covenant was the direct result of the reaction against the Puritan law which excluded persons from the privileges of citizenship unless they were church members.

Thus, puritanism could not avoid the logical consequences of its fundamental error, and the system fell by the force of its own inconsistencies. But its influence did not end with its fall. It projected into the stream of religious thought and action vicious principles, along with its elements of good, still active, whose influence we shall attempt to trace as we consider the influence of puritanism on nineteenth century Christianity.
