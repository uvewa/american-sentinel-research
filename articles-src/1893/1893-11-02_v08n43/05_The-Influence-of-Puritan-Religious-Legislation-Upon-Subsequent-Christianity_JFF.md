*A Course of History.*

THAT the influence of puritanical religious legislation is evil will appear that much more vividly when we pause to consider improvement upon previous codes of law more definitely. The fact is that "A crowd of reforms was at once seen to be needed. Morality had deteriorated." But when we remember that the whole force of religious enactment thrust crimes were punishable by death, we at least get some conception of the effect such laws were producing that day. We feel like justifying it.

It will be impossible for us to give that positive attention which an historical student in these matters has paid to the results of legislation in all its force and effect. Monarchy and rule of the Puritans in New England was a theocracy in its spelling features, is in the attempt to crush its real manifestation of Christianity has resulted in puritanism in the development of just a condition of affairs, both in human society and government.

We would base upon to note the hypothesis most forcibly the warning which the SENTINEL has been forced to give as to the tendency in which this country is moving. Rome does already rule the Nation. Not has the Roman Catholic Church is strong enough to meet her. Those who, as it were, calling themselves Protestants, methods which they use as to become themselves Roman Catholic in spirit, and in everything but name—which amount to them only as a cloak and a deception. Those who call themselves Protestants, and who profess to stand for the defense of liberty against Rome and its tyranny— Catholicism is a great political organization, and as they make an exact copy of their latest energy and make of Protestantism a great political organization, the true method of these facts of the land is a sure apostrophe of the masses and the justice of the biblical denunciation of the beast and the image to the beast.

The accomplishment of this purpose did not avail the Puritans that religion should every one say, that most beneficent institution in the principles which are the spirit of the churches, but of the best thinking classes of the land generally.

We must leave to a later issue a further consideration of these matters.
