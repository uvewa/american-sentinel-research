Civil—Pertaining to a city or State, or to a citizen in his relation to his fellow citizens or to the city or State.—Webster.

Government—The exercise of authority; the administration of laws.—Ibid.

By these definitions it is clearly seen that civil government points out the duties that we owe to each other and to the city or State as civil beings: and exercises authority in seeing that these are carried out.

Question, why was civil government demanded? Because of sin, which was the working out of selfishness. This invaded the rights of others, and a demand for the protection of life and property arose, in order that man's natural rights might be secured. This is seen in the history of Cain and Abel, and here is where civil government began. When these two brothers offered sacrifices, and Abel's offering was accepted while Cain's was rejected, Cain's anger arose, then the Lord began to reason with him: "Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin listh at the door: and unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him." In ruling over Abel, Cain was to give him his natural rights, which he evidently refused to do, for as soon as opportunity presented itself and his anger was strong enough, he slew his brother, and thus took away his natural rights to life and happiness. When the Lord demanded of him his brother's life, Cain's rebellion was stirred again, and he said: "Am I my brother's keeper?" In all this Cain rebelled against God and civil government, and the Lord punished him for it by bringing an additional curse upon him and the ground. "When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth." Afterward Cain acknowledged God's justice in establishing civil government and pleaded for self-protection, saying: "My punishment is greater than I can bear . . . and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me." But the Lord promised him protection, saying, "Whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should slay him."

Later on we find that as selfishness increased and men's lives became more and more in danger, the Lord said, "At the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. Whose sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." In this inspired record we have the origin and object of civil government, namely, that which secures to each person his or her inherent rights to life, liberty and property, and protection in the use of the same.

Liberty is here used in the sense of perfect freedom to think, speak and act out one's own convictions of duty in matters of faith and religion, irrespective of any other man's opinion, so long as he does not take away the same rights from others by so doing. This definition applies just as fully with reference to life and property as it does in matters of faith and religion.

From these facts it will be seen that the civil power has nothing to do whatsoever with a man's religious belief or practices; this is a matter that pertains solely to each individual, independent of every other individual or government. No matter whether a person be a Christian or a Catholic or a Buddhist, the same rights belong to each one alike; they may worship, how, when, and where they please, so long as they do not infringe upon the same rights of others, and the civil government has nothing to say about it because these are inherent rights that existed before civil government existed, being co-existent with man himself. God gave these rights to man, and he is responsible to God alone for the exercise of these rights. Moreover, our Government cannot give these rights because it never possessed them to give; and this fact is well stated in the Declaration of Independence—"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." No one could ask more or less of any government, neither can any government grant less or more; for this is complete and perfect liberty both civil and religious. It is just what Jesus Christ established and taught when he said, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." It is just what our Constitution guarantees to all its citizens in the First Amendment—"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

These rights and privileges were further guaranteed to the citizens of this Government in Article 6 of the Constitution, last clause—"No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust under the United States." By these quotations it is plain to be seen that the founders of our Government understood the true object of civil government. But lo! and behold, all these principles, which every lover of liberty supposed were granted to them, are being taken away. H. J. FARMAN.
