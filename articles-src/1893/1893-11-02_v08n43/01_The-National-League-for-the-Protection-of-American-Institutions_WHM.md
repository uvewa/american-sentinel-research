THE National League for the Protection of American Institutions has sent to the public press a circular letter,—addressed to the candidates of all parties for the position of delegate to the forthcoming constitutional convention in the State of New York,—with a request for editorial comment.

THE constitution of this league states the purpose of its organization, as follows:

The objects of the League are to secure constitutional and legislative safeguards for the protection of the Common School system and other American institutions, and to promote public instruction in harmony with such institutions, and to prevent all sectarian or denominational appropriation of public funds.

The National League is absolutely unsectarian and non-partisan in character. It is proposed to secure an amendment to the United States Constitution prohibiting sectarian legislation by the States. The Amendment, in form as submitted by the Law Committee, has been adopted by the Board of Managers.

The general secretary and original promoter of the league is Rev. James M. King, and the chairman of its law committee is Wm. Allen Butler.

THE constitutional amendment which the league has formulated and presented to Congress and advocated before its committees, is this:

No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, society, or undertaking, which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

Petitions asking favorable action upon this proposed amendment have been extensively circulated, and, throughout the entire summer, visitors to the World's Fair have been asked for their signatures to it, at a booth on the second floor of the Liberal Arts Building.

"A RESPECTFUL request to candidates of all parties for delegate to the New York State constitutional convention, for their opinion in reference to questions touching the protection of American institutions, and especially of the separation of the Church and State and of religious liberty," is the language with which the letter is entitled, then, with the proper blanks for the addressing of the candidate personally, it proceeds to say that it speaks in behalf of "The National League for the Protection of American Institutions" and "the constituency which it represents"; and that its purposes, principles and work "are in strict accord with the provisions of the National and State Constitutions," and with the pledges of the Republican and Democratic parties in 1876; it pleads further that "the membership of the league is absolutely non-partisan and unsectarian in character," and appeals to its list of officers and members to substantiate the plea.

AN expression of opinion is then asked upon a number of points, with spaces left below each query for the reply. Here will be the proper opportunity for comment. This is the first question:

1. Do you hold that the American principle of the separation of Church and State must be sacredly observed by the National and State Governments, for the preservation of peace and for the security of civil and religious liberty? Are you willing to give your help in this State toward securing definite Constitutional safeguards to perpetuate the separation of Church and State, and toward correcting the legislation which has arisen in violation of that principle?

The correct principle of the separation of Church and State,—that the State has no authority in civil matters,—that every man must "render unto God the things which are God's, and unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's," is not primarily an "American" principle, although first governmentally enunciated in the Constitution of the United States. It is first a divine and biblical principle; it is a fundamental and natural principle necessary to be observed strictly in the formation of an equitable civil code; for, in so far as this principle is not followed, just in that degree is the resultant civil policy inequitable and iniquitous. This was the purpose of the establishment of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, to preach the necessity for the sacred observance of this principle, and to raise its voice in condemnation of the legislation which has arisen, and is to arise, in violation of that principle, and to point out its attendant evils, their origin and result.

THE league has asked this question of these candidates and of the press,—let it make a candid reply to its own query. Will the league freely accept the full gospel of the separation of Church and State? If the league holds that the "principle of the separation of Church and State must be sacredly observed by the National and State Governments," it holds, with the SENTINEL, that the national Government did an unconstitutional and a suicidal act when it interfered, and dogmatized, in a religious question, and in obedience to the demand of religionists legislated to secure the observance of a religious and ecclesiastical requirement at the World's Fair. Did the league oppose this? or will it speak in condemnation of it now? At the great Methodist Conference, in Omaha, what did the general secretary of the league say in opposition to the resolutions purporting to commit the entire denomination to a request to Congress to pass an unconstitutional and irreligious act? Did he say that the principles of the league, of which he was secretary, required him to plead for the sacred observance by the national Government of the principle of the separation of Church and State, and, that that would necessitate that he should ask Congress, for himself and his organization, that it avoid all assumption of authority in a religious matter? Did the secretary say this, or did he, then and elsewhere, uphold and vote for the resolutions asking for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by act of Congress? Did the league agree with him in that course? If it did not, why is he still its secretary? If it did, how can such a contradiction of its own publicly expressed principles be explained? Will the league say directly, as it has by implication, that its purpose is to secure the separation of Church and State and the union of Church and State,—that its purpose is to oppose the interference of Congress in religion, and to advocate the passage of religious legislation by Congress? That is what it has done and is doing, and there is every evidence that it was organized for no other purpose than to pursue just such a contradictory course. The list of names constituting the membership of this league is a roll of the wealthiest and most influential men in this country. Have these men given the force of their names and influence in total ignorance for what and to what it has been given? or is it possible that in this matter they are unable to see and comprehend inconsistencies which in ordinary business and professional questions would have been perceived and avoided before they could have become evident to others?

WM. ALLEN BUTLER, the chairman of the law committee of the league, and who drew up the proposed amendment to the Constitution which the league presents, has advocated that amendment before the judiciary committees of Congress. The same man is pointed out as a lawyer of the greatest legal acumen and highest prestige in the ranks of those who favor and work for religious laws and legislation. That it is with reason that they do this is shown by published documents from his own pen. At the International Sunday Rest Congress held not long ago, in Chicago, he presented the principal paper, a lengthy and learned dissertation upon Sunday laws and in support of such laws and legislation. How does Mr. Butler harmonize the two inconsistent positions which he takes, as chairman of the law committee of "The League for the Preservation of American Institutions" asking Congress to pass favorably upon an amendment to the Constitution requiring that no State shall enact any law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,—and at the same time, before an international congress, upholding and advocating, with all the legal astuteness and learning gained by a long life at the bar, the religious laws enacted by the legislatures of the different States in continuation of the religious enactments of an English Church and State polity? How can he harmonize these inconsistencies? How does the league and the American Sabbath Union reconcile this anomalous course of Mr. Butler? Has he taken a retainer on both sides of the case? Or is the cause of the Sabbath Union and the league identical? If so, which is it that is sailing under false colors? These are pertinent questions for the league, the Sabbath Union, and Mr. Butler. They are especially pertinent when it is asked whether this question which the league has put to delegates and to the press has been asked in good faith or not. In this the league and Mr. Butler are in a sad dilemma; they must either acknowledge bad faith or plead their ignorance of what is religion, and what is religious legislation, and what are religious laws.

Does the chairman of the law committee, and the secretary of the league, and the league itself answer, Yes! to its own question? Will it give its influence in this State, and elsewhere, to the correction of legislation which has arisen in violation of the principle of the separation of Church and State? Will it help to secure the repeal of the law under which sixty-three tailors, of this city, have been held under bonds of one hundred dollars each to appear before Justice Koch, on Nov. 16, to answer to the charge of having desecrated Sunday by common labor? But there is no need for a reply to these questions. The league and its law committee will be known by their deeds.

THIS is the league's second question:—

II.—Are you in favor of constitutional and legislative safeguards for the protection of the Common School system and other American institutions; and are you in favor of the promotion of public instruction in harmony with such institutions, and of preventing the application of public funds or property for the benefit of sectarian instruction, or for schools or institutions under denominational control?

What is intended in this question by the expression "and other American institutions," leaves open a broad field for speculation. Most people would wish to withhold a reply to that until the institutions were specified. But, with this exception, there should be but one opinion in regard to this query; all should favor the most perfect protection of our common school system, and its complete defense from all sectarian, or denominational, or religious interference or bias, and oppose all, application of public funds to religious purposes, either in denominational schools or elsewhere. This would be a necessary result of an affirmative answer to the first question regarding the separation of Church and State.

But here again appears another strange inconsistency. It was not many years ago that the chairman of this law committee advocated, before an assembly called in the study of the good Dr. Crosby to discuss the subject of religious education in the public schools, the giving of religious education in these schools at the expense of the State, and did so with much vigor and fervor. However strange this may be, it is unquestionably true. This league seems unfortunate in its associates. Its principles are evidently of little repute even in the house of its chosen friends.

THE league's third question is this:—

III.—Are you in favor of requiring in the education of all the children of the State, elementary instruction in the fundamental principles of our Government bearing on the rights and duties of citizens, with the proper supervision by the State authorities of all schools, in order to insure these ends?

Is this entirely honest? "Proper supervision by the State authorities of all schools" may mean a great deal, and it may be interpreted to mean far too much. In fact, supervision by the State exercised over private or denominational schools as to the studies in their curriculum would destroy their independence immediately, and make them State schools supported by private contribution. This is not the way to secure the end desired, and that the instruction mentioned is desirable, and indeed necessary, is most certainly true.

THE fourth question is brief:—

IV.—Do you believe it wise for controverted questions of denominational or ecclesiastical claims to be settled by political majorities?

What can be thought of the wisdom of asking such a question? Civil politics has nothing to do with such subjects. Political majorities could not by any possibility settle them if they tried. It would certainly then be the part of wisdom to let them alone.

THE fifth query is as follows:—

V.—Are the words "to all mankind" in Article I, Sec. 5, State constitution, to be interpreted, as some political leaders claim, as guaranteeing to convicts confined in State institutions for crime, the right of choice as to the form of public religious instruction and worship to be provided for them at the expense of the State?

The supposition is here that religious instruction and worship in State institutions is to be provided at the expense of the State. This is inconsistent with an affirmative answer to the first question, and also inconsistent with the constitutional amendment which the league offers. If the principle in that amendment, and in the first question submitted, is sound and worthy of acceptance, then the State has nothing to do with the religious instruction and worship of the inmates of its institutions, except to allow them that which they shall choose, or give individual missionary workers reasonable access to them; and this, in its full interpretation, is just what the words in question should be held to mean.

THE sixth question is composite:—

VI.—Do you believe it was wise for the State to introduce the disturbing factor of controversy as to religious belief into politics?

a. By legislation which forces upon magistrates and police justices the consideration of the religious belief of parents and guardians, in their commitment of juvenile delinquents? (Laws of New York, 1878, Chap. 404; Amended, 1878, Chap. 245)

b. By the large grants yearly made from the State, County and City Treasuries to private educational and elementary institutions under sectarian or ecclesiastical control?

c. By legislation which imposes on the courts of the State a duty heretofore unknown, of regulating the character of public religious instruction and worship to be held in institutions which receive grants of public money? (Laws of New York, 1892, Chap. 396)

This question is itself, as well as in the three different phases into which it is elaborated, is answered by the reply which is given to the first question. Those who advocate the separation of Church and State can have no belief as to the unwisdom merely of such action as this by the State, but must oppose utterly every such thing from the beginning, as being matters in which the State has no control or authority whatever.

THERE are three other questions submitted in regard to institutions for the support of vagrant children and paupers which have no religious bearing, unless it may be that they are intended to elicit replies which can be used to antagonize Roman Catholic institutions of that character, which are supported more or less by public subscription, and also receive municipal appropriations. This suspicion of insincerity in the last three questions is strengthened by the facts set forth in a table accompanying the letter, showing that the city of New York has appropriated to such purposes, from its "Excise Fund" during the last ten years $6,173,258.54, and that, as shown by a comparison for the month of August 1893, the Roman Catholics have received of this amount more than five times as much as all other denominations put together.

There is also with this another table showing the sums appropriated yearly by the city of New York from "taxation and general fund" for the support of inmates of various charitable institutions; six Roman Catholic, four Protestant, three Hebrew, and nineteen undenominational; and that, out of over twelve millions of dollars appropriated to these, in ten years, the Roman Catholic received $5,526,733.34; the Protestant, $365,467.34; the Hebrew $1,106,363.23; the remainder going to undenominational charities.

Those who consider what the showing contained in these tables is intended to convey, and who realize the inconsistencies involved in the constitutional amendment which the league proposes, the queries submitted in this letter, and the contradictory positions on matters of religious law and legislation taken by the promoters and officers of this organization, must require something more than mere protestation before they can believe that this league is anything other than another American Protective Association in disguise.

Both propose similar things. Both show an equal inability to comprehend the principles which they themselves have enunciated. But the American Protective Association is the more candid and the less subtle of the two, for it leaves no doubt as to who it considers its enemy, and also that it does not love its enemy.

In this series of questions which the league has sent out it commits and convicts itself. The lack of consistency between the constitutional amendment and the first question, and the succeeding questions, show conclusively that it is not the intent of the league to consistently follow out its principles even if it has any adequate understanding of them as they are stated.

The humiliating truth seems to be that the League for the Preservation of American Institutions is nothing more than an expression of Jesuitical Protestantism seeking to aggrandize itself by antagonizing Romanism. The two are, therefore, but exhibitions of the same force from opposite poles. W. H. M.
