*American Sentinel.* A New and important religious scheme has been initiated out here in Pacific "to unite the Protestant, Catholic and Protestant churches and form an unholy alliance between Church and State."

Dr. Pond, pastor of Bethany Congregational Church, San Francisco, has recently, and recently preached in his address in a report read before the Mecklenburg Congregational Ministers, where it is received a strong and hearty response from large gathering.

It was published in last week's issue of the SENTINEL.

THE SENTINEL has proved a true prophet and a monitors affixa to the people. Dr. Pond's remarks are our precisely the same as those appearing in the SENTINEL for Sept. 14, given by Archbishop Riordan, in a discourse on the school question: "We want a common secular system of education; our mission is to secure this education in connection with religion; we want to establish a secular system; that church services, institutions, should offer instruction in religion; and to provide the means to pay for it; that home instruction should be offered." But as at present, public education. Schools are absolutely necessary, what the Puritans are proposing is church instruction and it is unnecessary that the people should be expected to accept a "mutual retaliation" can be established upon the ground of these teachings. This is the situation; it is the duty of every man to act, the action to be taken directly through the ballot box and through all legitimate means.
