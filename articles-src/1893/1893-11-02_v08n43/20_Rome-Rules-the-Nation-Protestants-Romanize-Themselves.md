In connection with the first article in this issue note the matter on page 343, entitled "Money for Sectarian Purposes." The facts and statistics in reference to national and municipal appropriations for denominational purposes here set forth, emphasize most forcibly the warning which the SENTINEL has faithfully given as to the direction in which this country is moving. Rome does already rule the Nation. Not because the Roman Catholic Church is strong enough either in numbers or influence to rule, but because her opponents, who call themselves Protestants, so Romanize themselves by the methods which they use as to become themselves Roman Catholic in spirit, and in everything but name,—which remains to them only as a cloak and a deception. Those who call themselves Protestants, and who profess to stand for the defense of Protestantism, declare that Roman Catholicism is a great political organization, and as such they antagonize it; and to do this they make an exact copy of their hated enemy and make of Protestantism a great political organization also. An apprehension of these facts will lead one to a keen appreciation of the reason and the justice of the biblical denunciation of the beast and the image to the beast.
