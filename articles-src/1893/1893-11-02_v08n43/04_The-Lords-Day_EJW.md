THE beloved disciple had been banished to Patmos, "for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ,"—that is for what he took part in and spoke in telling the truth as he had seen it,—but his separation from his brethren did not sever him from his Lord. While there he had wonderful visions, and at the time he begins to record these he says: "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice." Rev. 1:10.

From this we know that there was a certain day known at that time as the Lord's day, and that John, as a faithful Christian, was observing that day. We also know that if the Lord had a special day, it must have been in existence long still. Let us see if we can find out what day it was, for the Bible can tell us positively and it is the Bible.

In the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah we find the Lord's day mentioned in these words: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words; then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride on the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." Isa. 58:13, 14. Here the day which the Lord claims as his own is the Sabbath day. Mark 2:28. Now what day is the Sabbath? The Lord himself tells us this also. "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work." Ex. 20:8-10.

It repeats that the Sabbath—the seventh day of the week—is the day which may be called by the Lord "My holy day." These texts then prove conclusively that the Lord's day is the Sabbath—the seventh day of the week. And this was the day on which John was in the Spirit, and on which he received his great vision. The day, the Sabbath. Thus, to put the matter into complete form. The seventh day, the Sabbath; it is the Sabbath of the Lord; it is a holy day, and is to be kept holy; the Lord's day; and is "the Lord's day" on which John was in the Spirit on the Lord's day (Rev. 1:10); therefore it is the Sabbath day. Attention.

Jesus and his disciples went on the Sabbath day through the corn-fields, his disciples being hungry, began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat. The Pharisees, who were ever on the watch to find something against Jesus, accused his disciples of breaking the Sabbath. There was no question as to what day of the week this took place, "for it was the Sabbath." Be it stated, as many of this day believe and hold, they describe do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day;—this had reference only to the seventh day Sabbath, it is of value, indicative, as an authority what day of the week it is that is called the Sabbath day in the New Testament.

But Jesus would not allow that his disciples had been wrong; he, pleading and eating corn on the Sabbath day. Still later on, that which we may notice from a text, he said, "It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days." To this statement was said, in declaring his disciples from the false charge of Sabbath-breaking was a vindication of the Sabbath itself. I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, and in doing this they have done well. For the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day. Matt. 12:1-8.

Since it was the seventh day, which the Pharisees professed to only with which they charged the disciples with breaking, is the seventh day of which the Lord declared himself to be Lord. "For the Son of man is the Lord of the Sabbath day." How did Jesus come to be Lord of the Sabbath? Simply "by making it, and setting it apart for man's use. Thus, after the account of the six days of creation, we read:—

Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and rested before all; his work that he had sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made." Gen. 2:1-3.

The same one who rested on the seventh day, and made it the Sabbath by having rested on the seventh day. But the Lord Jesus Christ is the Creator. Of all things, as we read in John 1:1-3; Col. 1:15-17, and many other placed.

Having made the seventh day the Sabbath, therefore, by virtue of his being its Creator, and having given it to be "rested from my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them." Christ can truly say, "I am the Lord that sanctify them." Ezek. 20:12. So the Sabbath—the day which Christ as Creator we have "wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption." Consequently, the Sabbath reminds us only in the fact of creation; but confirms us long as it is a fact that Christ is the Creator, and that it has power to redeem.

Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Matt. 5:17, 18.

"And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail." Luke 17:17.

And though the present heaven and earth shall give way, they will not create, and the promises of "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord." Isa. 66:22, 23.
