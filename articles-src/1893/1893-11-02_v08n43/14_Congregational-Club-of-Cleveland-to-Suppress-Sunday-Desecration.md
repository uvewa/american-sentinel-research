The Congregational Club of Cleveland, Ohio, has undertaken to suppress all Sunday desecration in that city, and has appointed a committee to confer with other organizations and adopt some plan by which to secure a strict observance of Sunday. The "other organizations," with which the committee is to confer, are probably the Law and Order League and the municipal police.
