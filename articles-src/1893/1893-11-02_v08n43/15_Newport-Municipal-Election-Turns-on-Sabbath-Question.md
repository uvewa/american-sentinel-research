The municipal election in Newport, R. I., last week, according to the special correspondence of the Mail and Express, turned upon the Sabbath question. The qualifications of one candidate for Mayor were stated to be that he was a "churchman" and would continue the work, already begun, of "closing up the numerous small places of business on Sunday." The appearance of the "Christian party" in politics is not confined to New Jersey.
