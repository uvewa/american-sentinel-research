A telegraphic news item, of Oct. 23, is to the effect that the Grand Jury of Baxter County, Arkansas, has indicted sixty persons for using profane language, and that a test case will be made. The entire list of existing religious laws will soon be put into active operation. These things are the flying straws which show the direction from which the storm is coming.
