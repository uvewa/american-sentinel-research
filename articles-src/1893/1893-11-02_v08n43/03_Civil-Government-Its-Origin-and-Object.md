*Civil.*—Pertaining to a city or State, or to a citizen in his relation to his fellow-citizens or to the city or State.—*Webster.*

*Government.*—Direction, regulation, control, restraint.—*Webster.*

BY these definitions it is clearly seen that civil government points out the relation, the rights and obligations of the city or State as civil beings; and extends its authority only to that relation. Within this realm all is to be faithfully carried out.

Questionly, why was civil government demanded? Because of sin, which was an outworking of selfishness. Sin violated the rights of others, and a demand was made for protection of life and property in order that man's natural rights might be secured. This is seen in the first civil complication between men, when civil government began.

When Abel and Cain were making their offerings before God, and Cain's offering was accepted while Cain's was rejected, Cain began to reason with him: "Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee shall be the desire, and thou shalt rule over him." In ruling over Abel, Cain was to be ruled by the law of God; but, when sin had corrupted his heart, and as soon as opportunity presented itself and he saw Abel by himself, he rose up against Abel his brother. Thus he overstepped his authority, and thus took away his natural rights to protection. When the Lord came and demanded of him his brother's life, Cain's rebellion was ever again, and he said: "Am I my brother's keeper?" In all this Cain was responsible. God first, and the servant, and the Lord punished him for not by bringing an additional curse upon him and the ground. "When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforward yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth." Afterward Cain acknowledged God's justice in establishing civil government and pleaded for self-protection, saying "My punishment is greater than I can bear," and it shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me." But the Lord promised him protection, saying, "Whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."

Later on we find that as selfishness increased and men grew bolder and more and more in danger, the Lord said, "At the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." In the first is imposed we so have the origin and object of civil government, namely, that which secures to each person his or inherent rights to life, liberty, and property, and protection in the use of the same.

Liberty is here used in the sense of power for freedom to think, speak and act not of license. It includes individual liberty, of faith and religion, irrespective of any other person's faith and religion; liberty does not take away the same rights from others that each individual claims for himself, as fully with reference to life and property as it does in matters of faith and religion.

From these facts it will be seen that the civil law has nothing to do whatever with a man's religious belief or practices; this is a matter that pertains only to each individual, independent of every other individual or government. No matter whether a person be a Christian or a Catholic or a Buddhist, the same rights belong to one as another; they may worship, how, when, and where they please, so long as they do not interfere with the civil rights of others, and the civil government has nothing to do with them. These are inherent rights that existed before civil government was known; they came with man himself. God gave these rights of man, and he is responsible to God alone for the exercise of these rights. Moreover, no civil government can give these rights because it never possessed them to give, and has far as we recall.

In the Declaration of Independence, we hold these truths to be self-evident, "That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." These are "inalienable" rights. No king, no aristocrat, neither can any government grant the nor force of arms, can take them, and perfect liberty both civil and religious.

It is just this right that Christ established and taught when he said. "Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Thus Christ established a line common to all the citizens in the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

These rights and privileges were further guaranteed to the citizens of the United States in Article of the Constitution, last clause: "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust under the United States." By these quotations it is plain to be seen that the founders of our government
