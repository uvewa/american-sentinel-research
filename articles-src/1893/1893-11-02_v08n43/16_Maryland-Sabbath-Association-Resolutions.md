The "Sabbath Association" of Maryland met the 9th of October, and passed these resolutions:—

Resolved, That the executive committee of the Maryland Sabbath Association invites the American Sabbath Union to hold its annual meeting in Baltimore in December, 1894, and to hold therewith a jubilee of the first national Lord's day convention.

Resolved, That Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts be elected honorary secretary of this association, to speak in this State, under direction of the president of the association.

Resolved, That the ministers of the various denominations in the city of Baltimore be requested to preach upon the subject of "Sabbath Observance" in November or December ensuing, as may be most convenient to them.

How would it do for these ministers to take as examples with which to illustrate their subject the seven cases of seventh-day observers to be tried for Sabbath observance in Maryland, during November? The commandment reads, "Six days shall thou labor;" the first-day observance law of Maryland compels the seventh-day observer to disobey the injunction to labor six days, or else ignore the command to remember that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord. Will the ministers of Maryland advise the "Sabbath Association" and American Sabbath Union to continue to strive against God in this matter of his commandment?
