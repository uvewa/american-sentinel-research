A UNITARIAN minister, in San Francisco, recently preached a sermon in advocacy of opening the Midwinter Fair on Sunday. A press report of his discourse says:—

The ministers who have so strenuously advocated the closing were quick to condemn the minister. They hurried over the seals for the manner in which they had been handled. Their opposition had been full of extreme politeness ever afterward.

The tendency of the modern Protestant ministry to force temporal legislation through its control of legislatures, is becoming a conspicuous feature of their warfare. As there is no example of Christ or his apostles operating in this line, it is clear that those who do endeavor to "persuade" men by the arguments of threatened political loss, are preaching "another gospel." It is not possible to be done "fishing" for the gospel of the Founder of Christianity by such means of legislation; and is it possible to reach the hearts of men by any process of civil law.—*Signs of the Times.*

Money for Sectarian Purposes.

(The following is a concise statement of the relative expenditures from national and municipal funds:—Ed.)

WOULD it not be well to give a few facts regarding the use of public money for religious purposes?

In the year of 1893 a "Bureau of Catholic Missions" was established at Washington, D. C. This chief design of this was to "push Catholic schools upon the Government as earnestly as possible." In September of this same year, this same bureau secured from the commissioner of Indian affairs, Mr. Atkins, the following statement:—

The Government should be liberal in making contracts with religious denominations to teach Indians in schools as assisted by these denominations.

It should throw open the door, let any and all denominations. "They should be told, look here are these Indians. If it is a part of your faith or good work to do, and in it put your share of taxes that the Government may do for the Government, without penalty, should reach and educate and care for them." *Congressional Record*—"*Congressional Record, Fifty-first Congress."*

The door was thrown open at once, and the Catholic Church walked in with a tender of professed Protestant churches to the government for "denominational" or "contract" line offered. In the five succeeding years they made the following record of drafts upon the people's money, as shown by the *Congressional Record* figures:—

| Year | Catholic | Protestant | All others |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| 1886 | Catholic $118,343 | | All others of 1886 |
| 1887 | Catholic $194,635 | | All others of 1887 |
| 1888 | Catholic $221,169 | | All others $146,000 |
| 1889 | Catholic $347,672 | | All others |
| 1890 | Catholic $356,957 | | All others $183,000 |
| Total for Catholic: | | | |

For all other denominations and religions combined:

But President Harrison, with General Morgan as Indian Commissioner, determined to stop these appropriations, and to use the money to conduct real missionary work. But the administration met with such a combination of Jesuitical means, by Senator Dawes, that "it found it impossible to do that" and "that it was impossible to retrace the step." Finding "it was impossible," it was determined to allow no increase. But the Catholic Church ignored the wishes of Congress, and secured the increase allowed for that year only, of $41,00.

Seeing that the Catholics were getting the lion's share, as they always do, the Protestant churches raised the cry of "right!" But this was but had taste, con-
