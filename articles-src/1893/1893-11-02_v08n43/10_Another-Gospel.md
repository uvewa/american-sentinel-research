A UNITARIAN minister, in San Francisco, recently preached a sermon in advocacy of opening the Midwinter Fair on Sunday. A press report of his discourse says:—

> The ministers who have so strenuously advocated the closing of the World's Fair, were severely hauled over the coals for the manner in which they threatened legislators, and were set down as a lot of corrupt politicians themselves.

The tendency of the modern Protestant ministry to force special legislation through the coercion of legislators, is becoming a conspicuous feature of their warfare. As there is no example of Christ or his apostles operating in that line, it is clear that those who do endeavor to "persuade" men by the argument of threatened political defeat, are preaching "another gospel" than that preached "in the beginning;" for the gospel of the Founder of the faith was not urged in that way, nor is it possible to reach the hearts of men by any process of civil law.—Signs of the Times.
