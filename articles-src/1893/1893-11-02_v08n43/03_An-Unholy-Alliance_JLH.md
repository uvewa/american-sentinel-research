Editor American Sentinel: A new and nefarious scheme has been initiated out here on the Pacific Coast, to combine the Catholic and Protestant churches and form an unholy alliance between Church and State, in connection with our public school system.

Rev. Dr. Pond, pastor of Bethany Congregational Church, San Francisco, has been working on the plan for several months, and recently presented his scheme in a paper read before the Monday Club of Congregational Ministers, where it received a general and hearty indorsement. It was published in last week's issue of the Pacific, and I enclose you a copy.

The SENTINEL has proved a true prophet for it has predicted just such an iniquitous and monstrous attempt. Dr. Pond's premises are precisely the same as those recently enunciated by the Roman Catholic Archbishop Riordan, in a discourse on religious education, that it is impossible to secure this education in connection with our public schools, under the present secular system; that church services, including Sunday-schools, are entirely insufficient for it; that home instruction cannot be depended on, and therefore that church schools are absolutely necessary. The Government schools give secular instruction and it is unnecessary that the church schools should undertake that, if "mutual relations" can be established between the public schools and the church schools, and what Mgr. Satolli calls "parallel action" be thereby secured. The church schools would supplement the secular instruction of the public schools with religious instruction pure and simple, making the Bible, either Catholic or Protestant, the text-book, teaching the Christian evidences, history and ethics from the standpoint of Bible Christianity, and a general system of theology. Under this plan the public schools and the church schools instead of being antagonistic or competitive, would be cooperative.

Under this alliance, Dr. Pond says, "the studies pursued in the church schools would become electives in the public school curriculum, and children attending church schools would be dismissed one hour earlier on that account, and the record of credits in church-school studies would contribute in due proportion to the standing which the pupil attains in the public schools."

The "demand" on the part of the Protestant Churches, backed by "the immense political influence of the Romish Church," for such an alliance between the secular and church schools it is declared would be "irresistible." And this Protestant D.D., you will notice, quotes at some length from a recent address of the Papal Ablegate Mgr. Satolli, to show that "Romanists and Protestants can pull together," to this end.

A cunning scheme, a crafty plot! a fine entering wedge to secure a national religion by this instruction given by trained and salaried teachers, in buildings connected with the churches. And, as a starter, Dr. Pond is now bending all his energies to secure the funds for the erection of a church-school building on a lot adjoining his church.

It will cost to carry out this scheme, he admits, but thinks it will pay. Yes, Judas was paid. How long before Government would be called on to assume the expense of running this religious annex to its secular system, on parallel lines?

These are indeed perilous times for religious liberty, and without religious liberty how long will civil liberty survive? Foes within, and foes without; foes in one's own household of faith. Protestant pastors hob-nobbing and counselling with Italian priests to betray religious liberty! Alack and alas! "Who shall guard the shepherds?" Let our SENTINEL continue ever faithful.
J. L. HATCH.
