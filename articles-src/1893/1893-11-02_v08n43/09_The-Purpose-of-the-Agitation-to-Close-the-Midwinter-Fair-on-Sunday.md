THE whole object of this agitation concerning the closing of the Midwinter Fair is to obtain a California Sunday law. The closing of the Fair is but a single step toward this end. The professional ministers of the city and State, along with certain Christian methods (ignorantly no doubt do most of them do it,) are demanding the Fair to close on Sunday. If those do not choose to attend on that day, that is their privilege; but if they be compelled to do it by the law of the State the law is wrong, because the closing of the Fair is a religious question, one with which the State has nothing to do. Religious questions are being settled when Christians are using antichristian methods. Christ says: "If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed," "the truth makes man" free will. Jesus came not "to destroy but to fulfill." He came not "to minister." See John 17:47, and many other passages. These churches are now being made to coerce the conduct of the public and the Fair into it also. The initial step toward this was taken by the Christian Endeavor Societies at Alameda county, July 17, in the following resolutions:—

WHEREAS, Sunday opening of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago has been condemned by the Christian people of the United States, as seen by the strong protests against it, and by the action of our National Congress in forbidding from attending said Fair; and,

WHEREAS, The opening of a Midwinter Fair in this State would be a blow to the Christian sentiment, as well as the moral character of our people, which should be deprecated by all good citizens; therefore,

WHEREAS, We firmly believe that Sunday observance should be maintained and protected, and its desecration a gross violation of his law, therefore be it

*Resolved*, That the Alameda County Christian Endeavor Union does most heartily welcome the coming of this Fair; and we do most sincerely and prayerfully hope that it will be so managed as to be a credit to our State and to all Christians and law abiding citizens of the State. We welcome the many Christian Endeavor communities at the Fair and of entering into no controversy, and that during the days of the week; but that Sunday shall be set apart for worship during the entire time of the Exposition.

*Resolved*, That, as Christian Endeavorers, we urge upon every Christian Endeavor Society in this county the importance of this question, and urge each member of his society, church, and congregation, expressing their views in this manner, and working faithfully that these may be adopted; and instructed to send a copy of these resolutions to the National Committee of the Midwinter Fair, and that they be printed in the daily papers, and that they indicate such petitions in their motions.

Note that in these resolutions it is not asked that the work of preparing for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, be not continued. "The larger part of the intelligent citizens of these United States" refer to the protests of the Church people against the opening of the Fair. It is safe to say that not more than two-thirds of the Protestant people ever protested against it, while many to it is the Episcopalian, and the greater part of the Roman Catholic Church, and millions belonging to no church whatever, were positively for Sunday opening. Surely it can not be said that this small minority which was already and boycotted and manufactured all demanded are the larger part of the intelligent people of this country. It is true that many people were boycotted they did not want to pay a full price for a half show. This in which Mr. Endeavor, accompanied, by the gospel of force and coercion, but not by Christian means.

Now every one who will give his reason why the Fair should be closed is to be well received. If the people, individually or driven, will be violated by opening the Fair on Sunday, while the "gospel of the State is not so much to be sought as it is already" and does no power think it can "affect" the moral character of the people directly then these powers to them as individuals. With their clear, and these dispositions, their true mercantile, let the Endeavorers in simple justice resolve with authority to say what is true and proper upon the question; and then at each step as they think they will prevent improper action, let them take measures to make or dictate laws for the State. It is not assuming too much to say that no Endeavorer would wish to do an un-Christian act assumes (John 1s; 36; Luke 12:14), and no one who stands "in loco deu," with any such prerogative (Matt. 20:25-28; 1 Cor. 4:5).

The next step of the Endeavorers is to declare that no question to-day is what the Fair on Sunday is "a dishonor to God, and a gross violation of his law." And they feel the direction and the views it is the State of the same things, and more than this (for the truth of the matter is that the church and the people of this State to say that the opening of the Fair on Sunday or any other day would be perfectly legitimate on other grounds), they say the Fair should be closed because opening it on Sunday would be a violation of his law." If they could see that the name and authority and prestige of this step would be used on the side of the State, for State purposes; and yielded and passed a Sunday law for the State. A law of which could be given the only reason why a Sunday law is desired, but they would admit that the supposed religious duty had the unconstitutional legislation for itself, the actuated to interpret the law all right. It would come between the people and their civil rights; the rich who were equally good citizens, but who did not agree with the preachers, would be forced to suffer. This would be true with what the United States Sunday law has been in every State.

And of the religious persecutions with which almost every page of modern history is stained, so far as to recognize the rights of religion, so far government cannot go,—let the lesson be learned.

"Keep the Church and State separate."
