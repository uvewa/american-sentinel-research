# Uncertainties — v08n43 (1893-11-02)

## Masthead: Editor Names

- **Issue:** The OCR rendered the editor's first name as "ALONEO T. JONES" (likely "ALONZO") and the associate editor as "CALVIN F. BOLLMAN" (likely "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" — C. P. Bollman).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** "ALONZO T. JONES" and "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" in masthead (corrected OCR errors).
- **Confidence:** HIGH — these are well-known editors of the American Sentinel.
- **Note:** The OCR also lists "WILLIAM R. BUKER" as a second associate editor. This name does not appear in the known authors list. It is possible the OCR misread "BUKER" for another name, but it has been preserved as rendered.

## Article 3: Author Attribution

- **Issue:** The letter "An Unholy Alliance" is signed "J. L. HATCH." This name does not appear in the known authors list.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** author "J. L. Hatch", author_short "JLH".
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the signature is at end of letter with location "Oakland, Cal., Sept. 14."

## Article 5: Reprint Attribution

- **Issue:** "The Influence of Puritan Religious Legislation Upon Subsequent Christianity" is described as a continuation of a thesis by T. J. Van Horn of the University of Chicago. The OCR bracketed intro says "[Continuation of a thesis by T. J. Van Horn of the University of Chicago.]" This is not a standard periodical reprint; attribution as "reprint" with original_publication noted as a thesis is an approximation.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** attribution "reprint", original_publication "University of Chicago thesis by T. J. Van Horn".
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — content is clearly a continuation piece from an external source.

## Article 8: OCR Rendering "Endeavorss"

- **Issue:** The OCR consistently renders "Endeavorers" as "Endeavorss" (e.g., "The Christian Endeavorss of California"). This appears to be an OCR artifact.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Decision:** Preserved as "Endeavorss" since the original printed word is uncertain from OCR alone, but the intended word is likely "Endeavorers." However, following the rule of transcribing what the OCR presents (which is the closest available rendering of the original), "Endeavorss" has been preserved as it appears in the source OCR.
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error for "Endeavorers."

## Article 11: Author Status

- **Issue:** "Money for Sectarian Purposes" is signed "H. F. PHELPS." The article is introduced as "a correspondent of the Legal American." The attribution is treated as explicit because Phelps signs his own name and dateline, even though the article was originally from the Legal American.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** attribution "explicit", author "H. F. Phelps".
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the author signs his own name but the article was reprinted from another publication. Attribution "explicit" used because the signature is clear and personal.

## Page 8: Subscriber Notice

- **Issue:** Page 8 begins with a boilerplate subscriber notice ("Last one receiving the American Sentinel, without having ordered it..."). This has been skipped as publication boilerplate.
- **Decision:** Not transcribed as an article.
