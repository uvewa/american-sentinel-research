[The following list of items is from the Christian Statesman of October 21. In this the Statesman enumerates a few of those events throughout the country, continually increasing in frequency, upon which it prides itself as being the result of its Christian statesmanship.]

The city council of Napa, California, has passed an ordinance closing the saloons on Sunday, which goes into effect October 1st.

—The Trade Association of Philadelphia Druggists has recently discussed the proposal to close drug stores on Sabbath afternoons. Action was deferred to the next meeting.—The Minerve, a Catholic paper of Montreal, complains of the increasing Sabbath desecration of that city, specifying Jews' bakers' wagons and Jewish milliners working at their windows.

—The Lord's Day Observance Association of Canada will ask the Ontario legislature to define the class of voters who may use the ballot in Sunday car elections; to provide that such elections may only be held at stated intervals, and that, when held, the usual safeguards shall surround the polling-booth.—The retail butchers of Sioux City, Iowa, have all entered into an agreement to close their places of business on the Sabbath. September 10 was the first day for observance of the agreement, and with two or three exceptions the markets were closed. Those who did not close are to be arrested by their fellows in self-defense, if they cannot be persuaded to close voluntarily.

—The Grocers' Protective Association of Indianapolis, Ind., has been formed for mutual benefit and to promote the proper observance of Sunday.—Steps are being taken to prosecute Robinson's Shirt factory of Bayonne, N. J., for noisy Sunday work.—Four barbers of Knoxville, Tenn., were recently arrested by a fellow barber of that city for Sunday work. The law is one secured by the barbers of the State in their own behalf.—At Cramer Hill, Pa., on October 5, representatives of the churches met to form a Union Sabbath Committee to check Sabbath desecration.—The Grocers' Association of Kansas City, Mo., has called on the city prosecutor to know whether the laws protect them against Sunday work. He has replied that Sunday sales of provisions are specifically forbidden, and that he will prosecute all cases brought to him with proper evidence. [The last four items are from "Pearl of Days" column in the Mail and Express.]—The Advent Review and Herald reports that the Grocers' Association of Kansas City have sent out to their members a card for their windows, containing the following announcement: "This store will not open for business on Sunday on and after October 1."—The same paper reports that Sheriff Whitcomb, of Berrien Springs, Mich., has notified the merchants of that town that Sunday traffic must cease.—Also, that the Muncie, Ind., baseball club having been arrested for charging admittance fee on the Sabbath, have been again arrested for a subsequent offense in which, as an evasion, no charge was made at the gate, but seats were sold on the grand stand.—Also, that the Topeka pastors have condemned Sunday excursions to the World's Fair and to the G. A. R. National Encampment.
