W. ALLEN BUTLER, the chairman of the law committee of the league, and who has supervised the proposed addition to the Constitution which the league presents, has advocated that amendment before the judiciary committee of Congress. The same man is pointed out as a lawyer of the greatest legal acumen and highest prestige in the ranks of those who seek and work for religious laws and legislation. That is to with these that they do this is shown by published documents from his own pen. At the International Congress of Religion, at the great building in Chicago he presented the principal paper read before it, of the Congress of bearing upon Sunday laws and in support of such legislation. The identical Mr. W. Allen Butler harmonize the two inconsistent positions which he takes as chairman of the law committee of "The League for the Preservation of American Liberties" in asking Congress to pass favorably on an amendment to the Constitution requiring that no State shall enact any law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,—and at the same time, before an international gathering of religionists, avocating, with all the legal authorities and discussion he can bring to bear, the value of the religious laws enacted by the legislatures of various States, as establishing the constitution of the religious enactments of an English-speaking people? How can he harmonize these inconsistencies? How does the league and the American Sabbath Union reconcile this anomalous course of Mr. Butler? Has he taken a position on both sides of the same? Or is the course of the Sabbath Union and the league identical? If so, which is it that is sailing under false colors? There is no third course, and whether the Union, the Sabbath Union, and Mr. Butler, They must all be one or the other. But, whether this question which the league comes to the State constitutional convention has been asked in good faith or not. In the dilemma, it is after some relief is due their dilemma; they must either acknowledge bad faith on the part of their ignorant of what is religion, and what is religious legislation and what it is not.

Does the chairman of the law committee and the secretary of the league, and the other members, not embarrass the situation? Will it give in its inference as to that corruption of Church and State, of legislation which, has arisen in violation of principle of the separation of Church and State? Will it help to secure the removal of the law under which the three tailors, of this city, have been held to bail on five hundred dollars, each, to appear before Justice Koch, on Nov. 16, 1893, to answer the charge of having desecrated Sunday by common labor? But these in order, for a reply to this question.

doing, and there is every evidence that it was organized for no other purpose than to pursue just such a contradictory course.

But all of minor contributory the membership of this league is a roll of the most substantial men and firms in the city, in this country. Have those men given the force of their name and influence in total ignorance for what is to what it has been put? or is it possible that in this league the same men have fostered in league head inconsistencies which in ordinary business operations would be scouted? They have been preserved and avoided before they should now before another is chosen as their representative.

The country, and we realize the inconsistencies involved in the constitutional amendment which the league proposes, the question submitted in this letter, and the contradictory positions on matters of religious law and legislation, taken by the promoters and officers of this organization, must require something more than mere protestation before they can believe that this league is anything other than another American Protective Association in disguise.

But the American Protective Association cannot or need not appeal to any real equality to comprehend the principles involved, for the reason that its purposes are palpable on the face of them. We admit the desirable of the two, for it leaves no doubt as to its purpose in its country, and admits that it does not love its enemy.

In this series of questions which the league has sent out it commits and confesses itself. The link of consistency between the constitutional amendment and the question in this letter, and the anomalous questions, show conclusively that it is not followed out in principle even if its use may accepte understandings of them as they actually apply to each other.

The humiliating truth seems to be that the organization of the American Institutions is nothing more than a polished political machine secretly seeking to aggrandize itself by antagonistic religious purposes. It is, in fact, but little exhibition of the same force from the identical standpoint.
