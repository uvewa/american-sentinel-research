[This Methodist divine says "We Christians have changed the day." Compare with this statement the words of the Catholic Mirror to the same point, lately published in these columns. The facts upon this question must be acknowledged sooner or later by all. It will then resolve itself simply into the question: Will I observe the day God consecrated or the day which man has substituted? Then follows immediately the question of the right of the State to enforce observance of a day, and whether or no its religious edict shall be obeyed.—Ed.]

The Chicago Herald, of May 22, quotes Rev. James Miller, pastor of the Marshfield Avenue Methodist Church, as preaching the following words to his Methodist congregation the day before:—

> Then again, if this ancient Sabbath law is still in force, it is still good for the day as well as for the manner of its observance, but we Christians have changed the day and have decreed that the first and not the seventh day shall be observed as the Sabbath, and we have done this without any pretense of authority from either the Old or New Testament, except that which is strained and forced to meet the emergency of an argument.

Everything considered, Mr. Miller's statement of facts concerning the unscriptural grounds on which Sunday observance rests, is deeply significant. Historically, "We Christians," means Roman Catholics, against whom Methodists are not slow to bring grave charges, because they pervert the truth by false traditions.

Taking Mr. Miller's words as reported by the Herald, and the charge of perversion lies against the Methodists, with pertinent sharpness.

Do not Methodists attempt to show that the Bible requires Sunday keeping? They do; but as Mr. Miller candidly confesses, their arguments are "strained and forced to meet the emergency." A divine law against making Sunday a common day, without which there can be no transgression, does not exist.

What about the consistency and the Christian honesty of admitting that there is no such law, and then assuming that there is, and that men are wicked because they disregard what does not exist? Is that Christian, Christ-like?—Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.
