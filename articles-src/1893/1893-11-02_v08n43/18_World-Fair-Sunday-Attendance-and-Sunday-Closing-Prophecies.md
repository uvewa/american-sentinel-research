The attendance at the World's Fair on Sunday, Oct. 15, was 82,276, and on Sunday, Oct. 22, reached the number of 140,578. Such a Sunday attendance as this together with the fact that the great World's Fair is now an assured financial success, despite the enormous initial expenditures that were made, and also in consideration of the remarkable immunity of the World's Fair grounds, during the summer, from destructive storms which have swept the country so generally, and the unusually pleasant weather and comfortable temperature which that section has experienced during the continuance of the Fair, would seem to show that the Sunday closing seers, who prophesied destruction if the Fair opened on Sunday, should be classed among the false prophets.
