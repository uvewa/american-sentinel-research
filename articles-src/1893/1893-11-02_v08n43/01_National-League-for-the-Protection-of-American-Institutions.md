THE National League for the Protection of American Institutions has sent to the public press a circular letter,—addressed to the candidates of all parties for the position of delegates to the forthcoming constitutional convention in the State of New York,—making a request for editorial comment.

The constitution of this league states the purpose of its organization, as follows:—

The object of the League is to secure constitutional and legislative safeguards for the protection of the Common School system and other American institutions, and to prevent public appropriation of money for any sectarian or ecclesiastical institution, and to promote politics and government free from sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

The National League is ardently nonpartisan and non-sectarian. It is supported by persons in all the States of the Union. Its purpose is expressed in its constitution. It corresponds with and is represented before the legislatures of the different States when any legislation adverse to the purpose of its organization is introduced.

The general secretary and original promoter of the league is Rev. James M. King, and the chairman is the late William E. Allen Butler.

The constitutional amendment which the league has formally presented to Congress and advanced before its committees, is this:—

No State shall ever make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no religious test shall ever be required as a condition of suffrage, or as a qualification to any office or public trust, under any State. No public property and no public revenue of, nor any loan of credit by, the United States, or any State, Territory, District, or municipal corporation, shall be appropriated to, or made or used for, the support of any school, institution, society, or undertaking, which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

Politicians asking favorable action upon this proposed amendment have been extensively circulated, and, throughout the entire summer, visitors to the World's Fair have been asked for their signatures to it, at a booth on the second floor of the Manufacturers' building.

A RESPECTFUL request to candidates of all parties for delegates to the New York State constitutional convention, for their opinion in reference to questions touching the protection of American institutions, and especially of the separation of the Church and State and of religious liberty, is the language with which the letter in question, with the proper blanks for the addressing of the candidate personally, it proceeds to say that it speaks in behalf of "The National League for the Protection of American Institutions" and "the constituency which it represents," and that its purposes, principles and work "are in close accord with the provisions of the National and State Constitutions," and with the pledges of the Republican and Democratic parties in 1892; it pleads further that "the membership of the league is absolutely non-partisan and nonsectarian in character," and appeals to all its officers and members to be nonpartisan in the plan.

An expression of opinion is then asked upon a number of points, with spaces left below each query for the reply. Here will be the proper opportunity for comment in this or that question:—

I.—Do you hold that the American principle of the separation of Church and State must be as strictly observed by the National and State Governments, for the preservation of peace and for the security of civil and religious liberty? Are you willing to give your aid in this convention in securing definite Constitutional safeguards to permanently secure the separation of Church and State, and prevent corruption of the legislation which has arisen in violation of that principle?

The correct principle of the separation of Church and State,—that the State has no authority in civil matters,—that every man must "render unto God the things which are God's, and unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's,"—is an "American" principle, although first governmentally announced in the Constitution of the United States. It is first a divine and biblical principle, it is a fundamental and natural philosophy principle to be observed strictly in the formation of an equitable civil code; for, in so far as this principle is not followed, just in that degree is the national civil polity inequitable and injurious. This was the purpose of the establishment of the American Government, to present possibility for the sacred observance of this principle, and to make its voice in condemnation of the legislation which has arisen, and is arising, in violation of that principle, and to point out its attendant evils, their origin and result.

The league has asked this question of these candidates and of the press,—let us make a candid reply to its own query. Will the league freely accept the full gospel of the separation of Church and State? Will it say plainly that the "principle of the separation of Church and State must be sacredly observed by the National and State Governments," it holds, with the Reformers, that the national law should not be an unconstitutional and a sinful act when it is passed, and despotical, in a religious question, and in obedience to the demand of religionists legislated to secure the observance of a national and governmental Sabbatism at the World's Fair. Did the league oppose this? or if it proposes its condemnation of these evils? At the great Methodist Hall the general sentiment was expressed that the entire denomination as a request to Congress pass its unconstitutional and sinful. Did it say that the closing of the league, of which he was secretary, replied him by letter of "the sacred observance by the national and State Governments of the principle of the separation of Church and State, and that word government." Has that organization, that it a word all that an authority of a religion in any manner the State has no authority? Did his secretary say, or did he, that and elsewhere, that it was a vote for the resolutions making the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by congressional enactment? And does the whole league agree with him in that course? If it did not, may be it will be necessary? If it did, how can such a contradiction of its own fully expressed principles be explained? Will the league say directly, as it has by implication, that its purpose is to secure the separation of Church and State and the union of Church and State,—that its purpose is to oppose the influence of Congress in religion, and to advocate the passage of religious legislation by Congress?

THIS is the league's second question:—

II.—Are you in favor of constitutional and legislative safeguards for the protection of the common school system and other American institutions, and in order to form a front of protection against any attempt to divert any of the common school funds, or to prevent the appropriation of public funds or property for the benefit of any religious or sectarian schools or institutions under any pretext whatever?

What is infused in this question by the expression, "and other American institutions," seems to open a field for speculation. Most people would like to be with the principle when their true position was specified. But, with this exception, there is a very satisfactory response to this query; all should favor the most perfect protection of our common school system, and its complete defense from all sectarian, or denominational, or religious interference or bias, and oppose all application of public funds to religious purposes, either in denominational schools or otherwise. This is so reasonable as to call for an affirmative reply to the first question and this.

But here appears another strange anomaly of the league's position. We find that the chairman of this law committee has been "interested for some time in the study of the good Dr. Crosby to have the Roman Catholic catechism taught in the public schools, the giving of religious education in them, being in favor of the exercises of the State, and did so with some vigor and force. However strange this may be, it is unquestionably true. This league seems unfortunately to be in the position where its principles are critically of little practical even in the lives of its directors.

THE league's third question is this:—

III.—Are you in favor of requiring in the education laws that the branches of instruction shall be given in the English language as the medium of instruction in the fundamental principles of our Government, including industrial training in the schools, and of compulsory education requiring the attendance of all children, in order to insure equal opportunities to all?

Is this entirely honest? "Proper supervision by the State authorities" and "compulsory" may mean a great deal, and it can be interpreted to mean far too much. In fact, supervision by the State exercised over private corporate charitable and literary institutions has frequently threatened to destroy their independence immeasurably, and a position has been maintained for their liberty by private contribution. This is not the place for a full discussion, whether all that the instruction question is desirable, and of equal importance with the others.

THE fourth question is brief:—

IV.—Do you believe it wise for constitutional conventions and legislatures to entertain questions asked by political majorities?

What can be thought of the wisdom of asking such a question? Civil politics has nothing to do with right and justice. Political majorities could not by any possibility settle questions of right. It would certainly then be the part of wisdom to let truth alone.

THE fifth query is as follows:—

V.—Are the words "to all mankind" in Article 1, Sec. 3, Chap. 1, of the New York State laws, intended and understood to include corporations and trusts controlled in State institutions for religious instruction and worship, and to prohibit for general instruction, and worship to be provided for all those at the expense of the State?

The proposition is here that religious instruction and worship in public institutions is to be provided at the expense of the State. To ask our approval, after an affirmative answer to the first question, if the principle is that amendable, can it be considered consistent? If the instruction in religion be sound and worthy of acceptance, then having the State to provide for the religious instruction and worship of the institutionally confined, without compulsory measures, is to make religion freely accessible to them; and, if the best interests of those who reside in the institutions in question should be held in mean.

THE sixth question is this:—

VI.—Are you prepared to vindicate and fully protect the constitutional guarantees of the freedom of conscience, freedom of worship of God according to the dictation of one's own conscience, and place justices the considerations of State and church relations in the foreground, so as to prevent the enactment of laws that violate these guarantees?

> a. By legislation which imposes on the courts of law the settlement of disputes and controversies purely ecclesiastical in character, is legislation wanted to be held in this matter?

This question, in itself, as well as in the three different phases into which it is worked, is given to the first question. Those who advocate the separation of Church and State can have no belief on the matter, as answers of nearly all of such cases, as to every such thing from the beginning, is that to have the civil government exercise any control or authority whatever.

THERE are other questions relating to rights of State orphans and various kindred topics, including the matter of maintenance of vagrant children and dependent families by State and municipal aid. These may be that they are intended to elicit opinion that can be used to antagonize Roman Catholic institutions of that nature; but at the same time the Roman Catholic religious expenditures are not alone in their infringing on this principle.

Those who consider what the showing of the Roman Catholic Church is in this country, and the amount of appropriation to its institutions in this and other States, may well consider it a matter of national concern. The league and the law committee will be known by their deeds.
