"Let the workingman do on the Sabbath just as he sees fit," says Rev. Dr. McPherson, "so long as he doesn't infringe upon the rights of others. If he wishes to attend church, well and good, for he will be benefited; but if he does not, let him not be criticised. He should spend the day in a way that will give him recreation and enjoyment and improvement." Certainly, let the workingman be perfectly free—but stop the cars, and all but the more expensive public conveyances, so that the workingman will "see fit" to spend the day either at home or else in attending church. This is what Dr. McPherson and all the rest of the Sunday preachers really mean.
