## Opening Session of the Parliament of Religions.

The first session of the World's Parliament of Religion has been held. The Parliament is a reality; unique, and, in all probability, in some sense, the most remarkable and momentous event of the century. Upon the platform, at the opening hour, were gathered representatives of all the important and divergent religions, by men of widely varying opinion, and the whole spectacle was as novel and interesting as it was suggestive.

In the centre, clad in the purple, the Most Reverend Archbishop of Chicago and the Catholic Church, is a chair of live, Roman Catholic statesmen and bishops about him, revealed in their distinctive and picturesque costumes, are Oriental representatives of the ancient religions of the eastern world; near men of India in their white faith garb of Buddha and Brahma,—Parsee fire-worshippers, Confucianists, devoted to the maxims of Confucius, patriarchs of the Greek Orthodox Church, all side by side with the Roman Catholic faith, side by side with the intercession amongst the Protestants of all the leading denominations. Just so men stood whilst Cardinal Gibbons impressively opened the first impressive session. Bonney then delivered the opening address to the most from these impressions of the event will justify copious extracts:

> Let us rejoice that we have lived to see this glorious day. Let us rejoice that we see the time come for a new fraternity in religion have at last, each part in the solemn and mutual event of a new brotherhood in each, the coming unity of mankind, the dawn of the reign of everlasting peace, and the future relations of the various races of men shall be more firmly united by all bonds of fraternity, in which it has been clasped, it will become increasingly evident that, in all the best things of this life, the peoples of the earth are one. Just so truly like a new Mount Zion, crowned with glory and wreathed with joy, rises the new Parliament of all the Religions of the World.
>
> For when the religious faiths of the world recognize each other all as combatants against irreligion still then, will the nations of the earth yield to the reign of love, and the nations of the earth yield, and then shall the advent of a united humanity appear.
>
> It is inspiring to think that in every part of the world, men of every faith and all kinds gather here, and bow, they lift their hearts to the Supreme Being, and they are praying not only for the success of this Parliament, but for the coming day of peace, and the peace shall rule upon all the earth. Let us then enter upon this great work in love and sympathy of this impressive occasion.

Then as to the scope and purpose of the World's Congress of 1893, those cause with that common purpose and basis; this afternoon the clergy would be a fraternal conference on the religions of the world and their ultimate relation to religion. It is this Congress for which was sent by the Government of the United States. This was the understanding of the Congress as a general authority to every nation in the religions of different parts.

To a few of the most important features of the programme of the Congress it is assigned. To a few of the most important features of the programme I desire to call attention. In the beginning it was supposed that one or two days would be sufficient for such an assembly, but so great has been the interest so many

have been the applications in this department, that the Congress will have to continue its meetings for seventeen days. The leaders and representatives of the religious congresses have nevertheless extended a pressing invitation to all people to attend. Their programme for the 1893 constitutes what may with perfect propriety be termed "A Religious Declaration of Independence." This document is addressed to the general parliament of religions directly expressed by the government to the whole people of every religion: Russia, Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Syria, Japan, India, Sweden, Norway, Holland, and indeed a many other countries. The nations and religions are included: Christianity in all forms (including Protestants of all denominations): Judaism, Mohammedanism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Parseeism, Jainism, all Oriental religions. Catholicism, the Greek Church, Protestantism in all forms, and the other religions to be stated are considered.

The programme also announces for presentation at the Parliament "the important truths held by all religions: the grounds of union, the ethical unity of different religious systems, history, records, scriptures and manifestations of religion generally, and the leaders of human progress by whom these great religions have been founded or reformed."

In regard to this part of the general programme essentially the same period as the conferences as above, to be held in the Hall of Washington. [This will consist of what are virtually congresses of all the world's religious. Through these congresses special presentations will be made to the world, as representing the best religious thought of those religions on

## EACH TO OFFER OTHER CREEDS

The third part of the general programme for the sessions of the Parliament, in its more distinctly parliamentary aspect, consists of denominational presentations for the purpose of more fully illustrating the general subjects. These sessions will be held, for the most part, in halls adjacent to that in which the general Parliament meets. Halls for special reasons, already been built. It is the purpose of the Committee of Organization to afford opportunity for the best presentation of all who may desire it. The leaders of those several denominations and their followers and similar national congresses will each be held during the sessions of the Parliament of Religions.

The fourth and final part of the programme of the Parliament will present the work of the congresses of various kindred organizations. It includes: Evangelical Alliance, State and National Sunday, Free Religious Association, various missions, reform, Sunday rest, Salvation, Alliance, Christian Endeavor and others.

We meet on the mountain height of absolute respect and mutual confidence, for all other faiths offer to their devotees. (Cheers.) The very basis of the Parliament is the confidence that the truths of any religion can well endure the tests, and the truest and the best of all; and that they will be thereby shown to the world as worthy of universal acceptance and that as representing the great questions of the immortal life.

Let one other point be clearly stated. While the members of this Parliament meet, first of all, on the common ground of perfect equality, the ecclesiastical or individual limitations of the members are in no way to be compromised. No one shall be expected to make concession of his convictions and special tenets of belief. No rights of the members of this Congress are to be limited by the membership of the Parliament in any degree by its relation to any other. In the second place, we seek in this congress the bond of unity that consists not in uniformity, but which finds in such religions appeal all divisions; to make the best of each other. To seek to discover what things are common to all, and what are good in each other, in the good deeds of the religious life. Whoso is wise, and the Lord make such to agree among themselves upon any matter of faith or worship, or religious life on creation of all mankind, with an earnest

desire to be useful to each other and to all others whom they can reach with their influence and progress over the world, through the spirit of brotherhood. This religious sentiment, filling the air with its exquisite perfume. This cry of the heart for the unseen, this yearning of God in the hearts of men. He and down and far over and through all that the world is filled by, God the hearts of those who worship God and finds in all religions the very presence of God. It is the brotherhood of religions.

It is quite possible that this is the beginning of the last era in the world's history of evil, in which it is "heaped to the full" and in which the Lord arises against all who do evil, and who profess it against all who do not profess it, and he destroys with the brightness of religion its contradistinction to the progress of spiritual truth and religion. In the words of the speaker, "unite all religions against irreligion."
