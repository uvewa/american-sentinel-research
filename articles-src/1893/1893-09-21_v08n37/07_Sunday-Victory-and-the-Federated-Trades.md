"We have before made mention," says an Oakland, California, paper, "of the Retail Clerks' Union of this city celebrating their victory in securing the Sunday closing of the stores of their employers. But a 'Delegate to Federated Trades,' in a communication to a local paper, announces it as a 'Sunday victory.' All these local episodes of the Sunday-closing class are quickly seized upon to swell the Sunday wave that is sweeping the liberties of the people into the vortex of Church and State union. We have reached that point in the progress of popular religious domination where civil and religious liberty is construed to apply only to those who believe in Sunday sacredness. And the federated trades having fallen into the current, so far as this county is concerned, the above-mentioned 'delegate' calls down the boycott of the people upon the merchant who 'has the temerity to defy the Federated Trades of Alameda County.' It is remarkable how promptly the spirit of persuction seizes upon men when they espouse the cause of enforced Sunday observance. This one fact should be enough to open the eyes of thinking people to the innate iniquity of the cause."
