THE GROUNDS OF THE ONE OR OTHER OF THE TWO SIDES UPON THE CHRISTIAN SABBATH AS PLACES OF CHRISTIANS IN PRACTICE TO-DAY POINTS TOUCHED IN THE DISCUSSIONS ON THE WORLD'S FAIR SUNDAY QUESTION.

Public attention has been called to the above subject in the past week by the reports of a Congress of the world religions, followed by the International Sabbath Congress, held in connection with the series allowed by the Conference of the World's Congress of 1893. The resolutions criticism and conclusive, sent by this congress to the President of the United States Congress, and of the Secretary, for requesting the closing of the people by closing the World's Fair on Sunday.

The Adventists are the only body of Christians with the Bible alone as their teacher who can find no warrant in its pages for the change of day from the seventh to the first day. However, Sunday observers of every kind, their cardinal, observe "their" cardinal, and the last day of the exclusive worship of God, in conformity with the old Sabbath commandment of the 4th, repeatedly reiterated in the rest and lesson of that God to All New Testament, literally obeyed by the children of Israel of the Testament up to the crucifixion, then abandoned by the teaching and practice of the founders of the Christian church.

*Of course*, the Protestant takes the work of the Adventist according, with the Adventist, in regard to the Bible as the final teacher, by their practice, since their appeal is to the Bible; themselves adopted in passing this law, and the time honored practice of the Jewish nation to rest before their eyes, have the established day sacred for worship by God, and assumed, to enjoined continuation of its commands, a day for his worship never once referred to, for the first generation at all events, in the pages of the New Testament.

What Protestant pulpit does not ring with the most passionate invectives against Sabbath violation? Who can forget the frenzied clamor of the Protestant ministers throughout the length and breadth of the land, against opening the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday? The thousands of petitions, signed by millions, to save the Lord's Day from desecration! Surely, such general and widespread excitement and noisy remonstrance could not have existed without the strongest grounds for such animated protection.

And when visitors were subjected at the World's Fair to the various sorts of persecution to compel them to keep the day, who can forget the emphatic expressions of indignation and protest of investigation exhibited by our Presbyterian brethren as one of they heard of the decision of the Supreme Court to interfere in the Sunday opening? The newspapers informed us that they flatly refused to submit the decision therefore was an open basis, demanding the right to withdraw the articles in, held all other issues to their principles, and thus declare all contact with the sacrilegious and Sabbath-breaking concern.

Nevertheless, our Calvinistic brethren can hardly claim to have any advantage of the other sects, who, however, lost the happiest portents of energy or manship in upholding the institution of the Sabbath observance.

They became "a spectacle to the world, to angels and men," although their Protestant brethren, who filled the ranks of the hierarchy, were irrecoverable and entirely disposed to arbitrate their own allowances to religious principle, to Pentecostal pride and sluggish abstention.

But, what is the *fact* of the Bible in regard to shed light on this all-important teaching? Can such a total and sweeping reversal from the Protestant point of view as this would be—that the Lord has declared all shall be deprived of their "Chamber-chosen,"—has not any maybe the able to convince himself, and bend the question in all its bearings, and let the truth be judge?

The Christian world, as already spoken to us, teaches, on the plain grounds of fact, the practice of worshipping God on the first day of the week.

The Israelite community, on the other hand, contrasts the fact of being blessed by God Himself. Others, keep the last day of the week sacred for the same reason—God's orders. And similar the Seventh-day Adventists (a sect of Christians nominally) keep both the days the same day.

The Israelites and Adventists both appeal to the Bible for the divine commandment presumably citing the entire decalogue as found there.

The Israelites respectively the authority of the whole Bible from beginning to end. The one is a Christian, accepts the New Testament, as does also the Seventh-day Adventist. They both refer to the Old, viz: an inspired record also. He finds in this his Bible, his accustomed in both parts: that the Redeemer during the first period, the time kept holy the other day than Saturday. The gospel plainly seem to this to him fact, which, he sees the pages of the Acts of the Apostles; the Epistles, and the Apocalypse not the slightest mention of Saturday. No argument, no arrangement, can be found.

Essentially considered, the Seventh-day Adventist is the logical representative of the Protestant prohibition of the nations, not of numbers, but of truth, fact and right, a strict sense of justice forbids the condemnation of this little sect without a calm and unbiased investigation; this in sense of our journal.

The practical world has been, from its infancy to the sixteenth century, in thorough accord with the Christianity, in keeping "Holy" not Saturday, but Sunday. The discussion of the grounds of this practical agreement, of this universal practice for over three hundred years, and especially whether they were laid on so solid a basis in this particular, should be interesting, important and instructive; and we shall try to handle them with absolute respect for truth.—*Catholic Mirror*.
