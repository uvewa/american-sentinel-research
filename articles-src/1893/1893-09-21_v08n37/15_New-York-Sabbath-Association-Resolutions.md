At its recent meeting at Saratoga, the New York "Sabbath" Association adopted the following resolutions:—

Resolved, That we rejoice in and indorse the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, on February 29, 1892, that "this is a Christian Nation."

Resolved, That we see in such contrary decisions as that of Judge Stein, of an inferior court, the necessity for putting the decision of the Supreme Court into our national Constitution that all our Christian institutions may have an undeniable legal basis in our fundamental law.

Resolved, That we rejoice in the World's Fair Sabbath closing law and in the equally impressive failure of Sunday opening, and we urge that these great victories be vigorously followed up with State and local victories over Sunday papers, Sunday trains and Sunday mails.

Resolved, That we recognize the Church of Christ as the chief reform organization and religion as the very heart of all reforms.

Thus, on every hand, the evidence multiplies that it is the settled purpose of the so-called Protestant churches to control the politics of the country in the interest of their dogmas.
