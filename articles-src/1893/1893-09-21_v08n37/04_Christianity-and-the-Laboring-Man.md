To show that true Christianity is always the friend of the laboring man, it is only necessary to allude to the fact that Jesus himself was a laboring man. "Is not this a carpenter." Coming from the highest authority, one might well consider this a starting point.

Truly, He was King of kings and Lord of lords, yet no chances as we sin here, He had not the best of everything in any place. His birthplace was the manger of a stable for man and beast. His hands were hard with labor; and during his ministry, though the foxes had their holes, and the birds their nests, he had not where to lay his head. So the Christ was about doing good. "He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister." His only recorded saying on the subject of riches was among us "As one that serveth." Not long since a Chicago divine was wondering how an infinite God could ever have seen his way to the creation of man, while all the time forgetting the loving heart of his only begotten Son.

Christianity is a derivation of the Cross, and from that tip to avast of the brain. Starting from there, is there anything that could logically result in the tyranny of labor? All Newton meditations, all Kepler calculations, all Christian struggles in every shape, up even to the agony of bloody persecution, point in one direction—the freedom of the individual. What the man of religion dignifies his failure to exalt the laboring man, he loses the right in himself to be, both priest and king.

This, on every hand, the evidence and true of ecclesiasticism. Christianity bidding them to call any man father upon the earth; for one is our Father in heaven; and that, as God is no respecter of persons, the highest, a little nearer the condition of the Almighty than the lowest.

The truth spoken of by Ingersoll—"of thrusting down the baby that it might drip through the crust on the back below"—regarded the rights of the laboring man, any authority of man over his fellow; of bishop and martinet and Pope in between them all father, that each man may have his own rights in the eye of the law and in the father of all, while the fatherhood of God teaches men of equal right before Him. He was not ashamed to call the lowest of the low his brethren. The Church in the earlier days of its apostolic simplicity has given them brethren. The Church itself is in its very essence democratic. Christ came to proclaim liberty to the captive. In the name of Him who came

to give them their rights, she has robbed them of their rights. This is especially illustrated by the whole history of Sunday legislation. The very first law for closing labor and production on Sunday, the law of A.D. 325, was secured by the Church. "At the *Pontiffs'* part ... "that the devotion of the faithful might not be disturbed." But it did not mean Sunday rest. "Because people were discouraged and many," "Because people were discouraged and many to protect their right to worship free of disturbance, the Church really took away their liberty to go elsewhere on Sunday."

While thus denying the right of the laboring man to "go elsewhere," i.e., if they saw fit on Sunday, they really professed to do it all in the right of the laboring man, of all, and especially of the poor laboring man. The reason given for closing the World's Fair on Sunday, and all other work, "Because Christians ought not to be compelled to work on Sunday!" and in this sense, no one was compelled, only that if they of their own free will wanted to work in these places, and so as they were open on Sunday they were given no rest.

In professing to give them their rights denied and ignored that right to work, which was as God-given and inherent in him as the right to breathe; and thus the competition between it and the thinking laboring man who had sense enough to see the difference, and thus with a subtle, "owing to the prevailing passing influence of the Church at that day," the Church was often worsted. This was an initial effort on the part of the Church, to close places of amusement, and so turn recreation from these interests. And the cruelty of it is in type of that of all other efforts in all times. It is its very nature to deprive the poor laboring man of his rights, and it was in the fifth.

The Sunday agitation in Toronto, Ontario, to prevent the street cars from running on Sunday in the effort of the churches to so confine the people and prevent their access to parks and pleasure grounds, is giving them only the choice of the house or the church. All this was done in the name of the rights of the street car employees. This is something which is so obviously and plainly a piece of church imposition that it was never more apparent than in Toronto only day a labor in favor of Sunday cars. All the labor organizations of the city declared in favor of Sunday cars. Their representatives appeared on the various platforms of the city and in every way night in earnest conflict with the clergy. This in view of the Working Women's Protective Association. Miss Joaneson, the president of this association, has again declared to give at the outset a strong and able defense of Sunday cars. Here is an extract from a portion of a speech delivered by Miss Joaneson, August 24:

> I have been delegated by the Working Women's Protective Association in its endeavor to bring about Sunday cars to say a few words. This is a question that every working girl must take into consideration the subject. I wish to ask you as fair-minded men and women whether our vocations are not just as important as those of the few millionaires who are pushing this thing. (Loud applause.)
>
> The ministers and rich men of this city say, "Because people were discouraged, keep the Sabbath, make the poor white slaves in their homes, and we of the clergy and the rich, we will ride in our carriages to church and back," and I know whereof I speak. If the fourth com-

mandment is to be followed so strictly as these men say, why do they not notice that it includes the master as well as the man.

Again and again in my presence and in the sight of the public in general, of all these ministers, the official representatives of the churches, hired cabs, first day cars, and protested warmly against the clergy interference with his business and yet the preachers went right on professing in the interests of the laboring man and to speak for the laboring man.

A recent editorial in the *Toronto World* sets this matter out in the true light, as follows:

> In regard to Sunday labor the railway company say; We are quite able and quite willing to settle this matter satisfactorily to ourselves, the public and the company exercised recently has been very unfair. Those who professed solicitude in the welfare of their employees and the workingmen of Toronto, of all trades, in general, have been much more anxious to deprive them of a personal liberty than to help them. If we solicited to work under the conditions agreed to by the company, and some of our men object, then it is a purely personal question, and no one else has the right in the name of labor may accept. Labor is not the slave of the theologian.

Has the Lord a word about labor? Does he care about Sunday?

"Foxes have holes," read about labor? Does he care about Sunday rules?

What fools these Artis are making of themselves that they do not believe in Sunday street cars! They refuse to hear the experience, they refuse everything, and rather believe lies in!

But the Church wants them to believe in Sunday labour? Nothing but talk. And for what purpose? That they may be robbed of another right—the right to ride on Sunday street cars. That just proves this interference, this must.

They do not protest against working on Sunday, but they are protesting against working on Sunday cars. They don't care a single bit about the length of inspection.

It is the purpose of the churches who the people have declared to deny any right of the streetcar to labor itself to invade.

This is in every case the practical spirit of every attempt on the part of the Church to push this Sunday car question is concerned.

> The Church thus professes to be the friend of labor while denying the right of it.

The Church rides in its easy carriages, and sits in its well paid pews on Sunday; shuts every door of liberty, every road, every car and the parks they so kindly ask for, against the very people they pretend to be the friends of, in the name of it; and then of them, go away to the seaside and the mountains, while the laboring man with his family sits upon the porch, or the door or a thing; and yet when the laboring man says that a little Sunday car ride for himself and family, he is told in the most sweet-distempered of manner that the air of the alley street is good enough for him.

I will give one case or two illustrations of the utter mendacity and selfishness of people commending their friend[s] the "poor" laboring man.

> E. F. Spence claimed that of the street cars were run on Sunday, twelve hundred men would be kept busy by the boss first of the city.
>
> An interruption from the audience: "Lots of men would like the work, Mr. Spence."
>
> Mr. Moore: "You talk about poor all—every day. The commission at Toronto, that is all a farce. The people cannot get the right to ride on Sunday."

The audience resented this language and cried it down.

> When however the resolution to reject Sunday was where the disorder appeared.

As a matter of fact the railway worker's offer was of it was cleared of the kind of rubbish that are

attempting to fasten Sunday laws upon us. "For six days," says the law, "thou shalt labor,"... and it assumes from its place in the divine economy and therefore these classes must enforce and those who oppose them; then the moral issue of the friend of the laboring man who are asking for Sunday cars, and every right of equal freedom, is on the side of God and the laborer. "Thou shalt not," as directed and Christianity built up their recognized leader of both religious and law, that say this.

The Church is the real friend of labor when she seeks and expects to act in the interest of the laboring man, not by legal compulsion.
