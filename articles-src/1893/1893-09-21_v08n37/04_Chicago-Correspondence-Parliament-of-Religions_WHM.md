## Opening Session of the Parliament of Religions.

The first session of the World's Parliament of Religions has been held. The Parliament is a most notable gathering—in all probability, in some senses, the most remarkable and momentous event of the century. Upon the platform, at the opening hour, were represented many different religions, by men of widely varying racial characteristics. The scene was as novel and interesting as it was suggestive. In the centre, clad in robes of red, sat Cardinal Gibbons, of the Roman Catholic Church, in a chair of iron, curiously and strangely wrought,—about him were gathered in their distinctive and picturesque costumes priests and patriarchs of the ancient religions of the eastern world; wise men of India learned in the mystic lore of Buddha and Brahma,—Farses fireworshipers and the followers of the maxims of Confucius, patriarchs of the Greek Church, and followers of the Roman Catholic faith, side by side with the numerous representatives of Protestant denominationalism. The crowded audience stood while Cardinal Gibbons impressively recited the Lord's Prayer. Mr. Bonney then delivered the opening address; from this the importance of the event will justify copious extracts:—

**WOSSHIPPES OF GOD AND LOVERS OF MAN.**

Let us rejoice that we have lived to see this glorious day; let us give thanks to the Eternal God, whose mercy endureth forever, that we are permitted to take part in the solemn and majestic event of a World's Congress of Religions. The importance of this event cannot be overestimated. Its influence on the future relations of the various races of men cannot be too highly esteemed.

If this congress shall faithfully execute the duties with which it has been charged, it will become a joy of the whole earth, and stand in human history like a new Mount Zion, crowned with glory and marking the actual beginning of a new epoch of brotherhood and peace. [Applause.]

For when the religions faiths of the world recognize each other as brothers, children of one Father, whom all profess to love and serve, then, and not till then, will the nations of the earth yield to the spirit of concord and learn war no more. [Cheers.]

It is inspiring to think that in every part of the world many of the worthiest of mankind, who would gladly join us here if that were in their power, this day lift their hearts to the Supreme Being in earnest prayer for the harmony and success of this congress. To them our own hearts speak in love and sympathy of this impressive and prophetic scene.

When it pleased God to give me the idea of the World's Congress of 1893, there came with that idea a profound conviction that its crowning glory should be a fraternal conference of the world's religions. Accordingly, the original announcement of the World's Congress scheme, which was sent by the Government of the United States to all other nations, contained among other great themes to be considered, "The grounds for fraternal union in the religions of different people."

To most of the departments of the World's Congress work a single week of the Exposition season was assigned. To a few of the most important a longer time, not exceeding two weeks, was given. In the beginning it was supposed that one or two weeks would suffice for the department of religion, but so great has been the interest, and so many have been the applications in this department, that the plans for it have repeatedly been re-arranged, and it now extends from Sept. 4 to Oct. 15, and several of the religious congresses have nevertheless found it necessary to meet outside of these limits.

The programme for the religions congresses of 1893 constitutes what may with perfect propriety be designated as one of the most remarkable publications of the century. The programme of this general parliament of religions directly represents England, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Syria, India, Japan, China, Ceylon, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada and the American States, and indirectly includes many other countries. This remarkable programme presents, among other great themes to be considered in this congress, Theism, Judaism, Mohammedanism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Shintoism, Zoroastrianism, Catholicism, the Greek Church, Protestantism in many forms, and also refers to the nature and influence of other religions systems.

The programme also announces for presentation the great subjects of revelation, immortality, the incarnation of God, the universal elements in religion, the ethical unity of different religious systems, the relations of religion to morale, marriage, education, science, philosophy, evolution, music, labor, government, peace and war and many other themes of absorbing interest. The distinguished leaders of human progress by whom these great topics will be presented constitute an unparalleled galaxy of eminent names, but we may not pause to call the illustrious roll.

For the execution of this part of the general programme seventeen days have been assigned. During substantially the same period the second part of the programme will be executed in the adjoining Hall of Washington. This will consist of what are termed presentation of their distinctive faith and achievements by the different churches. These presentations will be made to the world, as represented in the world's religious congresses of 1893. All persons interested are cordially invited to attend.

## EACH FAITH TO SHOW ITSELF.

The third part of the general programme for the congresses of this department consists of separate and independent congresses of the different religious denominations for the purpose of more fully setting forth their doctrines and the service they have rendered to mankind. These special congresses will be held, for the most part, in the smaller halls of this memorial building. A few of them have, for special reasons, already been held. It is the special object of these denominational congresses to afford opportunities for further information to all who may desire it. The leaders of these several churches most cordially desire the attendance of the representatives of other religions. The denominational congresses will each be held during the week in which the presentation of the denomination will occur.

The fourth and final part of the programme of the department of religion will consist of congresses of various kindred organisations. These congresses will be held between the close of the parliament of religions and Oct. 15, and will include missions, ethics, Sunday rest, Evangelical Alliance and similar associations.

To this more than imperial feast, I bid you welcome.

We meet on the mountain height of absolute respect for the religious convictions of each other: and an earnest desire for a better knowledge of the consultations which other forms of faith than our own offer to their devotees. [Cheers.] The very basis of our convocation is the idea that the reprimatives of each religion sincerely believe that it is the truest and the best of all; and that they will, therefore, hear with perfect candor and without fear the convictions of other sincere souls on the great questions of the immortal life.

## EACH SYSTEM STANDS BY ITSELF.

Let one other point be clearly stated. While the members of this congress meet as men, on a common ground of perfect equality, the ecclesiastical rank of each, in his own church, is at the same time gladly recognized and respected, as the just acknowledgement of his services and attainments. But no attempt is here made to treat all religions as of equal merit. Any such idea is expressly disclaimed. In this congress, each system of religion stands by it all in its own perfect integrity, uncompromised in any degree by its relation to any other. Is the language of the preliminary publication in the department of religion, we seek in this congress "to unite all religion against all irreligion; to make the Golden Rule the basis of this union; and to present to the world the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life." Without controversy, or any attempt to pronounce judgment upon any matter of faith or worship or religious opinion we seek a better knowledge of the religious condition of all mankind, with an earnest desire to be useful to each other and to all others who love truth and righteousness.

This day the sun of a new era of religious peace and progress rises over the world, dispelling the dark clouds of sectarian strife. This day a new flower blooms in the gardens of religious thought, filling the air with its exquisite perfume. This day a new fraternity is born into the world of human progress, to aid in the upbuilding of the kingdom of God in the hearts of men. Era and flower and fraternity bear one name. It is a name which will gladden the hearts of those who worship God and love man in every clime. Those who bear its music joyfully echo it back to sun and flower.

It is the brotherhood of religions.

In this name I welcome the first Parliament of the Religions of the World.

It is quite possible that this is the beginning of the last era in the world's history, in which a "brotherhood of religions" is to be established which will unite all those who profess it against all who do not profess it, and thus inaugurate a brotherhood of religion in contradiction to the brotherhood of mankind, or, in the words of the speaker, "unite all religion against all irreligion."
