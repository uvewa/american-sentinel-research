The *Reminder* (Baptist) of this city, has this to say about the Congress of Religions:—

> There has been considerable—essential hurt, a good deal of good,—from these congresses known as "Congresses of Religion" in some quarters where an effort is being made to introduce all religion into the world. The basic proposition is that all religions are the same and that all are good. No one will or is to be made up of the basis of all them. What is made, or what "they" say is of any good. A gentleman who professes to have some knowledge of the movement assures us, however, that it is rather presumption; and with that view of the subject we heartily concur.

The congress may not be the occasion of giving a new renegade religion to the world, but it will certainly have a tendency to create the impression that one religion is about as good as another, after

all; indeed it has done something in this direction already. And as merely moral systems the difference may not be so very great; but while other religions have no power in those of back of them but the power of the human will, there is in Christianity the power of God to transform the soul. This fact has, however, been very largely lost sight of by the promoters of the Congress of Religion. They propose to make an exhibit of Christianity, but they cannot themselves exhibit its hidden power, which is not Christianity. The Congress of Religion is simply an exhibition of human vanity.—AMERICAN SENTINEL.
