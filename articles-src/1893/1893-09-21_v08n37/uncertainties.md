# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, September 21, 1893 (v08n37)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from 300 DPI PNG scans. The print quality is very small and dense, making precise character-level reading extremely difficult throughout. The text is period-typical dense three-column layout with very small type.

## Page 1 (289) — "The Papacy and the United States"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **General:** This article spans nearly 3 full pages (289-291) in very dense small type. Many passages, particularly in the middle of long paragraphs, are difficult to read with certainty due to the small print size.
- **Column 1, paragraph 3:** The quote block beginning "Within the present generation" — the exact wording of the introductory sentence is unclear. "We must testify not to the influence" may have slightly different wording.
- **Column 1, paragraph 4:** "our stronger practical acknowledgment [of] Church and State" — the word in brackets is uncertain; it may read differently.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM overall for this article due to its extreme length and small type.

## Page 2 (290) — "The Papacy and the United States" (continued)
- **Column 1, block quote:** The quoted passage from the Vatican letter to the New York Sun — some words are difficult to confirm. "Amen, Ait, all" in the introductory text is uncertain.
- **Column 2:** The passage about the year 1893 and what nations have "borrowed" is very difficult to parse — the argument is dense and the print is unclear in several places.
- **Column 3, bottom:** The passage about the Reformation and Victor Emanuel is clearer but some words at line transitions are uncertain.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Page 3 (291) — "The Christian Sabbath" (reprint from Catholic Mirror)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **General:** This is a reprint from the Catholic Mirror. The text is theological and argumentative in nature. Several passages about Protestant and Adventist positions on the Sabbath are difficult to read precisely.
- **Column 1:** The header text (all caps) describing the subject of the article is difficult to read word-for-word.
- **Column 2:** The passage about Calvinistic brethren and the World's Fair protests has some unclear words.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Page 4 (292) — "Chicago Correspondence"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **General:** The article about the Parliament of Religions opening session is clearer than some other articles but still has challenging passages.
- **The Bonney speech:** The quoted speech extracts are reasonably clear but some words at line edges are uncertain.
- **Programme descriptions:** The four-part programme description has some unclear words particularly in the lists of organizations and religious groups.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH

## Pages 4-5 (292-293) — "Christianity and the Laboring Man"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Author:** Signed "G. E. FIFIELD" at end — this is clear.
- **Column transitions:** Several passages crossing from page 4 to page 5 are difficult to read at the column/page boundary.
- **Toronto section:** The quoted speeches from Miss Joaneson and others about Sunday streetcars are challenging to read precisely.
- **The Toronto World editorial quote** is reasonably clear.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Pages 5-6 (293-294) — "Religious and Civil Liberty in Pennsylvania"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **General:** This is a long article about moral societies in Washington County, Pennsylvania and their enforcement of Sabbath laws. It contains detailed anecdotal stories.
- **The wagoner story** (about Mr. Martin and the Canonsburg incident) is told in great detail but some words are unclear at line transitions.
- **The onion patch story** (about the Widow Watkins) is similarly detailed with some uncertain words.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — many narrative details are difficult to read precisely in the small type.

## Page 8 (296) — Editorial Notes and Short Items
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Attendance figures:** "79,700" and "$100,000" — the exact figures for World's Fair Sunday attendance are read as best as possible but the small numerals are hard to confirm.
- **The Reminder (Baptist) quote:** The quoted text has some passages that are difficult to read precisely.
- **The Catholic Mirror editorial note:** The latter portion of this item appears to contain a seemingly unrelated anecdote about "Jesse Sparks" and Cleveland which may be a separate item or a misread; the text is very unclear.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-LOW for the Catholic Mirror note; MEDIUM for other page 8 items.
