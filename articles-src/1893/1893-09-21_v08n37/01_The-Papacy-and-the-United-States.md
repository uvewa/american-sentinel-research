The principles upon which the Government of the United States was founded, and the principles of Rome, are as exactly opposite as it is possible for principles to be. *And Rome knows it, and has known all of it, all the time.*

The principles of the Government of the United States have now been completely subverted, and the principles of Rome fully adopted by an apostate Protestantism, in the United States. *And Rome knows it!*

The effect of the principles of the Government of the United States upon other nations has been to weaken Rome's influence over them, and to draw them from her. So certainly is this true, that although Rome long ago denounced religious toleration as one of the eighty heresies of the day, yet Rome herself has granted "toleration."

Here is a statement that is worthy of consideration in its utter completeness. We must testify not to the influence of the American system "on the European communities."

> Within the present generation the principle of religious liberty and equality, with a corresponding relaxation of the union of Church and State, has made steady and irresistible progress among the nations of Europe, and has even extended more or less widely in other continents.

Never were the principles of the principles of the American Declaration of Independence more truly enunciated. No person in the United States has advocated the advocacy of the voluntary principle [in support of religious worship] and a separation of Church and State in Europe, point to the examples of this country and our stronger practical acknowledgment [of] Church and State in the United States.

Rome did not want the nations of Europe, or anywhere else, drawn away from her. Yet here was this very work "steadily and irresistibly" going on. This was not by any means a pleasant thing to her. Yet what could she do?

The work was not being done by any official action of the United States Government, in *diplomacy* or otherwise, and, of course, she could not meet it by any diplomatic means. It was by the silent, steady, and "irresistible" influence of the divine principle upon which the Government was founded, and which was spread before all the world in its constitutional guaranties. Plainly, as long as this was suffered to go on she could do nothing; and still the longer it went, the farther it reached out over the nations she was being weakened and her power with them was vanishing. And this to her was harrassing, nerve-racking, and affliction unbearable.

Yet what could she do? What about meeting this? Well, as it was the silent, steady, irremovable power of the divine principle of this Government that was sapping her life away, it is evident that the only thing that she should logically or possibly do to save herself was to *subvert* the principle of religious liberty, of the separation of Church and State, upon which the Government was founded, and that thus turn the Government of the United States into the way of her evil principles, and so regain her influence and power over the nations and thus once more draw all the nations after her. And this is what she has been consistently doing. As the Government of the United States, by the influence of its principles, held such a high place in the estimation of the nations, it is manifest that if the principles of the Government could be subverted and this Nation be turned into her evil courses, then the influence of this Nation would be just as powerful to draw the nations and bring them to Rome as it had formerly been to draw them away from her.

This is the very logic of the situation. And so Rome is always logical in the application of her own premises; this is the scheme which she set on foot, and which she has been working ever since she woke to the real situation. As a church, and for this purpose, she entered politics; politics, she secured political possession of all the great cities, so that there, by that means, she holds the balance of power even in a national election. She worked her agents also into the field of journalism, so that to-day, generally speaking, she absolutely controls the publications of the country, by which she is steadily warping public opinion in her favor, and if not that, then into fear of her power. She sends her secret agents into the Protestant religious schools and theological seminaries, and even into Protestant pulpits, by which means, she steadily and stealthily tones down the principles of Protestantism and molds religious opinion upon the view that there are at least certain things upon which Catholics and Catholics "can unite to shape legislation for the public weal," etc., etc. She sends her agents into the trade-unions, the labor organizations, etc., and takes control of these and molds them upon her principles; while in all this and upon her principles; with all multiplied upon, in which she deftly interlaces herself as the "arbitress," whose justice alone can settle the differences and whose power alone can calm the troubled waters. Note the Pope's encyclicals on the labor question.

All these have, for a long time, been the elements of a well-known campaign for the undermining of the foundations of integrity to the principles of the American Government. And all the while, she has behind held with secret but no less effective power, working with nominal Protestantism, in their endeavor to secure the recognition of religion in national legislation and national affairs. And when, February 7, 1893, she heard the Supreme Court of the United States declare of the United States that "This is a Christian Nation," with Catholic Christendom quoted to prove it, she could contain her delight no longer. She knew that her advantage was so certain, and her time was so fully come, that her plans no longer work in secret, but could announce themselves openly. And the American Catholic people in a letter from the Vatican to the *New York Sun*, and which was printed in that paper, July 11, under the heading of "The Papacy and Nationality," she said:—

In that letter are found the following startlingly significant sentences, in which are announced her programme, and her desire concerning the United States and (Amen, Ait, all) humanity:—

> It is for this reason that the Pope has put forth so much effort into the moral, social and political constitution of the States. ... *The Church has done in the past for European civilization* ... and the American clergy to guard jealously the solidarity of the civil and social fabric of the United States.

> Truly, LEO XIII desires to see strength in that unity. Like all sensitive souls, he hails in the transatlantic republic the model of social life in the future of the European regeneration. He wants America to be great. For this reason that *the influences from the United States actually penetrate to the masses in Europe*, he is watching the United States with fatherly solicitude.

> It is from such considerations ... *and what ought we to borrow from the United States?* What form of society will result from such reorganization? The answer depends in a great degree on the future of society in the United States. If many problems that people on, Europe will follow suit. But if the American people pull themselves together and adopt Christian politics, *the same movement will spread to this side*, and our old nations will experience a new birth. *But all, a new birth.*

That is what *she* is after, for power on both sides; and she can work she is after, power on both sides, combine the counsels for the moulding and shaping of society to her own ends; and to secure the position of ecclesiastical affairs, in order that the old institutions of the Old World shall be set up and established in the New.

Now, the year 1893, what have any nation have partially borrowed from the United States an example of voluntary organization? Nothing. United year after year the people have severely against the United States Government even in any way teaching anything by its evil ecclesiastical matter. That year, ever, February 9, the Supreme Court declared and decided that "This is a Christian Nation." This was reversing the meaning of the Constitution. This was subverting the principles of the Government, and the principles of the Government as established by those who founded the Nation and the Constitution. Then this year followed and came the professed Protestant churches of the country in demanding national legislation declaring Sunday to be the Christian Sabbath, and requiring the observance, because it is "a Christian Nation." And this year Congress committed the legislative branch of the Government to the same subversion of the principle upon which the Government was founded. And when Congress, through Benjamin Harrison approved and signed this legislation, this committed the Government—executive branch of the Government to the subversion of the principles of the Government as established. And also in the year 1892, in the whole Columbian celebration, with all its accompaniments—were the principles of the Government, the Government, subverted, and the principles of Rome, set up in the place. And not till then, and not till then, that Rome could proceed for Europeans the important inquiry, "What can we borrow and what ought we to borrow from the United States for our ... ecclesiastical reorganization?" And also, that, it was too ideal to think this important inquiry was merely propaganda in the United States, so that to-day, generally speaking these proceedings of the Government and churches of the United States which so entirely accomplished her long desired purpose—the subversion of the principles of the United States Government as established by our fathers.

AND we say that, with sorrow Rome has now succeeded in turning the nations away from her by the bright example of the Government of the United States in its complete religious liberty in the United States Government, assured by the United Constitution, the supreme law, and the fundamental principles of the Nation. Seeing this, she knew that if she would recover her lost, and regain her power over the nations, she must draw this Nation into her toils. If she could succeed in turning this powerful and influential Nation upward and its influence upon the Nations would be as strong to draw the nations toward her, as it had formerly been to draw them away from her. And as it has been. She has succeeded. Apostate Protestantism has seen the go-ahead Protestant element in the United States, steadily playing into her hands by their amazing blindness in calling for the legislation of religious and the legal enforcement of religious observances. And when at last she saw a "Christian nation" legally and most solemnly declared by a decision of the Supreme Court, and when she saw the professed Protestant churches joining hands with herself, and demanding Congress to recognize and fix in the national legislation her own sacred day, and when she saw a legislative body—when she saw all new, and knew that she could well feel so confident, and so she becomes more and more confirmed.

AGAIN it is written of her: "She saith in her heart, I sit a queen and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow." Rev. 18:7. And there was a time when she could not have said all this; there was a time so far from being a queen, and so far from sitting as a queen, that the Pope was himself a voluntary exile from Rome. A Pope was compelled to acknowledge to himself that "all reasonable expectation" of being sustained was "swept away." The Reformation came and did its mighty work: the Word of God was given to every man; civil constitutions were established; nations of one kind and another separated themselves from the Papacy; and so it was until 1870 when Victor Emanuel confiscated the last vestige of her temporal power, her temporalities, and separating the last vestige of civil power from the Papacy. She now is a widow and has been ever. She has mourned and wept over her widowhood. But here she is in the United States, just as publicly as ever she was anywhere, proclaiming for all to hear, and the world hears it too, that she is no widow at all; and she says there has been no mourning nor sorrow for her at all; and, she is exceedingly sorry with the kingdoms and nations of the world.

But the time comes when said that fire, "and her plagues" and "famine," "and she shall be utterly burned with fire." But not yet, not yet. She says she sits as a widow, and shall see no sorrow; yet in the same hour her plagues shall come, death and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burned with fire. She sits there, living delicately with all. Rev. 18:7, 9, 10, 17. She has a wonderful system of drawing the nations to her and of kingdoms and nations for her brutism and commerce. The kings and the merchants, and will externally congratulate themselves, and will say, "Alas, Alas!" as written. "Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning and famine." "For, strong is the Lord God that judges her." And the voice of God calls, "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Rev. 18:4. And where the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and destroy with the brightness of his coming." 2 Thess. 2:8. And this is the end of the career of all the evils which have been begun by this action of the churches and Government of the United States in subverting the principles upon which the Government was established and going back to the principles of the Papacy. Henceforth evil will be piled upon evil, and wickedness upon wickedness. Ever since there was a nation, which will keep on until the end. And what an end! and final ruin. Henceforth God hath a controversy with the nations. God standeth up to judge, and the judgment is ruin because their works are evil and unjust; Isa. 35:15-38; Rev. 19 and 18.

It may be that this will not be believed. It is the truth. And we know it. It is the truth whether men believe it or not. It is the truth whether men believe it or not. It is for them to decide, each one for himself, whether he will believe and be helped. In these columns we told the people that this is what a Congress, all Christian National, and that Congress, at the dictates of the churches, would act on Sunday as the law of the land. The people would not believe it.

Now all this has been done and everybody knows it. And this which we have now mapped out now as distinctly as before this that also came. For you can't make believers in it, and get ready, yet ready, get ready, for it is true and faithful and worthy of all acceptation.
