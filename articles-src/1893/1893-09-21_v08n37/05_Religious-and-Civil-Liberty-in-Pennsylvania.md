PENNSYLVANIA has had about enforcement of the population in Western Pennsylvania, in and about Washington County. It was naturally to be expected, as the strong Calvinistic element in religion would find expression more or less naturally in law: and its enforcement in its turn would reveal the character incidental to the people of that particular community; the temperament would reveal itself, and too conduct in the community would be in harmony with the law. The party in Washington County had continued right along, under the leadership of arbitrary conviction, with respect to its law-abiding community of Christians, in the spirit of the old Puritan codes, and which have been more or less known as "Blue laws." They have in Washington County what is called an organization of what were called "moral societies," formed for the purpose of the enforcement of those laws, and those morals, in relation to the enforcement of that law, notably, in its administration, of the Sabbath and temperance, of these two different categories. But the nature of the enforcement of both has been the same of the reasons by which it was attempted to be enforced. The enforcement of these laws was stopped by Col. of April, it is of:

> At a meeting of a number of the "moral societies" it was resolved to order each member of the association to take into consideration the expediency of forming an association "for the suppression of vice, immorality and Sabbath-breaking." A circular was called to this mind, and Obadiah Jenkinson was requested to prepare a constitution, and this constitution, with by-laws, it was resolved to form a society for "the suppression of vice, profanity, Sabbath breaking and intoxication." Certain rules were then adopted. Rule 6 provides, "That no member belonging to any other society shall be a member of this society." There were certain other rules, the seventh being a simple promise to promote the objects of the association by giving information against any member of the community whom they saw break the law. Of trade having fallen into the cursed, so attempting to fasten Sunday laws upon us. "For six days," says the law, "thou shalt labor,"... and it assumed from its place in the divine economy, and therefore these classes must enforce and those who oppose them; then the moral issue be upon the morals of the county, they should be reported. The prosecution was for "blasphemy," "profane trades" of Almetta, since the time, and was the effect upon the community of these organizations, that the practice of persecution smites upon men when they carry on their religious practice.

"Intemperate, Sabbath breaking, swearing," etc., precedes as follows:

The recovery or decree or selling or taking of their fellow citizen more particularly to the interest of that community, who only use intoxication. Since they are more quietly permitted to the enforcement of their interests their entire days of their own, believing, and were they not immediately and vigorously directed, to effect an effectual control of these evils. Some have been recently formed in this County, and they are recommended for use by all party of such associations. It is not the indulgence of that spirit that is prompted by a morbid desire for revenge, but the enforcement of good morals for the interest and good of the community, according to her locality, its wishes, and powers, according to locality.

It then goes on to speak of the increase in Sabbath-breaking, and then in a long statement, the fact that while in 1807 there were seven moral societies in Washington County, there were more than one hundred besides, a number of societies even greater than that of the population.

Under the influence of these moral societies, established throughout the county, a strict watch was at once set over the behavior of every individual; local laws were sworn, as references the law were constantly renewed, and the inspections were strengthened, and to a right enforcement of liberty, the members of the society had become, simply unjust bands of informers, the informers, for nothing, by the indecencies of the people, their members soon began to make arrests and to make the people report authority. As they pursued their corrections this unrestraint, each, many violations of the laws were detected and punished with vigor. Each individual community soon found himself to be under a sort of inquisitorial scrutiny that was as most unpleasant to those who were alive to the feelings of many true friends of the republic, as it was contrary to the spirit of republican freedom. For a considerable time, however, the communities had everything their own way. Ministers and competitors incurred censure, but no one had the hardihood to oppose, to be sure; this was natural enough, while only in the interest of morality, and which, in many instances, no doubt it was; the enforcement of the sabbath was the most prominent feature of their exercise. No one that had the least regard for his reputation venture openly to oppose the strict enforcement of the laws; and although many were sensible that there was certainly an under exercise of power, or false principle falsely involved in their proceedings, there seemed to be no escape; in lieu of disturbing it, or willing to bring down upon it, instead the odium of the charges and of the declared irreligion the enforcement of all these proceedings. In course of time, however, the moral burden and the people seemed to grow heavier the whole condition of the people. A general discontent began to manifest itself. Those who had been fined through the moral societies began to scrutinize more closely the conduct of the members composing them, and so many cases soon found that these self-constituted constitutions of the public morals were themselves guilty of offenses similar to those which they condemned in others. The consequence was the loss of influence on the part of some of the members of these societies, as well as the pity of the people, though to a lesser extent; however, he better understood by a restful opposition.

On one occasion, a Mr. Martin, near Washington, had employed a teamster to convey some produce for him to Pittsburg. Returning on Saturday, they were unable to make the whole distance, and were obliged to put up for the night within a short distance of Canonsburg. Setting out early, next morning, on their way homeward, on entering the borough of Canonsburg, they were at once stopped on the ground that they were not permitted to travel on the "Sabbath." At the request of the constable, Mr. Martin and remained at the hotel until the next morning before resuming his journey. After leaving the village, they were overtaken by the constable, who was set after them. He then and had to take him to answer for the then had to demanded of the wagoner the fine for traveling on the "Sabbath." The Mr. Martin wagoner refused to pay, and, after some altercation, it appeared that the constable had not with him any write to enable him to make an arrest. He then said he would return and procure a warrant, and then take him before he got to Washington. The wagoner, in the meantime, secured a friend on the way to drive the wagon for him, and disappeared. The authorities completely overshoot the town at Washington, he was actually arrived at the hiding of itself, and making considerable noise, a woman who was constable at one place began with the help, an old lady of their name, as to his ability to eluded the law, under the circumstances. He boasted that he could well elude the courts; and as he became more and more excited, he said, "Suppose you banter the constable to let this man go on the condition of the fine. I will give you and inform upon you both; and you will both be fined as well: the facts the one to the informer, I will receive the full amount of your fines, and when I will hand over to you, so that you will have nothing, and we shall both be none the worse." His friend agreed to this, and immediately proposed to be with the constable, who also agreed. And the arrangement was carried out. "Now," said the friend to the wagoner, "You have violated the law yourself, which is against betting and is a gambler's offense: and it is against the law; and I will be my duty to go and inform on you, for your breach of it." And so the constable, finding he was caught, because upon his own reasoning and his own trail of the matter, and because he had himself lost his fine and the informer, and his popularity if the matter were made known, honestly swore from the wagoner and his friend, and promised that if they would consent to this he would say nothing, and they would never inform on them about anything, and would "let them all around," and give a promising character for the wagoner. All of which they agreed to amidst great merriment.

On another occasion, one of the members of the Moral Society of West Middle meeting on the "Sabbath day," noticed on a Widow Watkins, two and a half miles from the West Middletown Meeting House. She had some onions growing in a patch which his teamster had forgotten there before the Sabbath. Going into the patch, he concluded to carry it home with him, and on the way he was observed by a constable. The constable finding that his friend was that he was violating the Sabbath by carrying a burden on the "Sabbath day." Upon his return home the circumstance clearly gave rise to reflection on his part, and although his piece. "Sabbath," meaning, he considered how he might be charged and found from the dilemma in which he had become involved. Upon reflection, he determined that his character, and as the onions were a burden upon his character as an orthodox and a member of the Moral Society itself that the happy thought occurred to him that if he would go and inform upon himself, such an instance of self-sacrifice, disinterested zeal and respect for principle, would not only clear his conscience from every sin, but elevate him even higher than before in the esteem of the faithful. By this he was accordingly encouraged. But he might be so uncharitable as to think, persons evidently did not wish, that the reason he so readily went to the informer, he would see two cases instead of one—very readily, he would get confiding, as at once resolved to do it, and inform upon himself. This would lose him a weary hour, lost any one should anticipate him in the performance of duty, which he felt was his peculiar duty, gave the fine of himself to himself, all was adjusted. This was a fine case as a full, efficient explication for the allotment, as appeared upon the records of the county, however, could not see the matter in that light, and he, being so able to be informed upon in his own case as it was for so extraordinary a case; and so, re-asserting the dignity of his position, he went to support the preachers, compelled to do their own informing.

From such facts of this kind came similar results at that time throughout the county; and cases will be sufficiently interesting. In its own locality, in its own way, where their object to expose or punish crimes which the interests of justice, and morality, and which in the last resort to the legislature, no magistrates had been properly conducted as to the enforcement of the law, because of those evils which affect individuals in their observance and conduct. It may had not previously been accommodated to accommodate their citizens with the times in the case of drunkenness, they were as prevalent and natural and natural as they. It will be further noticed that they attached no penalty for a breach of the law for the several particular religious offenses and for swearing "holy" and "sacred," yet to the Judaizing opinions which they had themselves, having clearly the spirit of the ancient Puritan code.

Union date of August 4, 1893, the Church Bulletin says:

> It is not quite fair probably to blame on Sunday, and evidently has had object lessons enough to be pertinent. They remind one of the wits of South Carolina published at South Carolina at the Statesman, that there might be a Sunday School day to keep every as they say ought. Forty and six churches as well as to the results in "religious hollow" and camp-meeting. Christians are largely to blame for the Sunday opening effort.

> The failure as pushed at South Carolina and evidently has had object lessons enough to be pertinent. They remind one of the wits of South Carolina, the Statesman, that there might be a Sunday to keep as day as they ought. Forty and sixty and were in "religious hollow" and camp-meeting grounds throughout Chicago.
