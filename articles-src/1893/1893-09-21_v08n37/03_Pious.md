UNDER date of August 4, 1893, the Church Bulletin said:

> Now that the Fair will probably be closed on Sunday, it is to be hoped that the camp-meeting managers will not open their gates on Sunday, and share with the railways the profits of the Sunday excursions. It is time for religious bodies to be pious, too. Christians are largely to blame for the Sunday opening effort.

The *Bulletin* is published at South Chicago, and evidently has had object lessons in the direction. Its pungent words are pertinent. They remind one of the wish expressed by a writer in the *Christiana Statesman*, that there might be a Sunday law strong enough to compel Presbyterians to keep the day as they ought. Piety and consistency are both desirable elements in "religious bodies" and camp-poeting associations.
