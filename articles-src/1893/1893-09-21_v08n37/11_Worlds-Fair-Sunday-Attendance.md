An Illinois paper of August 31, says: "Sunday's paid attendance at the World's Fair numbered 20,709, the receipts amounting to about $10,000. The expenses were about $3,000." September 10, the attendance was over 34,000. But the Christian Statesman says that "Sunday-closing has been practically achieved"!
