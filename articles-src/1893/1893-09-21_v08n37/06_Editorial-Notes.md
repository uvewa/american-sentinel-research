IT is now denied that the Vatican will ask the Government at Washington to receive a papal nuncio.

IT is said that the Pope will shortly publish an important document relative to the Catholic University at Washington.

AN Illinois paper of August 21, says: "Sunday paid" attendance at the World's Fair numbered 79,700, the receipts amounting to not about $100,000. The expenses were about $1,000." September 10, the attendance was over 91,800. But the Christian Statesmen says that "Sunday-closing has been practically achieved."

A CONGRESS is to be held in Chicago the last three days of this month, a "Sunday Rest Congress." The constitution of the first arrangers, of which Rev. Dr. Atterbury, Secretary of the New York "Sabbath" Committee, is chairman, includes members of the Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, Congregational, Episcopal, Methodist Episcopal, Dutch Reformed, Jewish communion, and a representative of the labor organizations of the country.

No definite action will be taken by the Sunday Congress, and it is understood that each speaker will be solely responsible for the views he may advance, and thus be free to say what he pleases. The Bulletin, of the People, Popular League, of Sunday rest, among whose leading spirits are John Simon and Leo Aligh, says that while it might have been expected that a Congress held at Chicago while the borders of Lake Michigan would be confessedly Protestant, the programme provides for Roman Catholic and Jewish representation, thus showing that there is in no greater liberality displayed on the banks of the Seine than on the shores of the American lake.

——

BUT there need be no surprise either felt or expressed at the "great liberality"

displayed in the matter of this Sunday Congress. It matters not how or by what means Sunday is exalted, if only it be exalted. Viewed only from a human standpoint one might well wonder that Jew would join in exalting the day which has ever been the rival of the time-honored Sabbath of the God of Abraham; but it is only natural that Roman Catholics should have a prominent place in doing homage to an institution which is preëminently the badge of papal authority.
