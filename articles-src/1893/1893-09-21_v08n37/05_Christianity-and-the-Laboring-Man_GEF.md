To show that true Christianity is always the friend of the laboring man, it is only necessary to allude to the fact that Jesus himself was "a carpenter, and the son of a carpenter." Coming from the highest heavens, he stooped to our lowest needs.

Though he was King of kings and Lord of lords, yet no diadem was on his brow, and no royal carriage conveyed him from place to place. His birthplace was the younger; during his early life, his hands were hard with labor; and during his ministry, foot-sore and weary, he went about doing good. "He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister." He was among us "as one that served." Not the wildest imagination of man could conceive how an infinite God could more grandly and eternally set the seal of nobility to labor than he did in the life and death of his only begotten Son.

Carlyle well says, "Sweat of the brow, and from that up to sweat of the brain, and sweat of the heart, which included all Newton meditations, all Kepler calculations, all spoken epics, all acted heroisms, up even to the agony of bloody sweat which all men have called divine—all is sacred since He has labored." Other religions degrade the toiler to exalt the priest, but Christianity exalts every man to be both priest and king.

While this is true of Christianity, it is not true of ecclesiasticism. Christianity would unite all men in one family, forbidding them to call any man father upon earth, only to lift them all, the lowest with the highest, a little nearer the one Father in Heaven. Ecclesiasticism has divided men into the clergy and laity, thrusting down the latter that it might exalt the former above them. It has disregarded the rights of the laboring man, and thrust priest and bishop and archbishop and cardinal and Pope in between his soul and God, teaching him to call them all father, that each may have his degree of proeminence, and the Pope he father of all, while the fatherhood of God is forgotten. All this in the name of him who was not ashamed to call the lowest of us "brethren." The worst of all is that while promising them liberty, the Church has given them bondage. The Church has made even the free, slaves, while Christ came to proclaim liberty to the captive. In the name of Him who came to give them their rights, she has robbed them of their rights. This is especially illustrated by the whole history of Sunday legislation. The very first law for closing theaters and spectacles on Sunday, the law of A. D. 425, was secured by the Church, as Neander puts it, "that the devotions of the faithful might not be disturbed." He indicates in what way their devotions were disturbed, when he says, "Because people congregate more to the theater than to the church." Professing to protect their right to worship free from all disturbance, the Church really took away their liberty to go elsewhere than to church.

While thus denying the right of the common people to amuse themselves as they saw fit on Sunday, they really professed to do it all in the behalf of the rights of all, and especially of the poor laboring man. The reason given for closing these places of amusement on Sunday, was, "Because Christians ought not to be compelled to attend these games." Of course, no one was compelled, only that they of their own free will engaged to work in these places, and so as they were open on Sunday they had to work.

In professing to give them their right to rest which they already had, the Church denied and ignored the right to work, which was as God-given and inherent as the right to rest. Professedly, it was to benefit the laboring man, but really it was to exalt the Church by destroying the competition between it and the theater,—in which competition, as Neander admits, "owing to the prevailing passion of the Christians(?) to attend these games," the Church was often worsted. This was the initial effort on the part of the Church to close places of amusement, and so turn the people into the church. The hypocrisy of it is a type of that of all other like efforts in all times. It is precisely the same thing in the nineteenth century that it was in the fifth.

The recent struggle in Toronto, Ontario, to prevent the street cars from running on Sunday, was the effort of the Church to so confine the people and prevent their access to parks and pleasure grounds, as to give them only the choice of the home or the church. All this was done in the name of the rights of the street car employés. This is something which is met everywhere, but the hypocrisy of it was never more apparent than in Toronto during the recent agitation for Sunday cars. All the labor organizations of the city declared in favor of Sunday cars. Their representatives appeared on the various platforms of the city nearly every night in earnest conflict with the clergy. This is true even of the Working Woman's Protective Association. Miss Joussaye, the president of this association, has again and again appeared on the platform, in able defense of Sunday cars. Here is an extract from the report of a speech delivered by Miss Joussaye, August 24:—

> I am present here representing the Working Woman's Protective Association in its endeavor to secure Sunday cars. Our organization has pronounced in favor of them, and that after a careful consideration of the subject. I wish to ask you as men whether the 6,000 servants girls in this city have no rights? Are not their privileges and conveniences just as important as those of the 800 street car men? [Cries of "Yes, yes," and lead applause.] The ministers and rich men of this city who are fighting against Sunday cars, and who are so solicitous lest a street car man should work on the Sabbath, make the poor white slaves in their basements work for ten hours on the day of rest, [Tremendous applause.] I have been a servant girl and I know whereof I speak. If the fourth commandment is to be followed so strictly as these men desire, why do they not notice that it includes the maidservant as well as the manservant and the beasts.

Again and again in my presence and hearing, and in the presence and hearing of all these ministers, the official representatives of labor declared for Sunday cars, and protested warmly against clerical interference with this business; and yet the preachers went right on professing to represent the interest of labor, and to speak for the laboring man.

A recent editorial in the Toronto World sets this matter out in its true light. I will give extracts:—

> In regard to Sunday labor the railway company has made several important concessions to its employés. These concessions are set out in an agreement which the company executed yesterday. The company's men are satisfied with the agreement. The Trades and Labor Council, representing the workingmen of Toronto of all trades, is satisfied with the agreement. The street car employés are satisfied to work under the conditions agreed to by the company. The Trades and Labor Council say the concession to labor is a most valuable one, and in the name of labor they accept it. Labor is satisfied. The men who will do the Sunday work are satisfied and willing to do it. Their confreres in other branches of labor are satisfied with the company's treatment of its men. All the labor people of Toronto are satisfied.
>
> Why then do the Antis howl about labor?
>
> Why do the clergy in the name of labor protest against Sunday cars?
>
> Why all this fuss about labor when labor is satisfied?
>
> What fools these Antis are making of themselves crying out against the inhuman blow that is being aimed at labor, while labor all the while is satisfied with everything, and rather likes it too!
>
> What have they or their friends ever done for labor? Nothing but talk. And for what purpose this talk? They are using labor as a cat-paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Labor will resent this interference, this insult.
>
> The Antis are not only seeking to deprive the workingman of his right to use the public coach on Sunday, but they are protesting against workingmen being allowed to manage their own affairs. Isn't it the height of impudence?
>
> Is the employment of labor on Sunday a question for the cryaymen of Toronto to decide, or is it a question for labor itself to decide?
>
> We pray that this city will be spared any more mandits tears over the poor workingman as far as this Sunday car question is concerned.
>
> The workingman has settled this affair for himself.

The Church thus professes to be the friend of labor while denying the right of labor.

The Church rides in its easy carriages, and sits in its soft pews on Sunday, while forbidding the weary toilers the street car and the parks they so loudly ask for. The Church, preachers, and people, many of them, go away to the seaside and the mountains for a summer airing and outing; and yet when the laboring man wants a little Sunday outing for himself and family, he is told in the most sneering, disrespectful manner that the air of the city street is good enough for him.

I will give one or two illustrations of the platform remarks of these pious Antis concerning their friends(?) the "poor laboring man:"—

F. S. Spence claimed that if the street cars were run they would not be patronized by honest men, but only by the loose fish of the city.

Mr. Moore was interrupted in sum of his statements by cries of, "Give us Sunday street cars and pure air."

MR. MOORE: "You talk about pure air. If you'll keep your mouth shut the air will be that much purer. The common sense of Toronto is not to be overcome by the bawling of a lot of bobs's."

The audience resented this language and cried the speaker down.

The Mayor finally threatened to clear the gallery unless the disorder ceased.

MR. MOORE: "And the gallery wouldn't suffer and the city wouldn't suffer if it was cleared out—if it was cleared of the kind of rubbish that are attempting to force Sunday cars upon us. If you've got enough sense left, keep quiet. Do you know anything?" "No-o-o-o-o."

And the audience took up the refrain, "No-o-o-o," and it ascended from pit to gallery and back again.

The Church cheers these sentiments and hisses those who oppose them; then she calls herself the friend of these laboring men who are asking for Sunday cars, and really expect that they will come to her and get converted. These are illustrations not of Christianity but of "Churchianity."

It is thus the Church reveals her shame, when she seeks and expects to convert the world, not by the power of divine love, but by legal force.
