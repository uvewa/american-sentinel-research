[From the chapter on "Civil and Religious Liberty," in "Memoirs of Alexander Campbell."]

PRESIDYESTANISM had almost entire control of the population in Western Pennsylvania, and especially in Washington County. It was naturally to be expected, therefore, that the spirit of the prevailing religion would find expression more or less in the local laws and regulations, and that these in turn would reveal the character and real tendency of this religion. Too inattentive to the probability of this latter result, and too confident in the possession of power, the adherents of the dominant party in Washington County had commenced, in 1815, a system of espionage and of arbitrary coercion, with respect to the people, which seemed to revive the spirit of the old Puritan codes, and which at the present day no Western community would for a moment endure. This system it was attempted to establish through the agency of what were called "moral societies," organized for the reputable purpose of "suppressing vice and immorality," which seemed, in the estimation of the founders of these societies, to form two different categories. But the nature of these organizations, and the plausibility of the reasons for which it was attempted to justify them, will be best seen from their own records. Thus, it is related that on the 4th day of April, 1815—

"At a meeting of a number of the citizens of the borough of Washington, to take into consideration the expediency of forming an association for the suppression of vice and immorality, James Brice was called to the chair, and Obadiah Jennings was appointed secretary. Whereupon it was resolved to form an association for the suppression of immorality." Certain rules were then adopted as the constitution of the "Washington Moral Society." In this constitution it was made the duty of every member "actively to promote the objects of the association by giving information against any one known to be guilty of profane swearing, Sabbath breaking, intoxication, unlawful gaming, keeping a disorderly public house, or any other active immorality punished by the Commonwealth." It was further enjoined upon each member to "assist and encourage his fellow members in their duty." Regular meetings were also to be held on the first Monday of May, August, November and February, at the Presbyterian meeting house in the borough of Washington, six members forming a quorum. It is recommended also that "similar associations be formed in the different parts of the county." After the constitution, an "address" was adopted, which, after setting forth at length the evils of "intemperance, Sabbath breaking, swearing," etc., proceeds as follows:—

The Society are desirous of calling the attention of their fellow-citizens more particularly to the aforesaid vices, not only because they are deemed amongst the most criminal and destructive, but also because they are more generally permitted to pass with impunity than many others of a less malignant character. At the same time it is confidently believed that there is a sufficient amount of moral influence in the community, if combined and vigorously directed, to afford an effectual corective. We would suggest the importance of forming similar associations in every part of our country. Some have been recently formed in this county, and the good effects are already visible. Can any one doubt the right or question the propriety of such associations? Is it not the indispensable duty of every member of society to promote its welfare, and prevent, according to his ability, everything which would be destructive of its interests and prosperity?

It then goes on to speak of the increase of immorality, and among other things mentions the fact that while in 1802 there were only fifty-five taverns in Washington County, there were then one hundred and fifteen, a ratio of increase much greater than that of the population.

Under the influence of these moral societies, established throughout the county, a strict watch was at once set over the behavior of every individual; local laws were passed in reference to the vices named, and the magistrates were stimulated to a rigid enforcement of them. The societies were, indeed, in their inception, simply organized bands of informers, though, emboldened by the submission of the people, their members soon began to make arrests without civil process or legal authority. As they pursued their vocation with enterprising zeal, many violations of the laws were detected and exposed, and every member of the community soon found himself to be under a sort of inquisitorial scrutiny that was as strict as it was novel, and as distasteful to the feelings of many true friends of morality as it was incompatible with the spirit of republican freedom. For a considerable time, however, the moral societies had everything their own way. Murmurs and complaints indeed there were, but no one had the hardihood to oppose, publicly, proceedings which were professibly in the interest of morality, and which, in many instances, no doubt secured the outward observance of its rules. No one that had the least regard for his popularity would venture to oppose the strict enforcement of the laws; and although many were sensible that there was certainly an undue exercise of power, or some false principle involved in such proceedings, there seemed to be no one capable of detecting it, or willing to bring down upon himself the odium of the clergy and of the dominant religious party. Nevertheless, the burden imposed upon the people seemed to grow heavier the longer it was borne, and a good deal of discontent began to manifest itself. Those who had been fined through the moral societies began to scrutinize more closely the conduct of the members composing them, and in many cases soon found that these self-constituted custodians of the public morals were themselves guilty of offenses similar to those which they condemned in others. The nature and operation of these societies, as well as the piety and consistency of their members, will, however, be better understood by a recital of actual occurrences.

On one occasion, a Mr. Martin, near Washington, had employed a teamster to convey some produce for him to Pittsburg. Returning on Saturday, they were unable to make the whole distance, and were obliged to put up for the night within a short distance of Cannonsburg. Setting out early next morning, on their way homeward, on entering the borough of Cannonsburg, they were at once stopped and informed that they would not be permitted to travel on the "Sabbath." At once acquiescing, they put up the horses, and remained at the hotel until the next morning after breakfast, when they again set out. After leaving the village, they were overtaken by the constable, who demanded of the wagoner the fine for travelling on the "Sabbath." This the wagoner refused to pay, and, after some altercation, it appeared that the constable had not with him any writ to enable him to make an arrest. He then said he would go back to town for it, and would overtake him before he got to Washington. As soon as he was gone, the wagoner got a friend on the way to drive the wagon for him, and disappeared. When the constable overtook the team at Washington, he was greatly enraged at being thus baffled, and making considerable noise, a crowd collected and began to dispute with him as to his ability to collect the fine under the circumstances. He insisted that he could and would collect it; and as he became more and more excited, one of the bystanders said to another privately, "Suppose you banter the constable to bet ten dollars on the collection of this fine. I will then go and inform upon you both, and you will both be fined; and as half the fine goes to the informer, I will receive the full amount of your fine which I will hand over to you, so that you will lose nothing, and we shall have some sport." His friend agreed to this, and immediately proposed to bet with the constable, who, in the excitement of the moment, at once accepted the offer. "Now," said the originator of the plot to him, "you have violated the law yourself, which is against betting as well as against Sabbath-breaking: and it will be my duty to go and inform upon you both." At this, the constable, finding he was caught, became quite crestfallen, and knowing that he would lose his office and his popularity if the matter were made known, besought all present to say nothing about it, and promised if they would consent to this and come into the tavern, he would "treat them all around," and give up prosecuting the case against the wagoner; all of which was agreed to amidst great merriment.

On another occasion, one of the members of the Moral Society at West Middletown, David M. ——, returning from meeting on the "Sabbath day," noticed at Wilson's tavern, two and a half miles from town, a bucket belonging to him, which his teamster had forgotten there the day before. Taking up the bucket, he concluded to carry it home with him, and on the way was rescinded by one of his friends that he was violating the law by carrying a burden on the "Sabbath day." Upon his return home the circumstances naturally gave rise to serious reflection on his part, and amongst his pious "Sabbath" musings, he considered how he should extricate himself from the dilemma in which he had become involved, and which was likely to bring reproach upon his character as an orthodox and orderly member of the church. At length the happy thought occurred to him that if he would go and inform upon himself, such an instance of self-sacrifice, disinterested zeal and respect for principle, would not only clear his escutcheon from every stain, but elevate him even higher than before in the esteem of the faithful. This bright idea was accompanied—or, as some might be so uncharitable as to think, preceded by another reflection of uncommon weight, which was, that as half the fine went to the informer, he would save two dollars by informing upon himself. Accordingly, he at once resolved to do it, and going next morning to the magistrate at an early hour, lest any one should anticipate him in the performance of what he felt was his peculiar duty, gave the information in due form and tendered half the fine as a full, efficient expiation for the offense he had committed. The magistrate, however, could not see the matter in that light, not being able to discover that the law had made any provision for so extraordinary a case; and so, reminding the pious culprit that the money went to support the preachers, compelled him to pay the whole fine.

From such facts (and similar cases were not infrequent) the moral tendencies of the societies will be sufficiently evident. It will be also seen that they had not for their object to repress or punish crimes which men commit to the injury of others, and to which the attention of the civil magistrate had been heretofore confined; but that they took under their especial care those vices which affect individuals themselves, and of which the civil authority had not previously been accustomed to take cognizance, unless when, as sometimes in the case of drunkenness, they caused a disturbance of the public peace. It will be further noticed that they attempted to engraft upon the civil code their peculiar religious views in regard to the "Sabbath," and to compel by law the whole community to submit to the Judazing opinions which they had themselves imbibed from their religious teachers.
