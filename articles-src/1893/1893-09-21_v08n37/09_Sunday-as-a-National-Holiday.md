AT its recent meeting the "National Sunday-law Sabbath" Association adopted the following resolution:—

> Resolved, That we rejoice in the growing sentiment of the American people in favor of a civil Sabbath.

> Resolved, That we are in such country decisions growing out of the Sunday institution by putting for the decision of the Supreme of legislation to restrict Sunday labor, as Christian institutions may have a more perfect observance of the Lord's day.

THE 17th of March, the feast of St. Patrick, has been recognized in Portugal as a holiday. So the Catholic Church is successfully making her claim of her own. St. Patrick's Day is officially recognized in New York; and Sunday, another popish day, is recognized nearly all the world over.—AMERICAN SENTINEL.
