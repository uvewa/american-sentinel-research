APROPOS of what has lately been said in the SENTINEL in regard to military religion, is the following, taken from the San Francisco Chronicle:—

> The first military company of the League of the Cross, the local temperance society of Catholic boys, has been organized. The members of the society in the cathedral parish have taken the lead in the matter, and their company is already started with a membership of between thirty and forty boys. They have not yet elected their officers, but that will probably be done at the next meeting. The first drill will take place next Monday night in one of the National Guard armories, in all probability.
>
> Col. William P. Sullivan has the matter of drilling the boys in hand, and will choose drill masters for all the company.
>
> The question of priority has been definitely settled. The boys of St. Mary's Cathedral will not be the first company in rank unless they earn the honor. It has been decided to make that company first which succeeds in securing the most charter members. Arrangements have not yet been made for uniforms and arms, but they will be made without difficulty at the proper time. This week companies will be formed in the other parishes of the city.

The Protestant Sunday-schools have set the example in this. Need they be surprised if it be followed? and will it be any wonder if these juvenile organizations come to emulate and at length to antagonize each other? What are the possibilities of such an education and training?
