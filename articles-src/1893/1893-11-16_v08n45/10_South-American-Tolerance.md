[This extract from the missionary news of the Christian at Work is extremely suggestive of the tolerant intolerance of some of the South American States.]

I CONSIDER, says Bishop John P. Newman (Methodist), of Omaha, South America a great field for missionary work. The State religion in all States except Argentina is the Roman Catholic, and although the constitutions are generally strict in their wording as regards religion, they are generally interpreted liberally, and the Protestant churches are not interfered with. In Peru I was not allowed to preach in Spanish. It would have been contrary to the law. But I was allowed to advertise my sermon and to preach in English as much as I desired. In Chili I said to a high official, "Your constitution provides that all public worship shall be according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church. How is it that you allow us to hold meetings undisturbed?" "Public worship," he answered, "we define as that maintained at the expense of the State. Your meetings are not maintained by the State, therefore they are not public." In Uruguay I inquired also according to what construction of the constitution Protestant meetings were allowed. "Well," answered my informant, "the constitution simply says that the Roman Catholic religion shall be maintained. It doesn't expressly forbid Protestant meetings. So we say what isn't forbidden, is allowed."
