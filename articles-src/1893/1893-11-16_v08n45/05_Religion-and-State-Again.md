The Chicago Presbyterian says: "We believe, as did the fathers of the Republic, in the separation of the Church and State, but we do not believe, as they did not believe, in the alienation of religion and the State." Just what may be meant by this is not a little difficult to determine, either from the words quoted, or the entire article. It seems, however, that while the Presbyterian would not foist upon the State any Church organization, or require the State to support any sectarian formulae; it would have the State and religion as closely allied as possible. But what religion would it have thus allied? Is there any which the Presbyterian can allude to in this remark, distinct from organization? Is not this statement simply a covert argument in favor of the union in fact of Church and State?

The Presbyterian is no doubt interested in the friendship of religion and the State, because of the supposed good which will accrue to one or both on account of their close association. This being the case, it is of course interested in the kind of religion which the State shall be closely associated with. This interest will lead it to use its influence to secure for the State's acceptance the kind of religion in which it believes the greatest good is to be found.

All other persons holding similar views of religion and State, will also possess and actively manifest a like interest. But all will not agree as to what true religion is, and hence will widely differ as to what religion should be accepted by the State.

It should be remembered that the State as such can accept but one religion. It can no more accept, encourage, and be closely and beneficially associated with several differing religions than an individual can do the same thing. Hence, before this close association between religion and the State is even begun, a choice of religion must be made by this corporate individual. But just here we are met by a distinct constitutional prohibition, which so long as observed must leave the State out of the question of religion; for it denies to it the power to make any selection or establish any kind of religion.

The mistake which pious people are making in reference to this serious question, is in the supposition that unless the State has some kind of religion the people of the State are necessarily irreligious. But the reverse of this has always been true. The more religion the State has had, the less the people have had; and only where the question of religion has been left entirely with the people individually, has the virtue, force, and moral power of it been manifested with comparative fullness.

The reason is clear: State religion is necessarily a religion of majorities or tyrannical minorities. In such religion neither the element of justice nor freedom predominates, and hence the opposite, with all their corrupting and debasing influences must prevail. The very thing which is indispensable to the efficacy of religion—freedom of choice—is wanting in a State religion, and can only be present in full force where the State has no religion and cannot have.
