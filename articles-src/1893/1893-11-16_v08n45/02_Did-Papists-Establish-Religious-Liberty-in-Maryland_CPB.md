We have several times recently referred to the claim of the papists that Roman Catholics established religious liberty in Maryland, and have challenged their right to any credit whatever on that score. First, because what they did was done only to prevent the legal establishment of some form of Protestantism; and second, because religious liberty was never established in Maryland, but only religious toleration. It has been well said that "toleration is not the opposite of intoleration, but is only a counterfeit of it. Both are despotisms. The one assumes to itself the right of withholding liberty of conscience, and the other of granting it." But toleration is the highest conception possible to papists, and consequently no State under the control of papists ever established religious *liberty*.

The charter under which the colony of Maryland was permanently established was granted to Cecilius Calvert, second Lord Baltimore, June 20, 1632, by Charles I. The established church that day, was then, as it is now, not Roman Catholic, but the Church of England. The charter granted to Calvert provided that—

> the patronage and adrowears of all churches which (with the increasing worship and religion of Christ) within the said region, islands, islets and limits aforesaid hereafter shall happen to be built; together with license and faculty of erecting and founding churches, chapels and places of worship in convenient and suitable places within the premises, and of causing the same to be dedicated and consecrated according to the ecclesiastical laws of our kingdom of England.

The laws of England provided only for churches and chapels and worship according to the ritual of the Church of England, and according to this charter Lord Baltimore had no authority to establish any other. He is, therefore, entitled to no credit for not establishing the Roman Catholic religion. He could not have done so had he attempted it, without risking, not only his proprietary rights, but also his head; for the charter further provided, as follows:—

> We will also, out of our abundant grace, for us, our heirs and successors, do firmly charge, constitute, certain and command, that the said province be of our allegiance; and that all and singular the subjects and liege-man of us, our heirs and successors, transplanted or hereafter to be transplanted, into the province aforesaid, and the children of them, and of others their descendants, whether already born there or hereafter to be born, be and shall be liege-men of us, our heirs and successors of our kingdom of England and Ireland; and in all things shall be held, treated, reputed and esteemed as the faithful liege-men of us, and our heirs and successors, born within our kingdom of England; also lands, tenements, revenues, services, and other hereditaments whatsoever, within our kingdom of England, and other our dominion, to inherit or otherwise purchase, receive, take, have, hold, buy and possess, and the same to use and enjoy, and the same to give, sell, alien, and bequeath; and likewise all privileges, franchises, and liberties of this our kingdom of England, freely, quietly, and peaceably to have and possess, and the same may use and enjoy in the same manner as our liege-men born, or to be born, within our said kingdom of England, without impediment, molestation, vexation, impeachment, or grievance of us, or any of our heirs or successors; any statute, act, ordinance, or provision to the contrary, notwithstanding.

Observe, this section of the charter provided that all privileges, franchises, and liberties were to be the same in the province as in England, "any statute, act, ordinance, or provision to the contrary notwithstanding." This made it impossible for either Lord Baltimore or the colonial legislature to abridge either the civil or the ecclesiastical rights of the people, as guaranteed by the laws of England. This meant that while the Established Church of England might be made also the established Church of the colony, no other could be thus established. Indeed it meant even more than this, and more than Lord Baltimore, as a consistent Catholic, could carry out, for it at least rendered probable the establishment in the colony of the English Church. To prevent this, and also to defeat the design of the Puritans to seize the colony, Leonard Calvert's legislature passed in 1649 the act by which "all Christian sects were secured in the public profession of their faith, and allowed to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience." This act was perhaps not warranted by the charter granted by Charles I, to Cecilius Calvert, but it gave the papists that liberty which they did not uninterruptedly enjoy in England, and was less likely to invite royal censure than would have been an act, establishing Romish worship to the exclusion of all other forms. This would not have been permitted by the king, nor would it have been endured by the colonists; for only three years after the meeting of the first legislature, a large company of Puritans settled in Maryland and soon began to manifest a spirit of resistance to the authorities. The following from the American Cyclopædia, art., Maryland, is to the point:—

> The first legislature met in 1639. In 1642 a company of Puritans, who had been expelled from Virginia for non-conformity, settled in Maryland, and soon began to manifest a spirit of resistance to the authority of the proprietary. . . . The Puritans, whose arrival in the colony has already been noticed, settled in Providence, which at a later period received the name of Annapolis, and became the seat of government. They still proved turbulent, and as a means of conciliating them their settlement was erected in 1650 into a separate county under the name of Anne Arundel; and still additional members of this denomination arriving from England, Charles County was organized for them a short time afterward. From this time they began to exercise a controlling influence in public affairs. On the overthrow of the royal government and the establishment of the commonwealth in England, their party insisted upon an immediate recognition of the new order of things. The authorities, however, proceeded to proclaim Charles II. But in the next assembly it was found that the Puritans had a majority; and in 1652 commissioners from England visited Maryland, with whom were associated Clayborne, the old opponent of the proprietary government, and Bennett, the leader of the Puritans of Anne Arundel County. They removed Gov. Stone, and completely established the authority of the commonwealth. Kent Island was once more delivered up to Clayborne, and he acquired also Palmer Island at the mouth of the Susquehanna. In 1654 Lord Baltimore made a determined effort to regain possession of the province, and having succeeded reinstated Gov. Stone; but Bennet and Clayborne, the former of whom was now governor of Virginia, again interfered, and reversed all that Lord Baltimore had accomplished. They established a commission for the government of the colony, and placed Captain Fuller at its head. Hereupon a civil contest ensued, and hostilities were carried on by land and water. Providence was attacked by the proprietary party, but the Puritans were victorious, and killed or captured the whole invading force. Many of the captives, among whom was Gov. Stone, were condemned to death, and at least four of them were executed. This decisive action was fought March 25, 1655. Three years after, however, the power of the proprietary was restored, and his brother Philip Calvert appointed governor.

This shows how futile would have been any effort on the part of the papists to have established Romanism in Maryland in the face, not only of the prohibition of the charter, but in opposition to opposing sects which were more than a match for the Catholics. As we have before remarked in these columns, Maryland does not even now enjoy religious *liberty*, but only religious *toleration*, and that was granted by the legislature composed not wholly of papists, as many imagine, but of papists and Puritans, as a compromise to which both parties were driven by fear of each other.
