THIS Nation has been a favored country. God was manifestly in its founding; his powerful hand miraculously restrained the mighty enemies from without, which threatened the Republic when the colonies were weak. Those within who belong here, themselves turned to be perhaps severe contests with the demon of intolerance, were for the most part controlled. Had the same earnests and devoted braved the same expressed joy our forebears seem to have unitedly continued by the unceasing generation the Republic would have been to-day the freest power of substantial force.

During all these years and amid all the changes of its history, the recognition of the principles of true liberty—which are the principles of Christianity, of Heaven, were not regulated. God could and has mightily blessed and prospered the Republic. But that time is now past. The SENTINEL has been telling, faithfully as it could, how it is declining. As to the principles of liberty, the people were stating clearly how it would be done, and how it must be done, and indeed it has come to pass, in vain continues to proclaim what is—by the wickedness was unmistakable. The people have sown the tares; and how it knew not what they were doing, they were deliberately sowing them; but the truth, when brought to them, yet it matters not now what harvest they will reap; for the results are the same. They might have known, therefore they blasphemously and stand condemned, although they themselves may be supreme judges and law makers of the Nation.

Jesus knew what he was teaching when he spent three and a half years of his ministry telling all about it informally as plainly as possible and directly. Then after it was done, it seems now very strange that in face of all that Jesus told him he should

go and do precisely the very thing Jesus told him not to do. Jesus had said that it would have been better for the man who should do that wicked act, and he had never been born. The truths which Jesus taught, he thought, he has something to be gained about. He thought that Jesus would gain more by it, and that to betray Jesus would be his financial glory. He probably thought as about betraying him into the hands of the civil government of that day; Jesus was thinking for Jesus' only. He thought that money, and not religion, that Jesus would take care of himself and of his own, that he could betray, and by the betrayal gain, and Jesus do the rest. But the people, he learned with bitterness that Jesus knew what he was teaching about. He has earned the wages that he agreed to, in exact amount. His reward has been confirmed. Jesus himself in the crucifying had such a struggle with the terrible prospect of it, he exclaims himself—yes, and all for thirty pieces of money.

And now the whole body of National Reformers—

Another point will Judas by his disclosing the faithful warning of Jesus go would began freely something of which he himself could not see the end. So with all the rest. First of all, the rulers and the Pharisees, who planned it and brought about the conspiracy after him, they knew Jesus could not redeem him. He still held to be true to the characters so had to be left to the characters to be redeemed by themselves. It is a fearful commentary that Jesus himself that his prayers were unanswered. In view of his forbearance and mercy, Judas had all the time and all the chance that any one of the Jewish nation could have wished, for he had listened to the gracious words that fell from the Master's lips. And the time when mercy and forgiveness lingered and pleaded, still there was no avail, that comfortness that all the princes showed that they knew.

It is also said of Judas that when Jesus would explain the situation he told them all beforehand that the many circumstances would be reached that he only was not deceived. In reply it was freely acknowledged by the nation that all that Jesus realized this and more, and spoke to his people, warning them the full content of the power of evil; yes, he knew it all, the whole of it, from the mind himself to—a fallen apostate, and a nation ruined. Like Judas he gave him the bag, and betrayed him to the money, but was led by Selfish. This is significant of Judas that such truths were delivered to him.

All this was written for our warning.

We, on, constituting this Nation, for so long a time have been blessed by the light and favor God has to accumulate, which it was with, the mercy of God who when, in this face of solemn warnings, to follow in the way of all the nations, in the history of other nations, as others in the history of other nations, seek by force of human legislation to embody the principles of religious freedom, we act them aside from him, from Jesus, from all truth. So then the nations treat with contempt the revelation, from truth, from Israel, as truth. So that it has not been unknown. God has repeatedly, in every dispensation and age, been given to religious liberty, been given repeatedly, and lack of every human right has been given from the foundation of the world. Like Judas, now will he prove it again. This nation presumptuously upon ground which goes beyond anything in the history of all was to extricate themselves?

The content of God's Spirit has been spurned (and is it only by the warning sounds and notes of Mrs. E. G. White's work) upon himself. Specifically, God's Spirit was present in the Senate chamber, and then. Yet they determined the will of the Nation not to meddle with the religious, and the opposite positions were being clamored for by the chief priests of to-day. They themselves know
