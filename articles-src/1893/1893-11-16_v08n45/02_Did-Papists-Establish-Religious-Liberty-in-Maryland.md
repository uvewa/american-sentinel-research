WE have several times recently referred to the claim made by Catholics that the Catholics established religious liberty in Maryland, and have challenged their right to make such a claim on two grounds: First, because what they did was done merely to protect themselves from some form of Protestantism; and second, because religious liberty was never established in Maryland, but only religious toleration. A bias we would make still more emphatic, as it is the opposite of intolerance, but is only a compound of it, and as dangerous. The one asserting to itself the right of withholding liberty of conscience, and the desire of granting it. But toleration is the highest conception possible of the Papacy, and under those circumstances the control of papists ever established different proportions than ever before in the experience of man, the results will not be far reaching and more destructive than previously. There never was a time when pseudo-religious and religio-political organizations were so numerous and world-wide in their influence as at present.

The charter under which the colony of Maryland was permanently settled, was granted to Cecilius Calvert, second Lord Baltimore, June 20, 1632.

1. The established church, that day, was not the Roman Catholic Church at all, but the Church of England. The king was its head, and the charter provided (with the surviving worship and religion of the Holy Church) that "the patronages and advowsons aforesaid hereafter shall happen to be built, together with license and faculty of erecting and founding churches, chapels and oratories, in convenient and suitable places within the premises, and of causing the same to be dedicated and consecrated, according to the laws of our kingdom of England."

Here there was no separation of church and state, but rather the union with the Church of England: and according to this charter Lord Baltimore had no authority to establish any other. He is, therefore, entitled to no credit for not establishing the Roman Catholic religion. He could not have done so had he attempted it; without violating, not only his proprietary rights, his his land, for the charter further provided:—

We will also, out of our abundant grace, for us our heirs and successors, do firmly charge, constitute and command, that the said province be of our allegiance; and that all and singular the subjects and liege men of us our heirs, and successors, transplanted or hereafter to be transplanted into the province aforesaid, and the children of them, and of others their descendants, whither already born therein or hereafter to be born, be and shall be denizens and lieges of us our heirs, and successors, of our kingdom of England and Ireland; and in all things shall be held, treated, reputed, and esteemed as the faithful liege men of us and our heirs and successors, born within our kingdom of England; and likewise any lands, tenements, revenues, services, and other hereditaments whatsoever, within our kingdom of England, and other our dominions, to inherit or otherwise purchase, receive, take, have, hold, buy, and possess, and the same to use and enjoy, and the same to give, sell, alien, and bequeath; and likewise all privileges, franchises, and liberties of this our kingdom of England, freely quietly, and peaceably to have and possess, and the same may use and enjoy in the same manner as our liege men born, or to be born, within our said kingdom of England, without impediment, molestation, vexation, impeachment, or grievance of us, or any of our heirs and successors, any statute, act, ordinance or provision to the contrary notwithstanding.

Others, this section of the charter provides, in substance, that all political liberties were to be the same in the province and the kingdom. There is not a divergence, or provision to its contrary not authorized. This made it as impossible for either Lord Baltimore or the colonial legislature to abridge any other civil or the ecclesiastical rights of the people of the province any more than to enlarge. This meant that while the Established Church of England might be made also the established church of Maryland, no other could be thus established. Indeed the colony was not a separate government, but it was a colony; and in this event, Lord Baltimore, as a consistent Catholic could carry out, if at last resources probable the establishment in the colony of the English Church, to protect his land ownership in the colony, forever; and, this and also to defeat the design of the Puritans in this direction. Leonard Calvert's legislature passed in 1649 the act of toleration—as he himself termed it. It went to the public profession of their faith, and failed to worship God according to the forms of the "Holy Church" aforesaid." This act was perhaps not warranted by the charter. But, however that it, is Cecilius Calvert, but it gave the papists that liberty that they did not have, to enjoy their religion, which they uninterruptedly enjoy in England, and was in itself the utmost limit, the act of religion would have been as set, establishing Romish worship to the toleration of all other forms. This would not have been permitted by the king, nor would it have been tolerated by the Puritans. Within three years after the meeting of the first assembly which had in it the first Puritan settlers, a Puritan colony from Virginia settled in Maryland and soon began to make its influence felt in all their Puritan therefrom. The following from the American Cyclopædia will help to make the matter clear:—

The first legislature met in 1638. In 1649 a company of Puritans from Virginia, who had been driven out for non-conformity, settled in Maryland, and soon became the principal population, to the great dissatisfaction of the proprietary. The Puritans, whose settlement was called Providence (now Annapolis), having overpowered the proprietary party, seized the name of Annapolis, and because and the name given it by the proprietary was Ann Arundel. This county having been erected in 1650 into a separate county under the name of Anne Arundel, and still additional territory was added to it in the ensuing years. Charles County was organized for a time under the government of the Puritans, and became a cause to a condition influencing in public affairs. In 1654 the Puritans seized the government, and that party insisted upon those as of the Church of England and others having had no part in its affairs. In the contest that followed, it was finally ascertained, it was found that the Puritans had been in their assertion, and then a compromise was arranged. Charlotte, the old opposer of the claims of the Calvert family, was restored to her ancient possession as a separate county under the name of Anne Arundel County. This quarrel was never fully adjusted, for Cecilius Calvert, the proprietor, finding his best interests to be served in the Puritan alliance, promptly made advance up to Charlotte, and he acquired the assent of one of the commissioners of Parliament. Then followed a period of decided effort to regain possession of the province; and at length, in 1657, the proprietary was confirmed in his rights by an agreement between Lord Baltimore and Claiborne, the Puritan of whose was then recognized. In 1660 Philip Calvert, half-brother of Cecilius, became Governor of the colony.

We will also, out of our abundant grace, secure a commission for the government of the said province, that the said province in things whatsoever shall be liable, etc., "particularly in a defense by sea and by land and water. Providence was at this time the capital. In 1694 the government was removed to the town called Ann Arundel, and at least four of them were executed. This is one of the records. In the year 1660, Philip Calvert, the Puritan, became governor with full toleration secured, and his brother Philip Calvert approved."

Others of this section of the charter provide, in substance, how little could have been established of toleration. Romanism in Maryland was at its best in the time of the first two proprietaries and of the proprietary government of the charter, but its opposition to opposing the charter, which was the basis of all the civil and religious legislation, was only the toleration which the papists themselves enjoyed.

Did religious toleration, established and managed in these colonies, Maryland, with the chartered right to all these things, amount to religious liberty? No.

And if this was so, how far from religious liberty, of worship, of papists, was simply intrigued in the matter of the politics of a new country, from which both parties were driven by fear and unrest, to their homes.
