THE New York Press of Monday, Oct. 30th contained this bit of news: "The assassin of Mayor Harrison was a good Catholic." What does it mean that the largest per cent. of criminals, law-breakers, and assassins of public officials are Catholic? What does it mean that the wretched coward who stole into notoriety by the assassination of one of Chicago's most popular public men, is branded as a good Catholic? Does it mean that the Catholic Church does not develop men of moral character and Christian virtue? Does it mean that they do not teach the pupils in their church schools, that murder is wrong, unlawful, punishable and God-forbidden? Does it mean that their religion is neglectful of giving a full and unqualified explanation of the curse by divine law, and the threat by human law against the destruction of life? Does it mean that the holy Decalogue is throttled and gagged by priest and sister? Does it mean their ignoring of the fact, that Protestants are American citizens whose rights will suffer no encroachment; without the invocation of the exact penalty of justice? Does it mean that the law of God and this country can be hoodwinked by the cry of "the deed of a crank"? Does it mean that the Catholic Church, refuses to recognize the killing of a non-Catholic as murder? Does it mean that the church will shield that villainous brute and murder from the tooth of the law? Or, what does it mean that the majority of outlaws are Catholic, and that many of them escape the whip of justice?
