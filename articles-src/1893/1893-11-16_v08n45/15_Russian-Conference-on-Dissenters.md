In the last of October a conference of Russian Church men was called to meet in Moscow to discuss methods for the disposition of dissenters, with especial reference to Stundists and Baptists. Two similar assemblies have been held before and the suggestions of the previous conferences have been followed by the government. It would seem that nothing remains for these dissenting sects but exile or extinction. These are object lessons. That which they teach should not be belittled.
