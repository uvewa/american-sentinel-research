THE FOLLOWING is from *Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper:*—

The *Economist's Standard* is constrained to say a few things on the Sunday labor question which are calculated to make the advocates of Sunday laws very unhappy. Leach has been breaking the law or has been made to appear to have broken it, and if it is true he is fined by the magistrates. He finds himself guilty, and his friends and fellow-citizens say that he is not—that the law has no jurisdiction. The people in his shop, whilst Sabbatarians are allowed to pursue their avocations next door with entire impunity. There is another aspect of the case with his friends; the magistrates are not men who accept the authority of the Act: Pedlar the First, or Leach be punished? Again, are there grocer shops to be found open on Sunday mornings by those who sell milk or newspapers or confectionery on Sundays? Why should two restaurants be permitted to open? The act is simply absurd. A public man may not sell tobacco, whilst a religious man may not. A Universalist may distribute tracts, and some few people may imagine the act of the grocer to be immoral.

There is an evident inconsistency in the matter, but it is not this thing alone in which complaint should be made.

No law, touch it with the evidence of any Sunday law, consistent with the rights of a free people, never can be, a consistent Sunday law, and every man knows it, consistent simply because they have no shadow of foundation in right and justice. Any law that place the observance of Sunday in any way a contrary to the law of God, and which people to compel men to observe it, is for which men to sin; and in the second place, to compel men to rest even on the Sabbath, of the Lord, in contrary to God's law, and Sunday laws are evil, in principle, and in application.—*Present Truth.*
