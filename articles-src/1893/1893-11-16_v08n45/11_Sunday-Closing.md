ENOUGH energies have been expended in fighting the battle of Sunday opening and keeping open the World's Fair on Sunday to have accomplished a world of good in the line of roads. What has been accomplished has been well done, and in the right direction, and do good, but the loss to the cause of Christ, and of religion, is greater, and the energy and money spent in galling with the present drift of evil, crime, etc., that the powers of the State and the State channel, the government of the World's Fair. "Reader therefore under the State can you not see," a keen observer of the things that are God's," draws a distinction, so must we, between God and Cæsar. Cæsardom is a machine, insatiable, incapable of moral function or force. It cannot reflect the tendencies of its people, as a mirror reflects the person, it cannot and will emit any religious sentiment based upon truth and conscience. The "Congressional providences," as this has been aptly called.

That truth well told. If any gunning act has been used against, arises from grinding the state religion on the people through the agencies of the legislature, "examples," outside of law. What are they! What advantage has resulted? Has it advanced the growth of the religion? Conscience into it and back of it to cut the foundation from under any appeal to the law of God and the Bible, the becoming it. Shall we have a religion when, that time comes the false claims of Sunday will refuse to listen by the State, and the Sabbath will be restored. Until that trust that is in the growing State religion, we will ever suffer repeated defeat and continued waste of valuable time and money.

"Europe almost a hundred and fifty years Europe was satisfied by religious persuasion in the form of the Inquisition. Since then, it is the great truth full and forth the nations have been imbued with concern with the opinions of men, and no church has been found with any political dogma with the form of worship which has been free. It is a historic fact."—*History of Civilization in England,* Vol. I.
