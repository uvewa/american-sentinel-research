On October 31, Mr. Bowers, of California, presented to the United States Congress, a petition of the American Protective Association of Church Exclusion, from the subjects of which intolerant results were the exclusive, and also expressed the purpose of establishing the nation's land, to refuse to return, and let got a man who could not in good conscience hold office. In the same manner, the rights of the religion rights referred to in the presentation of seventh-day observance were also violated. The speech of Senator Crockett in their defense contains the following:—

"I want to say to you, friends, when we get on conquery, were they not all Roman Catholics?

"Now, what are the facts? What is the common ground upon which we are to stand? I want to ask you: For what? 'What is the common ground upon which we should stand?' I want you to answer me first for that! 'What is the common ground for them? What is the meaning?' Mr. Lincoln used to say:—

"We do not know when the world was made. We do not know how the world was. I do know. You may not like the Jews. I like all people. We must all come to one place. Friends, it is no matter of creed. But there is one thing you will all admit, they are a faithful, honest, upright people. I have Jewish acquaintances and friends. They observe the Sabbath day that Christ observed, and you can go and say all you please about those people, God Almighty will take care of them. (Laughter.)

"I want you to go home to your Jewish friends—if you talk about this, being a Christian land, I will give you some more instances to digest, some more things for you to think about—go and talk with the Jewish Rabbis in the land, who knows that they are a good, honest people—who observe the laws."

Mr. Blair's reference to the Parliament of Religions raises the query in case itself: if those fairly-fixed, long-expected and long-hoped for times were like at hand, the Orient, Dharmapala, Moconakal, and a host of other Oriental religionists, who, at the Parliament of Religions professed—if they could have had in the gallery of the House during the discussion of this resolution, and had, and in listening, would have been the mingled surprise, amusement, contempt, compassion, as they would have felt? And would they not have been justified in feeling a great contempt for a Nation that had, or that might have a righteous indignation for one that calls itself a "Christian Nation"?

To use console on times of less is to be far too corrupt.

THE "religio-political methods of the American Protective Association have now been so pronounced in character as, in the order of course, to call for the attention of Congress and the appointment of a congressional committee of investigation, because of the serious charges, and imputations, Mr. Wendock, of Michigan, made on the floor of Congress touching the validity of the election of a member; and the reference with which he held specifying reasons why the election could not be well judged valid.

In connection with this matter I might say that the "A. P. A." is an abbreviation used for the name of a society which has become very general throughout the United States. If to investigate its patriotism and others contest is an American, if to inquire into its motives is unkind, if I have it has gone to the length of ordering arms——

Mr. HOPKINS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to a question of order.

The SPEAKER. The gentleman is not in order.

Mr. WENDOCK. Give the gentleman a chance to hear what the gentleman is saying.

Mr. HOPKINS. He will please take their seats and come to order.

The SPEAKER. The gentleman has the floor.

Mr. WENDOCK. I am asked to state to the House the question of religion which has been brought in connection with this very contest. I have just received a telegram from the Congregational clergy of a certain city which says, "In the churches of our city, she is no conflict between religion. They are united in their mutual spiritual work. Now, this does not concern me at all politically, certainly, and I do not know what sort of religion they want. Neither do I care, for the reason that they will give us the good old Christian religion after all. And yet, Mr. Speaker, when any organization seeks to use the instrumentalities of religion, in the interest of the efforts of its mission of political preferment, to prey upon the ignorance and credulity and prejudices, to limit the immigration of the lower orders of Chinese people, its practical purpose amounts to a private system, instruction to the morality of our country, an investigation by the proper authorities of this body into this religio-political society should immediately come, in the interest of all these great principles for which this Republic stands."

Mr. Blair's reference to the Parliament of Religions raises the query in case itself: if those fairly-fixed, long-expected and long-hoped for times were at hand, the Orient, Dharmapala, Moconakal, and a host of other Oriental religionists, who, at the Parliament of Religions professed—if they could have had in the gallery of the House during the discussion of this resolution, and had, in listening, would have been the mingled surprise, amusement, contempt, compassion, as they would have felt? And would they not have been justified in feeling that this call itself a "Christian Nation"?

To use console on times of less is to be far too corrupt.

THE first religious reference in this discussion was from the lips of Henry W. Blair, formerly senator from Massachusetts, and author of the well known Blair Sunday Rest Bill. The congressional record of Mr. Blair's words is this:—

The SPEAKER. The gentleman has the floor.

Mr. BLAIR. I rise up for one moment.

MR. SPEAKER. Tell us what the matter is.

Mr. DURLEY. Mr. Speaker, is that a privileged motion?

The SPEAKER. The gentleman states that he has no personal interest in this contest. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.

Mr. HOPKINS, of Illinois. Does that permit the gentleman from New Hampshire to proceed?

Mr. MOORE. We understand you sir.—

In connection with this it has transpired that this organization has a very peculiar history of transactions, and that it is possessing arms with a view to possible violence, and that the public seems to be in a state of unrest about it. Now it seems to me to be arranging a scrutiny.

Now, here has been some criticism and some complaint indeed concerning a remark made by myself. I stated what every one in this House knows, and what every one of the intelligent ministers of religion throughout the country, to this organization, has knowledge of, a movement to stamp out Romanism in this country, to so proper personal politicos by appeals to the power of the law, and this I maintain. Now, a political organization in the United States that tells the members of any religious association in the United States, that their religion disqualifies them for the sentiments or political opinions of those who compose the membership of any other religious body has a right to control, or down-trod, or discriminate against that is un-American, and that is what I said, and that is what I repeat.

The more proposition was presented, the more unmasked and the more marked the political and religio-political purpose appeared. I cited the Congregational Church in California the other day that declared that the government should be adopted, but the proposition to declare that the nation should be a "Christian nation" was overwhelmingly rejected. It was offered by a member of the church, and declared that three-fourths of the clergy of that denomination were opposed to any such measure.

Mr. MORSE. Has the gentleman from California the resolutions of the Congregational conference together with him?

Mr. RAINES. There is no such case in Maryland. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has started upon just what I was getting at. We have heard from the Congregational Church. Will he be kind enough to tell this House from what source he derived his information? I guarantee that I will either produce the information before the close—I can inform this gentleman and to this House, as I will confess that I need to.

Mr. BOWERS, of California (interrupting): Have you the report?

Mr. RAINES. I say we had a case three some years ago, and——

Mr. BOWERS, of California: Oh! I will read you a dispatch from the Congregational clergy of Maryland that will prevent that.

Mr. RAINES. Will the gentleman introduce his own statement about the denominational laws he has?

Mr. BOWERS, of California. Mr. Speaker I make the statement before this House and this country, that I have the utmost contempt for that kind of an organization which would prevent citizens of this Republic from holding office and which depends upon its sheriff's title and the prison cell to keep down men's beliefs and convictions—convictions of men. I think when you come to put your hand on the Chinese and say, "You are an alien and not admitted to citizenship because of" this, "take your noncitizens home from China and send them to your miserable country," you are saying a thing to the legislature which we cannot, under the religion.

And what has this to do with Chinese? All merely to create prejudice. The men who would talk so are not men. When it has been openly and publicly and boldly said that we are not men, that they deprive us, that they desire to persecute us and deprive us of everything that Christians enjoy today, as those that did under the cloak of the religion—the Holy Roman Catholic and Protestant.

The discussion being still continued, that none need fear the ultimate result.

Now, here has been some criticism and some complaint indeed concerning a remark made by myself. I stated what every one in this House knows, and what every one of the intelligent ministers of religion throughout the country, to this organization, has knowledge of, a movement to stamp out Romanism in this country, to so proper personal politicos by appeals to the power of the law, and this I maintain. Now, a political organization in the United States that tells the members of any religious association in the United States, that their religion disqualifies them for the sentiments or political opinions of those who compose the membership of any other religious body has a right to control, or down-trod, or discriminate against that is un-American, and that is what I said, and that is what I repeat.

The more proposition was presented, the more unmasked and the more marked the political and religio-political purpose appeared. I cited the Congregational Church in California the other day that declared that the government should be adopted, but the proposition to declare that the nation should be a "Christian nation" was overwhelmingly rejected. It was rejected because two or three ministers rose on the floor of the conference, which represented the largest representation of the membership of the church, and declared that three-fourths of the clergy of that denomination were opposed to any such measure.

Mr. MORSE. Has the gentleman from California the resolutions of the Congregational conference—

Mr. RAINES. There is no such case in Maryland. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has started upon just what I was getting at. We have heard from the Congregational Church. Will he be kind enough to tell this House from what source he derived his information? I guarantee that I will either produce the information before the close—I can inform this gentleman and to this House, as I will confess that I need to.

Mr. BOWERS, of California (interrupting): Have you the report?

Mr. RAINES. I say we had a case there some years ago.

Mr. BOWERS, of California: Oh! I will read you the full correspondence. I would like to ask why the House should give our attention to this, or are they going to resist what we have to say? There is an evident inconsistency in the matter, but it is not this thing alone in which complaint should be made.

From this, with the evidence of any Sunday law in this matter, the gentleman referred to? If so, I hope he will print them with his remarks.

The first religious reference in this discussion was from the lips of Henry W. Blair, formerly senator from Massachusetts, and author of the well known Blair Sunday Rest Bill. The congressional record of Mr. Blair's words is this:—

The SPEAKER. The gentleman has the floor.

Mr. BLAIR. I set out to touch upon this question of religion which has been brought in connection with this very contest. I have just received a telegram from the Congregational clergy of a certain city which says, "In the churches of our city, there is no conflict between religions. They are united in their mutual spiritual work purely and wholly, and I do not know what sort of religion they want. Neither do I care, for the reason that they will give us the good old Christian religion after all. And yet, Mr. Speaker, when any organization seeks to use the instrumentalities of religion, in the interest of the efforts of its mission of political preferment, to prey upon the ignorance and credulity and prejudices of the lower classes, an investigation of the lower orders of Chinese people, its practical purpose amounts to a private system, instruction to the morality of our country, an investigation by the proper authorities of this body into this religio-political society should immediately come, in the interest of all these great principles for which this Republic stands."

Mr. WALLACE. This society, which exists in several States, has become particularly offensive in Michigan by reason of its operations in that State, in connection with the elections. Its adherents are apparently drawn from the manufacturing of firearms and equipping it as a military organization. I am not personally familiar with the affairs of this organization. I do not deem it proper at this time——

Mr. MOORE. What society is the gentleman referring to?

Mr. WALLACE. Tell us the name of the organization.

Mr. DURLEY. Mr. Speaker, is that a privileged motion?

THE SPEAKER. The gentleman states that he has no personal interest in this contest. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.

Mr. HOPKINS, of Illinois. Does that permit the gentleman from New Hampshire to proceed?

Mr. MOORE. We understand you sir.—

In connection with this it has transpired that this organization has a very peculiar history of transactions, and that it is possessing arms with a view to possible violence, and that the public seems to be in a state of unrest about it. Now it seems to me to be arranging a scrutiny.

In a last discussion, the report of which occupies a column and a half of the *Congressional Record*, upon the resolution offered by Mr. Wendock, the whole question of the A. P. A. was discussed for some hours. In the discussion upon this matter, it is a noteworthy feature that Mr. Morse, of Massachusetts, and Mr. Bowers, of Maine, who have made themselves especially prominent in the contest, have also been before Congress, member to member, and both have, in the most vigorous terms, resented and resisted the mention of this matter. It is natural, perhaps, that those members of this congressional committee, who have openly and publicly espoused, not the principle of freedom of religion, in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and in other measures, should actually come before Congress, and the reference with which congressional investigation into the motives and purposes of the American Protective Association should be invoked. In all their skill and block, as far as lies in their power, congressional investigation of a spirit and make publicly known all the political motives and the spirit of the same fervor and intensity which Roman Catholic effort is being resisted. Such an attempt were made to investigate the American Protective Association, sometimes known as the Hibernian Rifle, or any other Catholic political society.

The question, Why should it be, of full and free investigation of all who have an object, and have invited, with a similar political motive, they in their professed purposes, is Religious, particularly in their political machinations, is more than obvious. Religious partisanship in every form, whether Catholic or Protestant, is intriguing. Organized Protestant politics are just as intriguing as organized Catholic politics; and all intelligent Christian men, are as profoundly convinced that the greatest danger to this country is not so much in any party, political or religious, as it is in the growth and spirit of organized Romanized Protestantism; indeed, there are those who believe and who maintain that it was not Rome, but the image to Rome, that the prophecy declares will be the first to demand and destroy the liberties of its people.

This office is in receipt of a considerable number of letters, from widely different sources, including officers of the American Protective Association, and some from those from whom these letters come are well known to myself, who have written the articles particularly referring to this association,
