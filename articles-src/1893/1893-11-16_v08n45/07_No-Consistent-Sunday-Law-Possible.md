The following is from Lloyd's Weekly London Newspaper, of the 8th ult.:

> The Lowestest Standard is constrained to say a word or two with regard to the prosecution of Frederick Leach, the Kirkley news-agent and tobacconist. Leach has been breaking the law by opening his shop on Sunday, and as a result has been twice fined by the magistrates. He feels himself hardly treated, and that not without reason. He sees in the same town a man fined for selling a Lloyd's paper in his shop, whilst Salvationists are allowed to have the War Cry about the streets and to turn their place of worship into a news-agent's shop with impunity. There is another aspect of the case with respect to the boats which during the season ply to hire on Sundays. Their proprietors are not summoned, although the act forbids the use of any boats or barge on the Lord's day. Then why should Leach be punished? Again, there are those grocers in the town who possess beer licenses. Why should they not be summoned for selling other articles on Sundays? Why should two restaurants be permitted to open? The act is simply absurd. A publican may sell tobacco on Sunday, whilst a regular tobacconist may not. A Salvationist may hawk papers, whilst a recognized news-agent may not; and some few people may imagine the act to be a good one, whilst other may not.

There is an evident inconsistency in the law, but that is not the thing against which complaint should be made. The trouble is with the existence of any Sunday law. There never has been, and never can be, a consistent Sunday law. Sunday laws are arbitrary and inconsistent simply because they have no shadow of foundation in right and justice. In the first place the observance of Sunday in any way is contrary to the law of God, and therefore to compel men to observe it, is to compel men to sin; and in the second place, to compel men to rest even on the Sabbath of the Lord, is contrary to God's law, and so Sunday laws are evil in principle and in application.
