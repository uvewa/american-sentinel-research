At the Baptist ministers' meeting, held in the Twenty-third Street Baptist Church, in this city, on Monday Oct. 6, Rev. Dr. Hiscox, of Saratoga, read a paper on "The Transference of the Sabbath." The paper presented was somewhat similar in form of treatment of the subject to that read on the occasion reported by a correspondent in last week's issue. Dr. Hiscox showed the utter unreliability of all, and the completely mistaken application of most, of the New Testament texts quoted to uphold the idea of Sabbath transference. The reading was listened to with general respect. A few were very uneasy in their seats, and one young divine was overheard to remark, "Twaddle!" with about the same subvocal unction with which he would ordinarily say "Amen." The moderator remarked when the paper was finished that it had left him as regards the question, in that state of mind now made historic by the classic expression, "Where am I at"? All discussion of the paper was deferred until the next meeting, Monday, Nov. 13.
