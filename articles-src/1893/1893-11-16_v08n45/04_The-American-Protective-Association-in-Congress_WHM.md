The religio-political methods of the American Protective Association have become so pronounced in character as, in the minds of some, to call for the attention of Congress and the appointment of a congressional committee of investigation.

On October 27, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Weadock, of Michigan, having risen "to a question of high privilege touching the validity of the election of a member," and referring to a petition which he held specifying reasons why this election was not legal and valid, said:—

In connection with this matter I might say that it will involve an investigation of the existence and animus of a society which has become very general throughout the United States—a society which the petitioners and others contend is un-American, illegal, and, under the constitution of the State of Michigan, a treasonable organization. This society has gone to the length of ordering arms—

MR. HAUGES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of order. It is impossible on this side of the House to hear what the gentleman is saying.

THE SPEAKER. The House will please be in order. Members will please take their seats and cease conversation.

MR. WEADOCK. This society, which exists in several States, has become particularly offensive in the eighth district of Michigan. Some of its members have gone to the extent of ordering arms in large numbers from the manufacturers of firearms in this country, and it is alleged that a reign of terror exists there owing to the machinations of this organization. I do not deem it proper at this time to go into the allegations of the petition.

MR. LUCAS. What society is the gentleman referring to?

MR. WEADOCK. It is named in the petition.

MR. MOUSE. Tell us in name.

MR. WEADOCK. It is the American Protective Association.

MR. DINGLEY. Mr. Speaker, is that a privileged matter?

THE SPEAKER. The gentleman states that he rises to present a memorial relating to the title of a member to his seat, which is privileged.

MR. HOPKINS, of Illinois. Does that permit the gentleman to arraign any society?

MR. WEADOCK. I am not arraigning any society.

MR. MOUSE. We understand you are.

MR. HOPKINS, of Illinois. It seems to me to be arraigning a society when the gentleman says is is traitorous, and that it is procuring arms with a view of intimidating the public. All that does seem to me to be arraigning a society.

THE SPEAKER. The Chair understood the gentleman to be stating some of the specifications contained in the memorial.

After a hot discussion, the report of which occupies a column and a half of the Record, as to the admissibility of the matter offered by Mr. Weadock, the whole question was withdrawn to be brought up again hereafter. It is noticeable that Mr. Morse, of Massachusetts, and Mr. Dingley, of Maine, who have made themselves extremely prominent in all matters of governmental religiosity which have so far been before Congress, seemed to be touched to the quick immediately upon the mention of this matter. It is natural, and it probably will be found, that those congressmen, who have openly and publicly espoused the cause of the legal enforcement of religion, in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, will, if the question should actually come before Congress as to the institution of a congressional investigation into the methods and purposes of the American Protective Association, defend that association with all their skill; and block, as far as lies in their power, every attempt to lay bare its spirit and make publicly known all its doings. They will fight this with the same fervor and intensity which Roman Catholic members would show if a similar attempt were made to investigate the Ancient Order of Hibernians, sometimes known as the Hibernian Rifles, or any one of the many such Catholic organizations. Why this should be so, if both parties are not imbued with a similar spirit of religious antagonism, is not obvious. Religious partisanship in civil things is one of the most marked types of irreligion. Organized Protestant politics is precisely as wicked in the eyes of God, and of all intelligent Christian men, as organized Roman Catholic politics. The immediate danger to this country is not so much, as some are evidently beginning to see, from Roman Catholicism as from Romanized Protestantism; indeed, there are those who have all along known that it was not Rome, but the image to Rome, which would eventually control this Government and destroy the liberties of its people.

This office is in receipt of a considerable number of letters, from widely different sources, in defense of the American Protective Association. Some of those from whom these letters come are well known to myself who have written the articles, particularly referring to this association, entitled, "Dangerous Antagonisms," in the issue of Oct. 19; and, "Stirring up Religious Strife," in the issue of Oct. 26; and the article above, which was in the hands of the compositor before the receipt of the letters referred to.

Of course every one realizes that what I have said is in arraignment of the association impersonally,—some of the noblest characters, humanly speaking, that the world ever saw have been, through mistaken judgment, to which all humanity is subject, champions of error, or, what is just as bad, champions of righteous causes after erroneous methods; and it is quite certain that there are many such among the ranks of the American Protective Association, as also it is that there are in the number of those whom they antagonize. This is a contest of principles, not men; one is always sure then of a foe deserving of his steel. Good men often ignorantly range themselves on the side of bad principles; but bad principles are never found on the side of truth, right and goodness.

Several of those, whose letters I have before me, are gentlemen for whom I have the highest personal regard, and whose feelings I would on no account wound. In deference to their expression of feeling, as far as I am myself concerned, I am perfectly willing to withhold all further statement, or formation of opinion, in reference to the American Protective Association until such time as its fruits show its character unmistakably to all. If, when that time comes, it should prove that I have been in error, in what I have said, no one will be more glad, and no one will hasten more quickly to say so, than I.
