THE constitution of this State is to be revised by a constitutional convention chosen for that purpose at the late election. The League for the Protection of American Institutions proposes to bring before this convention the question of the appropriation of public funds for sectarian purposes. In a recent letter sent out by the league, it is stated that millions of dollars have been appropriated in this State for such purposes, and a tabular statement shows that between 1884 and 1893 over $12,000,000 have been appropriated in this way; $5,500,000 to Roman Catholic institutions, $365,000 to Protestant institutions, a little over $1,000,000 to Hebrew institutions, and $4,700,000 to "undenominational" institutions, which, it may be assumed, are generally under non-Roman Catholic control.

Commenting upon these facts, the Outlook calls upon Roman Catholics and Protestants to unite their forces in a demand on this convention that it shall engraft upon the new constitution the fundamental principle that all funds raised by taxation from the public shall be expended under the control of the public. This is, however, too much to expect of Roman Catholics. It is true that Cardinal Gibbons has declared that the Roman Catholic Church in the United States does not believe in governmental subsidies for Roman Catholic institutions. But as actions speak louder than even the words of a cardinal, nobody believes that he means it in other than a Pickwickian sense. The action of the constitutional convention on this point will be awaited with interest. The Catholics of New York can be relied on to give the lie sooner or later to the declaration of the cardinal. However, as they do not control the convention they may not have opportunity to do this until the new constitution shall be submitted to the people. Then the fine hand of Jesuit cunning will certainly be discerned "knifing" that instrument at the polls, in case it shall contain a provision excluding popish institutions from the State crib. That some professed Protestants will not do the same, because their institutions will also be deprived of their share of public pap, is by no means certain.
