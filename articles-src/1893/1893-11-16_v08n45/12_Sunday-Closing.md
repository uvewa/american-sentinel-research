ENOUGH energies have been expended in efforts to secure legal interference in keeping open the World's Fair on Sunday to convert, if rightly used, a great army of souls. What has been accomplished by these well-meant efforts may be in the right direction, and do good, but the failure in the distinct purpose in view, together with the present drift of sentiment, is a good, practical lesson for all Christians, viz.: that the powers of the State are not the best channel through which to educate the world and promote Christianity. "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's," draws a distinction we ought not to lose sight of. The Government is a machine, incapable of individual moral sentiment. It may reflect the tendencies of its people, as a whole, but cannot be made to fairly represent any religious sentiment based upon spiritual obligation. — The Congregation News.

That is truth well said. If any genuine good has been gained, aside from demonstrating the utter weakness of the law, it has come through the influence of "public sentiment," outside of law. When that public sentiment gets enough religion and conscience into it and back of it to cut loose from the civil law and trust the case to the law of God and the Bible, the beginning of victory will be in sight. When that time comes the false claims of Sunday will wither in the light of truth, and God's Sabbath will be restored. Until that point is reached Christianity and the Church will suffer repeated defeat and continued disaster. — Sabbath Recorder.

"DURING almost a hundred and fifty years Europe was afflicted by religious wars, religious massacres, and religious persecutions; not one of which would have arisen, if the great truth had been recognized, that the State has no concern with the opinions of men, and no right to interfere, even in the slightest degree with the form of worship which they may choose to adopt." — Buckle's History of Civilization in England, Vol. I.
