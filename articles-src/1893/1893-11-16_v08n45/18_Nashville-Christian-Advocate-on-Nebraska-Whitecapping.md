THE Nashville Christian Advocate, in commenting upon the Nebraska white-capping affair, in which a local Woman's Christian Temperance Union, attempted by means of switches and tar and feathers to show its disapprobation of certain young women, says:—

> This Nebraska episode, though happening in an out of the way place, is an admirable illustration of what will inevitably follow when the friends of good morals lose confidence in the supremacy of spiritual forces, and resort to physical instruments for overthrowing the evils that afflict society.

This is true, and applies no less to courts and policemen's clubs, than to whitecaps and their switches and tar and feathers.
