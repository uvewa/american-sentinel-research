[The following extract is from the letter of an Australian correspondent to the Service and Herald, Battle Creek, Mich. It is interesting to note the development of the agitation of the question of Church and State union which it shows, and the evidence it contains as to the origin of the revival of interest in this subject, and the part which American example and Christian Endeavor propaganda is playing in that far away South Pacific Continent.]

IN the various churches in Australia, the young people are coming to the front, or at least, taking the most active part in aggressive work and missionary enterprise. Throughout the colonies, Mr. Clark, from America, has organized the Christian Endeavor Societies, and from personal observation, I can say that the meetings of these societies, and the work they do, are full of attraction, and give evidence that the Spirit of God is at work. But with the work along real Christian lines, is also work along antichristian lines in the misguided zeal of those who would enforce religious decrees through the power of law. In this field, we meet with those who are strong advocates of the union of Church and State. There is now a revival of interest in this subject, and the more the Church loosens her hold upon the hearts of the people, the more will this interest deepen, and the louder will be the cry for the aid of the State to compel men to wear a form of godliness, though its power be lacking. It is evident from the Word of God, and the luke-warm condition of the religious world, that the question of union of Church and State has come to stay, and be answered on the one hand or the other.

The Argus and the Age (our leading dailies) see the danger that threatens this young State, and raise a cry of alarm. In commenting on the action of the Wesleyan conference in regard to the union of Church and State, and the intermeddling of clergymen with politics, one of the dailies says, "It is the old scheme, after which the ecclesiastical mind has never ceased to hanker, of making the world perfect by invoking the aid of the civil power." In a further paragraph, the Age warns the people not to listen to the clergy in this matter, or "they will surrender their right of choice altogether, and be driven to the polls like sheep at the crack of the clerical stock whip." These editors declared that politics is one thing, and religion another, and that the introduction of religion into politics at this juncture, when parties are divided by issues of practical interest to the working classes, is an experiment that may be disastrous to the party of progress, and is deserving, therefore, of no encouragement. To these arguments the clergy reply that it is "impossible to keep religion and politics apart," and they claim that the doctrine of the separation of politics and religion is "profoundly atheistical and immoral." It is not necessary to comment upon this answer, inasmuch as Jesus has said, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."

Influenced by the unrest of the people, who are like blind people groping for the path, seeking for something tangible to which to cling, Christian leaders feel the need of some power to check the disintegrating process.

Mr. Owen (in "Australian Sermons") exhorts the Australians to take heed from the distress in America in allowing men to exercise the right of choice, the right to worship God according to the dictates of their conscience, and says:

> May Australia be warned off from a similar course, ere it shall be as hard for her to correct the mischief as the Americans appear to find it.

In no country will American example be more closely followed than in Australia. It has, no doubt, been the influence of her freedom in civil and religious matters that has given to Australia the liberty to go and do likewise; but Australia is quick to note the change in America's attitude upon the question of Church and State, and will not be far behind the feet of her elder sister, who has come of age.

From the attitude of Australia to the question of the union of Church and State, it can be readily seen that missionary workers in these colonies, as in America and elsewhere, must be well posted in history, in the rights of governments, the rights of individuals, and in the Word of God.
