WE do hear some dragon's teeth brushed over the land that such a host of men of Babel, born to violence and slaughter, should spring up? Or, has the old myth another application in these last days, and are those the dragon teeth sown, and the creatures, into being?

Is it true that they who lead men captive shall be themselves led into captivity? And is it true that those who take the sword shall perish by the same swift and merciless weapon? If it be so, then, is not their Nemesis, which is now afoot, visiting on mortal vengeance the wrongs of the wronger?

Is it true that the little flock watching, waiting, listening for the voice of the Great Shepherd, is ready to follow when he speaks; and the wandering, at the sound of his word turn to him and are born again before life is, let us see it anew, that they who follow him, who do not listen for his voice, and who know it not even if spoken, that those who but pursue the voice of the dragon when they think it, and answering to the usurp go forth to do the will—these also by appointment likewise observe the earth and fulfil the places of him who will rid by all?

SOME men have fattened upon the heart's course of their fellows, and have raised no fainter so long than they feel it to be in better place by divine right to rule and feed. And to get a dark stream at last by a night of might which is sufficiently diving for them; like the haughty Englishmen who boasted that every drop of the blood had been a free example of their family resemblance, a mailed knight with armed fist fell upon the throne of his fellows. What is the history of nations? Blood-shed and battles! What is the history of either? Maraud and robbery! What is the history of man? Sin! Shall not vengeance overtake them? and from whence will it come?

To every tribe is a turning. Long screws in accumulating capital at the expense of the laboring classes results at last in strikes and hard bread lines. Years of the abuse of political privileges for selfish turns, and the conversion of public trusts to private benefit, destroy at last all political integrity, and makes of the polls only places where reputation, place, and power are bought and sold; and of executive chambers and legislative halls, with all the retinue of office and office-holders attached. State and national, from the smallest to the greatest, an army of robbers, bound by mutual, selfish interest, but a various ground, and a fortress, and a personal following, from which and by which, to offend and maintain the opportunities for individual profit and power which have been acquired. These are the natural uses of governmental production or results. Nothing can there be predicated of governmental action except that it will not subserve the best interests of the greatest number; and that it will not protect the weak or restrain the unjust encroachments of the strong. Both a condition and this is virtual anarchy, covered with the complicated forms and the more developed governmentalism.

Generations of headstrong, bitter and relentless slavery, results in the formation of a caste hedged in, restricted, shut up to itself merely, morbidly and physically, design produces people across the lines which destroy untowered circumscribes. The development that follows an era of morbid growth, diseased mental, or coarse, deferred, mischalled bodies, vicious morales one utter lack of all moral sense, and the result is vampirism and abnormal forms of lawlessness, criminal and sin. The conditions of mortality and humanity being callused or destroyed, nothing remains but the brutal instinct animal; raging to and delivering food for the passion and satisfaction for the unnatural desires. These again meeting, rouse answering passions of violated revenge in the bosoms of those who illegally assume, in inquisitions of law or channels of its offence, to punish. So, political, and social conditions combine to increase and develop each the unfortunate conditions of the other and produce such disaster as are their inevitable results.

FINANCIAL combinations, such as the world never before saw, add their force to the situation. Colossal fortunes in few hands; gigantic enterprises controlled by few men's; business corporations and trusts managed for the benefit of the few, which should contribute neither to the benefit of society at large; even the legal tender currency of the country subject to fluctuations in value and quantity, governed by speculative operations of itself or of the product of the earth, and the factory, and the furnace, and the business necessities of the people; the good faith of financial legislation doubtful and uncertain. The bewildered market or trade requires looks to be conserved, and prices fixed, not in keeping with the cost of production or quantity in stock, but at the highest price it is possible to compel the consumer to pay; an insatiable greed for wealth, not as can only be accounted for on the supposition, of the belief that the dollar really is almighty. How long will the social order politic sustain these conditions without diversity?

THE Church, which should only be the conservator of public morals and civic order, by maintaining private morals, has surrendered its proper function of witness to the individual in striving to control and govern men by the mass. There is an attempt to apply the mass principles and methods to the management of the church of Him and the furtherance of religion which are great social corporations or the concerns of municipalities, indeed, there is an attempt to consolidate political with civic and Churchic affairs. This amalgamation will fire until the ore gall of all alike, for it will debate the gold and produce a dangerous compound. It is needless to remark what will be the result of such a course in Church and State. Those combinations are not new, they have been tried over and over again, and the results have always been utter failure. The question as regards this factor in the problem of the, nineteenth century seems to be
