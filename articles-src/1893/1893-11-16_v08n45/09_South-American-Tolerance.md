This extract from the missionary news of the Methodist Episcopal Church South shows the nature of some of South American tolerance:—

I conversely, says Bishop John P. Newman, of Methodist Episcopal Church South America in a great field for missionary work. The State religion in all State sovereignty is that Argentina is the Roman Catholic, and although the constitutions are generally so accepted, they do not interfere with dissenters in their worship as regards religion and God's law. Christians preached and on the soil freely. In Peru it was allowed for me not to undertake anything contrary to the law. But I was allowed to continue my exercises and speak in English as much as I desired. In Chili the constitution provides, which is settled, that, provides that all public worship shall be in their own Churches. But the Anglican Church. How is that you are allow one to land missionary work? "Because of" it, I said jocundly, "we," who is the establishment at the expense of the State. But all Americans, after a time in the State, therefore they are not public. It is well to observe that it is the spirit of the construction of the constitution Protestant religion allowed. "Well," was it answered any information. "the constitution says that the Roman Catholic religion shall be established. It doesn't expressly forbid Protestant meetings. So we say that what isn't forbidden, is allowed."
