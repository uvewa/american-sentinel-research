On October 13, Mr. Bowers, of California, addressed the House upon this same question of Church exclusion, from the debate on which quotations were made in last week's issue, and to put a keen edge upon his criticism of the religious influence which had been brought to bear, referred to the persecution of seventh-day observers in Arkansas, reading from the speech of Senator Crockett in their defense,—continuing from this the *Record* contains the following:—

MR. STOCKDALE. They were punished for working on Sunday, were they not, and not for worshiping God?

MR. BOWERS, of California. Well, why should you punish them for that? What is the commandment? "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work," and "on the seventh thou shalt not do any work." We do not know when the world was created. No man knows. But I will tell you what I do know. You may not like the Jews; I like them; there are a lot of good fellows among them, good friends of mine. You may not like them, but there is one thing you will all admit, they are an intelligent people, and in eighteen hundred years they have kept their reckoning and they observe the Sabbath day that Christ observed, and you put American citizens in prison for doing it, for keeping faithfully one of the ten commandments. [Laughter.]

Now, when you talk about this being a Christian land, I will give you some more instances to digest. In the State of Tennessee some Seventh-day Baptists—and every one who knows anything about them knows that they are a good, honest people—were working in their own field, after observing the Sabbath day which Christ kept, and they were arrested because they were at work plowing in their own fields not disturbing anybody. They were put to jail, found guilty, and sent to prison. They were going to carry the case up, but the old man died in jail and so escaped further torment on earth for Christ's sake. The sons served out their time. What do you think of that?

Again, I want to say to the gentleman who has been pleading here for Christianity, for fairness, justice, and mercy for the heathen to-day, that I will give him facts, some from his own State.

I am informed—I can not bring the evidence, but if this statement is disputed I will try to prove it, or if I have been misinformed I will own up—I am informed that twelve people are now under indictment in that State for Sabbath-breaking and one of them is a woman who is under indictment for having been seen through a window sewing in her own room in her own house on Sunday.

MR. DALELL. What State is that?

MR. BOWERS, of California. The State of Maryland.

MR. RAYNER. There is no such case in Maryland.

MR. BOWERS, of California. Very well; that is just what I was getting at. We have heard from Maryland now and the question is, was I misinformed, or is the gentleman who lives there misinformed? I guarantee that I will either produce evidence of the correctness of my statement to the gentleman and to this House, or I will confess that I am in error.

MR. RAYNER. We had a case there some years ago.

MR. BOWERS, of California (interrupting). Have you not got laws that permit that sort of thing?

MR. RAYNER. I say we had a case there some years ago.

MR. BOWERS, of California. Oh! I will not yield to you to make a speech because then they will call time on me. [Laughter.] Have you not got laws in Maryland that will permit that?

MR. RAYNER. We have the best Sabbath laws in Maryland of any State in the Union.*

MR. BOWERS, of California. Mr. Speaker, I think that you and every right-minded man will pardon me, if not approve of my sentiments, when I say that I have the utmost contempt for that kind of piety which would produce such results, which depends upon the sheriff's club and the prison cell to propagate, sustain, and to enforce it. Such piety never emanated from a just God or from the Son of man. I think when you come to put your Christian charity at work you had better look at home. You look too far off. You had better call your missionaries home from China and send them to the bordering States to teach the religion of the meek and holy Jesus to your own people. [Laughter.] What have the Chinamen to gain by giving up their religion for a religion that produces such results as I have described? Anything? But I must hasten on. Cant, hypocrisy, cruelty, these three masquerads under the mantle of Christianity to-day, as those three did under the cloak of the Pharisee when the Son of man walked on the earth.

The discussion being still continued, October 14, Mr. Maguire, of California, said:—

Now, there has been some criticism and some complaint indulged concerning a remark made by my colleague, Mr. Geary, in relation to the petitions presented, by conferences and associations of ministers of religion throughout the country, to this body. I make the same objection to the attempts of these religious bodies to reinforce their perfectly proper personal petitions by appeals to the power and membership of their respective churches. I deny that any religious conference in this country, or any religious association in the United States, represents or is authorized to speak for the political sentiments or political opinions of those who constitute the membership of their churches. I deny that any annual conference of two hundred ministers has a right to control, or does control, or does represent, the political sentiments of the sixty-four thousand members of its faith.

The same proposition was presented, the same stereotyped resolutions that have been here filed were submitted to the annual conference of the Congregational Church in California the other day and their adoption was urged. They were finally adopted, but the proposition to declare that the conference represented the sentiments of the members of the church on this question was rejected. It was rejected because two or three ministers rose and strenuously protested that the conference had no right to speak on this question for the members of the church, and declared that three-fourths of the church members were opposed to the position which a majority of the conference was ready to assume.

MR. MOUSE. Has the gentleman from California the resolutions of the Congregational conference to which he referred? If so, I hope he will print them with his remarks.

The final religious reference in this discussion was from the lips of Henry W. Blair, formerly senator from Massachusetts, and author of the well known "Blair Bills," now in the House. The record of Mr. Blair's words is this:—

How much more time have I, Mr. Speaker?

THE SPEAKER. The gentleman has one minute remaining.

MR. BLAIR. I will use that to touch upon this question of religion which has been brought in here. The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Morse], who sits on my right, tells me that he has received a telegram from the Congregational clergy upon this subject, and other communications have been received from the Methodist clergy. Now, sir, this is no conflict between religious. They have had an exposition of religions out in Chicago recently, and I do not know what sort of religion the Chicago people will decide to let us have hereafter [laughter], but for one, I am in hopes that they will give us the good old Christian religion which has made us what we are.

But, Mr. Speaker, in the interest of the Christian religion, in the interest of the efforts of its missionaries at home and abroad, in the interest of our own country and of mankind, I do insist that this immigration of the lower orders of Chinese people, bringing with them destruction to our industrial system, destruction to the morality of our country, destruction to the physical condition of our people—I do insist that immigration shall cease, absolutely cease, in the interest of all these great elements and of whatsoever appertains to the progress of humanity.

Mr. Blair's reference to the Parliament of Religions rouses the query in one's mind: If those dusky-faced, keen-eyed courteous, kindly-tempered gentlemen of the Orient, Dharmapala, Mozoomdar, Virekanaanda, Hirai, Shibata, Kung Quang Yu, who at the Parliament of Religions so unflinchingly hold the mirror up to the State religion which this United States professes,—if they could have sat in the gallery of the House during the discussion of this exclusion bill, and listened, what would have been the mingled surprise, pity, amusement, contempt, sorrow, which they would have felt? And would they not have been justified in feeling so? What else could they have felt, unless it might have been a righteous indignation at the ignorant hypocrisy of this people that calls itself a "Christian Nation"?

"O, wad some power the giftie gie us,
To see oursels as ithers see us?"

*We are informed that Mr. Rayner has since stated privately that he was misquoted in the Record; that he said moral, not leaf.—ELVIN SANTAKE.
