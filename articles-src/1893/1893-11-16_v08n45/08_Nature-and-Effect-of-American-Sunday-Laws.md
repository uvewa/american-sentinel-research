The origin, growth and persistence of the conception which finds its embodiment in what are known as "Sunday laws," would, if analyzed by a competent—and, therefore, of course, an impartial—student, form a most curious and interesting chapter in the History of Ideas—a work, by the way, which, notwithstanding the labors of Lecky, Buckle and others, yet remains to be written.

Only the ignorant or the intellectually dishonest contend for what is called the "holiday theory" of these laws—the idea of a "holiday" enforced by a fine being palpably absurd, and the combined prohibition of play and work essential to the completeness of every Sunday law sufficiently refuting the suggestion that such laws are passed with any reference whatever to a "holiday," or concern for the benefits thereof.

Sunday laws, then, are recognized by all who know, and are avowed by all who combine knowledge with intellectual honesty to be simply and solely embodiments of a religious dogma in the statute law. Some courts have undertaken to sustain them as exercises of the "police power," the limits whereof, it is said, are "hard to define." The proposition admits that this power is limited; and, unless this be conceded, we are stranded on the rock of paternalism, and there is no distinction between the American and the Russian polity. It is submitted that the police power of a free government has a limit, rather than "limits," and that there is no difficulty whatever about the definition of this limit, though it may be a task of some delicacy, in a given instance, to determine whether it has or has not been exceeded.

A free government is a government of law. All law deals with relations. Human law deals with the relation of individual citizens to each other, and to the great corporation, or ideal entity, the State. Hence, a government ceases to be free and becomes paternal and despotic when it undertakes to regulate or interfere with individual conduct without reference to these relations. This, then, is the limit of the police power in a free State—it can restrain or constrain the citizen with reference, and with reference only, to the effect of his conduct on other people or on the State. It cannot control him in any manner or to any extent whatever with the slightest reference to the effect of his conduct upon his own personal welfare. Unless we concede this limit of the police power, we can have no limit whatever.

Now, Sunday laws stand absolutely alone in our jurisprudence, in that they transcend this limit of the police power of a free government. They are the only attempts that have ever been made by American legislatures to regulate the conduct of citizens without any reference whatever to the effect of that conduct on other people or on the State. Sunday work and Sunday play are punishable by fine or imprisonment, though it cannot be pretended that they affect the State in any wise, and though no individual can be found to testify that he was disturbed or deprived of any civil right thereby. It follows that Sunday laws are passed to enforce on the individual the performance of a duty entirely dissociated from his relations to the State or to other individuals. That duty concerns his relations with Deity. It is a religious duty. All religious duties are matters of dogma. A Sunday law, therefore, is not an exercise of the police power, but a religious dogma embodied in a statute.

That dogma is that it is a Christian duty to abstain from play and work on Sunday. Its origin is curious enough. There is plenty of evidence that the Founder of Christianity and the Apostles "observed" the "Sabbath day" or Saturday, and knew Sunday only as "the first day of the week." But there was a deep-rolled idea among the early Christians that the Master would soon return to earth, and that he would return on the morning of Sunday at the hour of the resurrection. This gave rise to the practice of assembling at that hour, in order to be "prepared to meet him." The believers being assembled, prayer and praise naturally followed. Thus, gradually, a certain sanctity came to attach to Sunday in the Christian mind. In Constantine's time there were a large number of "sun-worshipers"—among the subjects of the empire. With these, also, Sunday was a sacred day. That astute and conscienceless ruler sought to conciliate the followers of Christ(?) and Mithra, the sun-god, at the same time, by promulgating the first "Sunday law" ever known. It required "rest" of the "judges and people of the cities," only, and expressly excepted agricultural laborers from its provisions. While it flattered the Christian bishops, by establishing to some extent for Sunday the regulation prescribed for Saturday by the fourth commandment, it professed to honor the day from the standpoint of Mithracism only—describing it as "the venerable day of the sun." Other edicts of emperors and popes, referring to Sunday "observance," were issued from time to time. But, in a general way, it may be said that the day was on a level in dignity with "saints" days and other festival occasions everywhere, and in many places it was less regulated than some other commemorative occasions.

This state of things continued till the seventeenth century, when puritanism came to the front in Scotland and England. "To their immortal honor," says one of their eulogists, the English Puritans devised that extraordinary "institution," "Our American Sunday." All of our Sunday laws are derived from and modelled after the Puritan Sunday laws of England. From the Puritans of England and no other source comes the inspiration which prompts the enactment and enforcement of such laws.
