A SPECIAL dispatch from Victoria, B. C., of Oct. 7, says:—

> A remarkable thing in connection with the Rathdrown homicide trial to-day is the fact that when it was sought to introduce the dying statement of the dead man, Jones, an objection was made, and sustained by the court, on the ground that it had been taken on Sunday, and it was therefore thrown out.

This is an excellent example of how legal Sunday observance may defeat the ends of justice.
