This Nation has been a favored one. God was manifestly in its founding; his powerful hand marvelously restrained those elements of persecution and injustice which threatened the Republic when the persecuted of other shores, who had found refuge here, themselves turned to be persecutors. True religious liberty, after severe contests with the demon of intolerance, was for the most part established. Had the same earnest and devoted energy exercised by our forefathers been perseveringly continued by the succeeding generation the Republic would now be far in advance of her present attainments.

During all these years and amid all the changing scenes of the Nation, so long as the principles of true liberty—which are the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ—were not repudiated, God could and has blessed and prospered the Republic. But that time is now past. The SENTINEL has been telling faithfully of this evil work, stating clearly how it would be done, before it was done, and since it has come to pass, its voice continues to proclaim when and how the wickedness was committed. There is done, although the men who did it knew not what they were doing (simply because they would not believe the truth when brought to them), yet it matters not now whether they knew it or not; for the results are the same. They might have known, therefore they are blameworthy and stand condemned, although they themselves may be supreme judges and law makers of the Nation.

Judas knew not what he was doing when he betrayed the Saviour, yet he was told all about it beforehand, as plainly as words could express it, by his loving Redeemer. It seems now very strange that in face of all that Jesus told him he should go and do precisely the very thing Jesus told him not to do. Jesus had said that it would have been better for the man who should do that wicked act had he never been born. The trouble with Judas was, he thought he knew something to be true, different from what Jesus was talking about. He thought that Jesus would work a miracle and deliver himself, even though he should betray him into the hands of the chief priests, whom he knew were thirsting for Jesus' blood. He wanted that money, and felt confident that Jesus would take care of himself and come out unharmed. But when it was too late, he learned with bitterness that Jesus knew what he was talking about, and that he meant just what he said. He found himself in the cunningly laid snare of the devil from which he could not extricate himself;—yes, and all for thirty pieces of silver. How he now loathed that money!

Another point with Judas: by his disregarding the faithful warning of Jesus he went headlong into something of which he himself could not see the outcome. After he had fallen into the snare Jesus himself could not rescue him. He had passed the bounds of His mercy and must be left to the destruction he had presumptuously chosen. It is a fearful situation to pass the boundary of God's forbearance and mercy. Judas had all the privileges of the other disciples. He had listened to the gracious words that fell from the lips of Jesus, but during this time when mercy and forgiveness lingered for him, his soul was so filled with self and covetousness that all the precious teaching of salvation availed him nothing.

It is also said of Judas that when he had received the sop (and Jesus plainly told them all beforehand that the man who consented to receive it would betray him) Satan entered into him. It is not at all likely that Judas realized this fact, but a fact it was. He was then under the full control of the power of evil; yes, and at the same time working for,—having hired himself to,—a fallen church power. Judas hired himself to the church, but was led by Satan. This is significant of that power which controls fallen churches. All this was written for our learning.

We, who constitute this Republic, have had great light from heaven. For this light and favor God holds us accountable. Mercy has lingered for us, as a Nation, but when, in the face of solemn warnings, based upon God's word, sound reason and the history of other nations, we repudiate, governmentally, the principles of true religious freedom, we, at that moment, pass our probation, and ruin and desolation will, from that time, await us. That step has now been taken. Countenance has been given to religious laws, which mean persecution; and that act sanctions all religious persecution from the foundation of the world. Like Judas, those who have done this have stepped presumptuously upon ground from which heaven cannot save them, neither can they extricate themselves.

The counsel of God's Spirit has been spurned (and it is only by the warning counsel and power of the Holy Spirit God can work upon human hearts). That Spirit was present in the Senate chamber, warning and entreating the representative men of the Nation not to meddle with religious dogmas when those measures were being clamored for by the chief priests of to-day. They themselves know that the burning words uttered by men in their presence, warning against these things, were sent home to them by some mighty power with unwonted force and clearness. That power was the Holy Spirit, then warning them before they followed in the steps of the Supreme Court and sold religious liberty for a few pieces of the fleeting favor of man. Yet, in face of all these solemn warnings they presumptuously did the very thing they were warned of God not to do. Congress thus says it knows more than God, and do as it may, all will come out gloriously, notwithstanding God says in his Word that such a course means ruin. The sop has been deliberately received, and as it was with Judas so it will be with those who, having received the sop, go immediately out to do what they do quickly, Satan having entered into them. Supposing themselves to be serving God—for they have hired themselves out to the fallen churches—they are under the wrong leader, in the form of an "angel of light." As that fallen religious system cared nothing for Judas and his sorrow after he had served its purpose, in like manner all the professed love of these apostate systems now amounts to nothing; for they will desert and be powerless to save those who have served them,—but then comes the end. Then the cup is full, and God arises with justice.

In view of the blazing light upon the true Sabbath (seventh day) and other warnings which have been spurned and set aside to exalt into the place of God the false institution of Sunday and kindred errors, God's anger burns against the guilty. Just as surely as He sits upon a throne in power and justice, He will arise and lay bare the foundation of this wickedness. His word has gone forth, and it will be fulfilled. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of God without a shelter. Christ is our only refuge and shelter. Those who exalt these rival claims set at naught the lowly Man of Nazareth, who is soon to come again, and although, as the deluded Jews thought that God was with them in Jerusalem at its destruction, men now presume to believe Jesus is in the exaltation of Sunday; yet, when too late, they will discover, as did the Jews, that their house is left unto them desolate,—and utter ruin follows.

It is not too late for individuals to flee for refuge and mercy to Christ. But, like Lot, it now means haste with no looking back. Delay not, but hasten to plant your feet on the solid Rock of eternal truth, and live.
