The following extract is from the letter of an Australian correspondent, and relates to the development of the agitation of the question of Church and State in the Australian colonies. This letter was written from the standpoint of interest in this subject, and the part which is here reproduced shows what part America is playing in that far away South Pacific field:—

In the various churches in Australia, the young people are coming to the front, as in all, taking the most active part in aggressive work and of missionary effort. An American Evangelist, recently from America, Mr. Clark, from America, has organized the young people of the Christian Church. From personal observation, I can say that the personnel of these men and women, and the work they do, are full of attention, and give evidence that the Spirit of God is at work. But with the work along real Christian lines, is also work along anti-Christian lines in the misguided zeal of those who would enforce religious observances by law. There are those who are fully in sympathy with those who are strong advocates of the Church and State—the union—and there is now a revival of interest in this subject, a movement in this direction which has taken hold upon the hearts of the people, the some with that interest that the final result will be to the cry for the aid of the State to compel for it was a form of religion, though in the power he looking for it must look from the Word of God, and the token earn conditions of the religious world, that the question of union of Church and State—will presently have to be answered on the one hand or the other. In no better way than the interest. Her colonies are the danger that threatens the young State, and rules are very of same. In commenting on the action of the Witnesses for truth, in the report to the laws of Church and State, and the intermingling of religion, and the politics, one of the dailies says: "It is the old offense, after which the ecclesiastical polled but has never settled in the religious liberty of the people, by invoking the aid of the civil power"—in this they do not err. It also warns the people not to listen to the clergy in this matter, or "they will surrender their rights of choice altogether, and be brought to the same fate alike as those of the clerical stock whip." These others declared that there is one thing, and religious another, and that the introduction of religious religion into politics at this juncture would be a great mistake, and be of practical interest to the working-classes, but the result of mixing religion politics to the party of progress, and is deserving, to say the least, of condemnation. The arguments of the clergy reply that it is "impossible to keep religion and politics apart," and they claim that the doctrine of the separation of politics and religion is "profoundly atheistical and immoral." It is not necessary to comment upon this answer, naasmuch as the reader has here the very words used. Take therefore an illustration therefrom of these things which are, to be sure, "such a mind," and not of God's.

The influence in the outward of the people, who are like blind people groping for the path, seeking for something tangible to hold to, cling. Christians leaders feel the need of more power to check the limitless grasping process.

In "Australia," as in America, wherever the Australians to take food from the willing to obey. Christians are equally sincere the right of choice, the right to worship according to the dictates of their consciences, and says:—

In an institution, a matter of religious concern, no it shall be as hard for her to commit the Sabbath as the Sunday. The effort is most creditable.

In no country will American example be more closely copied than in America and Australia. It is a friendly nation. It has, no doubt, been the influence of her freedom, and her religious matters that has given to Australia the liberty to go and to observe, but America is quite to note the change in American attitude upon the question of Church and State that has come about, especially by the influence of her older sister, who has come of age. But whatever may come, the political question of the union of Church and State with her workers in those colonies, in American and Australian, must be well taught in history, in the rights of government, the rights of individuals, and in the truth.

FANNIE BOLTON.
