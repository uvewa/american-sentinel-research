In the case of Sadie Means, who was expelled from the Second Presbyterian Church at Columbia, S. C., for working in the telephone exchange on Sunday, the South Carolina Synod at Clinton, on the 4th inst., ordered that the action of the Charleston Presbytery in the case be annulled and that the session of church in Columbia, "restore Sadie M. Means to all her rights and privileges as a member in full communion by said church." Notice of appeal to the General Assembly was given.
