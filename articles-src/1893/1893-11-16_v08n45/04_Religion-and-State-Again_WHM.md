"Religion and State Again" is the title of an editorial, "Dangerous Antagonisms," in the issue of Oct. 19, and, "Stirring up Evil," since Oct. 26, "in the issue of Oct. 19, and the article above, which is the last in a series of the consideration before the receipt of the letters referred to.

What we have said is arrangement of the associated material, or the subject matter, is not characteristic. Humanly speaking, that the world ever saw, have been, through inane taken judgment, to which all humanity is subject, champions of error, or, what is just as bad, champions of right—whose cause after strenuous methods of it in quite uncertain that there as many such amongst the rank of the American Protective Association, as is it that there are in the number of those whom they antagonize, and whom this association opposes; and one is always surer than of a foe decently and principally, but bravely under certain rarify range themselves on the side of moral principles; but they are quite as often found on the side of truth, right and justice.

Several of those, whom letters I have before me, are gentlemen for whom I have the highest personal regard, and whom feeling I would on a second thought. In so far as I am myself concerned, I am neither a member of this or any other association or establishment, of any character or description; and I have encouraged the American Protective Association until such time as its truth bear the character unmistakable to all.

If, when that time comes, it should prove that, I have been in error, in what I have said, no one will be more glad, and a readier to accept and to make amends, than I.
