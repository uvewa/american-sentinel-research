AT Centerville, Md., Nov. 9, the case against Charles Ford was dismissed at the request of the complainants, they paying the costs. Judge Robinson refused to continue the other cases pending the decision of the Judefind case by the Court of Appeals, unless the defendants would agree to abide by that decision when rendered. The cases were accordingly set for trial.
