# Uncertainties — v08n45 (1893-11-16)

## Page 1, Masthead area
- **Issue:** OCR reads "AMERICAN SEMINEL" (likely "SENTINEL" with OCR error on second word)
- **Transcribed as:** "American Sentinel" (corrected in masthead)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — obvious OCR error; title appears correctly elsewhere in the issue

## Page 1, Masthead
- **Issue:** OCR reads "ASSOCIATE EDITORS. CALVIN P. BOLLHAR." — surname appears garbled
- **Transcribed as:** "ASSOCIATE EDITORS. CALVIN P. BOLLMAN." (corrected)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — CPB is Calvin P. Bollman, a well-known associate editor; OCR misread final letters

## Article 01 — Untitled lead editorial by WHM
- **Issue:** Article has no title in the original; it begins mid-sentence with "WHO has sown dragon's teeth..." spanning pages 1-2
- **Decision:** Assigned working title "Signs of the Times" based on content; this is an editorial interpretation
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the article is clearly by W. H. M. (WHM) based on initials at end; title assignment is editorial

## Page 3, Article 03 — "Representative Religious Petitions Again in Congress"
- **Issue:** Footnote at bottom of page reads "We are informed that Mr. Rayner has since stated privately that he was misquoted in the Record; that he said moral, not leaf.—ELVIN SANTAKE."
- **Second pass:** "ELVIN SANTAKE" is almost certainly an OCR garbling of an editor's name or the word "EDITORS" — the footnote is included as-is in the transcription
- **Confidence:** LOW — "ELVIN SANTAKE" is an unresolvable OCR corruption; preserved verbatim

## Page 3, Article 03
- **Issue:** OCR reads "MR. MOUSE." multiple times in the congressional debate transcript
- **Second pass:** "MR. MOUSE." appears to be OCR garbling of a congressman's name (possibly "MR. MORSE."); however, since "Mr. Morse of Massachusetts" is mentioned separately later in the same article by WHM's commentary, and "MR. MOUSE" appears in the debate itself, this may be a different congressman
- **Transcribed as:** "MR. MOUSE." — preserved verbatim as it appears in the OCR
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error for another surname; cannot determine correct name from context

## Page 3 bottom / Article 03
- **Issue:** OCR reads "MR. DALELL." — likely a congressman's name
- **Transcribed as:** "MR. DALELL." — preserved verbatim
- **Confidence:** LOW — may be OCR error for "MR. DALZELL" or similar

## Page 3 bottom / Article 03
- **Issue:** OCR reads "MR. HAUGES." in Article 04 congressional debate
- **Transcribed as:** "MR. HAUGES." — preserved verbatim
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error for another congressman's surname

## Page 5, Article 06 — "Can God Love and Protect This Republic?"
- **Issue:** Author signed "T. E. BOWES." at end; known author in our list is TEB = T. E. Bowen
- **Transcribed as:** author "T. E. Bowes" — verbatim from the OCR
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — could be OCR error for "T. E. BOWE**N**" (TEB known); or could be a different person; preserved as found

## Page 7 — Advertisements
- Entire page 7 is advertisements (Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods, Waterman's Fountain Pen, Books for Little Ones, Prison Light, Story of Jesus, Christian Life Series, Safety Pencil Pocket, Favorite Bible Stories). All skipped as non-article content.
- Several advertisement blocks appear to be OCR artifacts with testimonials, image references [BBOX], and garbled text. Not transcribed.

## Page 8, Item 13
- **Issue:** OCR reads "A BARBEIS' Sunday-closing ordinance" — likely "BARBERS'" with OCR error
- **Transcribed as:** "A BARBEIS' Sunday-closing ordinance" — preserved verbatim in article body
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — almost certainly "BARBERS'" but preserved as-is per accuracy rules

## Page 8, Editorial notes
- The page 8 section appears to be an "Editorial Notes" or similar section with multiple short unsigned items. Each has been given its own file per project guidelines.
- The brief note about "AT ONE PRINTING THE AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it..." at the top of page 8 is boilerplate subscription/circulation information and has been skipped.

## Page 8, Item 22
- **Issue:** OCR reads "43 Boat Street, New York" — address is "43 Bond Street" throughout the issue
- **Transcribed as:** "43 Boat Street" — preserved verbatim
- **Confidence:** HIGH that this is OCR error for "Bond Street"; preserved as-is per accuracy rules
