THE MOON makes no comment, and it hates no one that made the item. Such events make it very apparent that regard for Sunday as a sacred day is not all in the thoughtful of this Sunday church members who know that it is no better than any other day; what they want is a man's enjoyment of the day for their own purposes. If the World's Fair was tiring their offerings they would to a man be clamoring for Sunday opening.

We pray for the Republican majority. Open it in the morning . . . . and not . . . ing about a single profanely hot day, they would be demonstrating against all who opposed the torment of an unmerciful, formally warm "orthodox" eternity.

Eld. Franck, Peeble, Col., published the institute "program" delivered by Elder Ivan Peck, of the Colorado Senate, at the opening of that body, January 7, . . .

We pray for the Republican majority. Open it in the morning . . . Great studies make those . . . and it is all but in matter. It makes no contribution to the motherland.

And then to other peoples the pay to an others . . .

Our contemporary's concluding statement, which we adopt, is "We give them the motto, to fully Christian . . . . none just is the disgust we feel."
