## The Sphere of Civil Government.

The *Nashville Christian Advocate*, the general organ of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, published an article recently in which the position was taken that "with it [the religious Sabbath] the State can have nothing to do." This statement has given offense to some of the Advocate's readers, and one of them takes the editor to task, as follows:—

In the *Advocate* of the 15th inst. is an editorial, "The Sabbath, Religious and Civil," against which I enter a solemn protest. . . . I am in my eighty-third year, and have been for a long time an humble member of the Methodist Church. I trust you will lose no time in correcting the impression that your editorial has made upon me and others. The general tone of the whole editorial is exceptionable, the gist of it being summed up in the following sentence: "So much for the purely religious Sabbath, with which the State has and can have nothing to do." There is not a Christian government on earth but does, and ought to, recognize the Sabbath as a holy day established as such by God himself. With the different religions the government has nothing to do. It does not claim some to be true and others false, but it does hold that the Sabbath is not only a day of rest, but a holy day. It does not consider civil contracts entered into on that day as binding and legal. Whether you intended it or not, the article in question conveys the impression that you look upon the matter of closing the Columbian Exposition solely from a civil point of view. I consider your argument a surrender of the whole religious question.

Several paragraphs of the *Advocate*'s reply are so good that we give them:—

"The question between us is, then, not whether the Sabbath should be religiously observed, but whether such observance should be enforced by the civil government. Without the slightest hesitation we say no, and this for various reasons:

"1. Civil government has a distinct sphere, that of protecting all its citizens in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Whenever it attempts more than this it gets beyond its appointed bounds.

"2. If civil government is under obligation to support one institution of religion, as such, then is it not equally under obligation to support every other on the same ground? Granted the premises, and there is no escape from this conclusion; and yet there is no man, we suppose, who would be bold enough to insist that the conclusion is sound.

"3. Governmental support for the institutions of religion implies governmental control. The whole history of the past proves this assertion. If the Church insists on being propped up by 'the powers that be,' it must submit to be governed by them.

"4. Nor do the foregoing considerations present the strongest view of the case. We go still farther and declare that it is *impossible* for the State to enforce the religious observance of the Sabbath. Religion is essentially a thing of motives, whereas the State has to do only with outward actions. Can the State make men pray? Can the State make men worship God? Only religious men can keep the Sabbath in a religious way; and vast numbers of our citizens are not religious, and do not pretend to be.

"All these errors grow out of the mistaken notion that the State is bound to labor directly for securing every possible good thing. But the fact is that there are many good things that the State is helpless to secure and ought not to attempt. God has provided other agencies for gaining them. We fear that many believers in Christ have lost the robust faith and courage that in earlier days made their brethren 'mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds,' and are inclined to go down to a secular Egypt for the help that can come only from the living God."
