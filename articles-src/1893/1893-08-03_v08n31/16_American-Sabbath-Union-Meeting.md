THE American Sabbath Union held its annual meeting, Tuesday, July 19, in this city. Rev. Dr. George S. Mott, acting president of the American Sabbath Union, presided. Addresses were made by Dr. Mott, Rev. J. H. Knowles, Anthony Comstock, and others. After saying that the glory of Sunday closing of the Fair belonged to the Lord, Secretary Knowles proceeded to give it to the American Sabbath Union. He is calling for contributions. Mr. Knowles said:

. . . bath Interests during the World's Fair. The American Sabbath Union . . . the organization as the funds are provided for the purpose, and de-

sire to avail itself of the present interest in the subject to vigorously push the work of organization in every State and territory.

In the evening session, Anthony Comstock said: "The question before us to-night is, 'Who is upon the Lord's side?' And is what is determining this question. Mr. Comstock and his co-workers want the power of the civil law to so that they can force men to be on the Lord's side. Don't they know that the Lord has more in interest to help them than they need to have? What is it on any other day of the week? is that himself has declared that 'the seventh day is the Sabbath'?"
