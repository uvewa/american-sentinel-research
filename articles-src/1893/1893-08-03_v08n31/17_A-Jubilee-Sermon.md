The Moon, a newspaper printed in Battle Creek, Mich., has in its issue of July 19, this item of news:—

The Second Baptist Church of Battle Creek will hold a jubilee meeting on the fair grounds in Marshall next Sunday, for the benefit of the new church. The meetings will begin at 10 o'clock A. M. The best musical talent will be present. There will be plantation melodies and songs and instrumental music. The sermon on "A Damned Hot Day" will be preached at 2:30 o'clock P. M. Admission ten cents.

The Moon makes no comment, and it seems that none is needed. Such things make it very apparent that regard for Sunday as a sacred day is not in all the thoughts of the Sunday church managers; they know that it is no better than any other day; what they want is a monopoly of the day for their own purposes. If the World's Fair was filling their coffers, they would to a man be clamoring for Sunday opening, and instead of preaching about a single profanely hot day, they would be denouncing against all who opposed them the terrors of an uncomfortably warm "orthodox" eternity.
