The spirit of religious persecution is not dead, but the light of these years withers it when public opinion is focused upon it. If the religious people who clamor for stricter legislation against Sabbath-keepers had their way the Middle Ages would hasten back to smother the world. As it is, such efforts serve to hasten the final downfall of all such unchristian and bigoted persecutions.—*Sabbath Recorder.*
