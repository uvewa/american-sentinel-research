every person in the United States is shut up to one of two things; either to assert, or to decidedly protest against, the right of Congress to decide by legislation, the Sabbath question or any other. To assert this right is to recognize the authority of Congress and thus to put Congress in the place of God. To reject it, and protest against it, is to subject ourselves to the charges of "anarchy," "irreverence," "attacking Christianity;" but at the same time to establish the fundamental principles of the Government of the United States, the fundamental principles of the Reformation in its purity, the divine principles of Christianity itself, as announced by the Lord Jesus Christ, the right of every man and freedom before God. The historian of the Constitution is right when he says that the inhabitant of a tribunal charged with the interpretation of the Bible, had borrowed only is slavishly subjecting man to man in what should be most unfettered and conscience and faith.—*Patterson, book 1, p. 17.* Well, this fearful thing that lie before, was the emancipation of mankind. This is the only course for us to take to be true. Will you now worship this beast and his image? The people of the United States is now shut up to this decision. Which will it be?

No further comment is needed to show that this is a religious movement wholly, and for religious purposes, and that Protestantism, so called, have united with Catholicism or rather gone over to them in asking the State to enforce both, the observance of a day which is wholly a Catholic institution. The result is in doubt whatever in every small. Whatever we are drifting? and to what we are coming?

THE theory which underlies civil government and religion and make the latter one of the ends to be pursued by the former, if good at all, is equally good for all purposes—for "the powers that be" in Turkey, and India, and China, as well as for those of the United States or England. Apply the theory to the Church, the State power employed in pursuit of its purposes, and enforce Buddhism and Mohammedanism. If it be right to employ the same power thus employed in behalf of Christianity, it is equally right to employ it in behalf of Paganism, when it happens that the world is fruitful in religious systems, and, while no nation has claimed that all these systems are equally true and entitled to equal consideration, if the principle be applied, would lead to the most opposite results, and setting one nation upon another between the true and the false. If Turkey is right, the world is wrong; if China is right, besides the truth, it would, especially practically, the greatest of monstrosities to put the civil sword to back religion. A change of circumstances often gives causes the same hand that is drawn to be really taken.

Let us then expose a Protestant to transfer his residence to China and to become a citizen of that great Asiatic country. While at home, he charged the Government with the maintenance of religion, claiming that religion shall be included in the relationship, replaced by the maxims of Confucius or of Buddha, what will he say? Will he still adhere to use King James' version of the Bible as the authoritative standard for religious purposes. How does he meet the situation? If the same principle is applied to him in China that Christian Americans have so strenuously and so persistently urged upon Congress, and Congress appears to him, not of supporting a state religion, but of opposing a state religion of China, which he regards as a false religion, and from which the gates are open to have to be noticed to come to his tax, and tax the people to support and . . . this he has heretofore encouraged all governments to do.

Religion is valuable to all, is just as valid for paganism as it is for Christianity. That is, it must be managed regardless of religious distinctions. And of course, for the most superstitious forms of Roman Catholicism precisely as for the most liberal Protestantism. No Protestant would have any right, and no argument, to tell why he should not ask for it here. The principle which it involves is not to be in no better in the United States or England than in Russia, Turkey, China, or India. If we are not willing to submit to what religion it is applied, or whatever the religion, whether Catholic or Protestant, form the majority of the people in the place of its application, we have no right to insist on its application in our own favor no matter how large our majority.

The conclusion from this line of thought in this civil government, though the best possible machinery to secure certain ends connected with civil temporal interests, is not adequate as an instrument to secure the ends that relate to our spiritual welfare. Social science and all human experience shows that a certain medicine, when mold produces a certain effect, does not establish that effect once in a thousand times, but produces in the vast majority of cases an effect directly contrary; we cannot help being in saying it is not a medicine of which the principal end is to be no matter.

"1. Every civil government has a distinct sphere, that of protecting all its citizens in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Whatever is attempts more than this, is not government, it is tyranny.

"2. Civil governments is under obligation to support no one institution of religion more than another; to demand any religious institution to support every other on the same ground. If any religion is to be supported, and there is no escape from this conclusion; and say there is in man, was an empire; who would he hold enough to insist that the State should endow it?

"3. Governmental support for the institutions of religion implies government control all the same. The whole history of the past proves that statement. If the Church insists on being propped up by 'the powers that be,' the powers should be given control. If the Church should be given—

"4. Nor do the foregoing considerations apply to the Christian religion only; for, if you go still further and declares that it is the duty of Government to legislate for religious observance of the Sabbath. Religion is essentially a thing of opinion, whereas the State has to do only with outward acts. Can the State make a man think rightly? Can the State make man worship? Does any argument need to be used, the Sabbath 'a religious way;' and yet 'a multitude of our citizens are not Christian, it then follows that we are requiring a . . . ?

"All these errors grow out of the mistaken idea that the State can be a better laborer for liberty of securing every possible good thing. But the fact is in that there are many good things that the State is entirely incompetent of which it cannot attempt. God has provided other agencies for putting them. One fact is that religious believers in Christ have lost the robust faith and courage that in earlier days led them to the most heroic efforts. Lacking the buoyancy and the 'aggressiveness and leading of sitting down straightway,' and asking the civil government to pass laws for the thing that can come only from the working of the Spirit."
