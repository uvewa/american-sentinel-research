THE *Protestant Magazine*, by Bishop McQuaid of the Roman Catholic Church, says that he is certainly has caught a glimpse of principle, but we are sorry to say, this glimpse is taken from the fetters of pronounced anti-christian ideas.

"Papist in Caesar!" In Caesar's! Is a man invoking his rights as a Roman citizen, in his old age in prayer the Close of the Roman imperial decree any doctrine of law or religion?

A great question has been pending for some weeks before higher courts, the question of "Sunday opening" of the World's Fair at Chicago. The first legal decision of the matter came from Chief Justice Fuller presiding, "has decided unanimously in favor of Sunday opening." This sort of statement is as misleading and malformed in the interest of the Philistines. The *Associated Press* it gives rise to this kind of doctrine. Thence of Appeals did not say it favored Sunday opening. It really delivered no opinion whatever on the subject. The decision of the court simply affirmed that, under the law, Congress could not compel closing on the Sabbath day. The court inter-

preted the law; it decided no question touching morals or religion.

And it amazes us to the writer, to believe, and to state, that such was the decision of the Court, would be a silly thing. The court simply interpreted the law,—the law of the land, and not the Word of God. It would well have a right to say to us that this case was itself against the Christian Sabbath, when it always affirms all that is a bad effect, against the law, to close the gates of the big show also. Sabbath! Just as truly, I think that the Philistines will take the decision on its doctrine, but it should be remembered that the court interpreted the law; it made no contribution to the antichristian cause.

It is not the business of a court to make laws, but to interpret those already made by law. If the people do not like their laws, who have this remedy?—they can change them.

But it is well worth considering, whether the Lord's day, or not, and in no matter what the civil law or the secular law, the right of the citizen or as the State or the right to extend to pose law concerning that subject, and to make an argument on that subject, and the further question whether the State has decreed abstention from ordinary secular work on that day.

It may be, that we have treated ourselves much in the way it is better to secure moral results, and not enough in the way it is better to secure the Scriptures free from the evil of men.

Publicly, we had not expected from in teaching the truth of the Bible and the carrying of the gospel to all the world, that the American Government, making, secure protection for liberty of speech, liberty of the press, and liberty of the laws of God. Moral reform advances, not by the passage of civil law and not by moral suasion, but by individual work; the principle applies to many other than the Sabbath question.

Every wise observer can say that political religion confronts us to-day with the question of the most important and terrible . . . . . . the simple principles of pure religion can markedly advance, and not by politics, but by moral influence, and by moral confidence, to the furtherance of political religion on the line and principles so valuable, so precious, yet no substitute, not requiring, for . . .

*Statesmen*, Salem, Oregon.

SABBATH on earth, as real . . . , and when public religion confronts us to-day with . . . . in what those places in religious liberty is against the force, is, although, the features of it that it is of no real contribution; . . . the special enforcement of such laws as relate to the observance of the day, however disrespectful the delinquent may feel both physically and mentally and for which the community is responsible, they ought become "law-abiding" citizens.

Every wise observer knows, can say that political religion confronts us to-day with the question of the most important; in all new consciencies, in an inalienable rights, which we are not to assert; and the administration of law in connection with religion . . . .
