The World's Fair Closed on Sunday.

On Sunday, July 23, the World's Fair was closed. This time by the order of the directors; the proper authorities in charge of the Exposition and responsible for its business interests. As business men representing a business corporation, they have the right, in the interests of their corporation and its stockholders, and according to their best judgment, to close the Fair and refuse to do business on any day of the week that they see fit. The courts have upheld them in their refusal to obey the arbitrary Sunday closing provision of Congress, though on a technical plea of the bad faith of Congress and not upon the proper principle which underlies the matter,—that Congress had no right to pass the proviso, and that such legislation on its part was unconstitutional. But nevertheless the directory was absolved, legally, from following the terms of its agreement with Congress as to Sunday closing.

Now, of its own choice, it has seen fit to close the gates on Sunday. This it had the right to do as far as any principle of civil liberty in religious things is concerned. Neither Congress nor legislators nor courts have any right, nor ever have had any right, to say to any individual or any corporation or the directors of any corporation, that they shall do this or that, or not do this or that, simply and solely because of the religious idea contained in Sunday, Christmas, saint's days, or other holy days of the Church.

The condition of things, by which the directors were brought to the conclusion that it was public and to their interest to close on Sunday, is one worthy of consideration in view of the progress which is to come in the enforcement upon the people of religious forms. The churches and religious organizations throughout the country which have set themselves to the furtherance of the enforcement of Sunday observance and moral compulsion by law, under the advice of their leaders, disclaimed any general boycott, but nevertheless privately and quietly this boycott has been organized and pushed with energy. It is not apparent, and may never be, that by it they succeeded in reducing the general attendance upon the Fair during week days, but it is quite certain that the influence brought to bear reduced quite materially, the Sunday attendance; and not only of those who had respect for Sunday and belonged to the church-going community who might nevertheless feel themselves perfectly justifiable in attendance upon the Fair during a portion of the day, Sunday, but the general crowd which never go to church at all, but spend their Sundays in one form or another of amusement, recreation, or jollification, have evidently felt that it was particularly and peculiarly disreputable to attend the World's Fair on Sunday and so have, instead, gone with their beer kegs to the various parks and picnic places and spent their Sundays in reality in a far less reasonable and reputable way.

But still further than this, a quiet and unseen but very active influence has been brought to bear upon the exhibitors and those having charge of the different State buildings. The Keystone Drill Company of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, having among its officers and directors a number of prominent National Reformers and members of the American Sabbath Union, took the lead in an aggressive action to secure a general covering of the individual exhibits on Sunday, and also threatened a suit on the behalf of the exhibitors themselves for the purpose of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. They claimed that they looked upon the matter from a business standpoint, and this business standpoint from which they looked upon the matter they were in a large measure responsible for themselves: they therefore knew well what they were talking about. They had assisted and made it the business of their lives for years to create as great a prejudice against the Fair as possible if it opened on Sunday, and to secure a boycott against it under such circumstances.

The Fair then being opened on Sunday, they claimed very naturally, that the very people they wanted to come to the Fair and whom they desired as customers, were staying at home because of the Sunday opening. They themselves covered their exhibits on Sunday and made a systematically organized effort to secure as many as possible who would follow their example, and boasted that three-fifths of the Exposition was covered from view, and made this as evident as possible by the publication of the names of the exhibitors who closed or covered their exhibits, filling, in one instance, more than a page of one of the large city papers. Of course, the general publication of the fact that so many exhibits were not to be seen, and that the machinery was not running, and the greater number of State buildings with closed doors made the Fair seem to the ordinary sight-seer a very poor investment for his time and money on Sunday. The closing of the State buildings was also due, in some measure, to the organized effort of these same persons.

So it will be seen, that although the directors have done that which they had a perfect right to do, and which it was perfectly proper that they should do, if they saw fit, they have been, in reality, coerced into it by the unseen and quiet efforts of those who had sought, previously, to accomplish the same thing by law, and having failed, have accomplished it by influence and boycott.
