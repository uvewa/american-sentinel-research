## Gone Over to Rome.

A Rev. Mr. Adams, of this city, a former Episcopal minister, has become a convert to the Church of Rome, and some of his friends profess to discover in his action evidence of an unsound mind. It may be so; but if by this Mr. Adams shows incipient insanity, what shall be said of the all but universal leaning of Protestants towards Rome and Romanism, evidences of which are discernible to-day on every hand?

Rome is all that she claims to be or, she is worse than nothing, as a church, and is indeed the apostate power so graphically described in Daniel and the Revelation, and for centuries regarded by Protestants as antichrist. Rome claims to be the Church. This unchristianizes all the "sects." If Rome is the Church, Protestants are no part of the Church. If Rome is not the Church her claim is blasphemous and she is antichrist.

But within the last quarter of a century a great change has taken place in the sentiment of the Protestant world. Rome is, with the masses of Protestants, no longer antichrist, but one division of the Church of Christ, and this notwithstanding the fact that she has abated nothing of her claims. Thus by admitting that Rome is Christian they unwittingly unchristianize themselves. Then, instead of it being regarded as an evidence of insanity for one to become reconciled to "the Church," should it not rather be considered the highest wisdom?—We mean from the standpoint of the milk-and-water Protestant who has already given his case away by acknowledging that Rome is Christian.

Moreover, every man recognizes the truth that the Church of Christ must have an infallible standard, an ultimate source of appeal, an end of all controversy. Protestants formerly had this in the sacred Scriptures. Catholics have it in "the Church" herself and in the Pope the head of "the Church." Now Protestants almost universally repudiate the Scriptures as the all-sufficient and infallible guide, and must walk either in sparks of their own kindling or else turn to Rome, as Mr. Adams has done.

Mr. Adams has only followed to its logical conclusion the road that the great mass of Protestants have been traveling for years. It is the wrong road, but it is no more wrong in its termination than at its beginning. And they who are in it are Protestants only in name, whether they have the courage to travel it all the way or not. There can be no compromise between Christ and antichrist.
