**Rhode Island Sunday Agitation.**

The cry for a union of religion with the civil government is becoming very widespread; being heard even in Rhode Island the State which of all the States should be the last one to seek such a union, having for its founder Roger Williams, who fled from the persecutions of the Massachusetts theocracy in the midst of winter to Providence, there to set up a government in which religious freedom might be enjoyed by all, and Church and State government might be kept forever separate. But lo! and behold, the following by the President of Brown University, a Baptist by profession, in a speech at Peace Dale, R. I., last March, reported in the Narragansett *Times*, from which we copy:—

From time immemorial we have been taught by men who meant to teach us right, a certain artificial separation between what is known as religious and what is known as secular. . . . Now I take it, that that doctrine, carried to the extreme at any rate, is prejudicial to society. It is untrue from a strictly religious point of view, and it is most deleterious from a civil and social point of view. . . . In the seventeenth century Roger Williams came to this country with these false notions, relatively false notions as compared with those they supplanted, but still false notions.

Thus President Andrews teaches that a total separation of "what is known as religious and what is known as secular, is *prejudicial* to society, and is untrue and wrong from a religious and social point of view." What better papal doctrine could be taught than this? Would the Pope ask anything different? Moreover he says that Roger Williams' idea of this entire separation of Church and State or "what is known as religious and what is known as secular," was wrong. That his "notions were false notions relatively false." Then here is a man coming to the front as an educationalist, a politician, and a religious teacher in this State who declares that the principle of religious liberty for which Roger Williams suffered and which he established at the risk of his own life, and for the benefit of his posterity ever after, as well as for himself, was wrong. Thus the principle laid down in the Bill of Rights of the State of Rhode Island, which reads as follows, is wrong also:—

WHEREAS, Almighty God has created the mind free, and all attempts to influence it by temporal punishment, or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness; and, WHEREAS, A principal object of our venerated ancestors, in their migration to this country and their settlement of this State, was, as they expressed it, to hold forth a lively experiment that a flourishing civil State might stand and be best maintained with full liberty in religious concernments; . . . and that every man shall be free to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience and to profess, and by argument to maintain, his opinion in matters of religion; and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect his civil capacity.

And President Andrews would have a man's religious faith affect his civil capacity, because he says the teaching of Roger Williams and others was wrong on this point. Thus we see that his views of the relation between civil government and religion when carried to their legitimate conclusions would carry him right over to the Papacy. This is all in accordance with National Reform ideas. Make the State dependent upon religion and religion upon the State.

And now along comes a petition from Protestant and Catholic clergymen asking the State to render assistance in the enforcement of a town ordinance, on religious grounds:—

The East Providence Town Council met on the afternoon of July 5, and took action on the petition from clergymen and others in relation to Sunday amusements at the shore resorts. Almost all the clergymen of the town, including Rev. Father Harry, of the Church of the Sacred Heart, were present and spoke in support of the petition against Sunday desecration. The following is the petition as presented to Mayor Potter:—

WHEREAS, During last summer at some of the shore resorts along the Providence River and elsewhere in the State, base ball games, theatrical exhibitions, Wild West shows and other performances were openly given on Sundays for pay and for profit, in open violation of the laws of Rhode Island; and

WHEREAS, Intoxicating liquor was sold in abundance upon many of the excursion steamers and at many of these shore resorts last summer, contrary to the laws of Rhode Island; and

WHEREAS, These violations of the State laws drew together on Sunday such disorderly crowds of people as to endanger the life, health and morale of our citizens, and these shore resorts thereby became schools of iniquity for the training of youths into ways of dissipation and vice; and

WHEREAS, Such unlawful conduct and proceedings are creating for this State an unenviable reputation far and wide; and

WHEREAS, Such conduct and proceedings are distasteful and offensive to the great mass of moral and law abiding people of this State, and are not only contrary to law and tend to a contempt and violation of all law, but are subversive of all those sacred traditions and principles upon which this Nation was founded, and to which she owes much of her marvellous prosperity under the guidance of Almighty God; and

WHEREAS, It is not our intention to ask for the special enforcement of such laws as would lead to the distinctively religious observance of the day, however desirable such enforcement might be.

Therefore we, the undersigned, ministers of the various churches, and citizens of the State of Rhode Island, desiring to prevent the desecration of the Lord's day, and to hand it down inviolate to our posterity, do hereby humbly petition the Mayor and Aldermen of Providence, and the Town Councils of East Providence, Barrington, Cranston and Warwick, and the sheriffs of Providence and Kent Counties, that they will use special and extraordinary measures to prevent a repetition of the above specified illegal and vicious practices during the coming season, and the same your humble petitioners will ever pray.

That this petition is wholly in the interests of religious legislation is apparent on the face of it, although the framers of it say, "It is not our intention to ask for the special enforcement of such laws as would lead to the distinctively religious observance of the day, however desirable such enforcement might be." If this petition aimed at the well being of all the people both physically and mentally and for the safety of the State, that its inhabitants might become "law-abiding" citizens, the "schools of iniquity" be stopped, and the "health and morals" of the people be promoted, why did they not ask that the drinking saloons, Wild West shows and other things that promote these great evils be closed on other days as well as on Sundays? Is it not just as bad to get drunk on Monday and disregard the State law as on Sunday? and would not the selling of liquor which makes people disorderly, be just as bad on Wednesday as on Sunday? and if "base ball games, theatrical exhibitions, Wild West shows and other performances" are "schools of iniquity for the training of youths into the ways of dissipation and vice" on Sunday, are they not equally as bad on other days? But oh no! the same paper which publishes the petition states that some of these ministers attend Wild West shows on other days of the week, and find no evil in them.

How does it happen that these things become so evil on Sunday, except it is a religious institution which they wish to have observed, and see no way of having it done except by appealing to the State for its observance? That this is their object they plainly state: "Therefore we, the undersigned, ministers of the various churches, and citizens of the State of Rhode Island, desiring to prevent the desecration of the Lord's day, and to hand it down inviolate to our posterity, do hereby humbly petition the mayor and aldermen of Providence . . . that they will use special and extraordinary measures to prevent the repetition of the above specified illegal and vicious practices during the coming season." No further comment is needed to show that this is a religious movement wholly, and for religious purposes, and that Protestants, so called, have united with Catholics or rather gone over to them in asking the State to legislate upon the observance of a day which is wholly a Catholic institution. The question should arise in every mind: Whither are we drifting? and to what are we coming?
