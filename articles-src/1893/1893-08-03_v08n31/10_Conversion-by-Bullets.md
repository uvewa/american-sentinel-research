**Conversion by Bullets.**

The justification of Mr. Fleming, the British magistrate at Rangoon, who ordered soldiers to fire into a body of Mohammedans, who had only assembled to sacrifice a cow in honor of one of their religious festivals, does not appear from the dispatches. It is no doubt British policy to keep down the people of India as a precaution for the safety of the comparatively small English garrisons, but Mr. Fleming will have a hard time convincing any one that he did right in forbidding the sacrifice of the cow. He saved the cow's life, but many human beings were sacrificed.
