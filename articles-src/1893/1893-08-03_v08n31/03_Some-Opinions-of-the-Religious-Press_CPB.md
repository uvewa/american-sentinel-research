## Some Opinions of the Religious Press.

The *Christian Advocate* of this city, calls the closing of the Fair on Sunday "Compulsory Right Doing," and says:—

The course of the directory has been such from the beginning that one cannot be sure that it is not now trying to hoodwink Christian people. Whatever it may hereafter do, it has broken the contract and is morally bound to pay that money back to the Government. Its past conduct affords no guarantee that it would not close for two months, to draw Christians and thereby swell its receipts, and then, feeling safe, open on the remaining Sundays.

The *New York Observer* calls it the "Failure of Sunday Opening," and says:—

Sunday opening of the World's Fair has proved a failure, and hereafter the gates will be closed on the first day of the week. The vote of the local directory, taken on Friday last, rescinding its former action, was overwhelmingly in favor of closing, standing twenty-four to four. It was a vote, however, forced by the commercial failure of Sunday opening, and in no wise a voluntary concession to the religious and law-abiding sentiment of the Nation. The directory is wholly mercenary, and in closing the Exposition on the Sabbath has regard only to the pecuniary profits of the enterprise, as it had in opening it on that day. Had open gates on the Lord's day proved remunerative, they would have remained open throughout the term of the Fair, and the laws of God, of Congress and of the directory itself have been defied and trampled on just as they have been for the past two months. They are closed solely under the compulsion of financial loss. Neither fear of God nor regards for man have influenced action in the least. The only factor to which attention has been paid was the steady diminution of receipts from Sunday admissions to a point below the actual operating expenses for the day, and the patent impossibility of making any arrangement by which attendance could be made remunerative.

The directory has been defeated and put to shame and unable to compel exhibitors to keep open their exhibits and to bear the financial loss resulting from its dishonest act, has offered the public the only reparation possible for its violation of solemn obligations and its desecration of the Sabbath day. But it has yielded only in order to make money.

The *Examiner* (Baptist) treats it as "An Instructive Failure," and thus assigns the reason of the final decision to close the gates on Sunday:—

It was confidently predicted that the opening of the gates on Sunday would result in doubling or trebling the attendance. As a matter of fact, the Sunday attendance began at a little over seventy-one thousand and had fallen to less than forty-four thousand on the last Sunday the gates were open. The plea for a Sunday opening was made in behalf of the poor workingman, but the poor workingman proved not to be so great a fool as the average Chicago newspaper takes him to be. When he goes to the Exposition he wants to see the whole show, not half the show. But the managers are powerless to give him a whole show on Sunday. A considerable part of the buildings were closed on Sunday, and in the buildings that were open a considerable part of the exhibits were covered. The poor workingman sensibly staid away from this half show, and manages to go when he can see everything.

The *Christian Statesman*, entirely unmindful of the fact that the Lord cares no more for Sunday than for any other of "the six working days" (Ezek. 46:1), hails the closing as "A Triumph of Righteousness," and exclaims:—

Hallelujah! The Lord God omnipotent reigneth!

By an overwhelming majority of the Board of Directors of the Columbian Fair it has been decided to close the gates hereafter on the Lord's day.

Our readers will agree with us that this is a triumph for righteousness such as the world has seldom witnessed. All the more significant because of the reason compelling this decision. These reasons do not appear in the resolutions adopted by the directory in their final decision. No, these officials were true to their character for evasion and insincerity to the last.

They recite in the resolution adopted in deciding to close, that the gates had been opened in response to the petitions of a large majority of the "public" and are now closed because of the disproportion between the numbers that are compelled to work seven days in the week if the Fair is kept open and the numbers attending on the Sabbath. This is simply a coward's excuse. The reasons for opening the gates were two-fold, viz., the greed of the managers for gain and a malicious intent toward the Christian religion. But no matter now—these enemies of righteousness have been put to shame before the eyes of the whole world. A more conspicuous subversion of evil designs and triumph of righteousness it is not possible to conceive. Let God have all the glory. These men made a pit and digged it deep and proposed to bury the American Sabbath out of sight, and, lo! they are fallen into it themselves. Experience is a dear school but fools will learn in no other.

While not strictly a press opinion, the following from a sermon by Joseph Cook, in Chicago, July 23, is to the point:—

Greed and the sordid avariciousness of men opened the gates of Jackson Park; the unholy and idolatrous worship of that most abject, degenerate and pitiful god, Mammon. Greed has also been the instrument by which the directors have closed the gates of the white city to-day.

And yet this closing is heralded to the world as a "great moral" victory, even as was the action of Congress in making Sunday-closing a condition of the gift of the souvenir coins; and this notwithstanding the fact that neither result is due to any higher motive than the hope of gain. Congress yielded to the demands of the churches in the first place under threat of political boycott, and the implied promise of votes if the action were taken. And now, the directors finding that there was no money in a Sunday Fair, have closed the gates for the purpose of securing the support and patronage of the Sunday people who would otherwise boycott the Fair. If this is a moral victory, then is bribery virtue and greed is godliness!
