THE justification of Mr. Fleming, the British magistrate at Rasgore, who was a third soldiers to fire into a body of Hindoo men; and who led the body of soldiers to sacrifice a cow in honor of one of their religious ceremonies, finds a response from the dispatches. It is no doubt British policy to show down the people of India as a pre-text for missionary work. This is the way a small English gentleman, Mr. Fleming has for turning down . . . . Some say that he did right in forbidding the sacrificial eating of animals (as they put it) but many human beings were sacrificed.
