**Law and Religion.**

[The following paragraphs are from an article in the *Tennessee Methodist*, by Bishop Haygood, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. It is true that the Bishop does not yet see every man clearly, but he certainly has caught a glimpse of principles which, if fully recognized, would free him completely from the fetters of governmental religion.]

PAUL "appealed to Caesar" in a case involving his rights as a Roman citizen; he did not appeal to Caesar to settle by an imperial decree any doctrine of law or morals.

A great question has been pending for some weeks before high courts, on the question of "Sunday opening" of the World's Fair in Chicago. The first decision was, as it seemed, favorable to Sabbath observance. The telegrams of the week tell us that the Court of Appeals, Chief Justice Fuller presiding, "has decided unanimously in favor of Sunday opening." This sort of statement is misleading and framed in the interest of the Philistines. The Associated Press is given to this kind of deciltry. The court of Appeals did not say it favored Sunday opening; it really delivered no opinion whatever upon the Sabbath question. The court simply affirmed that, under the law, it had no authority to close the gates on the Sabbath day. The court interpreted the law; it decided no question concerning religion or morals.

As it seems to this writer, to denounce Chief Justice Fuller, or the United States Court, would be a silly thing. The court is under oath to interpret the law of the land, and not the Word of God. It would be very unfair to say that the court sets itself against the Christian Sabbath, when it simply affirmed that it had no authority, under the law, to close the gates of the big show upon the Sabbath day. It is true that the Philistines will take comfort from this decision, but it should be remembered that the court interpreted the law; it makes no contribution to the anti-Sabbath argument.

It is not the business of a court to make law; its function is the interpretation of law. If the people do not like their laws, they have this remedy: they can change them.

But it is well worth considering, whether the Christian doctrine concerning the Lord's day, can be set up and maintained by the civil law or the secular courts. I offer no opinion as to the right of government to pass laws concerning the Sabbath, and make no argument on that subject. In most of the States of the Union, Caesar has decreed abstention from ordinary labor on the Sabbath day.

It may be, that we have trusted overmuch in the law of the land to secure moral results, and not enough in the power of the truth of God that alone makes free the soul of man.

Possibly, if we had expended as much force in teaching the truth of the Bible on the Sabbath question as we have exerted in seeking decrees from the civil courts, we might have had by this time more Sabbath observance. In the long run, nothing secures conformity to the laws of God, except teaching the people the laws of God. Moral reforms always move upon the lines of moral teaching. The principle applies to many other than the Sabbath question.

Every wise statesman can see that political religion confronts us to-day with the same threatening dangers that slavery formerly did. To prevent such a result in time, is the better and wiser way. Not a single principle of pure religion can ever be enforced by law. No orthodox preacher ever made a speech, whether called a "prayer," a discourse or an oration, without filling it with the namby-pamby and sentimental platitudes of his "faith." These inflictions have been borne so long and so patiently, that they have become a divine right, against which it is almost blasphemy, to kick, or to utter different views. It is enough to say to any patriot, that any political question which involves such serious and threatening results as the enforcement of political religion by law, as now confronts us, requires no apology for its timely warnings.—S. C. Adams, in *Statesman*, Salem, Oregon.
