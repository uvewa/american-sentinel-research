**No Shaving on Sunday.**

It is not a little remarkable that within the last few months there has been a wonderful awakening on the part of professed Christian people all over the world to the fact that Sunday observance as practiced in former years is falling into disrepute. It seems that they can begin to read, as it were, the "handwriting on the wall" of the sanctity of Sunday, if things continue to go as they are going. They do not, as a rule, appeal to the foundation of the Sabbath—the fourth commandment—as a basis for requiring its observance, for, as they too well know, according to that, Sunday is not the Sabbath. There is not a scintilla of evidence between the lids of the Bible showing that it is a sacred day or that it has any claims upon mankind to be observed as the Sabbath. Knowing this, they appeal to the civil law for its enforced observance, and to hide the real motive behind the movement, the plea is set up that the Sunday laws are asked in deference to "the poor working-men." And now we see some of the labor organizations coming forward and demanding law requiring Sunday rest upon the part of all. And why? It is not because the individuals composing them can not rest on Sunday if they wish, for they can. But it is that those who want to keep Sunday may not lose anything by the patronage received by someone else who does not care to observe the day, and would otherwise labor on that day. Supreme selfishness is at the bottom of the whole thing.

The barbers all over the country are agitating this matter, and are meeting with more or less success. Two years ago a vigorous effort was made by the boss barbers in Kansas City to close the shops on Sunday, but they failed because no jury in a justice court would declare that shaving and the work of a barber is not a necessity on Sunday as well as any other day.

But the Sunday-closers have not wearied, and in a case that has been before the courts for some time, and finally taken to the Court of Appeals in that State, they secured a favorable decision from Judge Dill, he holding that under the revised statutes of Missouri, that "a party may shave himself as he would take a bath or wash his face, and it would not be understood as labor; but when the barber opens up his shop and there follows his usual worldly employment, it is quite a different matter."

On this rendering, the barbers have declared the operation of barber shops on Sunday a violation of law, and have therefore issued an order to the effect that henceforth no barber shop belonging to the Barber's Union shall be open on Sunday, and that any shop outside the union over which they do not have direct control, will be prosecuted, to which work the prosecuting attorney of the city has pledged his best efforts. Thus it is demonstrated again that Sunday laws are secured at the instance of certain ones that they may domineer over others. And so the work moves on. The lines seem to be drawing closer and closer, and out of it all can come but one result, religious intolerance and persecution.
