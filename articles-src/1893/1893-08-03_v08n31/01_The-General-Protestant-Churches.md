THE general Protestant churches of the United States, knowing and confessing that there is no command of God for Sunday observance, and not being willing plainly to acknowledge the authority of the Catholic Church, which is the original authority that has commanded it, and feeling desirous of having a national institution in the United States on a day honored by God, were placed in an embarrassing dilemma. They were plainly in great danger of being obliged to go back to Rome.

They found by experience that the people of the United States were not inclined to accept, as the will of God, the bare statements of church authorities upon a thing on which little babes take their food. Besides this, they found a small body of Christian people scattered all over the United States, who, they knew, have cared and were care, enwrapped active with vigorous in telling the people everywhere, not that Sunday is not the Sabbath, but that the seventh day *is*; not only that there is no command of God to keep the first day of the week, but pointing plainly to the plain command of God—"the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God"—for the observance of the seventh day of the week. These things only increased the dilemma.

What should be done? What could be done? Well, we know there was no command of God to keep the first day of the week; and as it was not according to Protestant profession to practice religious observance for which there is no "Thus saith the Lord;" and above all, as it would not do for them to cite the authority of the Catholic Church as of obligation upon the people; to escape their predicament they did this: They took the commandment of God, which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and interpreted it to mean "the first day is the Sabbath," that thus they might have (!) a command of God for Sunday observance. Thus they hoped to find authority by which they could require Sunday observance by the people and so be saved from going back to Rome.

But lo! they found that this did not deliver them from their dilemma. Besides their forgetting that to presume to interpret the Word of God, is, in itself, to set up the claim of infallibility which leads straight back to Rome anyhow, they found that when they had the example of interpreting the commandment of God to suit themselves, the people were not slow to follow the example; is interpreting the commandment to suit themselves. This their effort to escape proved doubly futile: first, in that their example in interpreting the commandment was followed to their detriment; and secondly, in that they had no more power to secure the recognition of their interpretation, than they had before to secure the observance of Sunday after forcing it into the commandment of God where it does not belong; and their effort to secure the observance of the Sabbath of God as it is, in the commandment of God, where it does belong, being of Rome, where it does belong. Their effort to escape the dilemma, only increased the difficulty.

What next? Oh, they would have the national Government take up the question and indorse their side of it as correct, and this would give the power of the Government under their control with which to enforce upon the people their interpretation of the commandment of God, and so would effect their purpose to make Sunday observance a national institution toward God. And they have succeeded in this, for they got the Government to adopt their interpretation of this commandment. We have given the literal string resolution with which they forced Congress by which they required Congress to do their bidding. We need not cite that again. But it is proper to print again the result, for the very important fact which it discloses.

THE official record is as follows:—

MR. QUAY—On page 123, line 51, after the word "Columbian," I move to insert:

"And that provision has been made by the proper authority for the closing of the Exposition on the Sabbath day."

The reason for the amendment I will send to the desk to be read. The secretary will have the kindness to read from the Book of Law the law which the Senator from Arkansas cited, the part enclosed in brackets.

It was read, as follows:—

"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."—*Congressional Record, July 10, 1892, pp. 6, 1, 12.*

The discussion of this identical amendment was opened by Senator Manderson, of Nebraska, in the following effort:—

The language of the amendment is that the Exposition shall be "closed on the Sabbath day." I submit that if the senator from Pennsylvania desires to offer an amendment in regard to Sunday, this language will not necessarily meet the case. . . .

The word "Sabbath-day" simply means rest it is a Hebrew word meaning that and nothing more, and it would be subject to the discretion of those who read whatever the Exposition Congress should close the Exposition on the last day of the week, in conformity with the construction which a very large number of the inhabitants of this land . . . is, should close it on the first day of the week.

Then the senator from Pennsylvania offered a new amendment in which this amendment should be so modified as to include Sunday. I shall have no power to rise to that Exposition; that it should be closed on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

Therefore I offer an amendment to the amendment, which I hope may be accepted by the senator from Pennsylvania, to insert "and that the Government exhibits at the Exposition be closed on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." . . .

Then the amendment to Senator Quay's amendment, as far as it inserted "the first day of the week commonly called Sunday," in place of "the Sabbath day," was adopted, and all further proceeding was continued upon no other basis than that "the first day of the week commonly called Sunday" *is* the Sabbath, and that as such it was closed.

From this official record, it is as plain as anything can be, that the Congress of the United States (for the House did not differ from the Senate on this point), by direct issue by a vote of one hundred and twenty-two to thirty-five decided that the seventh day is not the Sabbath day, after deciding that Sunday is. In its official capacity, did adopt the interpretation which the churches made, and did officially and by legislative action put that interpretation upon the commandment of God. Congress did define what the word "Sabbath," means; it said that "I say" not one day or another, "Saturday" or "Sunday;" and it decide which day of the week is the first, and which day of the week commonly called "Sunday," and how the Bible as was ever made on earth.

AND, like all former human interpretations of the Scriptures, it is erring. As witness this Word: "When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun."—Mark 16: 1, 2. "That the plain Word of God says that 'the Sabbath was past' before the first day of the week came early" of it came. But lo! Congress of the United States officially decides that the Sabbath is the first day of the week. Now, when the Word of God plainly says that the Sabbath is past before the first day of the week comes, and the Congress says the first day of the week *is* the Sabbath, which is right? . . .

NOR is the Word of God indefinite as to what this distinction refers. Here is the Word as to that: "This day (the day of the preparation) the Sabbath drew on, and the Sabbath drew on. As themselves, which also followed, and beheld the sepulchre, and the body was laid. And they followed, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment. Now, upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them."—Luke 23: 54-56; 24: 1. Here is is plainly stated that the Sabbath day according to the commandment, and the first day of the week, are two distinct and separate days entirely. And yet Congress gravely defines "the Sabbath day—" which side on the other? The Word of God plainly says that the Sabbath day, according to the commandment, is past before the first day of the week comes at all; and yet Congress declares that the first day of the week is itself the Sabbath! Which is right?

Now Congress is not it is impossible for it to make interpretation of Scripture a basis of congressional procedure and interpret is order that this meaning shall reach the people of the United States and further, we see the people of the United States capable of finding out for themselves what the meaning of the Word of God is! or is not, so, that it is necessary that Congress should be put between the people and God so as to furnish to them the true and divine meaning of His Word?

WHETHER these questions be answered one way or the other, it is certain that this is precisely the attitude which has been assumed by the Congress of the United States; and that either Congress, or a citizen, or whatever now may say, as to the right or the wrong of this course of Congress, in no denying the fact that Congress has it upon itself to interpret the Scriptures for the people of the United States. This is a fact, it has been done.

Now here is the difference between this attitude and that of the other Pope. The Roman Pope assumes the prerogative of Himself to interpret the Scriptures for the whole world. Congress has assumed the prerogative of interpreting the Scriptures for the people of the United States. Where is the difference in these two assumptions? And if the Roman Pope, wherever the claim of the Roman Pope embraces the whole world, the claim of this congressional Pope embraces only the United States. And yet there is hardly room for this distinction; because this congressional Congress was so broad-spirited to include, and to be of force upon, all the nations that took part in the World's Fair, and that embraces nearly all the nations of the world. So that, even upon this basis, it is proper to state, that is only another illustration which from the Sabbath of the commandment has its remarkable degree in the respectiveness of rival Popes. There are two for upon in infallibility anyhow. That the Fair is clearly of the United States officially and by Congress and Sunday out of respect to this interpretation, does not alter the fact that Congress has interpreted the commandment of God. Besides this, the Congress of the United States by closing the Fair on Sunday distinctly established and settled of the question as the question as to which day of the week is the Sabbath.

And to escape this claim and its direct connection with Rome, or rather the Pope, not of Congress, was precisely the purpose for which the command of God was done to forbade the Government to have anything to do with establishing a national religious observance. At the very first step *for religious freedom from the Declaration of Independence,* which was the first step toward the result first in the national Constitution forbidding interference with religion, Mr. Madison made the clear statement: "It is impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects that profess the Christian faith without erecting a tribunal charged with the interpretation of the Bible, and he turned back only is slavishly subjecting man to man in what he should be most unfettered and conscience and faith."—*Patterson, book 1, p. 17.* Well, this fearful thing that Mr. Madison foresaw and Mr. Jefferson, before, was the emancipation of mankind. This is the only course in it no to take to be taken. Will you now worship this beast and his image? THE AMERICAN SENTINEL of the United States is now shut up to this decision. Which will it be?
