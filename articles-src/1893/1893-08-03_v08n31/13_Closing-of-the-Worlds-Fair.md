THE closing of the World's Fair is at last an accomplished fact; but from a moral standpoint it is a barren victory to the churches that worked so hard for it. It is true that they now try to make it appear that the failure of Sunday opening is an evidence of the great regard that the masses have for Sunday; but it is nothing of the kind. By threats of political boycott and by the indirect course of not by war but real politicians, the Sunday management the changing of and in large of part of the Fair that care; and they go on Sunday; and this by their own act they made impossible a fair expression of the sentiments of the people regarding the day. Had the Fair been opened on Sunday just as on other days, and had it as a . . . . had it as a . . pages to hear on exhibitors to induce them to either open on their exhibits on, and this the people had refused to attend in paying numbers, it would indeed have been evidence of general popular regard; especially, but under the conditions created for the occasion it prove nothing, except that people do not propose to pay full price for less than half a show.
