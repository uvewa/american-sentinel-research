A REV. MR. ADAMS, of this city, a former Episcopal minister, has become a convert to the Church of Rome, and some of his friends profess to discover in his action evidence of an unsound mind. It may be so; but if by this Mr. Adams has simply taught himself, what shall be said of the all but universal leaning of Protestantism in the same direction, the evidences of which are discernible to-day on every hand?

But seriously, what has the man done that is worse than nothing, as a church, can logically uphold? Protestantism essentially described in Daniel and the Revelation, and for Protestants to turn to be Protestant as antichrist. Rome claims to be the only true "church;" she claims to be the "saints." If Rome is no Church, Protestants are to say it of no Church. If Rome is not the Church her claim is that of the masses.

But within the last quarter of a century a great change has taken place. In the sentiment and declarations of Protestantism with the masses of Protestants, no longer antichrist, but one division of the Church of Christ, and this notwithstanding the fact that Rome in every respect maintains her claims. Thus by admitting that Rome is Christian they are putting qualifications on themselves. Then, instead of it being one of the reasons for a man's sanity to be questioned, it rather, it should be considered a sign of his soundness of mind from the standpoint of the milk-and-water Protestantism of to-day. Protestants of to-day have paved away by acknowledging that Rome is Christian.

Moreover, every man recognizes the logical necessity that all Christians should have an infallible standard, an ultimate union of appeal, an end of all controversy. Protestants formerly said this is the sacred Scriptures. Catholics say it is "the visible head of the Church." Now Protestants have practically ceased to hold the Scriptures as the all-sufficient and infallible guide, and must walk either in sparks of their own kindling or else turn to Rome, as Mr. Adams has done.

And this "walking in sparks of our own kindling" Protestantism has been traveling that road that the great body of it monopolized monopolizes for years. It is the wrong road, but it is no new departure in the formulas that has done this in the beginning. And they who are in it are Protestants only in name; when in reality they have the courage to travel it all the way out. There can be no compromise between Christ and antichrist.
