**More Sunday Closing.**

In the Battle Creek, Mich., *Daily Journal*, of July 7, is the following:—

Homer is enforcing Sunday closing, an attempt having been made to prevent even milk peddlers from doing business on that day. All places of business were closed last Sunday save the drug stores and markets and these were open but a short time.

Homer is about twenty-six miles from Battle Creek.

A gentleman writes from the South:—

They have closed up all places of business in Asheville, N. C., on Sunday, and have fixed the penalty for violation at $50.

Nor is the nefarious work confined to the United States, as is shown by the following clipping from the *Port-of-Spain Gazette*, Island of Trinidad, of June 7th:—

The members of the C. E. Union will, at their next meeting, discuss the question of Sunday closing in the Island. Resolutions will be passed in regard to the movement. Friends desirous of hearing the discussion are welcome. The meeting will be held. . . on Thursday the 8th instant, at 8.00 P. M.

What is the meaning of this spontaneous out-cropping of the spirit of bigotry in so many different portions, not only on the continent, but even in the islands of the sea? Though each seems to be independent of the other, without any concerted action at all, does it not show that one and the same spirit is behind it all? And is it not the spirit which had already begun to work in Paul's day, which begets in those whom it deceives "pleasure in unrighteousness"?
