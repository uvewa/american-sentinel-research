The Ranch, Pueblo, Col., publishes the following "prayer," delivered by Chaplain Peck, of the Colorado Senate, at the opening of that body, January 6:—

We pray for the Republican majority. Upon it rests the responsibility of the legislation that shall pass this house. Grant wisdom unto these men sent up by the people to make laws for the commonwealth. May they profit by the experience of the past and learn wisdom from the records of the last legislature, for if they do not make a better record than it made they will not have a majority of even one at the next election. And thou hast taught us to pray for our enemies. We pray for these democrats and populists. They wanted all the offices, but the republicans were one too many for them, and they got none. It was a bitter pill for them to swallow. Now we pray that they may have grace and resignation to endure their disappointment and keep sweet. Finally, we pray that the house now being organized and all the offices distributed, these men may forget party lines and legislate for the benefit and happiness of the whole people. Bless them day by day, and may they work as in thy immediate presence. We ask it in Christ's name. Amen.

The Ranch very properly says of this "prayer" that—

The spirit of levity that characterizes it goes better with a low comedy than a Christian minister in the midst of an intelligent and God-fearing people. The fact that the audience at its conclusion laughed and wildly cheered is evidence of the influence it had for evil.

Our contemporary's concluding comment, which we adopt, is: "We give the prayer in full, to show our readers how just is the disgust we feel."
