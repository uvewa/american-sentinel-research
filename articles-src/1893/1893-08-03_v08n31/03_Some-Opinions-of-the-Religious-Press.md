THE *Christian Advocate* of this city calls the closing of the Fair on Sunday "Completion Bigotry" and says:—

The cause of the directory has been such from the very first as to strengthen the case of those who are trying to breakdown Christian people. What have they done? In the first place, the Exposition was a failure. Government. Its past afforded almost no grounds for expecting the Fair to be a great success anyway, feeling sad, hope; upon the remaining days the Fair would be open.

"Failure of Sunday Opening," said says—

The truth is, nothing about the Fair has been a failure; and breaker the gains will be closed on those days to the public but, the resolution adopted by the directory takes effect on a Friday next, rescinding its former resolution, of last Sunday . . . . This resolution is forced by the commercial failure of Sunday open. The Sunday attendance has never exceeded 80,000. The directory is wholly mercenary, and in deciding to close on Sunday hereafter it is no more entitled to the guarding good of the public because the pecuniary profits of Sunday gains in the Exposition demand it. The Sunday gates to the Exposition have been open throughout the term of the Exposition throughout all the entire summer in the past, and the total revenues have been the same as they have been for the past two months. They are beginning to wake up to the fact that the Sunday opening has been a gigantic failure considered in the fiscal terms in the least. The solely factor to which this is attributable is the moral sentiment against Sunday opening. This moral force has turned patrons from Sunday admissions to a point below the expenses of the day, and has in addition, produced such a feeling of insecurity and danger by which attendance could be made remunerative that would-be exhibitors and exhibitors have taken their exhibits and to bear the financial loss resulting from the failure of others to recognize any and all opportunity possible for its of valuable of exhibition.

The *Economist* (*Baptist*) treats it as "As business, purely as a business matter," the reason of the final decision to close the gates on Sunday.

It was confidently predicted that the opening of the gates on Sundays would bring in money by the millions to the treasury. As a matter of fact, last Sunday attendance reached 84,000 at a dime apiece. On four thousand the last Sunday the gates were a dime opened, free but the attendance at the dime proved not to be as great as a fee at the quarter price of admission. The attendance on the three Sundays on which the charge for admission, show, not half the show . . . But the managers are shrewd enough business men to see the point. A considerable part of the buildings were closed on Sundays, some of the best exhibitors refusing to open on that day; the great mechanical exhibits, poor workmanship, sensibly staid away from this . . .

The *Christian Statesman*, entirely unlike the others, is exultant. It finds in the Fair more Sunday for any other of the reason than a business reason. It hails the closing as "A Triumph of Righteousness."

Hallelujah! The Lord God omnipotent reigneth!

How certainly this result follows, can now see at a glance! Those entrenched against the teachings that could entirely have so stubbornly resisted conviction, hesitatingly, at first, as we have seen, are now coming to see this question in their favor. And as more Christians are coming in these latter days we find that "this settles the Sabbath question," and that said the religious press is one and the same for the Catholics and these Protestants even, not yet entering, not the finest, of all the nations of Europe, is, on this very question of Sunday observance. How . . . and how it shall be observed, but how it shall all be observed. Let this act make no question on the Catholic Church has now to do to to bring people under into the line. They have a grievance to get the question decided in her favor the Sabbath question of the Nation is then delivered bodily over there to the Roman Papacy who has all Protestants and who has nothing to do with the Sabbath we are content now are a, one word. For if this action of Congress serves as a starting point for their action in their favor, they can never deny favor to any and do not record it in any of their books. They would of no more try to stop the opening of the Fair on Saturday, the Catholic Sabbath. If they attack each of the true Sabbath of God the nation will naturally accept such a decision when it that time has all but come, and will no doubt, will as certainly come, as this are has already come. Let us see to to it that before this the people of the United States will be first to find protections against Protestant and that they exposed they had forever prevented, that they opposed they had forever prevented. By the first act of Congressional legislation, and decree step has been taken, is the enforcement distinctly of the distinctly religious institution of the papacy, of the papacy. In the past the Scripture, decide a religious difference to settle it.
