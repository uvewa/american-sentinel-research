ON Sunday, July 23, the World's Fair was closed. This time by the order of the directory, the proper authorities in charge of the Exposition and responsible for its financial interest. As business men representing the business interests that were their right, in the interests of their corporation and the business and financial interest, in their best judgment, to close the Fair and refuse to do business any day of the week that they see fit. The courts have upheld them in their refusal to obey the arbitrary Sunday closing provisions of Congress, placed on a technical plea of invalid the faith of Congress and not upon the proper principle which underlies the matter—"that Congress had no right to pass the private, and that under legislation to establish Sunday observance was an unconstitutional reversal;" the directory was absolved, and and they reversed the former agreement with Congress as to Sunday closing.

Now, of its own choice, it has been fit that the gates be closed on . That is all that is: the right to do as far as say principle of business; for religions have no right as a thing itself; or that religious thing in connection.

Neither Congress nor legislators nor courts have any right, nor any have they power, to say to any individual, or any corporation or the directors of any business enterprise, that they shall do this, that, or not do this or that, simply and only for Sunday. And why? It is not because the individuals composing them can not rest on Sunday if they want to for they can. But it is that those who want to keep Sunday may not use any compulsion or exercise any authority over anyone who does not care to observe the day. Supreme ordinariness is at the bottom of the whole thing.

Sunday observance and moral compulsion by law, under the advice of their leaders, the churches passed a general boycott, but save—laissez privately and quietly this boycott. Then when oppressed and pulled with all energy. It is not approved, and may serve but that it may it they succeeded in discouraging from the attendance during working days, but it is quite certain that they did succeed in reducing Sunday attendance materially, the Sunday attendance, and not only of those who had respect for Sunday and belonged to the church-going communities who might be prevailed upon to be consistent and respect and perfect institution perfectly justifiable in attend. But upon the World's Fair as a whole and in the day, Sunday, but the general crowd are but intent to go only to observe at and to spend their Sundays in our former section of amusements, recreation, for peddling, visiting saloons, indulging in all kinds of low and peculiarly degradable to attend to the Fair than to be out of it doing many worse things; these people do not come in instead, goes with their beer kegs to the shady parks and pretty places ever to visit on their Sundays in reality is a far less restless sounds and especially so was.

But still further this thin, a quiet and deliberate boycott was brought; was to continue to bear upon the exhibitors and those in charge of the different features inside. The *Dayton Press* (not Congress) of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, having an article from the pen of such an article and of prominent National Reformers and other ministers of religion, . . . . churches took the lead in an aggressive action to secure a general covering of the Fair and exhibits on Sunday, and also commissioning a visit on the side of the exhibitors themselves for the purpose of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. They reported that they looked upon the matter from a business standpoint, and this business standpoint was only the pretence, because the matter they were in a large insurance and they themselves were not business men know well what they were talking about for? They demanded and but that all would lay most of their lives for years to create so great a spectacle that they then close the Fair if opened on Sunday, and to secure a great . . . . as religious the day. . . .

The Fair this being open on Sunday, that they raised very naturally, that the very people they wanted to come to the Fair were the people who had some interest in staying at home because of the Sunday opening. While those who did attend the exhibits on Sunday and made a systematic . . . in attendance, were the very same people as possible who would follow their example; and boasted that almost ninety of . . . the Exposition was reversed from view, and thus as also as are a parallel case by the publication of the names of the exhibitors who closed or covered their exhibits, fills two whole pages of the directory, one of the large city papers. Of course, a few of the less important of the State and many exhibits were not to be seen, and the vast machinery was not in motion, and the greater number of State buildings with closed doors made the fair seem to the ordinary sight-seer a very poor investment for a first-class admission and a long ride. The closing of the State buildings was also due, in some measure, to the boycott.

So it will be seen, that although the closing of the Fair on Sunday was within a perfect right to do, and which it was their right to do, the reason for doing it, as they saw fit, they have been, in reality, entered into it by the reason and quiet efforts of those who that sought, previously, to accomplish the same thing by law; and having failed, have accomplished it by a boycott.

Chicago, July 17.
