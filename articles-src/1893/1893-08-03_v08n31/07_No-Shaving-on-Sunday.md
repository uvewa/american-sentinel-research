IN the Battle Creek, Mich., *Daily Journal*, of July 7, is the following:

> Hours in enforcing Sunday closing are stringent in the neighboring town of Ceresco. All places of from living business or that day. All places of business, except drug stores, must remain closed on the Lord's day.

It was learned about three or so miles from Battle Creek.

A special telegram writer from the South says—

> They have closed up all places of business in the town and have very effectually enforced Sunday.

Nor is the infractions work confined to the United States, as is shown by the following clipping, from the *Port-of-Spain Gazette*, Island of Trinidad, of June 7th—

> The members of the C. E. Class will at an adjourned meeting on the . . . the consideration of . . . the discussion and reordering. The meeting at . . . .

But the Sunday closers have not wanted, in a case that has been before the courts for some time, and finally taken to the Supreme Court, of this State, and secured a favorable decision from Judge Phillips, of the United States court for the district of Missouri, that "a party may shave himself as he would take a bath or wash his face, and it would not be the most abused an labor, but when the barber opens his shop, and there follows his usual worldly employment, it is quite a different matter."

On this rendering, the barbers have declared the operation of barber shops on Sunday a violation of law, and have therefore decided that their . . . hereafter it is established no barber shop belonging to the barbers' union can carry on business on that day, and that any shop outside the union even still they do not who have control, will be promoted, to which work the prosecuting attorney of the city is pledged his best efforts. Thus it is demonstrated against that Sunday are now secured as the instance of certain ones that they may not displease others. And at the work moves on. The lines seem to be drawing closer and closer, and out of it it certainly . . . seems and more plainly that . . . fanaticism and persecution.
