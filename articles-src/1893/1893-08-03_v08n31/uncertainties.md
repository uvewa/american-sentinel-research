# Uncertainties — v08n31, August 3, 1893

## Page 2, Article 01 (Congress Interprets Scripture)

- **Issue:** The phrase "the decision that is cured the opening of the Fair on Sunday" appears garbled in the OCR. The phrase "is cured" is likely an OCR error.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "the decision that is cured the opening of the Fair on Sunday" (preserved as OCR output)
- **Confidence:** LOW — "is cured" does not make grammatical sense; likely OCR corruption of a different phrase (possibly "that secured" or "that insured")
- **Reason:** Could not resolve from context alone without access to original scan

## Page 3, Article 01 (Congress Interprets Scripture)

- **Issue:** "the charge of 'treason,' 'anarchy,' 'atholism,' etc." — "atholism" appears in the OCR. This is likely a corruption of "atheism" (possible scan artifact — 'th' misread).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "atholism" (preserved as OCR output)
- **Confidence:** LOW — "atholism" is not a word; "atheism" is virtually certain to be the original
- **Reason:** The context (charges leveled against those who resist congressional authority on religion) strongly suggests "atheism." OCR misread likely due to scan quality.

## Page 4, Article 04 (The Sphere of Civil Government)

- **Issue:** "Several paragraphs of the *Advocats*'s reply" — OCR renders "Advocats'" which appears to be a scan artifact for "Advocate's."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "*Advocate*'s" (silently corrected in text since this is clearly an OCR artifact of a proper noun)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — "Advocate's" is certain

## Page 5, Article 05 (More Sunday Closing)

- **Issue:** Author signed as "W. E. HOWELL." — this initials/name combination does not appear in the known authors list.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** author "W. E. Howell," author_short "WEH"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the signature is clear in the OCR; the person is unknown but the attribution is explicit
- **Reason:** May be a reader correspondent rather than staff writer

## Page 8 (various short items)

- **Issue:** "tricks onworthy of any but ward politicians" — "onworthy" is likely an OCR error for "unworthy."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "onworthy" (preserved as OCR output)
- **Confidence:** LOW — "unworthy" is virtually certain to be the original
- **Reason:** Context clearly calls for "unworthy"

- **Issue:** "Comblian Exposition" — OCR corruption of "Columbian Exposition."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Comblian Exposition" (preserved as OCR output in article 15)
- **Confidence:** LOW — "Columbian" is virtually certain
- **Reason:** Standard name for the 1893 World's Fair

## Page 8, Masthead note

- **Issue:** The date in the page 8 image reference reads "NEW YORK, AUGUST 3, 1898" — clearly an OCR error; the correct year is 1893 as established by all other headers.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** not transcribed (this is a running header, not article content)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — 1893 is correct

## Associate Editor Name

- **Issue:** The masthead OCR reads "ASSOCIATE EDITORS, CALVIN P. BOLLHAR." — "BOLLHAR" is an OCR corruption of "BOLLMAN" (C. P. Bollman is the known associate editor for this period).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" in masthead (corrected)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — C. P. Bollman is the documented associate editor for 1893

## Page 6, Article 11 (Law and Religion)

- **Issue:** OCR reads "given to this kind of deciltry" — "deciltry" is not a word; likely OCR corruption of "devilry" or "duplicity."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "deciltry" (preserved as OCR output)
- **Confidence:** LOW — the original word cannot be determined with certainty from context alone
- **Reason:** Both "devilry" and "duplicity" fit contextually
