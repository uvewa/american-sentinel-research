THE cry for a union of religion with the civil government is becoming louder. In the little State of Rhode Island there is agitation for a Sunday law, which State which of all the States should be the very last to entertain such a proposal, for its founder Roger Williams, who fled from the persecution of the Massachusetts theocracy in the middle of winter to establish in the wilds of America a State in which religious freedom might be established by, and Church and State forever separated might be kept forever separate. But recently and lately, this Colony, by the President of Brown University, a State institution, in response to Post, a Sunday law . . . . the *Providence Journal* and *East Providence Sentinel Times*, from which we copy.

President Andrews, of Brown University, who means to teach us right, a certain aim of the whole matter, is that things have come lately and what is known as secular. Now . . . false religion, the question of the relation of religion to the State should be decided on a strictly religious point of view, and it is most desirable that we should . . . of the relation of the country with these false notions, relatively false, in its proper scientific nature . . .

Thus President Andrews teaches that a total separation of "what is known as religion, and what is known as secular," is not proclaimed in society, and is unjust and . . . is wrong from a religious and social point of view. What a thing for the president of a religious university to . . . and to teach! Would the Pope take any higher ground? What would be Roger Williams' idea of this entire separation between "what is known as religion," and "what is known as secular," . . . were false notions relatively false." Then the President of Brown University, the man, a statesman, a politician, and a religious teacher in the State was declare that the principles of religious liberty that lies, Roger Williams suffered and which he intended this colony should enjoy, and enjoy for the benefit of his posterity ever after. President Andrews has no right to . . . the principle laid down in the Bill of Rights of the State of Rhode Island, which reads as follows, is wrong also—

No man shall be compelled to frequent or to support any religious worship, place or ministry whatever, and all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or civil incapacitations, are inconsistent with the rights of conscience, free, and, Westerly. A principal object of our venerable ancestors in coming to, founding and settling this State was to hold forth a lively experiment that a most flourishing civil state may best be maintained with full liberty in religious concerns, and that Christian forbearance, love and charity . . . among the various seasons and to parties, and by argument to make . . . and those who are most persuaded that they, that the great all their object.

And President Andrews would have a man's religious faith effect his civil engagements; because he says the founding of Roger Williams and others was wrong on this point. Thus we see that his views of the relation between civil government and religion when carried to their legitimate ends, directly result in the very thing that this was designed to prevent, re-establishment of the Papacy. This is all in accordance with . . . dependent upon religion and religion upon the State.

And now along comes a petition from Protestant and Catholic clergymen calling on the State to render assistance in the enforcement of a more strict observance of Sunday.

The Providence Town Council met on the afternoon of July 4, and took action on the petition of the clergymen of all denominations of the town, presented at the last meeting, asking for the observance of the town including: Father Haley, Father Bric, Father McKenna, . . . and others for stricter enforcement of the Sunday laws of the State. The following is the petition in response to petition for enforcement.

WHEREAS, During had increase as more of the violations of existing Sunday laws is particularly manifest in the sale of intoxicating liquor, immoral shows, Will West shows and other performances, Sunday horse-racing, public games, especially those concerning the Columbian Exposition solely from a . . .

WHEREAS, These violations of the State laws are greatly to the detriment of the moral welfare of our citizens, and these shows records that the law of this State, and . . . .

WHEREAS, Such unlawful conduct and proceed are against a violation of our citizens to which the law . . .

. . . therefore far and side; and

THEREFORE be it . . . resolved by the Town Council of the town of Westerly, that the petition of the law abiding people of this State, and are we all, we respectfully petition . . . the sacred traditions and principles upon which our State was founded, and to enforce all existing laws to the end that the peace of the community be preserved . . .

What is that the meaning of this outpopping of the spirit of bigotry in so many different portions, body only on the continent, but even in the island of of the rest of the other, without any concession at all; love is the all it mean but that the same spirit is behind it all? And is it not the spirit which had already begun to work in Paul's day, which begins in those when it desires "a new thing on the earth."

W. E. HOWELL.
