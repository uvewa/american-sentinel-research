IT is now charged that the Mormons have made a fund of $1,000,000, with which they propose to buy Senators for Utah. Well, why not? The other National Reformers have a year ago induced Congress to engage in wholesale bribery of the Columbian Exposition in the interests of Sunday observance; if now the Mormons want to pay in cash, who can condemn them? Not the Sunday boom connivance.
