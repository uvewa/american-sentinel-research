The American Sabbath Union held its annual mid-summer meeting July 23 and 24. Rev. Dr. George S. Mott, acting president of the American Sabbath Union, presided. Addresses were made by Dr. Mott, Rev. J. H. Knowles, Anthony Comstock, and others. After saying that the glory of Sunday closing of the Fair belonged to the Lord, Secretary Knowles proceeded to give it to the American Sabbath Union. In outlining future work Mr. Knowles said:—

A rare opportunity is afforded to circulate Sabbath literature during the World's Fair. The American Sabbath Union proposes to do this work as the funds are provided for the purpose, and desires to avail itself of the present interest in the Sabbath question to organize a Sabbath association in every State and territory.

At the outset of his remarks, Anthony Comstock said: "The question before us to-night is, 'Who is upon the Lord's side?'" And to assist in determining this question Mr. Comstock and his co-workers want the power of the civil law so that they can force men to be on the Lord's (?) side. Don't they know that the Lord has no more interest in Sunday than in any other day of the week? that he himself has declared that "the seventh day is the Sabbath"?
