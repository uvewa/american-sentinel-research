# The Relation of the State and Church.

The State and the Church are both established by divine authority; they are both recognized in the same Bible; they are both designed to promote and conserve the interests of humanity; and they are each to do their work in behalf of the same individual. But none of these consideration are such as to render their work interchangeable or mutual. Though they were ordained by the same authority, they were ordained for purposes that are entirely distinct. Though the Bible recognizes them both, it draws an unmistakable line between them and between their fields of operation. And although they are each designed to work for the good of mankind, the objects at which they are aimed are as far apart as heaven and earth. They do not do the same work for the same individual. The success of each depends upon its keeping to its legitimate work, and avoiding any interference with the work of the other.

The query of the proverb, "Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?" is applicable to the Church that intermediates with politics. The hands of the Church are blackened, her gold becomes dross by such contact. The work of the Church is spiritual: that of the State is carnal. The Church cannot engage in such work and retain her purity, and her influence for holiness. She thus forsakes her Lord and Master for the service of Caesar. On the other hand, when the State aspires to act the part of a spiritual guardian for its people, it transcends its commission, becomes antichrist, and destroys the very work it essays to do.

The State is not an adjunct of the Church; and it can only assist the Church by extending to it the same protection that belongs to other bodies and to all citizens alike, and securing to her the inherent privilege of prosecuting her work untrammelled by laws or oppression so long as in its work it does not interfere with the rights of others. In maintaining this attitude the State cannot take a partisan position, it cannot use its power in favor of, nor adversely to, the cause of religion. The State cannot be just and impartial while it occupies any other than a neutral position upon matters of a religious nature. And to maintain impartiality toward all its subjects in the dispensation or its benefits and the administration of its power, is among the chiefest considerations of good government.

The State should pave the way for the Church in the same manner and to the same extent that it does for any other salutary enterprise, by restraining violence and promoting civility among its people; by encouraging enlightenment and progress; by guaranteeing and securing freedom and equality in matters of conscience. But not one of these benefits comes to the Church by the State acting in collusion with the Church, or extending to her any special favor. Such favors are fatal to true spirituality, because pure and undefiled religion is a plant of heavenly origin; it must be nourished by divine light and grace, ministered to by an unseen power. It cannot be forced to healthy growth in the hothouse of public favor, nor derive its strength from rulers or parliaments. The introduction of earthly elements blights its purity, and stamps it as mongrel.

In the light of these facts, and our consciousness tells us that they are facts, we have to decide that in its attitude toward the Church—toward any church or religion—the State cannot with propriety or safety do more than it will do for the private citizen. Its rights are to be recognized and protected. It is to share equally with all others those privileges and immunities, no more, no less, which come to the people at large from the administration of the government. If it be a land of freedom, the Church will share that freedom. If light and progress, knowledge and refinement prevail, the Church comes in for her share of those advantages. The government that pursues an upward path in obtaining for its subjects the most free and full exercise of their personal rights, assisting in enlarging the understanding of its people upon the lines of useful education and the unfolding of true knowledge, without any reference to the advantage of any particular or any special creed or system, acts the part of wisdom and confere upon its citizens and upon the Church of Christ the highest favor that it is in its power to bestow. The State owes no duty to the Church that it does not owe to its most humble citizen. It has no work to do for the promotion of religion any further than has been indicated. It cannot do more for the religion of Christ and the Bible, for when the State takes up that work, it ceases to be the cause of Christ and becomes the religion of the State; it becomes of the earth earthy, and not heavenly; carnal, not spiritual. Such is the relation that the State sustains to the Church, or the cause of Christ.
