THE REV. Patrick J. Dillon, D.D., of the diocese of Peoria, Ill., delivered a lecture Sunday night, September 24, at the Carmelite Church in East Twenty-ninth street, this city. His subject was "The Church and Liberty." He said: "The name of liberty is often mistaken for its substance and is made the excuse for cruelty and despotism. Liberty in its fullest sense appertains only to God. Liberty, therefore, so far as it relates to the human mind, means freedom from all control except the control of God." Civil and political liberty, Dr. Dillon declared, had been fostered by the Catholic Church in every age.

The Doctor is quite right in his definition of true liberty, but not as he meant it. With the Romanist, the Pope is the vicar of Christ and stands to men in the place of God, "so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." With the papists "freedom from all control except the control of God" means freedom from all control except the control of the Pope. Popish platitudes about religious liberty mean no more no less than Cardinal Gibbons' definition of such liberty; he said it was "liberty to worship God according to the dictates of a right conscience." "The church," that is Rome, always reserves the right to define "a right conscience." The whole papal theory is opposed to liberty in either civil or religious things.
