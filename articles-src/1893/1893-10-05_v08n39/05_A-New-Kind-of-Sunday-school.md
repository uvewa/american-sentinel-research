## A New Kind of Sunday-school.

The idea of the industrial Sunday-school is not a new one, but very interesting experiments are now being made with it, especially in St. Louis, where a Sunday-school for technical education has just been opened under the supervision of Prof. C. M. Woodward, the head of the Manual Training School of Washington University.

The school is founded by the "Self-Culture Club," an organization of workers many of them wage-workers in the trades. It is remarkable in this and it is not less remarkable because of its incidental connection with Washington University, which, as it represents the New England influence in Missouri, might be supposed to be in some sympathy with Sabbatarianism.

There has seldom been a wider departure from Sabbatarianism than in the opening of this Sunday-school for teaching drawing and the principles of mechanics, arithmetic, algebra and the higher mathematics, as well as other branches needed to complete a technical education and to broaden the mind.

The school will be attended by men and women who are too much occupied during the week to study. It may be said that all such might attend night schools, and no doubt some of them do, but the person who is exhausted by a hard day's work is at a great disadvantage in trying to learn at night. This kind of Sunday-school will not interfere with any other school, Sunday or secular. It will supplement them all. Undoubtedly it has a great future.
