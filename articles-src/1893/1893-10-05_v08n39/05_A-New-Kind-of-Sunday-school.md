The idea of the industrial Sunday-school is comparatively new. The first experiments are now being made with success in several cities. Its growth in popularity is remarkable. In this country the school for technical education has just been given the name of Sunday-school by C. M. Woodward, the head of Manual Training School, of St. Louis.

The school is founded by the "Saturday half-holiday fund" for the purpose of giving many of these young workers in the trades an elementary training more thorough and systematic because of the industrial element. With Washington, with Philadelphia, it is growing. In this city, also, as it represents the New England idea of the Sunday-school which seems to be in some sympathy with this movement. The children at present are learning from Sabbatarians their in the opening of the school. The main studies include drawing and the principles of mechanism, nature, as well as other branches needed to complete a technical education and to broaden the mind.

The school will be attended by men and women who can be only employed during the week to study. It may be said that all men study attend in night schools, and no doubt some of them do, but the present efforts to be sustained by a day's work it is a great disadvantage to trying to learn after a day's work. This kind of Sunday-school will develop the very training that is needed whether of secular. It will supplement and increase the educational development.
