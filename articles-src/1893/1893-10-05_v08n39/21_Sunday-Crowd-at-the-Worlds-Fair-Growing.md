A CHICAGO dispatch of the 17th inst. opens with this items of news:—

The usual small Sunday crowd was at the World's Fair to-day, there being no attractions outside of the Art Building and the Midway Plaisance.

The dispatch contains thirty-six lines, all told, and closes with this bit of information:—

The World's Fair paid admissions to-day were 40,654.

The "usual small Sunday crowd" has steadily increased week by week from (in round numbers) 12,000 to 40,000, and this "with no attractions outside the Art Building and the Midway Plaisance." This the Christian Statesman calls "practical Sunday-closing." August 27, the "usual small Sunday crowd" numbered less than 21,000; September 10, it had increased to over 34,000; a week later it was over 40,000.
