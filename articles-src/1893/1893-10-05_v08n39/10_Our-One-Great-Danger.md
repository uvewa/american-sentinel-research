## "Our One Great Danger."

[The following letter, with the above heading, appeared recently in the Christian Standard, the organ of the Disciples Church. It is commended to the thoughtful reader. Italics as they appeared in the Standard.—H. F. PRELIN.]

WHAT have we done? Our plea for apostolic Christianity, our plea for Christian union, our work and labors throughout the whole restorative movement for Christianity pure and unalloyed, our fight upon all things that bear the marks of Romanism, is marred by our action in the Sunday question that has been under agitation, and will be agitated for a few years yet to come.

It seems now that we incline to the misapplied Sabbath day—misapplied by the "infallible Pope," and received as righteousness by the sectarian world. We excuse this action by differential statement, designating it the "civil Sabbath."

What has constructed or made a "civil Sabbath"?—Law. Who makes law?—Man. Who made the Sabbath?—God. For whom was it made?—For man. Can man make it for himself?—No. Then we bow before the force which takes the affairs of God into its own hand, who is "above all that is called God"—the Papacy? To whom and to what do we bow in this question of a "civil Sabbath"? To the Pope and to Romanism.

There can be no doubt that this legislation upon the Sunday question is a "mark of the beast." As a people who have vied in the creation and enforcement of this "Sabbath law," we have received upon our foreheads and upon our hands the "mark of the beast." We have not too much evidence that the first day of the week is the Lord's day. While we have conclusive evidence that the first day of the week is not the Sabbath day.

If, as we infer, the first day of the week be the Lord's day, then what authority have we to enforce the Lord's day upon the world or expect its recognition by legal force? Or by what authority do we assume to exact from other brethren, by legal force, the rights of honest, conscientious worship on the only day embodied in the divine law? Church and State should not be combined. Our glorious brotherhood must not assist in combining them.

If we engraft in law the first day "Sabbath," then, indeed, as all law, it must be enforced. Besides injustice to very good and honorable people, we should know we have no right to enforce God's law upon the people that dwell on the earth, presuming it to be the Sabbath day, which we all know quite well it is not. As well might we exact a law to compel all men to be baptized, or fix in law what may constitute a Christian, or by law create Christians.

A person out of Christ is no better by respecting, or being compelled to respect, a day of worship, for he is not spiritually or otherwise in the realm of worship. . . . Still this carnal law, when enforced (and enforced it will be, sooner or later), has gotten higher than God.

What now is higher "than all that is called God"? Why, it is papal authority, unmistakable and certain. And the "saddest of all sad things" is that the Church of Christ has stultified herself in this action in this matter, and taken one step backward toward Romanism.

We have brethren who thoroughly understand this question and this line of prophecy now under fulfillment, and know well these are facts we must confront.

For shame! May not our General Convention further compromise our position upon these questions, by indorsing our national legislation upon the subject, or giving support by resolution or otherwise to a "national Sabbath"—the beginning of the union of Church and State in America.

Let us come down out of the crowd and watch what we are about.

JAS. A. DEMOSS, M.D.
