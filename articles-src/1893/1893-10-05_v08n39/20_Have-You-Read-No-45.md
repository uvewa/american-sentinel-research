HAVE you read No. 45 of the Sentinel Library? "That Christ has a Baptist is Explained why," and answers the question in the affirmative. There is nothing better on the proposition. There is nothing better on the subject of a Baptist in this publication than can be found in this tract. Pacific Press, price, 9 cents.

One of the very best of the tracts on the subject of Religious Liberty is Extra No. No. 15, "Christ and the Sabbath." Everything is here set out with the utmost care against a dissolution of our National purpose down to cases. It can be ordered as above.
