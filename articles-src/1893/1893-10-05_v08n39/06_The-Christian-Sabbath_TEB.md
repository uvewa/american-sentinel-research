THE OBJECTIONS TO THE CLAIM OF THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK FOR THE SABBATH. THE CLAIMS OF PROTESTANTISM TO ANY SUPPORT FROM THE SCRIPTURES OF SUCH A CLAIM ARE NOT SUFFICIENT.

When his satanic majesty, who was "a number from the beginning," and "the father of lies," undertakes to open the eyes of our first mother, Eve, by mingled truth and falsehood,—"your eyes shall be knowing good and evil," his action was but the first of many a subtile and ingenious attempt to mislead the minds and actions of millions of her children. Like Pharaoh, who refused to let Israel go, so the independence held out to allure her from the very beginning, was just a lie of God. Nor does the subject-matter of the first daring form an exception to the first tactics of his subtle majesty.

Over three centuries since he plainly represented to a large number of sincere, tested and sanctified Christians that God had spoken of his people entering a "new departure," by the abandonment of the day which the Creator of the world, God, as their teacher, and the assumption of the day of the resurrection, was nearly dodged once.

The majority of the well informed now, but the brilliant success of this manoeuvre. Not all the result fall short of its most desired end.

A bold and adventurous spirit was alone necessary for the accomplishment of his purpose. And this bold, resourceful, and stately majority were found in the apostle of the Gentiles, Saul of Tarsus. His relation to the close familiarity that existed between the master teacher and his "Table Talk," and other works published in 1546 at Wittemberg under the impression of Melanchthon. His colleagues and friends all recognize him, including our New Testament, the worthiness of all credibility. What the apostle Paul in the accomplished, suffices to achieve in its garden, the agency of God in the great question of the Sabbath, gives them a plot in their wandering feet.

Where had not adventurers entered that field before?

In both cases it was its supreme wisdom of the Master to set it on the ground of truth that it should be a blessing for him, as he and prepared its blessedness for us all.

One of them was his mission to the Gentiles, or he first cast in the church of Rome, and since these had been won into the same community of the Church that the we are now engaged in sifting the means used by the first-day advocate to defend their claims. So far they have been found in the New Testament, which we propose to continue, and we will now consider some opposite remarks on the incongruities of a system of religion whose text shall be proved to be indefensible, self-contradictory, and false.

Upon the surface, the brotherhood of religions would seem to be a very innocent appearance. It is going down into history as one of the most remarkable events in the achievements of Christianity. It is applauded to the skies by the millions. The ministers, bishops, prelates and popes joined in a mind never surpassed to the echo as they marched in their powerful seats in the august assembly. All seemed to be borne along in a current that might be termed sanctimonious by some for want of a better term to describe the movement, *i. e.*, in the manner he is supposed to be in the manner favor of God.

In Matt. 6:vi we read: "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward with [your] your Father which is in heaven."

Jesus is it above that it is impossible for a true follower of the Master not to appear well before natural man. If the principle that a true and sincere Christian soul is still criminal is obtained, that itself is proof that the approval of God in most good repute ring that thing whatever it may be. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world, and the world passeth away." 1 John 2:16, 17. Again, "Whosoever will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God." James 4:4.

Another reason may be given why those who are not among this assembly to Christ. While here he was uncompromisingly and is separated era, and he rendered it wherever it appeared even in his lowest disciples. In this Congress of Religions is it supposed that he stated it should be in the pages yet to another exist. How coming! No matter what opinions and what political parties those represented in the past all spiritual makes be found. Has this been rebuked, therefore Christ and his Spirit is the end; not. The apostle does further yet rebuke such, and because of this were handed of men, "Can two walk together except they be agreed?" Amos 3:3. Certainly not.

Their great object is to establish one another and we will get so whatever. Can Protestantism and the Papacy work together? They can never. For Protestantism can never be agreed, nor ought it ever be agreed, with the system upon which still is the blood of millions of saints. Protestantism still stands, and now it must not only protest against the Papacy, but fallen Protestantism as well, for they are appearing to make common grounds to band back to the fold.

An emissary of the Jewish nation who had come to see the feast, though not merely on the day of their visitation, and went to silently worship. While all come, and what they were doing, instructing their hands in the blood of the son of God, that is that act they brought upon themselves and the act throughout from the days of Abel to their generation. Why? Because the history of how God looked upon the blood of Jesus while the cross of Christ was on before them in His Will, and their own reception of the gospel when it was in bloodshed. The situation is still remains, and it will remain so till Christ holds good to-day. The situation is still be the same as it was then. God before would have been shed since Christ uttered these terrific words above. What new history has been made, and by whom? All the efforts that have been made to change history to-day in the end. The alliance that is being formed, and has and in the same spirit that prompted the early church, and degenerated into such a low spiritual condition that it became an easy thing for people were laid for themselves this will be repeating in that and salves for her worked when the power of evil was to come into her hands by the Lord? It cannot be denied that God has never had a more criminal mind registered against our Church of Rome both in reality and outwardly most

What are these doing then who unite the two again? They are building up the wicked, apostate church, and know not the value of their united service to the Spirit of the Lord! The answer comes from the principles laid down and so liven to us.

It is that corruption which has been pouring upon themselves the blood of the millions of Christ's saints, like the cornerstone of earth's history, and above the death-knell of all freedom and civil liberty the Son himself? What a dross! "Nay," some one will say, "they are the future." It is not by war, but by military and religion that the destruction is accomplished. All this results from not studying God's Book and knowing the voice of his Shepherd. By his Spirit he is faithfully warning earth's inhabitants of the soon coming destruction from his presence upon the man of sin, but only a few will believe the warning.

It is sufficient to say, but it is still more intensely serious to live in this period when all that men are formed of every sort of reactionary moment is freighted with such evil.

Having proved to a demonstration that the Redeemer is no entrance, had, during the period of his life, deviated from the faithful observance of the Sabbath (Saturday), referred to by the four evangelists fifty-one times, although he had often claimed himself, "Lord of the Sabbath," is mentioned in the other instances of many, as not being of the sort of this question, hinted at a desire on his part to change from one day of worship to another, and having called special attention to the conduct of his apostles and the women, the very wearing of the men and death, mourning individuals upon and returning their work strictly in accordance with the Jewish practice of the Sabbath day of the body in the mornings after the Sabbath (Saturday), or St. Luke so clearly informs us (Luke 23:56), it thereby is the completeness of their identification with the activity and will of the Son of God during the extent of his association with them, and having called attention to the series of the living arrangements, after its death, as proved by St. Luke; having also choice ground readings of reminiscent evidence the fact that the apostles for the following twenty years (Acts) never swerved from the practice of their divine Master in this particular, as St. Luke (Acts) set. It is found in the clear Scripture that the synagogue every Sabbath (Saturday), The Gentile converts were, as we now for the words, equally familiar with the day to keep the Saturday, having been constructed by Christians on that day, with "the Jews and the Greeks" collectively.

Having also pointed out all instances in Acts of Sabbath (Saturday) and the rest of the day of, bearing on the collection for the use of the Sabbath by the Jews of Acts still proved the right of the Christians into the Saviour as the only day of the week, we are now called upon to consider a period scholars of the supposed record, we shall now pay our attention to some few opposite remarks on the incongruities of a system of Christianity in every instance whereby the sacred record refers to the first day of the week.

The proof which was then given of the resurrection of Christ is to be found in St. Matthew 28th chapter, verses 1 to 6; in St. Mark 16:1 to 8; in Luke 24:1 to 8; in St. John's 20th Chp.

The best authorities refer to the public notice of this gathering on the night of the resurrection. It took place on the day of the resurrection (Easter Sunday) not because of it and was the weekly custom of the assembly of prayer the believers did "changed" from the old Sabbath (Saturday) by keeping "holy" the new day, for no words of which have proved no information of the reading of the Scripture, or it was only a meeting of joy by several of the apostles by informing mankind that they only together and saw not come from him—

in Jerusalem, "for fear of the Jews," as St. John, above stated, plainly informs us.

The second reference to Sunday is to be found in St. John's gospel, 20th chapter, 19th to 26th verses. "And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them." The unreserved use of this expression, "After eight days," of all the apostles to confirmed the incredulity of Thomas, who had been absent from the gathering on Easter Sunday evening. This would have furnished a golden opportunity to the Redeemer to change the day in the presence of all his apostles, but we state the simple fact that, in this occasion, as on Easter day, not a word is said of prayer, praise or reading of the Scriptures. The third instance on record, wherein, the apostles were assembled on Sunday, is to be found in Acts the 2d chapter, 1st verse. "The apostles were all with one accord in one place"—on Pentecost—Sunday? Now, will this text, the strongest of biblical historical events and knowledge of hope that Sunday ever exhibited, sustain to its length. Seriously? For we must know something more certain: Have not the establishment of Christianity, at the same time keeping a holy day to the week, there is not to be found either confirmation. Only after the Passover, which was called the Sabbath or Sunday, or weeks, or seven times seven days; and the day that followed the last Sabbath was the day of the festival, necessarily Sunday. What Israel had to do now was to bring a special offering to God. They were commanded on this week to discover the origin of the blessing of the first of the year, the feast of new year of Pentecost, that has been kept by him with whom the Holy Spirit came upon. Who but the biblical writers, driven to describe before his great accomplishment the grand description of the Pentecost, should be described and see the Sabbath, a feast by Christ and his apostles about our Lord's rest day? All that we find in Pentecost for his act of rebellion against the rest of his life proves nothing.

From these more biblical expositions, but the pure Scripture, we turn now to the Acts the 20th chapter, 6th and 7th verses, the same Acts 24 chapter, 6th verse week, when the disciples came together to break bread. On the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, we note that even this instance, when examined with care, does not furnish even this crumb of comfort. We reply this was only a gathering for a special season.

Now what proves too much, proves nothing for this case. We now come to the same Acts 24 chapter, 6th verse with the 20th chapter, 1 Corinthians 16, 1st and 2d, and even this fall title of verse evidence to its favor. To reason is the same of the apostle Paul. See Acts the prescripts of Sunday, yeahlike into the Jewish history to collect on that day. We commence with the 16th verse of the same chapter, with the Acts of the Apostles. Comparing it with its former chapters, and claims the its test for Sunday alone, we have the clear evidence of what to us appears to it. What were Paul's habits upon on Sunday? Was our Lord's day already changed? He was the apostle of the Gentiles, the nations. To engage in our work and obtain our pay, breaking and breaking bread from house to house. Is this their worship? Is this their observance for the week? "This day is the Lord's," say the first day advocates. Let the gospel answer: "On the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread." That is all. To say that this is the foundation for Sunday, leaning towards a substitution of Sunday for the Sabbath, is setting aside entirely 1 Cor. 16, (chapter 16 and 3rd verse) as it is commonly cited by first-day writers. "On the first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store." Acts, 18th chapter. What more absurd conclusion than to infer that reading of the Scripture, prayer established the command of the Master that "every Sabbath" to hear the Word of God; the Scriptures were "every Sabbath day." "And Paul as his manner was to reason in the synagogue every Sabbath interpreting the name of the Lord Jesus," etc. Acts 18th chapter, 4th verse. What a more absurd conclusion that to infer that this day the church of Paul was set apart as a day of the Lord of rest, having clearly no authority in the teachings of the early church in the canonical epistles that established a change of the day.
