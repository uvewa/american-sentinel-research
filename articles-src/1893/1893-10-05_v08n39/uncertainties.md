# Uncertainties — v08n39 (1893-10-05)

## Article 01 — "Christianity and the Common Law" (CPB)

- **Page break mid-word:** The article crosses pages 1–2 with an apparent line-ending mid-word. Page 1 ends with "...can by any possibility be Christ-" and page 2 begins "ity. When such union comes in, Christianity goes out." The OCR preserves this as a page-break artifact. Transcribed as: "...can by any possibility be Christian. When such union comes in..." joining the partial word. Confidence: HIGH — the context is clear.

## Article 06 — "The Christian Sabbath" (Catholic Mirror reprint)

- **Publisher's note (footnote):** The OCR contains two footnotes marked with * and †. The text of these footnotes appears somewhat garbled in the OCR (e.g., "refr of on what has been said," "pap-rs," "EDITER" instead of "EDITOR," "Percezants" instead of "Protestants"). These appear to be OCR artifacts from small-print footnotes in the original. Transcribed faithfully as OCR produced them, without correction. Confidence: LOW for footnote text — multiple OCR errors likely in these small-print sections.
  - "refr of" — unclear; possibly "reflect" or "rely"
  - "pap-rs" — likely "papers"
  - "EDITER" — likely "EDITOR"
  - "Percezants" — likely "Protestants"

- **Article subheading:** The OCR renders the subtitle as "THE CLAIMS OF PROTESTANTING TO ANY PART THEREIN PROVED TO BE GROUNDLESS, SELF-CORTRADECTORY AND SUICIDAL." "PROTESTANTING" likely should be "PROTESTANTS" and "CORTRADECTORY" likely should be "CONTRADICTORY." These may be OCR errors or original printing errors. Transcribed as found. Confidence: MEDIUM — likely OCR artifacts.

## Article 06 — "The Christian Sabbath" — verse/poem

- The four-line poem ("Give them a plod to their wandering fleet...") may contain OCR errors. "A plod" is unusual; possibly "a pilot" or "a plot." Transcribed as found. Confidence: LOW.

## Article 08 — "The Relation of the State and Church" (G. C. Tenney)

- **New author:** G. C. TENNEY (initialed GCT) is not in the known authors list. This may be George C. Tenney, an Adventist writer. Flagged for verification.

## Page 8 Editorial Notes

- **"items of news"** (article 21): The OCR reads "this items of news" — likely a typo/OCR error for "this item of news." Transcribed as found ("items"), preserving the original as it appears.

- **"of of the combine"** (article 11, Justice Brewer quote): The OCR reads "the slaves of of the combine" — a probable OCR duplication error. Transcribed as found.

## Page 8 — Subscription/Boilerplate

- The subscription rates table on page 8 is garbled in the OCR (all rates show "—"). This section was skipped as boilerplate/advertisement content.

## West Shore Railroad Advertisement

- The agents' names and addresses in the West Shore Railroad advertisement appear heavily garbled (e.g., "WARDINGBORNE" for what is likely a city name, "SOOHEY" may be a surname). This section was skipped as advertisement content.
