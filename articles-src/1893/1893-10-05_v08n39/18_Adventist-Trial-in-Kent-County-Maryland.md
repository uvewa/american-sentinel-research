THE approaching trial of another Adventist in Kent County, Md., for Sunday work, has revived interest in this subject in that particular part of the country; and somehow it has leaked out that previous to the first case of the kind in that county (that of Mr. Judefind), some months ago, the prosecuting attorney of the county was appealed to by certain ladies, jealous for Sunday sacredness. The attorney demurred to taking the initiative, when one of the ladies exclaimed: "But you must do something; we've seen them carrying water from the pump on Sunday." But the attorney was obdurate, and nothing was done until the Methodist preacher came to the rescue and secured the arrest of Mr. Judefind.
