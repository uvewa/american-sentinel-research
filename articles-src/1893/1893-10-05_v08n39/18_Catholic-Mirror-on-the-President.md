THIS Catholic Mirror published a statement some weeks ago to the effect that a certain man in the South, named Collard, Jesus Sparks, of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, caused during Mr. Cleveland's former term in the White House, "the gallant old Confederate officer" said to Profound it, a person of "a receipt of fat, juicy, Permanent pecuniary, which throw money to himself." We remarked at the time that if this were was a slander on the President, it certainly was on the Nation. Now a more serious charge is publicly made by the *World*, of this city, namely, that the commission on the question of the denomination was appointed in consideration of $50,000 contributed to the campaign, found at the last presidential election. We trust that neither of these charges is true. "The first, if true, might indicate simply a "soft spot" in the make up of our Chief Magistrate; the second would cause a decay in our political life but little short of that indicated to be our last days of Rome, when the highest offices went to the highest bidders, and even the royal dignity was bartered and sold in the most shameless fashion.

The Catholic nation never tire of boasting of how they established religious liberty in Maryland. The fact is that they did this in order to secure liberty for themselves. England was at that time Episcopalian, not Papal, and in providing for liberty of worship in Maryland, the colony Lord Baltimore, himself a Papist, simply secured the colony against the otherwise a certainty that the colonists were people of England, or of Presbyterianism, and the great majority of the Maryland colonists, and Presbyterianism was at that time stronger, by political ancestry, in Maryland, and was already the established religion of Maryland and a guarantee of religious liberty was on the part of Lord Baltimore was an act of self-preservation.
