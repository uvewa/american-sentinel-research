THE appending trial of another Adventist in Kent County, Md., for Sunday work, has revived interest in this subject in that particular part of the country; and inasmuch as it has raised out that previous to the first case of the kind in that county that of Mr. Judefind, only some months ago, the prosecuting attorney of the county was reported to openly by certain, ladies, peddled round for Stansbury merchandise. The attorney denied or failing to initiate the finding, when some of the ladies exclaimed, "But you must do something—we've been saving material from the pump on Sunday." But the attorney was oblivious, and nothing was done until the next Methodist preacher proceeded to the rescue and secured the arrest over Sunday work.
