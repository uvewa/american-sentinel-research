In the papers read at the Parliament of Religions, Sunday, September 18, occur two statements, which we wish to examine in their relation to each other.

One of these statements was made by Rev. Geo. P. Hattersodt, the evangelist, the other by Prof. Thomas, of the University of Washington. Dr. O'Gorman's statement, which was made in support of the declaration that "with no separation of Church and the broad separation of the State from religion," was as follows:—

Now this case it has been decided by your courts, that we are a Christian people, and that Christianity is true and our new law; so set in the corpus of the common law.

Dr. Hattersodt's statement was a definition of Christianity, made, however, with no relevance to Dr. O'Gorman's words.

Christianity is not belief in a doctrine or even a system. It is not belief, but a living union with a living Saviour.

That this definition is essentially correct will appear from a few texts of scripture.

SAYS THE SAVIOUR:

I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

And, again, we have this declaration of the apostle—

But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.

And, again, the same inspired writer makes this declaration:—

I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

Many other texts might be quoted to the same intent, but these are ample to show that Christianity does indeed consist of a living union with a living Saviour.

This much being settled, let us test the first proposition, namely, that "Christianity is part of our *new* law, as it is part of the common law of England."

It is always proper to use the definition of a word instead of the word itself. Applying this rule in the case we have the proposition:—

"It has been decided by your courts that we are a Christian people, and that 'a living union with a living Saviour,' is part of our new law, as it is part of the common law of England."

Who does not know that this is not true? and that it cannot be true of any nation? Only individuals can have "a living connection with a living Saviour;" only individual men can be Christians, for nothing short of this is Christianity.

Every individual is peculiar in his spiritual nature. So no college research can settle this respect. Simply material research in this respect. Simply material contact with a more or less direct observance of peculiarities to its sufficient extent constitutes one a Buddhist, or a papist, or any other school, or a Mohammedan, or a disciple of any other religion except Christianity; and "a living union with a living Saviour" constitutes any one a Christian.

This is the distinguishing and essential feature of Christianity, which the apostle referred to as "the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." Col. 1:26, 27.

A failure to comprehend the spiritual nature of Christianity has done limitless harm in the world; and for this, professedly Christian nations, those making a profession of real Christian experience, are very largely to blame. They have both sanctioned the application of the name of Christian to nominal adherents of nominal Christianity, and have so used the term themselves, through pride of numbers, until to the world at large a mere adherence to Christianity in preference to some other system of morality, is accepted to be Christianity. Hence, we hear of Christian saloon keepers, Christian saloons, of Christians from Africa, Christian opium sellers in China, Christian injustice to weak and mortgaged people, etc., and also, the term, "Christian nation."

To say that Christianity is part of the common law of any country is only to say that nominal Christianity has in that country the support of the civil power. But whatever may have been asserted of England, it is certainly not true, and never was true of this country; and cannot be as a part of our unwritten law. Faith, hope, and charity are the crowning graces of Christianity, but are they any part of the unwritten law of this country? And if not, were they ever? But if they were, how could the civil law undertake to compel any man to have these graces? True, he might be required, under civil penalties, to profess to have them, but having them is not possession, in spiritual force, any more than in temporal things.

When a man professes possession of temporal things, when he does not have it, we call him a fraud; we call him a liar. Dare any one be fraudulent when he professes spiritual riches he does not possess? Certainly not; and against each the Lord says, "Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven." And shall not those who by the civil law are pushed into a pretending faith, suffer a like righteous retribution?

It was Madison who said that politics and religion both exist in greater purity when kept separate. But as far as the Christian religion is concerned, he might have said that it can exist at all only as it is separate from all entanglement with civil power. Being born of entanglement with a dominant, "a living union with a living Saviour," is no more in its possibilities between any civil government and Christianity direct, since, which in any degree united to a civil government.

When such union comes in, Christianity goes out. Christianity is the life of Jesus Christ reproduced in the hearts of men by the power of the Divine Spirit, and it is as impossible to unite it with civil government as to unite oil and water or to combine fire with the ether that fills all space. The things are totally diverse. The one is of the earth earthly, the other is spiritual, and is from heaven.

The Lord himself, plainly pointed out this truth when he contrasted the Roman Empire (here let us say the Roman Cæsar) and had that distinction been regarded by his so-called followers, and had the Church remained true to her Lord as the bride is to remain true to the bridegroom, the kingdoms of this earth, the kingdoms of the world, instead of its name only, "the kingdoms of heaven."

C. P. B.
