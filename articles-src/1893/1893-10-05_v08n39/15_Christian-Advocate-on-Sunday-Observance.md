THE CHRISTIAN Advocate thinks that the cause of Sunday observance has derived about the same profit from the opening of the World's Fair "as the cause of temperance derives advantage from the shameless conduct of a drunken woman or the yells of a crew of bacchanalians." Just how this is we cannot say, but it is certain that the Sunday cause has also received great damage from the agitation in regard to the Fair, for never before in the history of the world have people so very generally had brought to their attention the fact that Sunday is not the Sabbath, and that there is no divine command for its observance. The agitation has certainly done much for the cause of truth.
