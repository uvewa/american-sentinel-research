THE Catholics never tire of boasting of how they established religious liberty in Maryland. The fact is that they had to do it in order to secure liberty for themselves. England was at that time Episcopal, not Papal; and in providing for liberty of conscience in Maryland, the second Lord Baltimore, himself a Papist, simply secured the colony against the otherwise probable establishment of the Church of England, or of Presbyterianism. Indeed the greater part of the Maryland colonists were Presbyterians, and not Papists; and as Presbyterianism was at that time striving for political ascendancy in England, and was already the established religion of Scotland, a guarantee of religious liberty was on the part of Lord Baltimore only a measure of self-defense.
