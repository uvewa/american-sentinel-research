THE English papers have reproduced the token prohibiting Jews to change their names under penalty of law, short stopping them from the land. This requires a few words of comment.

The persecution of the Russian Jews, having nothing to do with any international deliberation, in the eyes of the student, the law by rule and with considerable ingenuity, in each acts, which would be considered criminal in any country, there is a special provision in the new law, and the Jews were put in this respect, in an even still more unfavorable position.

The new law does not refer only to the changes of family names, which might in themselves, if misused, give rise to legal regulations, although the sons of the ancient Hebrew race ought not to take it wishing in wholeness, each pupil having the right of his forefathers to find the same name under which he chooses to pursue it.

The token in question is directed against the changes in the spelling of what already points to our Christian nature. The names the apparent, therefore, quite whimsical, changed so that they shall appear to understand how deplorably mean it is. The case of Yiddish, which is a corrupt German dialect, Slavonic, which will conform with an admixture of still more corrupted Polish and Russian words, has introduced a corruption of the Biblical and ancient names. Instead of the ancient David, Abrahams, Salomons, and Moses, the Russian Jews get a sort of corrupted nicknames which sound ridiculous to the ears of a Christian population.

The new abuse is directed against the character of those emanations which lend themselves so easily to the vulgar taste for cruelty. It is, therefore, a worthy consideration that Jews are more compelled to submit to the new naming of their persons. Yet we are informed that the Jewish press as a whole has taken it as a memorandum upon the degradation of Jews of their iniquities by allowed himself to use the word "mediæval" with reference to the present treatment of the Jews in Russia."
