THE Christian Advocate thinks that the cause of Sunday observance has derived about the most possible good from the opening of the World's Fair "as the cause of temperance derives advantage from the shameless conduct of a drunken woman or the yells of a crew of bacchanalians." Just how this is we cannot say, but it is certain, that the Sunday cause has also received great damage from the signification in regard to the past; for never before in the history of the world have people so very generally brought to their attention, the fact that Sunday is not the Sabbath, and that there is no divine command for its observance. The agitation has certainly done much for the cause of truth.
