## Object of the Sabbath.

"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work; . . . for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." Ex. 20:8-11.

"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it, because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made." Gen. 2:3.

"And hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God." Eze. 20:20. "Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them." Verse 12.

All this is spoken of the seventh day of the week, and of no other; for "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Therefore the seventh-day Sabbath—the only Sabbath—was given that men might know God and his sanctifying power. God is known through his works (Rom. 1:20) and it is through his creative power that men are freed from sin. See Ps. 51:10: Eph. 2:20. So the Sabbath, as the memorial of creation, is the means through which a perfect, saving knowledge of God is obtained. But God is known only through Christ, for all the works of God are wrought in him.

Now the question is, Since God sanctified the seventh day for this purpose, is it possible that the same object can be gained by another day, upon which he did not rest, and which he never blessed nor sanctified? Certainly not; to say that it can, is to impugn the wisdom of God in sanctifying the definite seventh day in the beginning.

We have already seen that the Sabbath pertains to what is called the "Christian Dispensation." There is more evidence still. Who created all things? It was Christ, through whose blood we have redemption. See John 1:1-3; Col. 1:13-17. It is he also "who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption." 1 Cor. 1:30. He, then, is the sanctifying power of God, for he is the power of God. Now the Sabbath was given that we might know God who sanctifies us. Therefore the Sabbath was given for the purpose of revealing Christ to us as the Saviour of sinners.

The gospel is the power of God unto salvation. Rom. 1:16. The power of God is known by the things that are made. Verse 20. The Sabbath is for the purpose of directing our thoughts to the things that God has made, so that through them we may know his power to save; for redemption is creation.

In the resurrection of Christ the power of God is shown. Paul's prayer was that we might know the "exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead." Eph. 1:19, 20. But God's power is one, and ever the same, and it is seen in the things that he has made. Therefore it was creative power that raised Christ from the dead. We are sanctified through living faith in the death and resurrection of Christ, which, as we have seen, were accomplished from the foundation of the world. But the Sabbath makes known the sanctifying power of God; therefore the Sabbath is the reminder of the power of the resurrection as well as of the power of creation.

"What is the chaff to the wheat?" Men cannot sanctify a Sabbath. They can make nothing holy. The customs of the people are vain. Custom decides nothing. True, the Sunday has been nominally observed more or less for fifteen hundred years, but that proves nothing. God's name has been blasphemed, and the sun and other objects have been worshiped instead of him for nearly four times as many years; but that does not make blasphemy and idolatry right.

It is true also that the Jews rejected Christ, but that was not because they kept the Sabbath. On the contrary, it was because they did not keep it, although they professed to. They rejected Jesus because they did not know him; but if they had kept the Sabbath in the Spirit, and not in outward form merely, they would have known him as the sanctifying power of God.

Not how men have regarded the Sabbath, but who gave it, is what determines its sacredness. God gave the Sabbath day, and the blessing and sanctification which he placed on it can never be removed by any action of men. But the observance of Sunday—"the venerable day of the sun"—was "the wild solar holiday of all pagan times," and as such was adopted by that power which, exalting itself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, thought itself able to change times and laws. Shall we continue to observe it, and thus recognize the authority of the Papacy? or shall we walk in the "old paths," and by keeping the rest-day of the Lord, find the rest from sin, which he alone can give?
