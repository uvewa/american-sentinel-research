"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work; . . . for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."

"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made." Gen. 2:3.

"Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and you, that ye might know that I am the Lord that sanctify you." "And hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God." Rom. 20:12. "Moreover also I gave my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them." Verse 12.

All this is spoken of the seventh day of the week, and of no other; for "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." "Therefore the seventh day Sabbath;" only Sabbaths are given that men might know God and his sanctifying power, is a sign forever (see Ex. 31: Rem. 1:20) and it is through his creative power that he sanctifies. Heb. 2:11; Eph. 2:10. So the Sabbath, as the memorial of creation, is the sign of him whose power, working through men by whose will, sanctifies. See Eze. 20:12. God is of salvation. But God can only sanctify men by giving his Spirit, and they are wrought in him.

Now we ask this, Since God sanctified the seventh day for this purpose, is it possible that the same thing can be said of another day, upon which he did not rest, and which he has not blessed and sanctified? Certainly not; to say that it can, is to impeach the wisdom of the Almighty, who declares the seventh day as his memorial.

The question now arises, What pertains to what is called the "Christian Sabbath," or "The Lord's day," or "The day." Who created all things? It was Christ. See John 1:1-3; Col. 1:15-17; Heb. 1:1, 2. Then it was Christ who rested on the seventh day and sanctified it, the completion of the creation. Then the seventh day is pre-eminently "the Lord's day."

But is there anything in the Scriptures pertaining to what is called the "Christian Sabbath?" Who created all things? It was Christ. John 1:1-3; Col. 1:15-17; Heb. 1:1, 2. He is the manifestation of the invisible God, "for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily," and so he is "made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption." 1 Cor. 1:30. He is the manifestation of God, for he is the power of God. Now the Sabbath is given to make men know God who sanctifies us. Therefore, who knows the Sabbath, knows Christ as revealing Christ as the Saviour of the world.

The gospel is the power of God unto salvation, and since the Sabbath reveals the power of God, and is the sign of God's sanctifying power, he who keeps the Sabbath, keeping it in faith, is the one who is known by the things that are made, concerning the creation testifies as to the greatness of God, therefore the Sabbath is to be the sign of God that has made, or the things that he has made. Now the Sabbath, by the same power, is the sign of his redemption is creation.

The power of the gospel of Christ power that God is shown. Paul's prayer was that men might know "what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead." But God's power to save is the same as the power that raised Christ from the dead, and is set forth in the same thing that he has made, and it is seen that in these things he has made, the power of God is the same power that raised Christ from the dead. It is through this power that men are saved, the death and resurrection of Christ, in which also these acts, were one with his, from the foundation of the world. But since the Sabbath is the sign of this same power of God; therefore the Sabbath is the remainder of the power of the gospel of Christ, the power of God.

What is the chaff to the wheat? Who can make common what God has made holy, since no one but God can make nothing holy. The customs of men cannot substitute for divine law. True, the Sunday has been observed by many for more than a hundred years, but that proves nothing. Many idols have been worshiped, and many idols and other objects have been worshipped instead of him for a longer period; but that proves nothing but the people's apostasy and idolatry right.

Some one will say, "The Jews rejected Christ, but that was not because they kept the Sabbath." On the contrary, it was because they did not keep it, although because they did not keep it, although they professed to do so. It is certain that they did not keep in letter, but if they had kept the Sabbath in the Spirit, and not in outward form merely, they would have known him as the sanctifying power of God. They who have regarded the Sabbath, but who gave it, what determines the sanctifier. God gave the Sabbath, and the blessing and sanctification which he placed in it can never be received by any action of men. But the observance of "Sunday" the venerable day of the sun,—"the wild solar holiday of all pagan," said a more wise observer, who adopted his own power, while the world itself above all that is called God or that is worshipped; for Sunday is his banner, and changes times and laws. Shall we continue under the same delusion? Shall we accept the authority of the Papacy? or shall we walk in the "old paths," and "a keep the rest-day of the Lord, find the rest that he gives to his people?"
