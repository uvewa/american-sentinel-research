## Persecution of Jews and Poles.

The English papers have reproduced the ukase prohibiting Jews to change their names under penalty of fine, short imprisonment, and administrative punishments. This requires a few words of comment.

The change of name here alluded to has nothing to do with any intentions of deluding, in one way or another, the law. For such acts, which would be considered criminal in any country, there is a special provision in the new law, and the Jews are put in this respect on a level with Christians. The new law does not refer even to the change of family names, which might be objected to on the score of passport regulations, although the sons of the priests, for example, are in the habit of doing it wholesale in schools, each pupil having the right of inventing for himself the name under which he chooses to start in life.

The ukase in question is directed against the change in the spelling of what corresponds to our Christian names. The measure appears, therefore, quite whimsical. But some explanation is needed to understand how despicably mean it is. The use of Vidikish, which is a corrupt German with an admixture of still more corrupted Polish and Russian words, has introduced a corruption of the Biblical names as well. Instead of the solemn Davids, Abrahams, Samsons, and Moses, the Russian Jews get a sort of corrupted nicknames which sound ridiculous to the ears of a Christian population.

The new ukase is directed against the changing of these surnames, which lent themselves so easily to the vulgar taste for banter. It is, therefore, a worthy counterpart of the ancient law prescribing to Jews the wearing of some ridiculous article of dress as a badge of their race. Yet we are informed that the Jewish Rabbi of Moscow was exiled because in a memorandum upon the deprivation of Jews of their synagogues, he allowed himself to use the word "medieval" with reference to the present treatment of the Jews in Russia.!
