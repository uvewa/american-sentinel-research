A FEW weeks ago the CATHOLIC REVIEW made this suggestion:—

If every subscriber to a Catholic paper, would, after reading it, send it regularly to a Protestant neighbor, what an immense influence might be brought to bear to make America Catholic.

This the Ave Maria commends as a practical suggestion, as indeed it is. Protestants who are such only in name have no security against the wiles of Rome. An earnest, intelligent propaganda among them by Catholics could not fail to result in the conversion of many to Romanism. Few comparatively are armed against the sophistries of Catholicism by a thorough acquaintance with the principles of Protestantism.
