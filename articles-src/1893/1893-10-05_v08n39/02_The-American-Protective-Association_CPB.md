## The American Protective Association.

The American Protective Association, some mention of which was made in these columns last week, is one of the forces which is making itself felt in this country. It is an anti-Roman Catholic secret society, which originated in Pennsylvania. It spread westward and in some of the western States it undertook to dictate in politics last year.

It is now beginning its operations in New York. The first Buffalo council was organized last March, and now there are 836 members in a number of councils. Isaac Cluff, a Toronto Orangeman, was the organizer and he is still the leading figure in that city. Said he recently to a representative of the press:

We are going to run this city just as the A. P. A. runs Kansas City, Detroit, Saginaw and other cities of the West. We are saying nothing until we have 5,000 members. Then we will show our hands.

Our membership here includes the most prominent men, lawyers, doctors, merchants and even ministers. We propose to fight the Popacy with ballots and if need be with bullets. Look at Ruf Jalo's public schools. Over 80 per cent. of the teachers are Roman Catholics. Inside of two years there will not be one Catholic teacher left. Almost every official and employe of the municipality and corporation of Detroit was a few years ago a Catholic; now there are only two left in the city's employ.

Look at the army of Roman Catholics about the Buffalo City Hall. Within two years every department down there will be Protestantized. In New York State there will be a great turn over, and we are getting ready to leave every Catholic at home.

Look at our army and navy being run entirely by Catholics, for some day I suppose they hope to use it. We think we can Protestantize the army and navy but granted for arguments sake that Catholicism retains its grip on these two important branches of the service, then we have plenty of men who can bear the musket.

Speaking of this association, the New York World says:

Its intention is to revive the old Know-Nothing agitation which led to so much bitterness and bloodshed during the fifties. Irish-Americans are the special objects of its hatred, but it proposes to disfranchise all Roman Catholics, at least to the extent of preventing them from holding office.

Nothing could be more opposed to the spirit of the American democracy than the establishment of a State religion.

It is the right of every man in this country to adhere to any religion he pleases as long as he does not make it a part of his religion to commit crime. Except for that single qualification religious liberty is absolute, and it is of the most vital importance that it should be maintained.

No man must be kept out of office in the United States because he is a Roman Catholic, or a Presbyterian, or a Methodist, or a heathen. As long as a man's religion does not interfere with the rights of the community, it is not the business of the community and it must not be interfered with.

The A. P. A. is a conspiracy against the public welfare, and those who are pushing it are moved by the same spirit which caused the massacre of St. Bartholomew; which moved Calvin to burn Servetus; which animated Claverhouse when he was riding down and butchering the Scotch Covenanters.

This is the nineteenth century. The twentieth century is almost here. We will not go back to the Dark Ages. Religious liberty must and shall be maintained in America.

The Mail and Express of September 23, also has something on this subject:

The attorney-general of Kansas has rendered an opinion to the effect that the Secretary of State cannot issue a charter to the American Protective Association, because, as he says, it seeks to abridge the religious rights of some citizens. This association is an anti-Catholic organization of recent and sudden growth. It has become very strong in several States, notably Ohio, where it has obtained exclusive control of the government of Toledo, and has made advances in Columbus and Cleveland. Two years ago the association carried the city election in Omaha, Neb. Its ticket was divided between Republicans and Democrats, the latter preponderating. Another election is shortly to be held in the same city and the association, which is fully as strong as it was then, is repealing its tactics of two years ago. In Kansas City there is a state of war between the association and its opponents, and last night for the third time a fight occurred between them. The association has secured a foothold in this State, notably in Buffalo. Its platform for New York is summarized as follows:

- Protection of the free public school.
- Objection to State aid to sectarian institutions.
- Restriction of immigration.
- Uniform naturalization laws for every State, with extension of terms of probation.
- In choosing public officials preference given to those who are independent of foreign, temporal and ecclesiastical control.
- Taxation of Church property.
- The opening of all private and parochial schools, convents and monasteries to public official inspection.

It is not difficult to understand how this association is destined to make a stir in this country. Several of its objects are commendable, but when it proposes to set up a religious test for civil office it is treading on dangerous ground. Whatever may be the merit of the arguments by which such a course is justified, it is pretty sure to stir up "bad blood" in the shape of religious prejudices, and may result, as did the Know-Nothing agitation, in bloodshed. The student of the signs of the times will watch the development of this association with interest, but will stand aloof from it. God's work in the earth is not done through political parties, either secret or otherwise. The Christian's duty is to teach the gospel, not to engage in political contests.
