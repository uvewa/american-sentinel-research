# Is it An Alliance?

Upon the surface, the brotherhood of religions at Chicago presents a pleasing appearance. It is going down into history as an evidence of wonderful progress in the achievements of Christianity. It is applauded to the skies by the multitude. The ministers, prelates, bishops and archbishops in their rich apparel were cheered to the echo as they marched to their honorable seats in the august assembly. All this is pleasing to the natural heart. It might be termed sacrilegious by some to question as to whether Christ is in this movement, i. e., in the manner he is supposed to be in it by the multitude.

In Matt. 6:1 we read: "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness [marg.] before men to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward with [marg.] your Father which is in heaven." By this teaching of Jesus it is shown that it is impossible to please the Father by doing anything to appear well before natural man. If the applause of the multitudes (whose minds are still carnal) is obtained, that of itself is proof that the approval of God is not resting upon that thing whatever it may be. "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world, and the world passeth away." 1 John 2:16, 17. Again, "Whosoever will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God." James 4:4.

Another reason may be given why Christ was not among this assembly to bless. While here he was uncompromisingly set against sin, and he rebuked it wherever it appeared even in his loved disciples. In this Congress of Religions it was agreed that no attack should be made upon each other's creed. How cunning! No matter what may have been the deeds of any party there represented in the past all mouths must be closed. Sin cannot be rebuked, therefore Christ and his Spirit is shut out. The apostles fearlessly rebuked sin, and because of this were hated of men.

"Can two walk together except they be agreed?" Amos 3:3. Certainly not. They must agree to walk together or one will get in advance. Can Protestantism and the Papacy walk together? They can if Christ can walk with Belial. True Protestantism can never be agreed, nor form any alliance with, that wicked power upon which rests still the blood of millions of saints. Protestantism still protests, and now it must not only protest against the Papacy, but fallen Protestantism as well, for they are agreeing to walk together hand in hand. Let us see what this means.

Jesus said of the Jewish nation who had the Word of God, that because they knew not the day of their visitation, and went on blindly, while they might have known what they were doing, imbruing their hands in the blood of the Son of God, that in that act they brought upon themselves all the righteous blood from the days of Abel to their generation. Why? Because the history of how God looked upon the slaying of innocent persons was all laid out before them in Holy Writ, and they were without excuse. That same principle holds good to-day. The situation is still more fearful now, as torrents of righteous blood have been shed since Christ uttered those awfully solemn words. A dark history has been made, and by whom? Ah! by that very same power who by peace is to destroy many in the end. The alliance is being formed, and how sad is the scene of the once noble, God-fearing protesters degenerated into such a low spiritual condition as to calmly walk into the subtle snare laid for their feet by this wily power. Where is the record of the papal power repenting in dust and ashes for her wicked crimes when the power of earth was given into her hands by the Lord? It cannot be produced, therefore all those horrible crimes stand registered against this Church of Rome both on earthly and heavenly records.

What are those doing then who unite hands in this enlightened age with this wicked, apostate church, and know not the day of their visitation by the Spirit of the Lord? The answer comes from the principle Christ laid down to the Jews. They bring upon themselves the blood of the millions of Christ's saints, the blood of the apostles and prophets since the commencement of earth's history, and above and beyond all this the precious blood of the Son himself. What a doom? "By peace shall he destroy many." Yes, many! It is not by war, but by subtlety and intrigue the destruction is accomplished. All this results from not studying God's Book and knowing the voice of his Spirit. By his Spirit he is faithfully warning earth's inhabitants of the soon coming destruction from his presence upon the man of sin, but only a few will believe the warning.

It is solemn to die, but it is still more intensely solemn to live at this period when all the ages are so focused and every probationary moment is freighted with such fearful responsibilities.

T. E. BOWEN.
