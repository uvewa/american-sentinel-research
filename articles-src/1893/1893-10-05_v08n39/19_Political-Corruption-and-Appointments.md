THE CATHOLIC Mirror published a statement some weeks ago to the effect that a certain man in the South, namely, Colonel Jessie Sparks, of Murfreesboro, Tenn., was appointed to a Mexican consulship because during Mr. Cleveland's former term in the White House, "the gallant old Confederate officer" sent the President a present of "a couple of fat, juicy, Tennessee opossums, which Grover seemed to heartily relish." We remarked at the time that if this were not a slander on the President it certainly was on the Nation. Now a more serious charge is publicly made by the World, of this city, namely, that the gentleman recently named for the Italian mission was appointed in consideration of $50,000 contributed to the campaign fund at the last presidential election. We trust that neither of these charges is true. The first, if true, might indicate simply a "soft spot" in the make up of our Chief Magistrate; the second would show a decay in our political life but little short of that which marked the last days of Rome, when the highest offices went to the highest bidders, and even the royal dignity was bartered and sold in the most shameless fashion.
