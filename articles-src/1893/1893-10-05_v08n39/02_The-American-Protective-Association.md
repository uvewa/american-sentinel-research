The American Protective Association, concerning which we had something to say in our columns last week, is one of the forces which is making itself felt in this country. It is an anti-Roman Catholic secret society, which originated in, and whose greatest strength is in, the western and central western States it undertook to dictate in politics.

It is now beginning its operations in the eastern cities. The organization was organized last March, and now there are six members in a single county. William Isaac Goff, a Toronto Orangeman, was the organizer and is still the leading figure in that city. Ball is recently to be heard.

Kansas City, Detroit, Saginaw and other cities in Michigan are reported to have 5,000 or 8,000 members.

The right of every man in this country to hold whatever office he is eligible to, and not to make it a part of his religion to exclude citizen from any office is a self-evident proposition, is absolute, and it is of the most vital importance.

The A. P. A. is a conspiracy against the public welfare, and those who are making it are moved by the same spirit which caused the massacre of St. Bartholomew's, which stirred the fury of every Protestant martyr that has gone to his death, and was tearing down and besieging the South Carolina colony in America.
