A CHICAGO dispatch of the 17th inst. says: "The 'small small Sunday crowd' increased by three, being something done to the Fair, but the figures show there are being nothing to see on Sunday."

The dispatch contains thirty-six lines, bold, and even with this fall title of it.

"That 'small small Sunday crowd' " has steadily increased week by week made for grounds; round numbered 112,000 or 6,000, and this with an attendance unlike the Art Building and the Midway Plaisance only. Thus the Christian Statesman calls "preserving the American Sabbath?" The average "small small Sunday crowd" numbered more than 61,000. September 24, the crowd was below 57,000; a lovely week end for it.
