It is the boast of the CATHOLIC REVIEW that "the Church in New England has increased during the past quarter of a century not only by immigration and by the full natural increase in the Catholic population, but also by making converts of Protestants."

According to the Review, the Catholic Church in New England "counts to-day among its members descendants of the bitterest Puritans, the most Dutch of the New Netherlanders, and the most rigid of the Church of England men of a century or so ago. If it cared to parade the names of its proselytes, it would furnish the daily press with a sensation that would retain the public interest for much more than nine days."
