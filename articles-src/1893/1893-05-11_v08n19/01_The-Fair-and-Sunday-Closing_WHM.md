From the beginning the total question involved in the movement for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair has been a religious one. Only a small and uninfluential minority has stated and defended the principle which applies to the matter, and attention to it has been studiously avoided by all in authority.

The utter failure to comprehend what is at stake in this is an example of the pervasive governmental folly and mental infirmity, not equaled since the days before Christ, to call the nation Israel into court to refuse Christian men testify before them and convict him because he did not meet their mistaken expectations. The Supreme Court affirms that this is a Christian Nation, and the congressional legislation to enforce religious ceremonial, is the nineteenth century expression of the same fatal error of the temporal rule of Christ.

Christ's kingdom upon earth does not come by means of law or force of arms. That which is religious feeling, for such means is antichrist. Does not the whole world know this? Such is the truth it should know it, or have had the opportunity to learn, will have the opportunity; and if they do not acknowledge it to be so it will be because they themselves are not Christ's but belong of those who

THE SENTINEL has said months ago that in all probability it would not be definitely known whether the Exposition was to be closed on Sundays or not until the Fair was already in progress, and that meanwhile it would be regarded with a mighty interest, the significance of the attitude as to Sunday observance would not only complicate but increase. This has proved to be true. Since Congress, although having irrevocably committed itself to a religious precedent, no one who looked at the matter in the proper light has taken any interest in the question as to whether the Fair shall in really be open or closed on Sunday, except as being concerned what the course should be taken which would most closely adhere to the greatest number of citizens the legislative error which has been committed, and awaken the conscience of the greatest number to the realization of the fact that that allegation to religious things is for God and not for man.

The discussion of this question, irrespective of the Sunday closing or opening of the Fair gates, and the feeling upon it, will grow more and more intense as time goes on. New phases of this and allied questions, which no one can now foresee, will develop from time to time. An instance of this has already occurred in the movement of the workingmen to rest and attend the Fair on the seventh day, and begin their week of labor on the first day according to biblical time. The expression of opinions, and prejudices, and impulses and ignorance, which this has called forth from many of the clergy is of the highest also, suggestive, startling! What spirits are abroad in this land!

One notable thing is the statement made when told of this purpose of the Central Labor Union, said, "The Union is in earnest in their trip. Then we will see if there is any law in this country." How thoroughly in the line and of popular sentiment! But, has that false assumption of charitable interest in workingmen, and their days but poorly burned away, in gardens, parks, and museums to which an admission is asked, elsewhere throughout the country. Exactly the same principle applies and should govern in all these cases the smallest to the greatest.

The fierce light of this blaze of actual feeling not even a trace is to be seen of disinterested anxiety for the defense and protection of the workingman. The dragon can not always masquerade under the similitude of the lamb. He roars what sometimes betray it.

The haughty silence of this Chicago clergyman is only equaled by the arrogant exclusion of another who says of the canons of the unconstitutional proceedings, "Congress didn't dare to do anything else." Congress that did do anything else otherwise than order the Fair Closed. Sentinel is the first time that this same thing has been said. Do congressmen hear? Do congressmen read? Are they pleased to have it heralded from pulpit, and parsonage, and church steeple, that at the command of a faction they were coerced, violated the Constitution and sold the birthright of the Nation for a mess of pottage? When a legislative body is so thoroughly subjugated that the masters have no hesitancy in publishing the fact; when preachers that the boast will ultimate organize the legislation and without thought for the feelings, or the reputation of those legislators upon whose notice they are treading, then the enslavement of the law-making power is as complete as it is disgraceful.

BUT workingmen do not press as deeds quite as strongly as words. It might be learned from the Sunday theologians themselves that the Sabbath does not pertain to any particular day, and applying the whole force of their batteries to the use of their own authority no more so as to assure laborers in Sunday than any other day of the six. No divine law makes it holy. If it has ever rested with man to make choice of a rest day, the right to so confine to him as much as in any other man, or body of men, living now or that ever did live. He will then put his right to Sunday rest, his own right. On the Sunday theologians' own ground it is now his day. He knows that legislative authority may provide holidays upon which he may not rest if he chooses, but he knows just as well that no human authority can properly rest on any day he shall not choose, any more than on any day he shall work. He knows by virtue of his citizenship in the

fully exercise this authority. He knows that the only Sabbath's law is the Divine law and proclaimed itself in possession of the Sabbath, and if he accepts the word of his pastors and masters that this is not binding, and is abrogated, he has conceded a greater authority over him than God, and prostrated himself before them as a despot; and by so doing have turned him to himself and the earth. American workingmen are not likely to deify any of their fellow citizens and bow down divine honor, just yet. Therefore do not respect the divine law worship they know has never been repealed, how can they be expected to respect a human act which human law can so easily possibly may prohibit arbitrary and properly no human authority can properly forbid. And while forbidden they certainly only pay regard to the law which is recognized as being in contravention of the divine. This the workingmen from the Sunday or the Protestant preachers, and it is irritating to them by the words of the learned leaders of the Roman Catholic Church, who tell them there is no command in the Bible which directs the observance of Sunday.

In Roman Catholic theology and in fact that Sunday is a Christian institution transferred to it from the Jewish Sabbath; it was not instituted either by Christ or by the apostles; it is in the fourth commandment, nor was it ordered by the Church, nor was it regarded, that the observance of Sunday in order to give the Christians a day of rest from their cares, and regard recognizing it as a good thing the church in its resources altogether made up. At the Reformation the Protestants carried it with them as a legacy from the papal observance of the Sunday dogma by reasons no law "of a previous departure from their own principles with which were inconsistency." Has it come to this, that Protestant workingmen must be taught by a Roman Catholic priesthood to learn not that which pertains to their own religious liberty.
