THAT California has had no Sunday law has long been the wailing cry of the National Reformers and kindred spirits, in this Sunday law agitation. And while it can not yet be said that that State has an out and out Sunday law now, yet it is so very near akin to it that it is equivalent to the same thing. During the last session of their legislature the following act was passed:—

An act to provide for a day of rest from labor.

Approved Feb. 27, 1895.

The people of the State of California, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:

SECTION 1. Every person employed in any occupation of labor shall be entitled to one day's rest therefrom in seven; and it shall be unlawful for any employer of labor to cause his employee, or any of them, to work more than six days in seven; provided, however, that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any case of emergency.

SEC. 2. For the purposes of this act, the term day's rest shall mean and apply to all cases, whether the employe is engaged by the day, week, month, or year, and whether the work performed is done in the day or night time.

SEC. 3. Any person violating the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.

SEC. 4. This act shall take effect and be in force thirty days from and after its passage.

When the foregoing act was introduced a number of the papers said it would not amount to anything; others that were a little more sagacious said that it was only the first step in the direction of a stringent Sunday law. But since the foregoing was passed and approved, several succeeding steps have been taken. The following amendment to the "Civil Code" of California was passed and approved March 23:—

An Act to amend section seven of the Civil Code of the State of California, relating to legal holidays and non-judicial days.

The People of the State of California, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:

SECTION 1. Section seven of the Civil Code is hereby amended so as to read as follows:

7. Holidays, within the meaning of this code, are every Sunday, the first day of January, the twenty-second day of February, the thirtieth day of May, the fourth day of July, the ninth day of September, the first Monday of October, the twenty-fifth day of December, every day on which an election is held throughout the State, and every day appointed by the President of the United States or by the governor of the State for a public fast, thanksgiving or holiday. If the first day of January, the twenty-second day of February, the thirtieth day of May, the fourth day of July, the ninth day of September, or the twenty-fifth day of December shall fall upon a Sunday, the Monday following is a holiday.

The same amendment was made to the "Political Code," and also approved March 23. Not being satisfied with their efforts in the direction of Sunday laws, and evidently desiring to make a clean sweep while they were at it, they amended the "Code of Civil Procedure" by adding the paragraph last above quoted, and in addition they added another section to read as follows:—

SEC. 2. Section one hundred and thirty-four of the Code of Civil Procedure is hereby amended so as to read as follows:

134. No court shall be open, nor shall any judicial business be transacted, on Sunday, on the first day of January, on the twenty-second day of February, on the thirtieth day of May, on the fourth-day of July, on the ninth day of September, on the first Monday of October, on the twenty-fifth day of December, or a day upon which an election is held throughout the State, or on a day appointed by the President of the United States, or by the governor of this State, for a public fast, thanksgiving, or holiday, except for the following purposes:

1. To give, upon their request, instructions to a jury when deliberating on their verdict.

2. To receive a verdict or discharge a jury.

3. For the exercise of the powers of a magistrate in a criminal action, or in a proceeding of a criminal nature; provided, that the Supreme Court and the superior courts shall always be open for the transaction of business; and provided further, that injunctions and writs of prohibition may be issued and served on any day.

The first measure seemed like quite a tame affair; one day's rest in seven was all that was asked for; but having secured this, they immediately set about the work of deciding which day that one day in seven should be, by placing Sunday among the holidays of the State. A great deal of work has been done in California in favor of religious freedom; and it was hoped that these Sunday laws, which are a relic of the Church and State regime of the Middle Ages, were entirely swept from their statutes. Many had the hope that California would keep itself clear in this matter; but the people of the United States should be awake to the fact that we are on the verge of a revolution backward into the ecclesiastical despotism of four or five centuries ago, when a man was allowed to think, and believe, and act only at the dictates of the representative of a hierarchy. And while some are making great boasts of our rapid advancement, and that the world is getting much better, the careful student of our times, who is acquainted with the history of the past, must see that these efforts to meddle with the rights of conscience, forecast no good. When the Sunday laws that we already have are being used by bigots and fanatics to oppress and persecute those who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week rather than Sunday, it is time for every citizen to raise a protest against enacting any more such intolerant laws.
