THAT California has had no Sunday law is a constant cause of irritation to National Reformers and kindred spirits, in this law-ridden American. And while it can not yet be said that that State has an out and out Sunday law any one of it is so very near akin to it that it is equivalent to the same thing. During the last session of their legislature the following was enacted:

*An act to provide for a day of rest from labor.*

*The people of the State of California, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:*

SECTION 1. Every person employed in any occupation of labor shall be entitled to one day's rest therefrom in every seven, and it shall be unlawful for any employer of labor to cause his employees, or any of them, to work more than six days in seven, during any part of any year: Provided, however, that this act shall not apply to any case of emergency; and provided, further, that this act does not apply to any person who is employed by any employer who does not employ more than five persons; and provided, further, that whatever the employee is engaged by the day, week or month, and whether he has a right to refuse to work.

Sec. 2. Any person violating the provisions of this act shall forfeit to the party aggrieved $50.

Sec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.

When this foregoing act was introduced a number of the people said it would not amount to anything; others that were a little more sanguine said that it was practically the entering wedge of a stringent Sunday law. But since the foregoing was passed and approved, several succeeding steps have been taken. The following amendment to the "Civil Code" of California was passed and approved $22d.

*An Act to amend section seven of the Civil Code of the State of California.*

*The People of the State of California, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:*

SECTION 1. Section seven of the Civil Code is hereby amended so as to read as follows: Section 7. Holidays, within the meaning of this code are every Sunday, the first day of January, the twenty-second day of February, the thirtieth day of May, the fourth day of July, the ninth day of September, the first Monday in September, the twenty-fifth day of December, every day on which an election is held throughout the State, and every day appointed by the President of the United States or by the Governor of this State, for a public fast, thanksgiving or holiday. If the first day of January, the twenty-second day of February, the thirtieth day of May, the fourth day of July, the ninth day of September, or the twenty-fifth day of December, falls upon Sunday, the Monday following is a holiday.

Sec. 2. No amendment was made to the "Political Code," and also approved. No bill has been before either had yet been in effect to the direction of Sunday laws, and evidently only dealing within the State; but while they were at it, they acknowledged quite openly the "Code of Civil Procedures" also, the paragraphs last above quoted, and in these they added another section to the law, to be read as follows:

Sec. 2. Section one hundred and thirty four of the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of California is hereby amended to read as follows:

134. If the day, or the last day, for doing any act provided herein, or by law, falls on a holiday, such act may be done on the next business day, with the same effect as if done on the day appointed; but this section shall not apply to the doing of any act, or the issuing of any legal process or paper, before a police magistrate or in a justice's court, or the giving or issuing of notices as to matters in the courts of justice.

"I give, upon their request, instructions too burdensome to be described or omitted."

1. For the exercise of the powers of a magistrate or judicial officer, as distinguished from a ministerial officer.

2. For carrying the judgment into effect, when the superior courts shall always be open for the transaction of judicial business, and all ministerial acts and writs of probation may be issued on holidays.

The first money seemed very like quite a start; one day's rest in seven; but in seven it was all that was asked for; but hearing secured a start, they immediately set about the work of getting a full observance of Sunday. They should be, by placing Sunday observance with all recognized holidays.

Considerable comment is being made, and a deal of work has been done in California and especially in San Francisco. It is to be hoped that these Sunday laws, which are a relic of the Church-and-State rule of the Middle Ages, were entirely swept from their statutes. Many had the hope that California would keep itself clear of this matter; but the people of the United States, and the people of California likewise, are on the verge of a revolution backward toward the ecclesiastical rule of the State of five centuries ago, when a man was allowed to think, and believe, and act only at the dictation of the representatives of a hierarchy. And while some are making great boasts of our civil rights and advantages, and that the world is getting ahead of all times, the careful student of our times, is acquainted with the history of the past, must see that those efforts to meddle with the rights of conscience, foretell no good. Liberty, truth and justice, and human liberty are being used by bigots and fanatics to oppress and persecute those who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week rather than Sunday, it is time for every citizen to raise a protest against such bigotry.

A. O. TAIT.
