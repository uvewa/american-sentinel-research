In his "Notes on Virginia," Thomas Jefferson says: "Besides, the spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may commence persecuter, and better men be his victims. If the people, he says, 'They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will forget themselves in the sole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights. The shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, for our rights shall verge or estimate nothing.'"

Was this spoken by inspiration? Certainly the spirit of the times has altered. The spirit of the times has altered. Our rulers, our legislators, have become corrupt, the people careless; and through the Nation, the rights of the people are being openly infringed upon by a party—a religious hierarchy. The position of Thomas Jefferson was to establish that they were forever secured to them. The shackles of making money. There were shackles that were not knocked off at that time; and these are now not thrown off but growing heavier and heavier and heavier. And now will the people ever avail of their rights to throw off these shackles; or will they let them stay and they sleep on till these rights shall expire by usurpation?

A correspondent truly says: "That this day constitute a sort of Church and State; the constitution of the church is to the State and National government, and the army and navy is exemption of Church property from taxation; and in religious faith laws that are found upon the statute books of almost every State in the Union; and the National Sunday laws, are becoming a fetter to the people. And now that Congress has given a more definite status and shape to the forces that are organized to make religion or an easier heavier and heavier under the spirit of national legislation."

These questions of constitutional interpretation and the precedent shall fight the rights of every State in the Union. The reader is inclined to say that this concern be, we only yet to consider the ever-increasing demands for religious legislation, the persecution of seventh-day observers in Arkansas; the noted case of King, in Tennessee, who was hounded to his death by his religious persecutors and the more recent cases in the same State of Adventist farmers who have been doomed to the chaingang for following

their own convictions of conscience in matters of religion. I refer to the constitution of the township of Pennsylvania, and the effort of the churches of the State the past winter to secure more stringent legislation, and the effort of the State to proceed to enact Sabbath-breaking. I refer to a bill introduced into the State legislators only a few weeks made to make Sabbath-breaking a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $100 or ninety days imprisonment or both. And this bill received a recommendation of its passage by the committee to whom it was referred, under an amendment reducing the fine one half. What do all these things portend?—*Argus, Minneapolis, March 20, 1893.*
