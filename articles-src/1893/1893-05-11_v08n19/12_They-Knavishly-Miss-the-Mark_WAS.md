The churches in Michigan are just now stirred over a proposed bill for the taxation of the Church property in the State. At a hearing this week in Lansing, a large number of clergymen appeared in opposition to the measure. The gentleman who made the leading speech, Dr. Radcliffe, said, "We will render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's," and turning to the legislators, "You render unto God the things that are God's." This was rather an unfortunate reference, for the text misused was spoken by Christ, on an occasion when the Jews tried to entangle him, hoping he would declare himself exempt from tribute intending thereupon to charge him with disloyalty to Caesar. But they failed and the Head of the Church laid down the principle that his Church is not exempt from the duty to pay tribute to the civil power which exists as the ordinance of God to preserve civil order.

This text used to be similarly misused in the days of the agitation against the church tax, levied in England upon dissenters as well as churchmen, for the support of the State Church. In those days when the newspaper had not come within the reach of the poorer people, the political ballad singer was a power in the land and the verse writer wielded about as much influence as the newspaper editor. One of these versifiers, Ebenezer Elliot, the poet of the Anti-Corn Law movement, thus pointed out the bad logic in the current use of the text:—

> When palaced paupers, sneering, beard the town,
> They preach the church tex in a text like this—
> No text more plain—"To Caesar give his own!"
> Ah, serviles, knavishly the mark they miss,
> And give to Caesar ours—not there, nor his!

Why should not a believer in a religion be willing to pay all that his exercise of that religion involves, if it is worth anything to him, whether it be his share in the support of his pastor, or his share of the taxes on the building in which he worships which receives the same care and protection from fire or other injury that any other piece of property does. In the time referred to in England a direct tax was levied to support the Church; but would it really make any difference to a man who does not believe in the religion in which I believe, whether he is levied upon by direct tax to support the church in which I worship, or whether he is made to contribute to it indirectly by the exemption of the property from taxation? Not if he is a logical, thinking kind of a man.

W. A. SPICER.
