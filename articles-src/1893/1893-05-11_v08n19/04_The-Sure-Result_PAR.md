ALL morals and the moral law belong to God. The ten commandments, or the moral law, seek to direct not only the actions but the thoughts of men. The moral law reveals the character of God, God only knows the heart. He alone can rule morally.

Civility and the civil law belong to man. Civil rulers should seek only to direct the actions of men in a civil manner. Civil rulers can not know the heart of man, and therefore can not rule morally, and should never seek to control conduct toward God. Hence, God says to man, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's." Both thoughts and actions stand before the Most High for judgment. But only the overt act of incivility can the civil rulers hope to control. A man can not surrender his personal rights to civil law or society. They are the basis of all civil law and inalienable. Civil law begins only when personal rights are assailed. Whenever civil rulers break over the civil boundary line, civility becomes uncivil. When civil rulers legislate upon man's duty to God, civil law becomes uncivil, and they that obey such laws and persecute under them are no longer civilians but villains in society; civil rule is broken; terror and anarchy prevail; life and property are unsafe; liberty and happiness are gone. This has always been and always will be the sure result.

Nebuchadneszar, King of Babylon, in his pride assumed to put himself in the place of God and command his subjects to worship an image contrary to the moral law and personal rights, and beyond his right of authority as a civil ruler. He had a perfect right to rule his people in a civil manner but when he assumed to dictate in matters of worship then his right to rule was taken away, and he driven to the beasts of the field, there to learn that God rules in morals. Again, Ahasuerus, King of Media and Persia, in his delight to honor his favorites and hearken unto their petitions, transcended his civil powers and bade his people bow, and reverence Haman, the wicked prince. The sure result followed this,—thousands of lives, liberty and happiness, were lost before the civil power was restored. Again, Darius became the ruler, and, partaking of the vacillating traits of Ahasuerus, his father, not being instructed by his faults as a civil ruler, made the same fatal blunder of dictation in matters of worship, together with the governor, princes, counselors, captains and the chief men of his kingdom, and the lions' den proved them guilty. Thus the sure result followed quickly upon civil rulers forming a confederacy upon a religious question,—a union of Church and State. Again, "The sublimest incarnation of power and a monument the mightiest of greatness built by human hands which has, upon this planet, been suffered to appear" was the Roman Empire. Proud of her conquests and exceeding jealous of her claims she sat mistress of the world and asserted the right to rule in all things human or divine.

> The idea of the State was the highest idea of ethics; and within that was included all actual realization of the highest good. Hence the development of all other good pertaining to humanity was made dependent upon this.—Neander.

> Worship the gods in all respects according to the laws of your country and compel all others to do the same. But hate and punish those who would introduce anything whatever alien to our customs in this particular.—Gibbon.

This was a close union of Church and State in the Roman law. The highest idea of good to the Roman mind was to worship according to the civil law. Hate and punish those who would dare refuse. This clearly shows to us how that mighty empire brought upon the world the most gloomy period, known in history as the Dark Ages, in the which the lives of over fifty thousand martyrs declare unto us the destructive power hid away in a union of Church and State. This blood declares unto us that the civil power can not have anything to do with religion. This blood declares unto us that the Church can not govern the civil power. This blood declares unto us that the civil power is ordered of God, and when civil governments usurp the prerogative of God he gives them over to the hands of Satan for destruction. Thus the Babylonian, the Medo-Persian, and the Roman Governments became self-destructive by the self-same cause, i. e. civil rulers putting themselves in the place of God and dictating worship. Notwithstanding all these facts of history, and the First Amendment to the Constitution pointing out the causation and forbidding a repetition in our Government, the President of these United States, instead of his veto, deliberately put his zeal to a declaration of Congress saying the first day of the week is the Sabbath day, contrary to the voice of God from Mount Sinai, in thunder, saying, "The Seventh day is the Sabbath." The union of Church and State is confirmed in the United States since Aug. 3, 1892. The test is upon the people. "Choose ye this day whom you will serve."
