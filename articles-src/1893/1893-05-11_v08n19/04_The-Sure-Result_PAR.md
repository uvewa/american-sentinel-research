ALL morals and the moral law belong to God. The civil power exists to enforce the moral law, and to direct and only the one that reveals the character of God. God only knows how to direct men in right moral paths, therefore his revealed law rules over all.

Civility and the civil law belong to man. Civil rulers only know how to direct the actions of men in a civil manner in their dealings with their fellow-men, and therefore can not rule morally; but civility includes the duty of each one in conduct toward God. Hence, God says to man: "Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's and unto God the things that are God's." Both Testaments declare that man's duty: Both Testaments actions stand before the Most High for judgment, and duty in both of them inevitably can the civil rulers hope to cope with the problems of morality. And the natural rights of the civil law or society, the natural law of civil law and justice, cannot be twisted from this purpose, or civil rights are assailed. Whenever civil governments presume to enter the realm of morality, liberty of the citizen becomes impossible. Whenever civil rights become insecure. When civil law becomes unjust, and they that made it are no longer citizens but villains in the sight of those they have wronged and naturely prevails; life and property are unsafe. This is the testimony of all history. This law has been and always will be the same.

In the time of Nebuchadnezzar, when his pride assumed to put himself in the place of God and direct men in morals, he became through this ambition to worship an image contrary to their consciences. Thus in that event the king, of the first right of authority as a civil ruler. He could not compel any man to serve God's cause or character but when he assumed the right to direct a man in morals, and a man's right to rise was taken away, and he lost the right of authority as a civil ruler. And that God rules in morals, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Media and Persia, made a decree into which certain ambitious men incorporated their evil ambitions, and then made into their petitions, transcribed those in the established law of the Medes and reverence Haman, the wicked prince. Then those who lived according to the law of their consciences and the higher law of lives, liberty and happiness were just as soon placed under a sentence of death. Again, Darius became the ruler, and, through the ambitions and manipulation of wicked men, he was led to decree that in matters of worship, together with the prayers of the heart, should be directed to him, and the chief men of his kingdom, and all power and rulership of his land. And the sure result followed quickly upon civil rulers forming a confederacy upon a religious question,—a union of Church and State.

The elevation of Constantine to a position of power and a moment the disposition of premiums built by human hands, in opposition to the faith of others, seemed to appear, was the Roman ruler, jealous of her claim she sat matters

of the world and asserted the right to rule in all things human or divine.

The rise of the State as the highest idea of the organization, or management, or realization of the highest good. Hence the great problem of human government, as history deals with it, was what kind of control we made dependent upon this—Monarchy.

The Church or the State or both combined into the one, should be the supreme ruler of the State. Rule and punish those who would not submit; and especially rule and punish those who would dare refuse. History shows us that all those ancient empires brought upon the world the most profound sorrow, both in the darkest of the Dark Ages, in which the lives of over five hundred martyrs before order, or management came the power held away in a union of Church and State. That which taught us that the civil power can not have anything to do with morals. This blood declares unto us that the Church can not govern the civil power. This blood shows us that the civil power is in the orders of God, and the civil power, governed in the orders of moral matters, gives them over to the hands of Satan and from the Medo-Persian, and the Medo-Persian, and the Roman Governments, in every case, from the smallest rise to the great self-same cause, i.e. civil rulers putting themselves in the place of God and legislating morals. Notwithstanding. All these facts of sacred and secular history, the Amendment to the Constitution pointing out the exactness and establishing apart from the form of Government, the United States of America, failed to recognize, the voice of the people, the voice of Congress saying the first day of the voice of God from Mount Sinai, is things saying, "the Church of God and the Sabbath." Thus Church and State as confirmed in the United States since Aug. 5, 1892. The test is upon us the precedent has been set the future will show.
