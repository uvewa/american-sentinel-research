THE CHICAGO HERALD RECORDS the fact that a considerable number of theological students from the institutions near Chicago, and young ministers with suburban charges, have been enrolled as guards at the World's Fair, and quotes the police captain who enrolled them as saying that, "Several of them, in fact nearly all of them, asked to make it a provision that they be relieved from duty on the seventh day." It would be interesting to know whether this was the actual request of this ministerial police or not.
