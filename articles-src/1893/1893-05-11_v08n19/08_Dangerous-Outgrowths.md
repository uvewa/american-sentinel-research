THE newspaper report that in South Carolina a young woman has been excommunicated from a Baptist Church because her engagement to a telephone company requiring her to render telephone service on Sunday, and that in Pittsburgh, the business manager of a daily paper has been fined for publishing a Sunday edition. A few weeks a Sabbath keeper in Tennessee was fined by the courts for working on his farm on Sunday; in failing himself compelled by his conscience to observe the seventh day instead of the first day of the week. This is a most monstrous and glaring ignored of the function of law in the interest of the people, of the law's function is not to compel righteousness, but to protect rights.

It is true that the fourth commandment forbade any manner of work; and that under this law a man was put to death for gathering sticks upon the Sabbath day. But the Israelites had just been released from slavery, and their condition had been one of contrariness and rebellion and. The Sabbath day of rest was given them as a blessing and not as a curse. It was given not in order that all might possess the blessings of liberty; they could not be coerced, with vigorous regulations, and enforce them with severe penalties. And as a community in camp, essentially an army of the march of the day of rest. It was for Israel in the Wilderness—a strictness of rule required in which in a community settled in homes would be unsuitable.

But even in the Wilderness conditions let go, equally, merely a day of rest from toil, constituted rest applied to the great, continually respected, in Israel the seventh day.

Christ did not abolish the day; nor modify its character, as to give it a new and false interpretation. He furnished it with his disciples on the Sabbath, constant work, he did heal the every day; he reproved his disciples as they gathered the wheat and ate in the way through the grain through the wheat-field, and went on to a limited guard to a distant part of country to the right use of the Sabbath in its true spirit, to be preserved and cherished for man, not for God. "The Sabbath"—

*This is the day the Lord hath made.*

*This is the day of the Lord:* God given and six days in which we were to earn living; he set apart one day in which he serves and causes also as to remind our hearts during the next six days. The Sabbath is a man's day, and has a right to the protection; a right, too, to share the privileges of both State and Church for this day he has a right to be left free to use it according to his own judgement and conscience, subject only to the equal rights of others. Something free with the rights of others. Something

might be said of a State which fined a farmer who called on his farm hands to work on the Sabbath, or for a church which excommunicated its members for an offence against the authority of the church, a telephone company who required his employees to work on Sunday; or for a farmer, the Sabbath. But to fine a farmer for nothing, or to fine a man for a fact, or excommunicate a young woman for being the medium for the transmission of telephone messages for such as wish to send them, is to contravene the spirit of Christian liberty and misinterpret the legitimate function of both State and Church. Whether it is legitimate to give the land or operate a business on Sunday are questions we do not undertake to decide; but as long as such operations are carried on in the community, and are regulated by law in the past of others, neither State nor Church has any right to complain.
