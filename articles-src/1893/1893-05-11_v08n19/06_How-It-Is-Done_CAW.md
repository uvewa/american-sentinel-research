AMONG the convention jottings in the Christian Statesman of Feb. 25, '93, there is recorded this suggestion:—

> It is a good thing to meet our legislators face to face. They are men of like passions with ourselves, influenced by hopes and fears, and would do much better than they do if good men would aid them by frequent suggestions in person or by letter.

Now this sounds all well enough, and indeed the suggestion rightly followed would doubtless lead to a better condition of things publicly than we now see. Especially would this be true if only good and wise men gave assistance in that direction.

There is however a degree of latitude in the application of these "suggestions" which might more properly be observed with very beneficial results not only to "ourselves" but the Statesman as well and the body politic in particular. This will readily appear from the frank acknowledgment that is made that "ourselves" are subject to "passions" and "influenced by hopes and fears" as well as the legislators. This being true will bear special recognition, and "suggests" the need of more than human wisdom to guide these "passions" and prejudices, if you please, of both the suggestors and the suggested to, else the blind might lead the blind and themselves and the Government fall into the ditch. Which thing has been done in the past and after the manner so ardently advocated by the Statesman.

We have in the same issue some of these "suggestions" of "ourselves" as represented by the speech of Rev. W. J. Robinson before the Judiciary Committee of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on the Sunday Newspaper Bill. After the preliminary amount of adulation of the men addressed he said:—

> We appear before you not to instruct you in your official duties, neither to persuade you to the faithful discharge of them, nor to antagonize you in your convictions of what is right and proper in your official conduct, but to assure you of the sympathy, approval, and support of the great body of your constituency which we represent."

Now if he had no instruction to give relative to official duties, no persuasion to faithfulness and no antagonism as to their convictions of what was right and proper, it would seem that he might better yield the floor to some one else as he had voluntarily confessed that he had no message save the "assurance of sympathy" which he fully expressed in "instructive persuasion" and "antagonism," the very things he had denied his purpose to do.

As to his reasons for appearing before that honorable body he said:—

> And why do we come to you? simply because we have neither the right nor the power.

Since he had stated that his sole purpose was to give "assurance of sympathy," it is somewhat vague as to what this "neither the right nor power" might mean, except we let his own words of "instruction" to the committee represent what he would do did he occupy their places, which is undoubtedly the intention of such language. Having artfully tried to conceal his true purpose under the cloak of "assurance of sympathy," he then followed with such words of "instruction" and "persuasion" as have but few parallels in this Nation. In speaking of the source from which the body addressed had received their authority, he continued:—

> And whence comes this authority to you? From what source have you derived it? Not from your fellow-citizens. But the authority comes from God. And he alone can give to one man the right to lay his hand with controlling authority, or the person, property, and rights, of his fellow-men. You are acting in his name. You are the expounders of his will to your fellow-citizens in the department of their civil relations and conduct.

Now if there was not a goodly amount of "instruction" and intent at "persuasion" in this, and if "ourselves" did not have some purpose of "influencing" these "demagogues" it is hard to see the force of this statement. But farther we read:—

> But he has not left you to determine what is his will in the matter of rights and obligation of men in their civil capacity. He has distinctly enunciated these in his moral law which is summed up in the Decalogue. You are empowered and required therefore by your acceptance of the legislative functions of the civil magistracy to place upon the statute books, as the binding law of the State, this infallible summary of human rights and obligations.

For downright instruction and persuasion this man of "passions" has but few peers. His argument summed up amounts to this. The legislators are the expounders of the will of God (which is his law) to their fellow-men, and having interpreted that law are in duty bound to place their interpretation thereof as the binding law of the State. How admirably this is in line with the action of the late Congress in the interpretation of the fourth precept of the Decalogue. How quickly the "assurance of sympathy" became the loud voice of ecclesiasticism, uttered to persuade those men not to repeal that twin relic of paganism, a Sunday law. Can the reader for a moment think that God, as this man has testified, has given any man, or set of men, the right to lay hands with controlling force upon the rights of his fellows? Can it be that legislators are to be instructed, nay, persuaded; nay, antagonized, that they shall interpret the law of God and cause such interpretation to be forced upon the consciences of men? Has it come to that stage of results that our legislators not only listen to such "instruction" and "persuasion" but actually follow it? It is ev'ec. so. And the "hopes and fears" that influence these men to do this are demonstrated to be none other than the "hopes" of office and the "fears" of not getting or retaining it unless they yield to such "instructive persuasion," etc. The Statesman has given, unwittingly it may be, a perfect example of how this influence is used.
