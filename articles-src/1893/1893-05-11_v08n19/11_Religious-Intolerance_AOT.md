With the above for a heading the Appeal-Avalanche, Memphis, Tenn., of April 30, has quite a little to say in regard to the case of a young lady who has been disbelievable from the Second Presbyterian Church of Charleston, S. C., because she worked in the telephone office on Sunday. The Appeal-Avalanche thinks that such a course is highly reprehensible, and can not be condemned too strongly.

If it is religious intolerance to disbelievable from the church a young lady who persists in working on Sunday, what does the Appeal-Avalanche call the course taken by the authorities in Tennessee, who fined, imprisoned and worked in the chain-gang, honest, upright citizens who observe the true seventh-day Sabbath and who exercise their constitutional and God-given right to work on Sunday?

Though the church is not censurable, still it is pleasant to see the sympathy of the Appeal-Avalanche for this young lady in South Carolina, as it certainly has missionary work to do in its own State, in correcting the actual "religious intolerance" there. A. O. Tait.
