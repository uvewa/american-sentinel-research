The movement in the province of Quebec, ostensibly aimed at political independence, really contemplates incorporation with the United States. That such would be the outcome of Quebec's separation from the Dominion and from Great Britain is not denied by ex-Premier Mercier, who has become the chief advocate of the project among French Canadians. But the French Canadians can hardly be induced to vote for an independence which will mean annexation, unless their clergy are convinced that the interests of the Catholic Church would not suffer through the conversion of the province of Quebec into a State of the Union. At present not only the priests of rural parishes, but some of the most distinguished members of the Catholic hierarchy in Montreal and Quebec seem imperfectly informed respecting the limited powers of the Federal Government in matters of religion; which the States regulate for themselves.

In these circumstances, it is possible for American Catholics, whether members of the clergy or laity, to powerfully further the continental union movement. Especially is this true of the Catholics of New York City, whose relations with Montreal are intimate, and of the Catholics of the New England States, which, during the last twenty years, have received a tremendous inflow of French Canadian immigrants. There is incessant communication by letter, and there is frequent personal intercourse between American Catholics in this portion of our country and their co-religionists in the province of Quebec. What they say will be believed, and they have only to set forth facts with which all our citizens ought to be familiar. They have only to send to their friends in French-speaking Canada copies of the Federal Constitution to convince them that while the Federal Government is forbidden to establish a particular Church in the country at large, there is nothing to prevent a given State from doing so. The Virginians might, for instance, have continued, had they so chosen, to pay tithes to the Episcopal Church formerly established in their colony, and the citizens of Massachusetts might have continued to grant special privileges to ministers of the Congregational or so-called Orthodox Church. If the people of Quebec saw fit, after their province had been transformed into a State of the Union, to embody in their State Constitution a provision for the payment of tithes such as are now paid to the Catholic clergy, the act would lie wholly within their competence. To give, indeed, our friends in Quebec a still more striking illustration of the breadth of the powers reserved to States, we may point out that our Federal Constitution would not debar them from perpetuating the law of entail within their borders. It was some years after the adoption of the Federal Constitution before the law of entail was abolished in the State of New York.

The truth is, that arrangements for the support and inculcation of religion are, under the American system, left in the hands of the people of each State. If this fact was once brought home by American Catholics to the clergy of Quebec, the luke-warmness with which the latter at present regard the movement for continental union would be transformed into earnest, concerted, and triumphant advocacy.
