THE sentence of J. W. Judefind, convicted in Kent County, Md., of the crime of husking corn on Sunday, was thirty days, not sixty as we stated last week. We were wrongly informed by a telegram. This case has been carried to the Court of Appeals, where it will be heard in October. The other Sunday case now pending in Maryland, that of Isaac Baker, of Kent Island, has been postponed to await the decision of the higher court in the Judefind case.

THE SUNDAY CASES IN MARYLAND HAVE REVIVED THE QUESTION PREVIOUSLY RAISED IN TENNESSEE AS TO THE FAITH OF THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS REGARDING THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT OF THE TECAGOGUE. THIS QUESTION WAS NOT RAISED BY THE DEFENSE IN THE CASE OF J. W. JUDEFIND, ON THE CONTRARY THE BROADGROUND WAS TAKEN THAT INASMUCH AS THE LAW REQUIRED THE OBSERVANCE OF A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION IT INFRINGED THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF EVERY MAN; BUT THE COURT RAISED THE QUESTION BY REMARKING THAT IT WAS NOT IN EVIDENCE THAT THE RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS OF THE DEFENDANT REQUIRED HIM TO WORK ON SUNDAY.

This failure to set up the religious belief of the defendant was not an oversight; nor was it a mistake. The Constitution of Maryland declares: "That, as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him, all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty." To leave every man free to worship means more than simply leaving the individual free to choose how he will worship. No man is free to do that which he is obliged to do. It might have been proper for Mr. Ringgold to have shown under protest that Mr. Judefind had a religion which required him to work on Sunday, but to have done so voluntarily would have been equivalent to admitting the right of the State to sit in judgment upon a man's religious convictions.

If it were the province of the State to require the individual to have some religion and to render some sort of worship to his Creator, it would of necessity be legitimate for the Government to pass judgment upon what constituted religion. Indeed the only way Government can avoid this is by confining itself to things entirely civil, for the moment it requires the individual to have any religion whatever it must of necessity become the judge of that religion.
