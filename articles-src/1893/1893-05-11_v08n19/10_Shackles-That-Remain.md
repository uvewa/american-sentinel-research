In his "Notes on Virginia," Thomas Jefferson says: "Besides, the spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may commence persecution, and better men be his victims." Of the people, he says: "They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights. The shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion."

Was this spoken by inspiration? Certain it is, these words are fulfilled to-day. The spirit of the times has altered. Our rulers, our legislators, have become corrupt to such an extent as to sell the liberties of the Nation, the rights of the people, into the hands of a religio-political party—a religious hierarchy. The people have forgotten their rights, feeling that they were forever secured to them, in the sole faculty of making money. There were shackles that were not knocked off at that time, and these are becoming heavier and heavier. And now will the people rise and demand their rights, or will they sleep on till these rights shall expire in a convulsion?

Some of the shackles that remain to this day constitute a sort of Church and State union, in the providing of chaplains in the State and national Government, and in the army and navy; in exemption of Church property from taxation; and in the religious laws that are found upon the statute books of almost every State in the Union. These, especially Sunday laws, are becoming a burden to the people. And now that Congress has given us a national Sunday law, these will become heavier and heavier under the spirit of intolerance and bigotry that exists, until persecution shall blight the fair name of every State in the Union. If the reader is inclined to say that this can never be, we only ask you to consider the ever-increasing demands for religious legislation; the persecutions of seventh-day observers in Arkansas; the noted case of King, in Tennessee, who was hunted to his death by his religious persecutors; and the more recent cases in the same State of quiet, inoffensive citizens condemned to the chain gang for following their own convictions of conscience in matters of religion. I refer to the persecutions of the newsboys of Pennsylvania, and the efforts in the legislature of that State the past winter to secure more stringent laws in regard to what the State is pleased to call Sabbath-breaking. I refer you to a bill introduced into our own State legislature only a few weeks ago to make Sabbath-breaking "a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $100 or ninety days imprisonment, or both." And this bill received a recommendation for passage by the committee to whom it was referred, under an amendment reducing the fine one half. What do all these things mean?—Publina, in Red Wing Argus, Minnesota, March 30, 1893.
