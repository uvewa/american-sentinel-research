In the second and third Christian centuries, the world of philosophical and theological thought and feeling had been divided and subdivided into contending factions. Among the more prominent of these were the Academics, the Stoics and the Platonics; each with a different view of God, and each having a different solution for the great problem of life. Among the Jews, there were the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, and the believers in Jesus.

Christianity itself, so recently from the hands of its Founder and his apostles, had already bedecked its robe in the rich and gaudy ornaments of factionalism; cling to the simple teaching of Christ and the apostles, their followers were divided into Christians, the Nazarenes, or the Ebionites, as they were afterward called, and the Gnostics already subdivided into several sects, till of these combining Christianity with oriental mysticism. Then, there were a hundred different forms of pagan worship, originating in as many different nations; yet composed of so many different elements that are united by flocking to the Pantheon to find place in each and every system of philosophy asserted itself with more or less, dogmatic force, and proclaimed itself in possession of the ultimate truth.

What wonder that under such conditions of matters, there should arise a set of good, earnest men, who looked upon this wild scramble for philosophical and religious supremacy as a disgrace, the very denial of the broad spirit, which obliged every one to swear allegiance to the dictates of his master?

Such were the Eclectics, who did not believe that any one creed was broad enough to hold all the truth, but rather that the truth lay dispersed in scattered fragments among all the systems of belief and philosophy. As their master taught, they "professed to simply follow truth," gathering up what was accorded with it wherever it might be found; that practically they would avoid sectarianism and all the warring parties, and that if all men of the world have come together on an Eclecticism on a broad international basis of religion, what a magnificent opportunity for the formation of a new creed. However, in the early days, men let us welcome each member more openly, and these Eclectic philosophers borrowed one from another, exchanging platitudes. "This philosophy was adopted by each of the learned in Alexandria, so that the Eclectics had a special home. It will retain the name, the garb, and the language of every school of philosophy, but the one creed soon proved too narrow for these men of liberality; and it was merged one into another, which for broad and comprehensive liberality, could not possibly be surpassed by this genius of a modern, even though he ran ahead of himself in dignifying and unifying a whole international congress of religions.

Says Mosheim: "This eclectic mode of philosophy was embraced not the Christians only, but also by the founder of Ammonia Saccus, with great applause, made the foundation of that sect which is called the New Platonists."

The Eclectics undertook to show the foundation of that next which is called this makes the contrast between the two schools in a way to reveal a danger to the liberality of the latter. "The Eclectics" held that there was an element of truth in all religions that had been promulgated, had, true and false, in all systems, and likewise they could collect out of all what was true, incorporating in a whole which had rejected the rest." "But Americans at the Congress of Religions profess the same system of truth, with only a little more modern garnishment, and it is this: some modern difference in their conclusions as that by means of amicable consultation, they might, with little difficulty, be brought into one fold." (p. 69.)

"The grand object of Ammonius was to bring all sects and religions into one system of truth, both religious and philosophical." The Eclectics proceeded to show how all forms of philosophy and religion could be reconciled and blended into one system and harmonized by reason and the system of that was beautiful. Here is a breadth of good fellowship and liberality which will enable even these pagans, the hearts of the most extravagant patrons of the perspective Congress of Religion. But how wide was the utility of this philosophy but how true was the reality was the experiment tried? and what was the result? Surely there are important lessons to be learned.

"At Alexandria, Almon or Alemmone down to the time of Ammonias drew to the rich city of Alexandria. A school of Ammonias gradually cast all others into the back ground." "From Egypt it spread, in a short time, over the whole Roman Empire and Ages after Ages all its precepts instilled in states of philosophy and society." Origins, the disciple of Ammonias, introduced the same views into the presidency of the school. He recommended earnest study of Greek philosophy for its interpretation, applying those things to Christianity.

"He read the Scriptures this same ruling and the Greek Scriptures this same reading borrowing all forms of paganism and many things and pagan philosophy with the Christian religion. These originated the whole trouble, which as a system of religion, where every student of history knows, is simply fatality. For as Gravatt says, "Ammon and a form of paganism are now of one family. And thus the broad liberality of Ammon was the fountain head of Roman Catholicism itself."

Origin's method of interpreting Scripture borrowed from Greek philosophy, still to-day, by Chambers and others, called the "father of children and the father of genius in Christendom." He was the father of the system which has ripened into all the degradation of Catholicism itself, of philosophical importation adopted by Rome for origin and Christianity, did not benefit the teachers of it to involve in philosophical system of origin and Christianity. He led the teachers of it to involve in philosophical terms and philosophical methods which are in themselves vain and hopeless, the truths and precepts of the gospel of the Saviour not a few things have been added to those precepts from the schools of the philosopher, from those of the Scripture. "Finally, it allowed the Christians to retain many of their former notions, from Christianity itself, and from philosophical terms, and forms, and language consisting of 'Christians' and 'Chalcedonians' and 'Monothelites' and 'Iconoclasts' and other such." Looking at the effects which arose from this new philosophy, we find that Roman Catholicism with all its errors, (Christianity mingled with paganism) this attempt to reconcile truce between the two; between which and which Christ himself forever drew the line.

The most wonderful fact of all is, that within one hundred years of the time when they were decrying "all sectarianism," the whole Christian world was rent in the bitterest strife, "just like when the breath of spirit, "just like when the breath of the spirit, was gone out of it...." The Eclectics, instead of establishing the breadth of liberality, of that "syncretism, as Mosheim calls it," were really destroying the foundation of the Papacy that in all the centuries to come would persecute and disgrace its powers. A new "syncretism" could be brought about the same Congress of Religions, would produce the same results. That spirit of the nineteenth century gave into the Papacy, this one is preparing the way for another worse form of it. But, this subject has been discussed in the earlier "Historical Study."

The history of the world proves that just as the majesty professing a love of truth, invariably, there is but one kind of unity possible. It is the papal unity—the unity of an enforced creed.

The history of the world proves that just as the majesty professing a love of truth invariably there has since that proportion of truth in any system has that proportion of truth to recommend it, it is also irresistible. Especially is this true, if the man or the nation happens to find in such cases, is a miserable comparison with a clear that can not stand victoriously, a fair fat, the truth taught by the few to the other few, just as surely forward discussion, diversity of positive beliefs has been a great fact of this whole world history. For such a unity always has been, and always will be a way toward despotism, and this, whether it be civil or religious, is fatal to civilization and liberty.

The nineteenth century especially holds these facts of warning before modern liberal theological thought. The more in earnest it all will be, before a creed so liberal as to call itself Catholic or universal, and still as bigoted as to persecute, with merciless severity, all dissenters from it.

In truth strange similitude does the world move. The same platform upon which the Emperor Hadrian gives of the immediate results in Alexandria, may well be read at any session of the coming congress, or a like result, would surely follow this congress, and these men who call themselves Seraphs are Christians, and those who call Christians are Seraphs and Seraphs are Seraphs of Seraphs. There is no ruler of a synagogue, no Samaritan, no presbyter of the Christians, who is not an astrologer or a prophet or a minister of Hadrian himself, when he comes to Egypt, even those who worship Serapis are in fact those who call themselves the bishops of Christ by the oldest. Christ. They have but one God; him do the Christians, him do Hebrews Christians, Jews and all races worship alike."
