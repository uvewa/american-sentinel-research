THE MEMPHIS APPEAL-AVALANCHE which publishes a Sunday edition and yet had, so far as we know, no protest to offer when well-disposed citizens of Tennessee were arrested, fined, and imprisoned, for quiet Sunday work, is indignant because a young woman has been dismissed from her church for Sunday work. The Avalanche evidently thinks that the State is the proper disciplinarian in spiritual things.
