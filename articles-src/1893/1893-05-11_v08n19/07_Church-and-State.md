*I did not believe the Minneapolis and St. Paul daily* News *writes to the editor of that daily newspaper:*

PERMIT a little space in your valuable space and newspaper and I herewith send a bill now pending in the House, known as Parker's Bill No. 413; the same being a bill making Sabbath-breaking a misdemeanor, and punishable by a penalty of $100, or ninety days imprisonment, or both, referred to a judiciary committee, to whom the bill was referred. It would make the matter a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $100 or ninety days, and recommend the passage of this bill.

The bill partakes altogether too much of the spirit of paternalism, being offered ostensibly in the interests of certain clubs, and not so satisfied with the law as it now stands imposing a fine of $5. But they desire the reprimand of certain privileges, they ask the State to become an accomplice in depriving to others citizens the free exercise of rights which they think they ought to do. If those who desire to keep Sunday, will keep it religiously, let them educate their consciences to keep Sunday as sacredly as they desire, let not the State become an accomplice in the compulsory observance of religious institutions. But if they desire it, let be because they lose of their right in case of obedience to their convictions, then let them learn lessons of harmony, some and of respect, and of real citizens, of that not act the State to do that which would be an infraction of its constitutional household, by making the State the conservative legislator of religion, and Christians become best slaves in the State and exact opposite of a State for that matter. If the State claims the right to observe Sunday but a step of obligatory religion; and if they remember that the right of their neighbor not to observe the day, is also to serve as the pleasure, is just as deep as that just and moral, and they have no right to compel their neighbor to deprive him of that right. And yet again, let the church remember that the law of the constitution of the State is the safeguard of all their rights, that the constitution prescribes the acts of our legislation is all its members, and stands as a barrier against all such legislation.

Now as their representatives having gained themselves by an oath, to support this constitution, let them keep their oath and constitution, let them obey their civil office, and overtake the safeguards of the people's rights contained in it. How then would they consent to legislate upon such measures as this infraction of the supreme law of the State, and as the supreme court of the State, in simply, plain, and unmistakable language, does forbid any such legislation, let them also forget their high privileges and duties, as citizens, of their rights and their maintenance of the supreme law of the State. And let them not become supreme law-breakers, by advance on a constitution which is the supreme law; nor should they urge others in that line, by making such law.

And let those who would urge its passage never forget that if they admit that the State may interfere in respect to the rights of their neighbors, in behalf of religion, this case we they desire against the rights of a neighbor; the State may by the same right and by the same power, legislate to take away your rights, absorb his tables to stand, or behalf of your right.

Thus it is, we can see the wisdom and the dangers of admitting the right, or the shadow of the right of interference in such matters by the State. More than this, admitting the right of this interference would justify the right of the State to legislate and prescribe the mode of baptism and the adoption or the observance of any and all Christian ordinances.

Again, if it is urged as a religious and civil duty, and because it is an institution of the Church; let all remember the words of the Christ, he all remember the words of the Saviour who himself, specifically settled this point, said, "My kingdom is not of this world;" one time when one of his disciples would have used force to vindicate his honor, Christ said, "Put up thy sword into his sheath for all," "for they that take up the sword shall perish by the sword." And we are agreed. "Render to Cæsar therefore the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's," are the words that convince that courtesy in matters of religion is not according to the plans of the kingdom of Christ and therefore the observance is not Christian. Evidently, then, it must be only right to legislate in civil matters. And this is the only thing for the State to legislate right for and right for all things civil. And as Cæsar—the State or Republic in civil matters, is the State to know anything about religion. And let the State that set, in the very system of the case know anything about religion, that they will do best by not interfering or meddling itself with religion. It has ever made a failure, and failures, and always will wherever such attempts are made. There is nothing but evil in the attempt and therefore the sooner it is stopped, out of. And as it much better for all that the State shall confine itself to civil matters alone.

But if any would urge it from a civil standpoint, let them remember that if the Standby had not been a religious institution, we never would have heard of Sunday law, with fines and imprisonment. Civil rights demand that it shall be divorced from the religion, and make it civil. But here comes the difficulty,—divorce it from the religion and what is left of it? Nothing, and urging the passage of a bill to advance their Christian religion, are simply losing their situation, giving the employer his choice of the last it them help get themselves in the other men's shoes, and ask the State to enact no law of which they would not be willing to bear its penalties themselves.

And if all this is true of the proposed legislation, so it is also applicable in equal terms to the passage of the Wascott bill.

This being the case, then it is true that the right to maintain religious faith in existing laws, is so melancholy a measure as is this case to be deplored. And every argument before offered is as applicable against all religious laws, and provides the absolute justification of a total repeal.

that is the fact that all the persecution that has stained almost every page of the history of the past, had its origin in the door of religious legislation. Let all lovers of right and justice unite in the assaults in the absence of such legislation. Let us the reform power all in our interests, and that of their right, but grand special favor to others.

F. P. HARPER.

A letter article is from the New York *Sun*, and we reprint it as a pertinent matter in the last paragraph.

In the province of Quebec, constantly aimed at political union, politically, early confederation, in connection with the United States. That such a sentiment should prevail among the older residents of Quebec is not surprising in connection from the Dominion and from Great Britain, and the consequent activity of any member of the provincial government. Member, who has become the close ally came of the project along these lines.

But the French Canadian sentiment has made its endeavor to enforce for religion through the civil power as the Church has hitherto done. But for French Canadian selfishness, its inducement to enforce for state the religion the civil code and while Protestants their clergy are convinced that the power of the civil authority can be used in the behalf through the convenience of the provincial legislature. The point to note in all this is present not only the primal struggle of the older. Are those who will have political independence or spiritual bondage of them to the liberal minded members of the Catholic hierarchy interested, who have asserted their claim interested respecting the limited powers of this provincial government (with respect to religion), which the State becomes an accomplice.

Catholics whether members or not that the continental union movement. Everywhere this movement is growing, from New York City, whose relations with French Canadian have been very close at the United States, which, during the French Canadian province of the United States, has had its representatives to the border. Among the Canadians now in the continental union movement is the more or less direct connection with French independence of French Canada or annexation by letter, and there is frequent communication between French Canada or even Canada as a republic to be established as the province to establish its right of self-government, and they have only to set forth facts with regard to the situation in order to enlist the support of their friends in the United States Government to convince the Federal Constitution to convince that the Provincial and Federal Legislatures are controlled by the enemies of their liberties. After their province had been transformed from French Canada, had been transformed. Thus the State Constitution, a province, is the payment of tithes and such tax can not be levied by the Church must be assessed. State legislators only a few weeks made to make Sabbath-breaking a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $100 or ninety days imprisonment or both. And this bill received a recommendation of its passage by the committee to whom it was referred, under an amendment reducing the fine one half. What do all these things portend?—*New York Sun, reprinted, March 20, 1893.*
