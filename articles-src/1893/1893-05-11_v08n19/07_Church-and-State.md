[Of a bill before the Minnesota Legislature, a correspondent of the St. Paul Daily News writes to the editor of that journal as follows:—]

PERMIT me a little space in your valuable paper to examine and dissect a certain bill now pending in the House, known as House File No. 413; the same being a bill making 64-Death-breaking a misdemeanor, punishable by a penalty of $100, or ninety days imprisonment, or both. The judiciary committee, to whom the bill was referred, have amended by making the fine $50, and recommend the passage of the same.

The bill partakes altogether too much of the spirit of paternalism, being offered ostensibly in the interests of certain clerks, who are not satisfied with the law as it now stands imposing a fine of $10. But as they desire the enjoyment of certain privileges, they ask the State to become an accomplice in denying to others equal privileges, and compelling others to do as they think they ought to do. If those who offer the measure wish to keep Sunday, let them educate their consciences to as strict an observance as they may desire, but let not the State become an accomplice in the compulsory observance of religious institutions. But if they desire the law because they fear loss of position in case of obedience to their convictions, then let them learn lessons of independence and self-respect, and self-reliance, and not ask the State to do that which would be but to deprive them of their own manhood, by making the State the conservator of their own rights; for in so doing they become but slaves to the State and exalt the State above the people. Moreover, if these claim the right to observe Sunday as a day of rest, religiously or otherwise, let them remember that the right of their neighbor not to observe the day, or to observe it as he pleases, is just as dear to him and just as sacred, and they have no authority, morally or legally, to deprive him of that right. And yet again, let the promoters of that bill remember that the constitution of the State is the safeguard of the rights of the citizen, and also prescribes the acts of our legislators in all such matters, and stands as a barrier against all such legislation.

Now as their representatives have obligated themselves by an oath to support that constitution, let them not ask these representatives to violate their oath of office, and override the safeguard of the rights of the people, as they would do should they consent to legislate upon such questions. The constitution is the supremal law of the State, and as the supreme law of the State, in simple, plain, and unmistakable language, does forbid any such legislation, let them not forget their high privileges and duties, as citizens, of obedience to and maintenance of the supreme law of the State. And let them not become supreme law-breakers, by advocating a measure so directly opposed to the supreme law; nor should they urge others to become such, by enacting such a law.

And let those who would urge its passage never forget that if they admit that the State may interfere in respect to the rights of their neighbor, and legislate in this case as they desire against the rights of a neighbor, the State may by the same right and by the same power, legislate to take away your rights, should the tables be turned in behalf of your neighbor. Thus it is, we can see the wisdom and the justice of the denial by the constitution, of the right of interference in such matters, by the State. More than this, admitting the right of this interference would justify the right of the State to legislate and prescribe the mode of baptism and its adoption; or the enforcement of any other Christian ordinance.

But, if it be urged as a religious necessity, and because it is an institution of the Church, let all remember the words of the Author of the Christian religion, when he said, "My kingdom is not of this world, else would my servants fight." And at one time when one of his disciples would use the sword in defense of his Master, Christ said, "Put up thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword." And yet again: "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." So we must conclude that coercion in matters of religion is not according to the plan of the Author of the Christian religion, and therefore is not Christian. Evidently, Caesar has enough to do to take care of civil matters. And this is the only thing for which the State is ordained—to care for all things civil. And as Caesar—the State—is ordained in civil matters, it can not know anything about religion. And as the State does not, in the very nature of the case know anything about religion, it has always made a bad job, in intermeddling itself with religion. It has always made a failure, and always will make a failure whenever the attempt is made. There is nothing but evil in the attempt, and nothing but evil can come out of it. And so it is much better for all concerned, that the State let religious matters alone.

But if any would urge it from a civil standpoint, let these remember that if the Sunday had not been a religious institution, we never would have heard of Sunday laws, with fines and imprisonments. It is an utter impossibility to separate it from the religious, and make it civil. But let them show their sincerity by dropping this, and urging the passage of a bill to give all employés a day of rest without losing their situation, giving the employé his choice of the day. Let them put themselves in the other men's shoes, and ask the State to enact no law of which they would not be willing to hear its penalty, should the tables be turned.

As all this is true of the proposed legislation, so is it also applicable to any and all past religious legislation by the State. This being the case, then it is true that the Wacek bill to repeal these Sunday laws, is as meritorious a measure as is this one to be deplored. And every argument here offered is as applicable against all religious laws, and proves the advisability of the passage of the Wacek bill. One thing should never be forgotten, and that is the fact that all the persecution that has stained almost every page of modern history, can of a truth be laid at the door of religious legislation. And such persecutions can never be made possible in the absence of such legislation. Then let the State protect all in the enjoyment of their right, but grant special favors to none.

H. F. FHELPS.
