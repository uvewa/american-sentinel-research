THE Chicago *Mail* notes the fact that sentimentalists want a World's Fair forever adopted, and remarks that, "If there were any blossom that closed on Sunday there might be some sense in it."

The *Memphis Appeal-Avalanche* which publishes a Sunday edition and yet had, so far as we know, no protest to offer when well-disposed citizens of Tennessee were arrested, fined, and imprisoned, for quite Sunday work, is indignant because a young woman has been dismissed from her church for Sunday work. The evidence evidently thinks that the State and the proper disciplinarian is a spiritual court.

THE SERIOUS of A. O. Waddell, convicted in Kent County, Md., of the crime of husking corn on Sunday, was thirty days, not only as we stated last week. We were wrongly informed by a telegram dispatch. This case has been carried to the Court of Appeals where it will be heard in October. The other Sunday case now pending in Maryland, that of Isaac Bailey, of Kent Island, has been postponed to be connected with the case of the higher court in the Judefield case.

TEN Sunday cases in Maryland have been carried to the Court of Appeals. Seventh-day Adventists regarding the obligation to observe the faith of the Seventh-day Adventists regarding the obligation to obey the law by the fourth commandment to keep the Sabbath. This question was settled by the defense in the case of A. W. Judefield, on the contrary the broad ground was taken that inasmuch as the law required the observance of a religious institution it infringed the religious liberty of every man; but the court ruled the question by reasoning that it was not in evidence that the religious convictions of the defendant required him to work on Sunday.

This failure to set up the religious belief of the defendant was an oversight; or was it a mistake. The Constitution of Maryland declares: "That, as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to him, all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty." To have every man free to worship means more than simply leaving the individual free to choose how he will worship. No man is free to do that which he is obliged to do. It might have been proper for Mr. Ringold to have shown under protest that

Mr. Judefield had a religion which required him to work on Saturday, but to have done so voluntarily would have been equivalent to admitting the right of the State to interfere upon a man's religious conviction. In deference not in fidelity to principles, but to their resistance in the highest principles.

If it were the province of the State to require the individual to have some religion and to render some sort of worship to his Creator, it would of course be legitimate for the Government to pass judgment upon what constituted religion. Indeed the only way Government can avoid this by confining itself to things entirely civil, for the moment it requires the individual to have any religion whatever it must of necessity become the judge of that religion.

THE *Chicago Herald* records the fact that a considerable number of theological students from the institution near Chicago, and young ministers who have taken charge, have since enrolled as guards at the World's Fair, and quote one as the captain who enrolled them as saying that, "Several of them, in fact nearly all of these, asked a provision that they be relieved from duty on the seventh day." It would be interesting to know whether this was the actual request of those men.

In the toast of the Catholic Baccivret "that Church in New England" comes to-day during the past quarter of a century not by immigration and by the full material increase in the Catholic population, but also by making converts direct.

According to the *Review*, the Catholic Church in New England "counts to-day a flock numbering close to half a million, littered Puritans, the most Dutch of the New Netherlanders, and the most rigid of the Church of England mest of a century or so ago. If it cared to parade the names of its proselytes, it would furnish the daily press with a sensation that would hold the public interest for more of than nine days."

As an article on another page of this paper, "The Theology of this, this moral, Theological Thought," contains much food for reflection. There prevails in the world to-day a sort of wide-sweeping sentimentalism that exhaltes sentiment for principle and then insists that everybody shall do homage to it regardless of principle.

To this sickly sentimentalism is due in fact the World's Parliament of Religions. It is in fact this of that religious sentiment also manifests itself in the popular demand for Church union, very, very inappropriately called Christian union. Christian union is union with God through the Spirit, not simply organic union, not even the so-called union upon a sentiment which involves a surrender of principle. No religion demands such loyal adherence

as truth as does Christianity, and no system involves more disloyalty to eternal verities than does this modern scheme for "Christian union;" it is not in the interests of truth but of human pride. In deference not in fidelity to principles, but holds in higher principles than facts. In the quest speeches, and in numbers of three periods. Its motto is, "Man's proper study of worship is man," and of course nothing fitting representation of the press knew one be found that this professes one in the scheme itself. Those who are in harmony with God and confine themselves about harmony with others; they will naturally find themselves in union with the children of God everywhere. The ties they have in common will enter upon.
