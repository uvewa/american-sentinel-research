The *American Sentinel*, of Philadelphia, has the following paragraph:

General Grant once said that the best way to get rid of a bad law was to enforce it. It was this maxim that prompted the State Typographical Union to pass at a recent session a resolution calling upon all their members to vote against any one for the office of governing the race, and which for more than a hundred years has been so consistently sustained by the overwhelming sentiment of the people; newspapers, railroads and electricity were unknown. Our conditions were practically the same as existed hundreds of years ago. It is not the condition of things, those acceded Sunday laws were made to apply to. Now that the great changes brought about by invention and discovery a hundred or more years ago to late. Now that the great changes have taken place many of our Sunday laws are entirely inapplicable; and yet they will doubtless proceed on their viciousness until some fellow whose punishment he does not deserve will be brought under the provisions of the various Alleghany County low-car laws, and the enforcement of the prejudice to the punishment of the prisoner was for the best. If the law is right, stand by it and see that it is enforced. If it is unjust or oppressive, repeal it first. Let the law making a penal offence all work on Sunday be enforced, and we believe there would be such a stampede of confectioners and there be no half way business about it either.

It may indeed be that Grant was right in the reason confined to him, but if he did he certainly did not justify, and they have no right on that hand. A bad law, is not to perpetuate the injustice by continuing to enforce it, but to make an end to the bad law and the wrong done under it by a summary repeal. There can be no question of the fact that the right enforcement of an unjust law, which serves to call attention to the hardship which it works as to secure perhaps a more prompt repeal, but that is not abrogation of the offensive law. But it under no pretension that this law can be made offensive to a sufficient number of a reformed class of society. On the other hand if those who suffer are not a consequence for a withdrawal of unjust votes in public affairs, their outcry against the injustice done them will be ignored by the citizen who has been taxed to remain, rather than make the government assume and are quite content as an asault and the legislative and judicial tyranny go on.

It is certainly true that it is not the best way to obtain the repeal of a bad law—to enforce it. Two wrongs can not make one right. The passing, of unjust law is wrong, and the enforcement of it, is as much as to say that the sense of justice and fairness put in their heart for rights sake, has left the hearts of the people; and this only way to restore the sense of justice in the hearts of the masses is that fellow-men is by making any other that the law is not the way to go about it. Nevertheless. Perhaps this is so; but if it is, two wrongs do not make a right; and last word. No repeal an unjust law, and not enforce it.
