THE North American, of Philadelphia, has the following paragraph:—

> General Grant once said that the best way to get rid of a bad law was to rigidly enforce it. It was probably a desire to rest the wisdom of that remark that prompted the State Typographical Union yesterday to endorse the old Blue Laws, affecting the publication of Sunday newspapers. The obsolete laws governing the case, and which for more than a century have been permitted to rest in "innocuous desuetude," were framed at a time when newspapers, railroads and electricity were unknown. Entirely out of harmony with the present condition of things, these so-called Sunday laws would probably never have been "resurrected" but for a band of selfish Pittsburghers born a hundred or more years too late. Now that the "crusaders" have been, in a measure, successful in harassing the newspaper publishers of Pittsburg, they will doubtless proceed on their victorious march against the directors and stockholders of the various Allegheny County horse-car lines, and with every prospect of success. Whatever their motive might have been, the self-sacrificing indorsement of the printers was for the best. If the Puritan Sabbath is to become a legal institution in Pennsylvania, let us have it at once and be done with it. Let the law making a penal offense all works on Sunday, except those of "necessity and charity," be rigidly and equally enforced, and let there be no half-way business about it either.

It may be that General Grant made the remark credited to him, but if he did he was in error. The best way to get rid of a bad law is, not to perpetuate its injustice by continuing to enforce it, but to make an end to the bad law and the wrong done under it by a summary repeal. It is sometimes true, of course, that the rigid enforcement of an unjust enactment may so call attention to the hardship which it works as to secure popular attention and united effort for the abrogation of the offensive law. But in order to reach this result the law must be made offensive to a sufficient number of a certain influential class of society. On the other hand if those who suffer are but a comparative few without a noticeable voice in public affairs, their outcry against the injustice done them will be ignored and the obnoxious law be allowed to remain, rather than make the acknowledgment that the statute books are at fault and the legislature and judiciary have erred.

It is certainly true that it is not the best way to obtain the repeal of a bad law—to enforce it. Two wrongs can not make one right. The maxim, if maxim it is, is as much as to say that the sense of abstract justice and the love of right, for right's sake, has left the hearts of the people, and the only way to secure their attention to the wrongs they are doing their fellow-men is by making sure that the blows they deal shall rebound upon themselves. Perhaps this is so; but if it is it is not the first and best resort but the last and worst. No, repeal an unjust law; do not enforce it.
