IN the second century of the Christian era, the world of philosophical and theological thought was already much divided and subdivided into contending sects. There were the Epicureans and the Academics, the Stoics and the Platonics, each with a different view of God, and each having a different solution for the great problem of life. Among the Jews, there were the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essones, and the believers in the mystic Kabbala.

Christianity, itself, so recently descended from heaven in garments of light, had already bedraggled its robe in the filth of earth. Besides those who still cling to the simple teaching of Christ and the apostles, there were the Judaizing Christians, the Nazarenes, or the Ebismites, as they were afterward called, and the Gnostics already subdivided into several sects, but all of them combining Christianity with oriental mysticism.

Then, there were a hundred different forms of pagan worship, originating in as many different nations now conquered by the overflowing armies of Rome, and all flocking to the Pantheon to find place in that temple of all the gods. Each creed and each system of philosophy asserted itself with more or less dogmatic force, and proclaimed itself in possession of the ultimate truth.

What wonder that under such circumstances, there should arise a set of good, whole-souled, broad-minded and generous-hearted men, who, to use Mosheim's, words, "disapproved of the controversial spirit, which obliged every one to swear allegiance to the dogmas of his master." Such were the Eclectics, who did not believe that any one creed was broad enough to hold all the truth; but rather that the truth lay dispersed in scattered fragments among all the systems of belief and philosophy. As their name implies, they "professed to simply follow truth, gathering up what was accordant with it in all the philosophical schools." "Especially they avoided altercations and a sectarian spirit." Could all the religions of the world have come together on exhibition in some grand international congress of religions, what a magnificent opportunity for the formation of such a creed. However, in the early days, men had to do without such modern appliances, and these Eclectic philosophers seemed to succeed tolerably well, for, says Mosheim: "This philosophy was adopted by such of the learned in Alexandria, as wished to be accounted Christians, and still retain the name, the garb, and the rank of philosophers." But even this school soon proved too narrow for these liberal thinkers; and it was soon merged into another, which for broad and comprehensive liberality, could not possibly be surpassed by the genius of a modern, even though his maw should succeed in digesting and unifying a whole international congress.

Says Mosheim: "This eclectic mode of philosophizing was exchanged near the end of this century (the second), when Ammonius Saccus, with great applause, opened a school in Alexandria, and laid the foundation of that sect which is called the 'New Platonic.'" The same historian thus states the contrast between the two schools in a way to reveal the increased liberality of the latter. "The Eclectics held that there was a mixture of good and bad, true and false, in all systems, and therefore they selected out of all what appeared to them consonant with reason, but rejected the rest." "But Ammonius held that all sects professed one and the same system of truth, with only a little difference in the mode of stating it, and some minute difference in their conceptions; so that by means of suitable explanations, they might, with little difficulty, be brought into one body." And again, "The grand object of Ammonius was to bring all sects and religions into harmony." The historian proceeds to relate how all forms of philosophy and religion—the Christian included—were combined into one system and harmonized by means of allegorical interpretations. Surely here is a breadth of good fellowship and liberality which would even now rejoice the hearts of the most enthusiastic projectors of the prospective Congress of Religions. But how wide was the influence of this philosophy back there? how fully was the experiment tried? and what was the result? Surely these are important questions. Let the historian answer. "At Alexandria, almost no other philosophy was taught from the time of Ammonius down to the sixth century." Again, "The school of Ammonius gradually cast all others into the back ground." "From Egypt it spread, in a short time, over the whole Roman Empire and drew after it almost all persons inclined to attend to metaphysical studies? Origen, the disciple of Ammonius Saccus, succeeded his preceptor in the presidency of the school. He continued the same methods of allegorical interpretation, applying them especially to the sacred Scriptures, thus mixing and harmonizing (?) all forms of pagan ceremonies and pagan philosophies with the Christian religion. Thus originated the Papacy, which, as a system of religion, every student of history knows, is simply a combination of paganism with Christianity. For as Gavazzi says, 'Almost all forms of paganism are now in the Roman Church.'" This liberal school was the fountain head of Roman Catholicism.

Origen's method of interpreting Scripture became so universal that he is, even to-day, by Chambers and others, called the "father of biblical criticism and exegesis in Christendom." He was the father of that gloriously liberal Pagonist Christian philosophy, which ripened into the Papacy. Mosheim says: "This new species of philosophy imprudently adopted by Origen and other Christians, did immense harm to Christianity." "For it led the teachers of it to involve in philosophic obscurity many parts of our religion which are in themselves plain and easy to be understood, and to add to the precepts of the Saviour not a few things of which not a word can be found in the Scripture." "Finally, it alienated the minds of many, in the following centuries, from Christianity itself, and produced a heterogeneous species of religion, consisting of Christian and Platonic principles combined." "And who is able to enumerate all the evils and injurious effects which arose from this new philosophy; or, if you please, from [this syncretismus] this attempt to reconcile true and false religions with each other."

The most wonderful fact of all is, that just while those liberal philosophic Christians were decrying "all sectarianism," and repudiating "the controversial spirit,"—just while they were laying the foundations of that broadest and most liberal of all schools of philosophical religion, of that "syncretismus," as Mosheim calls it,—just then they were laying the foundation of the Papacy, that in its bigotry burned men for heresy for more than a thousand years. A new "syncretismus," could it be brought about at the Congress of Religions, would produce the same results. If that one in the second century grew into the Papacy, this one would grow into the image to the Papacy. This growth would be as much more rapid than that, as the nineteenth century is more intense than the second. It matters not how much men may talk of liberality, nor how sincerely they may decry the sectarian and the controversial spirit; they did the same there.

The great historical fact still remains that the Church and the world have arrived at the recognition of the rights of conscience only as the multitude of contending sects have made a universal creed impossible. The only unity that can exist concomitantly, with liberty, is the divine unity, not of an external creed, but of internal truth. Nothing could be farther from this unity of truth than the tendency to a miserable compromise with error, of the New Platonists of the second century, and the believers in the Congress of Religions, in the nineteenth. Beside this unity of truth, however, there is but one kind of unity possible. It is the papal unity—the unity of an enforced creed. The history of the world proves that just as the majority professing a creed becomes large, and the minority rejecting it, small, just in that proportion is the temptation to enforce it by law irresistible. Especially is this true, if the creed itself, as always happens in such cases, is a miserable compromise with error, that can not meet victoriously, on a fair field, the truth taught by the few. In other words, just as every step towards diversity of positive beliefs has been a step towards liberty, so every step toward such a unity always has been, and always will be a step toward despotism, and this notwithstanding all the fine talks about liberality and liberty.

Such is the unavoidable tendency of modern liberal theological thought. The final outcome of it all will be, as before, a creed so liberal as to call itself Catholic or universal, and still so bigoted as to persecute, with merciless severity, all dissenters.

In such strange antitheses does the world move. The serio-comic picture which the Emperor Hadrian gave of the immediate result in Alexandria, may well make us pause and think here, for the same, or a like result, would surely follow. Says he: "Those who worship Serapis are Christians, and those who call themselves bishops of Christ are worshipers of Serapis. There is no ruler of a synagogue, no Samaritan, no presbyter of the Christians, who is not an astrologer and a soothsayer. The patriarch of the Jews himself, when he comes to Egypt, is forced by one party to worship Serapis, by the other, Christ. They have but one god, who is none. Him Christians, Jews, and all races worship alike."
