FROM the beginning the real questions involved in the movement for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair have been ignored. Only a small and uninfluential minority has stated and defended the principle which applies to the matter, and attention to it has been studiously avoided by all in authority.

THE utter failure to comprehend what was at stake in this is an example of stupendous governmental folly and mental blindness, not equalled since the Jew sundertook to raise Christ to an earthly throne and then crucified him because he did not meet their mistaken expectations. The Supreme Court dictum that this is a Christian Nation, and the congressional legislation to enforce religious ceremonial, is the nineteenth century expression of the same fatal error of the temporal rule of Christ.

CHRIST'S kingdom upon earth does not come by stress of law or force of arms. That which attains religious dominion by such means is antichrist. Does not the whole world know this? Such as do not already know it, or have not had the opportunity to learn, will have the opportunity; and if they do not acknowledge it to be so it will be because they themselves are not Christ's but belong, of their own choice, to antichrist.

THAT which was of supreme importance in this crisis was the voice of the court of last resort, and the decree of the highest legislative authority. Whether the behest of these should be obeyed or not in this instance was of the very least moment, except as to the individual responsibility of those who in this acknowledge religious allegiance to the temporal power. Whether the Fair shall be opened or closed on Sunday is of the same category precisely as the Sunday opening or closing of stores, gardens, parks, and museums to which an admission is asked, elsewhere throughout the country. Exactly the same principle applies and should govern in all these cases from the smallest to the greatest.

THE SENTINEL has said months ago that in all probability it would not be definitely known whether the Exposition was to be closed on Sundays or not until the Fair was already in progress, and that whatever the result in that regard might be, the agitation of the subject of enforced Sunday observance would not only continue but increase. This has proved to be so. Since Congress adjourned, having irrevocably committed itself to a religious precedent, no one who looked at the matter in the proper light has taken any interest in the question as to whether the Fair should in reality be open or closed on Sunday, except as being interested that the course should be taken which would most clearly show to the greatest number of citizens the legislative error which has been committed, and awaken the consciences of the greatest number to the realization of the fact that their allegiance in religious things is to God and not to the State.

THE discussion of this question, irrespective of the Sunday closing or opening of the Fair gates, and the feeling upon it, will grow more and more intense as time goes on. New phases of this and allied questions, unexpected and totally unforeseen, will develop from time to time. An instance of this has already occurred in the movement of the workingmen to rest and attend the Fair on the seventh day, and begin their week of labor on the first day according to biblical time. The expression of opinion, and prejudice, and arrogance, and ignorance, which this has called forth from many of the clergy is remarkable, suggestive, startling! What spirit inspired that Chicago clergyman, who, when told of this purpose of the Central Labor Union, said, "If the Union is in earnest let them try it. Then we will see if there is any law in this country!" How thoroughly in the white heat of prejudice engendered by this, has that false assumption of charitable interest in workingmen and their rest day been burned away. In the fierce light of this blaze of actual feeling not even a trace is to be seen of disinterested anxiety for the defense and protection of the workingman. The dragon can not always masquerade under the similitude of the lamb. Its voice will sometimes betray it.

THE haughty threat of this Chicago clergyman is only equalled by the arrogant exultation of another who says of the passage of this unconstitutional proviso, "Congress didn't dare to do anything else." "Congress did not dare to do otherwise than order the Fair closed." Neither is it the first time that this same thing has been said. Do congressman hear? Do congressmen read? Are they pleased to have it heralded from pulpit, and parsonage, and church steeple, that at the command of a faction they have contravened the Constitution and sold the birthright of the Nation for a mess of pottage? When a legislative body is so thoroughly subjugated that its masters have no hesitancy in publishing the fact, without fear that the boast will militate against them and without thought for the feelings, or the reputation of those legislators upon whose necks they are treading, then the enslavement of the law-making power is as complete as it is disgraceful.

But workingmen do not prove as docile as congressmen. The workingman has learned from the Sunday theologians themselves the theory that no sanctity pertains to any particular day, and applying their own teaching, he says, therefore, that by their own authority no more sacredness inheres in Sunday than any other day of the six. No divine law makes it holy. If it has ever rested with man to make choice of a rest day, the right to do so resides in him as much as in any other man, or body of men, living now, or that ever did live. He will then put his right to immediate use and choose his own rest day. He knows that legislative authority may provide holidays upon which he may rest if he chooses, but he knows just as well that no human authority can properly say that on any day he shall not work any more than that on any day he shall work. He knows by virtue of his Americanism and his manhood that no man may rightly exercise this authority. He knows that the only Sabbath law is the divine law which says the seventh day is the Sabbath, and if he accepts the word of his pastors and masters that this is not binding, do they expect to be able to exercise greater authority over him than God, whose injunction they have taught him to despise, and by so doing have turned him over to himself and the devil? American workingmen are not likely to deify any of their fellow-citizens and pay them divine honor, just yet. Therefore if not respecting the divine law which they know has never been repealed, how can they be expected to respect a human law which they know can not possibly have any divine authority and properly no human authority? And if they respect the divine law they certainly can pay no regard to the human law which is a usurper, and in contravention of the divine. This the workingmen learn from the self-styled Protestant preachers, and it is reinforced to them by the words of the learned clergy of the Roman Catholic Church, who tell them "there is no command in the Bible, which directs the observance of Sunday." It is Roman Catholic canon law and from that the Protestants have borrowed it. That Sunday is a Christian institution is an error,—"In the strict sense of the word it was not instituted either by Christ or his Church. It is not ordered by divine law, nor was it ordered by the Church. Constantine decreed the observance of Sunday in order to give the Christians a chance to compete with the pagans, and recognizing it as a good thing the church in her subsequent councils adopted it. At the Reformation the Protestants carried it off." Their attempt to compel the acceptance of the Sunday dogma by recourse to law "is a grievous departure from their old battle-cry of civil and religious liberty." Has it come to this, that Protestant America must sit at the feet of the Roman Catholic priesthood to learn not only church history, but civil and religious liberty?
