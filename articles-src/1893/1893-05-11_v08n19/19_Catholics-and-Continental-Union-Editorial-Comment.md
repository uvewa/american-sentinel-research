THE ARTICLE PRINTED ON ANOTHER PAGE FROM THE NEW YORK SUN SHOWS ABOUT AS plainly as anything could the subserviency of the press of this country to the Roman hierarchy. It is true as the Sun states that Quebec might become a member of the Union and still continue to pay tithes to the Roman Catholic Church, but that this fact should be held out as an inducement to the Romanists of that province to intrigue for political union with the United States is, to say the least, significant. It shows by how slight a tenure is liberty of conscience held in our American States. Only let party aggrandizement or political necessity require it and how soon politicians would consent to sweep away every guarantee of religious equality in our land!

The Romish camel already has not only his head but a considerable part of his body in Uncle Sam's tent; and it seems now only a question of time when he will occupy it all. Such papers as the New York Sun are contributing not a little to this undesirable consummation.
