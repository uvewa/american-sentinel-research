AN ARTICLE ON ANOTHER PAGE OF THIS PAPER ON "THE TENDENCY OF MODERN, LIBERAL, THEOLOGICAL THOUGHT," CONTAINS MUCH FOOD FOR REFLECTION. THERE PREVAILS IN THE WORLD TO-DAY A SORT OF WISH-WASHY SENTIMENTALISM THAT SUBSTITUTES SENTIMENT FOR PRINCIPLE AND THEN INSISTS THAT EVERYBODY SHALL DO HOMMES TO IT REGARDLESS OF THE PRINCIPLE.

TO THIS SICKLY SENTIMENTALISM IS DUE THE WORLD'S CONGRESS OF RELIGIOUS. This sentiment also manifests itself in the popular demand for Church union, very inappropriately called Christian union. Christian union is union with God through the Spirit, not simply organic union, nor even the so-called union upon a sentiment which involves a surrender of principle. No religion demands such loyal adherence to truth as does Christianity, and no system involves more disloyalty to eternal verities than does this modern scheme for "Christian union;" it is not in the interests of truth but of human pride. It delights not in fidelity to principles, but deals in high-sounding titles, in grandiloquent speeches, and in numbers of three periods. Its motto is, "Man's proper object of worship is man;" and of course no more fitting representatives of the genus homo can be found than the prime movers in the scheme itself. Those who are in harmony with God need not concern themselves about harmony with others; they will naturally find themselves in unison with the children of God everywhere. The less they have in common with error the better.
