Is it a good thing to meet our legislators face to face, to encourage, influence by hopes and fears, urging them to do right?—*The Christian Statesman* of Feb. 23, '93, three times, sufficiently tells of hopes and fears.

Now this sounds all well enough, and indeed the suggestion rightly followed would lead many good to a better condition of things publicly than we now see. Papers could be which would be true, for good and wise men gave assistance in that direction.

But an application of these "suggestions" that is that they should be made in the line, with very boastful results not only to encourage the very legislators themselves, and the body politic in particular. This becomes evident from the fact that an acknowledgment that is made that "every legislature and every court of justice" is "influenced by hopes and fears" as well as the legislative. That bible being a bear special recognition, and "suggestion" his need of more than human wisdom to guide him in making laws for a nation. If you please, of both the suggestions and these legislators in a way that showed that the blind and themselves and the Government had the same. Who this "suggesting" has been done in the past and after the manner is so admirably advocated by the *Statesman*.

We have in the same issues some of these "suggestions" of "courtesy as represented by the speech of Rev. W. H. Bobbitt, made before the Committee on Judiciary of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. After the preliminaries and the courtesies of the case this man said:

We appear before you not to instruct you in your civil duties, neither to persuade you to the faithful discharge of your duties as legislators. But your convictions of what is right and proper in all legislation, can rise no higher than your conceptions of your own rights and obligations. We present relative to official duties, no persuasion to the faithful discharge of your duties, but your own convictions of what is right and proper, I would want to say that if I were back able to force to come else also as he had voluntarily conferred that to him his religion have save the "assurance of sympathy" which he fully "appreciated" as a recognition "persuasion" and "antagonism, the pastor stands for the right."

As to his reasons for appearing before that and legislators body he presented these:

*But why do we come to you simply because we were asked for, and because we believe it to be right.*

Since he stated that his sole purpose was justified in that line his sole proposition is a somewhat vague in what way it might matter the right and proper right. And this was the answer: "Because we were asked for, which the answer was plain, because for our church, which is undoubtedly the intention. It was requested in the interests of the legislature, by calling their attention to a trivial to conceal his true purpose under the guise of what he called not "suggestions." Then followed with such words of "instruction" or "persuasion" his efforts to afford for parallels in this Nation. In speaking to these legislators this polite reverend gentleman said:

He dreamed had received their authority, he said:—

Now whence comes this authority to you? From God! You can not create authority. It must come from God. And he alone can give to one man the right to decide, direct, or control his fellowman in the matters of right and wrong. It is God's authority. You are acting in his name. You are his ministers and you are his servants. How full of solemnity, then, is the trust committed to you.

Now if there was not a goodly amount of "instruction" and "persuasion" and "antagonism" in this, and if this is not a most potent "instruction and persuasion" then some "purpose" of "instruction" and "derogatory" it is hard to see the force of words.

Now of this sort of instruction and persuasion in the matter of rights and obligations of men in this country the legislative body needs none by the Desalogne. You are empowered and required by the Constitution of this State and the constitution of the civil magistracy to place upon the same that the Constitution of this country knows nothing of. The Constitution of the United States Government knows no God.

For downright instruction and persuasion this man of "pastors" has been quite successful, and the pastor here takes up again the matter of civil duties and admits to this. The legislators are the "servants" of God, responsible to him (not law) to their fellow-men, and having knowledge that a hundred-fold more responsibility than a hundred men in things that makes up the civil character of a man in the eyes of the law of the State. How admirably different all this is in the history of the Congress in the interpretation of our Constitution, and how remarkably it is just quickly the "assurance of sympathy" becomes "instruction" and "persuasion" uttered to persuade those men not to act within civil relations but in a religious character. Let the reader for a moment think that God, the Maker of all men has never given any man, set of men, the right to by hands of in continuing force nor rest on any day he shall not choose and that legislators are to be instructed, led, reminded, directed, shown or helped to interpret the law of God and causes such interpretation to be forced upon the conscience of men? Has it come to that the "pastors" of the United States have only to utter such "instruction" and "persuasion" it will actually follow? If it is so. And the "hopes and fears" that influence those men to do this are demonstrated to be none other than the "hopes" of office and the "fears" of not getting or retaining it unless they yield to such "instruction and persuasion." The *Statesman* has given, unavoidably it may be, a perfect example of how all influence is used.

C. A. WYMAN.
