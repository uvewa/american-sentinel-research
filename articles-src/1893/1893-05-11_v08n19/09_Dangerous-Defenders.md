The newspapers report that in South Carolina a young woman has been excommunicated from a Presbyterian Church because her engagement in a telephone company requires her to render telephone service on Sunday, and that in Pittsburg, Pa., the business manager of a daily paper has been fined for publishing a Sunday edition. A few months ago a Sabbatarian in Tennessee was fined by the courts for working on his farm on Sunday; he felt himself compelled by his conscience to observe the seventh day instead of the first as his Sabbath. These cases illustrate a curious ignoring of the function of law in its relation to the religious life. That function is not to compel righteousness, but to protect rights.

It is true that the fourth commandment forbade any manner of work; and that under that law a man was put to death for gathering fuel on the Sabbath day. But the Israelites had just been released from slavery, and their condition had been one of continuous and unbroken toil. The Sabbath day of rest was given them as a boon, not imposed upon them as a burden; but in order that all might possess the boon it was necessary to protect it, at the outset, with vigorous regulations, and enforce them with severe penalties. And in a community in camp, essentially an army on the march—and this was the condition of Israel in the Wilderness—a strictness of rule is required which in a community settled in homes would be unendurable. But even in the Wilderness the Sabbath was, legally, merely a day of rest. The fourth commandment required no religious observance; it simply prohibited toil. Christ did not abolish the day; nor did he so much enlarge its liberties, or modify its character, as to give it a new and divine interpretation. He walked out with his disciples on the Sabbath, cured the sick, hid the healed carry his bed, approved his disciples as they gathered the wheat and ate it while they were walking through the wheat-field, and went as an invited guest to a dinner-party of considerable social importance. He gave the key to the right use of the Sabbath in his memorable saying, "The Sabbath is made for man, not man for the Sabbath." The familiar distich,

> This is the day the Lord hath made,
> He calls its hours his own,

exactly reverses the facts. God gives us six days in which we are to serve him; he sets apart one day in which he serves us and prepares us to render our service during the next six days. The Sabbath is a man's day, and he has a right to its privilege; a right, too, to have the protection of both State and Church for this day; but also a right to be left free to use it according to his own judgment and conscience, provided that use does not interfere with the rights of others. Something might be said for a State which fined a farmer who called on his farm hands to work on the Sabbath, or for a church which excommunicated the president of a telephone company who required his employés to operate the telephone on the Sabbath. But to fine a farmer for quietly plowing his own land, or to excommunicate a young woman for being the medium for the transmission of telephonic messages for such as wish to send them, is to contravene the spirit of Christian liberty and misinterpret the legitimate function of both State and Church. Whether it is legitimate to plow the land or operate a telephone on Sunday are questions we do not here discuss. We only insist that so long as these operations are carried on in a way not to interfere with the Sabbath rest of others, neither State nor Church has any right to interfere.—*Christian Union.*
