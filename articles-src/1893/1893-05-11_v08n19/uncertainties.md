# Uncertainties — v08n19 (1893-05-11)

## Associate Editor Name

- **Location:** 00_masthead.md, line for Associate Editors
- **Issue:** OCR reads "CALVIN P. HOLLMAN" but the known associate editor is C. P. Bollman (Calvin P. Bollman). "HOLLMAN" appears to be an OCR error for "BOLLMAN."
- **Transcribed as:** "CALVIN P. HOLLMAN" — preserved exactly as OCR output to flag for review against original scan
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "BOLLMAN"

## Article 03 — Author Signature

- **Location:** "Sunday Measures in California," final line
- **Issue:** OCR reads "A. O. Taft." The known author with these initials is A. O. Tait. "Taft" is likely an OCR misread of "Tait."
- **Transcribed as:** "A. O. Taft." — preserved as printed; flagged here
- **Confidence:** LOW — very likely OCR error; same author signed correctly as "A. O. Tait." in article 11

## Article 04 — "Nebuchadneszar" Spelling

- **Location:** "The Sure Result," first paragraph of historical section
- **Issue:** OCR reads "Nebuchadneszar" — likely OCR misread of "Nebuchadnezzar." Preserved as printed.
- **Transcribed as:** "Nebuchadneszar"
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly a misread of the standard spelling; may also be an archaic variant in the original

## Article 07 — Title of Bill (OCR Corruption)

- **Location:** "Church and State," first paragraph
- **Issue:** OCR reads "making 64-Death-breaking a misdemeanor" — clearly corrupt OCR. The context (a Sunday law bill) indicates this should read "Sabbath-breaking" or "Sunday-breaking."
- **Transcribed as:** preserved exactly as "64-Death-breaking" to flag corruption
- **Confidence:** LOW — underlying word is almost certainly "Sabbath-breaking" or "Sunday-breaking"

## Article 07 — Author Name

- **Location:** "Church and State" (reprint from St. Paul Daily News), final signature
- **Issue:** OCR reads "H. F. FHELPS." The "F" before "HELPS" is likely an OCR artifact; the name is probably "H. F. PHELPS."
- **Transcribed as:** "H. F. FHELPS." — preserved as printed
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely "H. F. Phelps"

## Article 12 — Author "W. A. SPICER"

- **Location:** "They Knavishly Miss the Mark," final signature
- **Issue:** W. A. Spicer is not in the known authors list. This appears to be a genuine contributor not previously catalogued.
- **Transcribed as:** "W. A. SPICER" — preserved as printed; initials used as "WAS" in filename
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — legible signature, no known variant

## Article 15 — "TECAGOGUE" (OCR Corruption)

- **Location:** "The Judefind Sunday Case in Maryland," second paragraph (all-caps section)
- **Issue:** OCR reads "FOURTH COMMANDMENT OF THE TECAGOGUE" — clearly corrupt. Should read "DECALOGUE."
- **Transcribed as:** preserved exactly as "TECAGOGUE" to flag corruption
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "DECALOGUE"

## Article 15 — All-Caps Paragraphs

- **Location:** "The Judefind Sunday Case in Maryland," second paragraph
- **Issue:** OCR renders a long paragraph in ALL CAPS. This may reflect typographic emphasis in the original (e.g., small caps or bold text), or it may be an OCR artifact. Preserved as rendered.
- **Transcribed as:** ALL CAPS as in OCR
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 18 — "HOMMES" (OCR Corruption)

- **Location:** "The Tendency of Modern, Liberal, Theological Thought (Editorial Comment)," first paragraph
- **Issue:** OCR reads "everybody shall do HOMMES to it" — likely OCR corruption of "homage" or "obeisance."
- **Transcribed as:** "HOMMES" — preserved as printed to flag
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "homage"

## Page 3 Date Header

- **Location:** Running title area, Page 3
- **Issue:** OCR reads "May 11, 1895." The correct year for this issue is 1893. This is an OCR misread of the running date in the original scan.
- **Note:** Not transcribed into any article; noted here for completeness.

## California Legislation Dates

- **Location:** Article 03, "Sunday Measures in California"
- **Issue:** The approval dates in the California legislation read "Feb. 27, 1895" and "March 23" — these dates appear anachronistic for a May 1893 article. The year "1895" in "Approved Feb. 27, 1895" may be an OCR misread of "1893." Preserved exactly as in OCR.
- **Confidence:** LOW — dates are likely OCR errors for 1893
