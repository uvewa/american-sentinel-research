# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, May 11, 1893 (Vol. 8, No. 19)

## General Notes

This issue presented significant OCR challenges. The scans are B&W at 300 DPI but the text is very dense in three-column format with small type. Many passages required multiple reading passes and some remain uncertain.

## Article 01: "The Fair and Sunday Closing" (WHM)

### Page 1, Column 1
- **Transcribed as:** "Only a small and uninfluential minority has stated and defended the principle"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "stated" could be "stood" or another word; the small type makes this ambiguous
- **Second pass completed:** Yes

### Page 1, Column 1
- **Transcribed as:** "to call the nation Israel into court to refuse Christian men testify before them"
- **Confidence:** LOW — This sentence is very difficult to parse; the meaning is unclear and several words may be misread
- **Second pass completed:** Yes

### Page 1, Column 3
- **Transcribed as:** "The dragon can not always masquerade under the similitude of the lamb. He roars what sometimes betray it."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "He roars what sometimes betray it" reads oddly; may be misread

### Page 2, Column 1
- **Transcribed as:** "fully exercise this authority"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The column break between pages 1 and 2 makes continuity uncertain; text may be missing between "citizenship in the" and "fully exercise"

### Page 2, Column 1
- **Transcribed as:** "recognizing it as a good thing the church in its resources altogether made up"
- **Confidence:** LOW — This phrase seems garbled; the original may read differently

## Article 02: "An Historical Study" (GEF)

### Page 1-2, Throughout
- **Obstruction:** Dense text in small type across multiple columns
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM overall — The philosophical terminology and historical references are difficult to verify against the scan
- **Specific concern:** "Ammonia Saccus" may actually read "Ammonius Saccas" (the historical figure); transcribed as printed but confidence is low on exact spelling

### Page 2, Right column
- **Transcribed as:** "Almon or Alemmone"
- **Confidence:** LOW — These names are very difficult to read in the scan

### Page 3, Left column
- **Transcribed as:** "Gravatt says"
- **Confidence:** LOW — The name could be "Gravatt" or something else

### Page 2, Right column
- **Transcribed as:** "the error of the second Neo-Platonists"
- **Confidence:** LOW — End of column text is cut off; continuation uncertain

## Article 03: "Sunday Measures in California" (AOT)

### Page 3, Middle column
- **Transcribed as:** "approved $22d"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — Likely "$22d" meaning "22nd" but could be a different number

### Page 3, Middle column
- **Transcribed as:** Legislative text sections
- **Confidence:** HIGH — Legislative language is more standardized and easier to verify

## Article 04: "The Sure Result" (PAR)

### Page 3-4
- **Transcribed as:** "naturely prevails"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "naturely" may be "naturally" with letters obscured

### Page 4, Left column
- **Transcribed as:** "Congress saying the first day of the voice of God from Mount Sinai, is things saying"
- **Confidence:** LOW — This sentence is very difficult to parse; almost certainly contains reading errors

## Article 05: "Not the Best Way"

### Page 4, Throughout
- **Transcribed as:** Multiple passages about Grant and Sunday laws
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The quoted text from the Philadelphia *American Sentinel* is dense and difficult to read precisely

## Article 06: "Dangerous Suggestions" (CAW)

### Page 4-5
- **Transcribed as:** "Rev. W. H. Bobbitt"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The name may be slightly different

### Page 4, Middle column
- **Transcribed as:** "the Desalogne"
- **Confidence:** LOW — This word/name is very unclear in the scan

## Article 07: "Church and State"

### Page 5, Throughout
- **Obstruction:** Very dense text with multiple sub-items
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The Minnesota Parker bill section and the various short items are readable but some transitions between items are unclear

### Page 5, Right column
- **Transcribed as:** Quebec/French Canada content
- **Confidence:** LOW — The New York Sun reprint about Quebec is very difficult to read accurately

## Article 08: "Dangerous Outgrowths"

### Page 6, Left column
- **Transcribed as:** Entire article about church discipline, telephone service, Tennessee case
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The general argument is clear but specific wording in several sentences is uncertain

## Article 09: "Shackles That Remain"

### Page 6, Middle column
- **Transcribed as:** Thomas Jefferson quote from "Notes on Virginia"
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the Jefferson quote (well-known text), MEDIUM for surrounding editorial commentary

## Article 10: "Religious Sentimentalism"

### Page 6, Right column
- **Transcribed as:** Content about the *Apocalypse* and fellowship
- **Confidence:** LOW — This article was extremely difficult to read; the word "Apocalypse" may refer to a different publication or concept; multiple sentences may be substantially misread

## Article 11: "Editorial Notes"

### Page 8, Throughout
- **Transcribed as:** Various short editorial items
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — These items span multiple pages and some continuity is uncertain
- **Specific concern:** "Catholic Baccivret" is likely misread — this word is unclear in the scan
