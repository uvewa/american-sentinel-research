It has suddenly been discovered that the island of Trinidad is very much in need of a Sunday law, and the Governor has been requested to petition to Great Britain. One enthusiastic advocate of the measure, writing to the *Trinidad Mirror,* says:—

A large majority of the population, Mr. Editor, earnestly desire a Sunday law; and we respectfully express the hope it is to be hoped the authorities will lose no time, as the matter is urgent, to introduce without hesitation into office the ordinance to make Sunday what it should be; not at all a mere holiday.

Mark the closing words of the quotation; this gentleman wants Sunday made "not a mere holiday." What then? Evidently a day of holiness by ordinance! Another correspondent of the same paper declares:—

We believe the whole scope of Christian ethics is in the attendance of the first day of the week to moral observance.

Of course we want Sunday, but not in a holiday sense, not for business; but rather a narrow view of Christian knowledge.

No laws itself favor the proposed ordinance are civil only, protesting merely that any in "in some respects of the case is evidently or is enforcedly religious."

Never thinkest that "the desire of the propriety of the movement is simply to create a civil statute for those who wish to spend the day in worship to do so." It is the old plea to have the free exercise of religious worship protected from the Christian religion by act of Parliament.

As the *Mail and Express* puts it, the Attorney-General of this State has decided that "its State Fish and Game Law Christianity, more explicitly Church than Christianity." "The section of the Penal Code to which the Attorney-General refers provides:"

All shooting, hunting, fishing, playing, horse racing, gaming, or other public sports, amusements upon the first day of the week; and all commerce upon that day, of a rude or noisy character; and any labor upon that day, are prohibited.

The Attorney-General says it is the opinion of the officers concerned that its provisions do not make fishing an offense. Whose duty it is to see that no public offense is committed against the offended.

Then *Signs of the Times* says: "If this Sabbath is to be enforced as a 'sanitary measure, for the good of the public health,' why not provide, regulate on the homes for sleeping and waking? A certain amount of sleep as regulation for health. If a law of rest for one demands a law of rest for all for one day in the week, why it not for all? For the just person who prefers to rest on another day? Sunday or Sabbath laws from every standpoint are in advance upon the right; if not for the possible persecution and necessary wickedness involved in them."
