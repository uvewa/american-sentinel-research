THE Christian Statesman is opposed to bicycle riding on Sunday, but says:—

> As the solitary cycler is his own driver and conductor and requires no other person to work to furnish his Sunday pleasure, and does not make traffic, if he cures his cycle and no race is on, and does not directly promote noise and crime, the civil law should not interfere, but he should be urged to consider the laws of conscience or at least of courtesy.

Then why should the law interfere with the man who hucks corn on Sunday, or with the woman who sews? or with anybody else who attends to his own affairs without interfering with others?
