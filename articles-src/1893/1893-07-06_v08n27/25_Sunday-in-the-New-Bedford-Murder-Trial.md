THE supposed sanctity of Sunday obtruded itself even into the famous murder trial recently concluded at New Bedford, Mass., and was used by the prosecuting attorney to score a point against the prisoner, who had on a Sunday morning burned a certain dress supposed by the police to be stained with the blood of the victims. The prisoner's sister had asked what she was doing. Repeating this question to the jury, the attorney said, "Why the morning of the Sabbath should have been selected to burn that dress was sufficient to cause her to ask the question." But as "desecration" of Sunday is not a capital offense even in Massachusetts, the jury found the accused not guilty, notwithstanding the fact that she burned an old dress on that day.
