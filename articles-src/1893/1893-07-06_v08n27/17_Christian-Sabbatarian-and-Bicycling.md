THE Christian Sabbatarian is opposed to bicycling riding on Sunday, but expects the saloon cyclist to be his slave, driver and dance and require no other person to work for his earthly pleasure, and not make the Sabbath for himself, but must to directly and indirectly destroy morals and procure the sinful object. It is strange that men are willing to consider the law of convenience or at least of two codes.
