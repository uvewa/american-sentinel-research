No. 10, of the Religious Liberty Library, just out, discusses in a practical way "Religious Liberty and the Mormon Question." This tract is a complete refutation of the claim so confidently made by many that Sunday laws and anti-polygamy legislation rest on the same grounds, and are equally justifiable. It is a dispassionate arraignment of polygamy as an invasion of natural rights, and a logical defense of the right of every man to keep any day or no day as a season of rest or worship. 20 pages; price, 2½ cents. Address—Religious Liberty Association, 271 West Main Street, Battle Creek, Mich.
