THE result of the fourth century Sunday laws was that the church and sought and obtained control of the civil power. The conditions resulting from that were not different from those of the nineteenth century.

There never was but one theocracy. That was the Jewish theocracy. But when that kingdom was overthrown by Babylon the decree went forth—"Remove the diadem, take off the crown. It shall be no more until He comes whose right it is;" that is, there was not to be another until that day, the end of time, if a theocracy were set up in the name of Christ, it would result in exalting man in the place of God. That was in the fourth century, the result of which was Paul's "man of sin." 2 Thess. 2:1-5, the "Mother of harlots," of Rev. 17, which was "drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus." The history of that madness theocracy is written in bloody persecution of all dissenters.

It is the logic of the situation, and it is the simple truth. Their every action only furthers illustrates it; and their calling of names "anarchists," "rebels," "traitors," "atheists," and so on, can never disguise the abiding truth.

There is the accommodation to which we were challenged last year by the logic of a Congress requiring the closing of the Fair. It is an accommodation that could only be reached from the basis of ecclesiastical dictation or control in the affairs of the Government. And this for the plain and simple reason that on the part of the ecclesiastics it is never intended that they shall pay any respectful attention to any law or any decision that does not suit them. Therefore the only purpose for which they ever resort to other legislation or judicial procedure is that the outcome shall only be an additional weapon with which to exercise upon the people their ecclesiastical authority. And if it fail, it is at once to sweep away all really legal authority.

And all this only makes the more manifest the divine wisdom which commands the entire separation of the ecclesiastical and the civil power, which forbids the Church having anything to do with the State. It also demonstrates the wisdom of the step that made the Government of the United States, in embodying in its Constitution and its law a total separation for government—the total separation of Church and State. And this which has been done, and which is now the law of the land, the church, is not a church to any purpose whatever, when she forgets her place and her high privilege, and actually turns to governmental jurisdiction of religious observance, she, then, by so doing, and in proportion, forfeits her power of protest, and her right to dissent, her right to claim governmental consideration at all. And then in practice she refuses to let it go, that as before; according to her will she openly and intentionally disregards every authority which she herself has invoked. She thus becomes the chiefest danger and source of lawlessness, and the swiftest instrument of governmental ruin.

And this is what the Sunday leaders of the United States say; and this is the result and its tendencies for the country to-day.
