The *Sabbath Outlook* publishes itself in name and now appears weekly as the *Evangel* and *Sabbath Outlook.* Its editor, Dr. A. H. Lewis, is doing excellent work in his line. The *Sentinel,* while the *Evangel* international has a different theological standpoint, but on the subject of religious liberty and the separation of Church and State, they are thoroughly agreed.
