The Michigan Christian Advocate, in its issue of May 30, found great "cause for rejoicing" in "the action of the authorities in closing the gates of the World's Fair on the Sabbath." It is well that it rejoiced while it had opportunity; for doubtless ere this its joy has been turned to mourning; "and there shall be heaviness and sorrow," for "the end of that mirth is heaviness."

The advocates of the total separation of Church and State have long pointed out that the union of civil and ecclesiastical power leads to tyranny and paternalism, and ultimately makes a complete wreck of the government, but it also works disaster of the most ruinous character to the Church. So while the Church glories in alleged victory as it gradually edges itself into possession of civil power, it not only thrusts a thorn into its side, admits a canker to prey upon its flesh, and inoculates a most deadly poison into its system, but lays bare its very vitals to the voracious greed of that vulture whose appetite is satiated with nothing less than total consumption—the devil. Let the Church take warning before it is too late.

The Advocate further says:—

> True, it was done with great reluctance and not without tremendous pressure brought to bear from every possible direction, but it was finally done with a thoroughness worthy of the determined management.

Shall this be considered as a reproach on the work which Christ committed to his Church? He has plainly declared how his work must be done: "Not by might, nor by power [not by tremendous pressure brought to bear from every possible direction] but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." As to the "thoroughness" of the work, the word of God, which is the sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6:17) is "quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." Heb. 4:12. The Lord has provided all the "thoroughness" that will ever be called for in the work of his church.

The Advocate continues:—

> Perhaps never in the history of the world was so persistent a fight made to override the wishes of Christian people, and turn a national institution completely over to antichrist and mammon.

The wishes of Christian people do not rightly demand any more respect from the State, simply because they are the wishes of Christian people, than those of any other people. The State has only to consider what the wishes are and on what grounds they stand, and it matters not whether they come from the veriest sinner in the land or from the most righteous saint; if they are in harmony with the true principles of all State legislation they must be recognized by the State, for this reason and no other. If complying with the wishes of Christian people would lead the State to any measures subversive of the public or individual freedom of its subjects, they ought to be overridden, and trampled into the dust. Exactly the same would be true of the wishes of the un-Christian or of any citizen. The more persistent the fight in such cases the better.

As to turning a national institution over to antichrist and mammon, the latter perhaps has the first claim on the Fair; but the fact about the former is that in yielding to the wishes of the Christian (?) people the State has not only attempted to turn a national institution over to antichrist, if so be that the institution is national, but it has turned itself over to antichrist. And the Church by allowing such requests to be granted without raising a protesting voice, by making such requests herself, and by actually glorying in the granting of such requests, is hastening on apace. Having been the suitor in this adulterous union she will feel it her duty, forsooth, to hold the bond sacred.

Again, the Advocate says:—

> The infidel elements, the Seventh-day Adventists, and the reckless representatives of greed, all combined in a gigantic array of alleged arguments, some of which were plausible, to break down the authority of the Sabbath, nullify the action of Congress, and to lift the flood-gates of wickedness as an American object-lesson for the representatives of the world.

Here, again, the same principle touched on above is involved. If infidels and reckless representatives of greed are asking for the right thing on right grounds and from right motives, or protesting against wrong things done on wrong grounds, Seventh-day Adventists are glad to be classed in with them in such a work. On just what ground the infidel asks for an open Fair may be a question; but it is doubtless the recognition of an infringement, not only of his inalienable rights, but also of the rights guaranteed him by the Constitution of the United States. And right here let it be remarked that those whose minds are freest from prejudice and bias from a perversion of true religion, are often the quickest to see when the State oversteps its rightful bounds and goes to tampering with legislation entirely foreign to its legitimate sphere. Personally, the writer knows of infidels who, by reading a few numbers of the SENTINEL and using a little reason and common sense, have grasped more of the true ideas of religious liberty and liberty of conscience, than some of the most enthusiastic zealots for religious legislation probably ever will grasp.

As to "representatives of greed," it is not to be said but what their motive is gain. But in regard to Seventh-day Adventists, the character and object of their work is most grossly misrepresented. Their attitude toward the Fair is so well put by the AMERICAN SENTINEL of June 15, that it is quite needless to amplify, further than to say that they attempt neither to break down nor to build up the authority of the true Sabbath; for it cannot be broken down, and needs no building up. But as to the authority of Sunday, if that is what the Advocate meant when it uses the expression, "to break down the authority of the Sabbath," Seventh-day Adventists will forever oppose that; for the authority of Sunday is the very same authority which is making desperate efforts to protect Sunday by closing the gates of the Fair on that day.

The statement that Seventh-day Adventists are attempting to "nullify the action of Congress" is true, in the sense that they persistently protest against all religious legislation by Congress, because of the disastrous results to both Church and State, that will inevitably follow the adoption of such a course.

Seventh-day Adventists are doing all in their power to shut down the flood-gates of wickedness, the lifting of which has been too serious an "American objectlesson for the representatives of the world." It must not be denied that many of these "representatives of the world" know too well what this lifting of the flood-gates of wickedness, which are being hoisted higher and higher in this country, means. They are not without experience in this kind of work, being acquainted with it in the history of their ancestors and with the vestiges of it which still remain in their own day. And so far from America's setting a worthy objectlesson to the world by this sort of legislation, she would better learn an objectlesson from the past history of the "world" and clamp her flood-gates tighter,—the very thing which Seventh-day Adventists are earnestly beseeching her to do; not because she is legislating for Sunday and not for Saturday, as many represent them as doing, but because her legislation is religious legislation, and will ultimately, if continued, lead to legislation on more religious subjects than the Sabbath, and utterly ruin both Church and State. And they "have not yet given up the contest." Seventh-day Adventists are charged with doing the very thing the Methodists themselves are helping to do. If the charge were true, Methodists ought not to be ashamed of their company.

Seventh-day Adventists do not "propose [purpose, the Advocate doubtless means] to try every device to break the precedent and get the gates open," but they do purpose to use every honorable means to get Congress to keep its hands off of every religious question. If Congress' having nothing to do with opening or closing the gates of the Fair on Sunday, will open the gates, then it might be said that, indirectly, Adventists are working to get the gates open. But this is not the end they seek, by any means. Opening the gates would be merely incidental, should Adventists succeed in their object. But the Advocate says, "Let us hope they will not succeed." Perhaps it will change its attitude when it learns their true object. Seventh-day Adventists are really working just as truly in the interests of Methodists and all other churches as in their own, in protesting against religious legislation by Congress. The Advocate says further:—

> It is in the true interest of the workingmen that those gates be kept tightly shut every Lord's day. Were the Sabbath to be abrogated the workingmen would know no rest and probably enjoy no increased remuneration.

Let Rev. Mr. Dunnett, the Canadian evangelist, answer in the words with which he arrisings the Methodists for their aggressive attitude on the World's Fair Sunday opening: "In the name of God, my friends, as you hope to stand before the great tribunal of God, quit this sham. It is a farce. The world knows it and laughs at you." This pleading, in behalf of the workingmen, is but a piece of affected altruism. The workingmen do not, as a rule, ask nor want any such help; nor is the Church sincere in asking Sunday legislation in behalf of workingmen. It is asked in behalf of Sunday only, and hence in behalf of what she regards a religious institution. It matters not whether the workingmen do or do not want Sunday legislation, the State has no right to meddle with it. If the management want to close the Fair on Sunday in the interest of the workingmen, all right; they have a right to do what they regard as in the best interests of the Fair.

In an article in the Advocate, immediately following the one under consideration, it styles the action of the directors of the Columbian Exposition, in admitting the public to the grounds on Sunday, "a great blunder." But the truth is that the "great blunder" is made by the Advocate in supposing the "Sabbath to be abrogated" by the opening of the Fair on Sunday. It is, too, a twofold "great blunder;" for Sunday is not the Sabbath, and if it were, it could not be abrogated by opening the Fair on that day. And not only this, but this twofold great blunder is based on a profound error. The authority of the true Sabbath is not vested in the government. And right here have not Sunday observers given their case away? Their Sabbath is of such a nature and rests on such authority that they consider that if the Government closes the Fair on Sunday its sacredness will be preserved; but that if it opens the Fair on that day the Sabbath would be abrogated. Now, to abrogate, means "to annul by an authoritative act"; and as they consider that it would be abrogated, should the government allow the Fair to be open, they frankly confess that the authority of their Sabbath rests in the Government or State. They are right. It not only had its origin in the State and has maintained its existence by the State, but that State was and is a State in the most corrupt form, a union of Church and State—the Papacy. And this is the only authority it has. If its supporters recognized its real authority, they would be acting consistently in seeking the help of the State to maintain it, but nevertheless contrary to the principles of right and justice, plainly set forth in our Constitution.

But hear the Advocate again:—

> The nation would likewise take a tumble downward, for history shows that no nation has ever long prospered in open defiance of God and his laws. Decay, disaster and death surely await that people who ruthlessly trample under foot the commands of Jehovah.

Granting the truth of this statement, it is one of the very best arguments that our Nation has already lost its equilibrium and is beginning its downward course. The "command of Jehovah" is, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." Caesar's image and superscription is not on the true Sabbath, but God's is. Therefore if it is attempted to turn the Sabbath over to Caesar, it is "in open defiance of God and his laws." And there could be no better characterization of this step than dipping in a "compromising sop to Satan." It is said of Judas Iscariot that "after the sop Satan entered into him," but it does seem that in this case Satan must have entered before the sop.
