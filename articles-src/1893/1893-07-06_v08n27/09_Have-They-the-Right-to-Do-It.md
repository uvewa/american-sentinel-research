THE following from the Dispatch, of Birdsboro, Pa., illustrates the crude ideas which many people have of the powers of the GOVERNMENT:—

> The AMERICAN SENTINEL is up in arms against the religious sentiment of the day in its effort to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. It seems to see in this interference of Congress, the certainty of a union of Church and State. As to such a result, we think its fears are groundless. But admitting such to be the ultimate condition of things what is the SENTINEL going to do about it? Our law-makers are going to legislate to suit their preferences and convictions. And as perhaps a large majority of them may be believers in the sanctity of Sunday, is it not natural for them to protect the sanctity of that day? The only hope of the SENTINEL, in our estimation, is in changing the faith of the Christian Church in this respect, and then it is a question if there is much hope there. We fear that Sunday folks are joined with their idol.

It makes not a particle of difference what the religious opinions of our law-makers are, they have no right to be governed by them in their official capacity. Congress is by the Constitution prohibited from making any law "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Now if Congress makes no law setting up a single denomination as a State Church, yet by law gives certain sects and modes of worship a preference, requiring everybody, as is done by Sunday laws, to observe the "holy days" of those sects, does it not thereby violate the Constitution and interfere with the free exercise of religion? It may be as the Dispatch says, that our fight is a hopeless one, but should we for that reason abandon it? B.
