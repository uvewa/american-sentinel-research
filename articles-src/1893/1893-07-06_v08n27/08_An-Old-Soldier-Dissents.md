[In the Memorial services at Berry Centre, N. Y., on May 29, the speaker, who was a minister, exhorted the old soldiers to "war a good warfare" in behalf of "the American Sabbath." One at least of his bearers, and an old soldier, failed to recognize the fitness of such a discourse on such an occasion, and disagreeing with the theology of the speaker, replied to him as follows in the Elmira Telegram.]

THE so-called "American Sabbath" is wholly unscriptural, and to enforce its observance by law is productive only of evil. Let right, truth, and liberty prevail in all things regardless of "institutions." That "Jesus Christ is ruler of this world" is not now true. He is the rightful heir of the world, but is now acting as our high priest and intercessor, awaiting the time appointed of the Father, as abundantly shown in prophecy; then he will return to earth, break in pieces like a potter's vessel all the wicked kingdoms of Satan that now rule in this world, establish his own kingdom and reign here personally forever.

Seeing men differ so widely in their understanding of the Bible, if it should be the basis of all our legislation, who has God appointed to be an infallible expounder thereof, that all may know the truth? Whose exposition is to be accepted by all others, whether they believe it or not? Must those who believe differently be compelled to conform to another's dictum? What kind of "religious liberty" is that? Law can make hypocrites in the outward observances of forms and ordinances, but law cannot reach the heart to make men better.

The official head of which of the leading denominations of America has Christ appointed to be his vicegerent here, to execute his rulership of this Nation? Is it Bishop Simpson, Dr. Talmage, Leo XIII., Dr. MacArthur, or some other man? Robert Ingersoll is said to be a good, kind, law-abiding citizen, and he fought for the preservation of our Union, with civil and religious liberty; and—as far as law is concerned—should have an equal right to believe or not to believe, and advocate his own views. Law is for the protection of our liberties and our rights of citizenship; not to bind religious dogmas upon us. "The American Sabbath" is well so-called, for it is man-made. There is no record that God ever made an American Sabbath, but he did sanctify and bless a certain day, viz., the seventh day, Saturday. There is not one word in the Bible showing Sunday to be more sacred than any other day; therefore men should cease insulting God by robbing this holy day of its prestige, sanctity and authority to bolster up a man-made "American Sabbath." Having full liberty to love and observe their Sunday, ought to satisfy them without calling on soldiers to war a good warfare in binding on men a counterfeit Sabbath. Let soldiers, as they love the liberty for which they fought, never by word or deed assist in foisting bigoted-born, religious legislation on men to bind their consciences, but let us "war a good warfare" to sustain the much vaunted assertion that this is truly "the land of the free and the home of the brave."

R. ANDREWS.
