JUNE 26, two more Adventists, M. A. Bryan and Geo. W. Marvell, were arrested at Ford's Store, Queen Anne's County, Md., for Sunday work. Maryland seems determined to outdo Tennessee in the nefarious work of religious persecution. As usual all the facts connected with these cases show that the arrests were made to satisfy religious bigotry. The warrants were both sworn out by members of other churches.
