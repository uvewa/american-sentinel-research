Perish the thought, that any "*Mail and Express*" is by no means the only paper that is guilty of the inconsistency of favoring Sunday laws while it is published as a Sunday paper. We are glad that the Lord has not told us, like the *Mail and Express,* for we understand that he hates his hypocrisy.

Every man's free and highest allegiance in this world is due to his Creator. It is man's duty to God and not merely to man. It is for this reason that no man can, as of right, assume the dictation of another relating to his duty toward God.

for his paper on that day—but in what other way could that paper so confidently give items of news and published in the press generally, and which could in the very nature of the case be gathered on any other day?

Now it is alone in the Windy City that the reporters of the *Mail and Express,* the employees of the *Mail and Express,* the employers of the Union, ruthlessly trample upon the first day of the week. In their edition of the fourth commandment which says that the first day, the Sabbath, the following join of Harrison, serve up, the *Mail and Express* of the Monday.

And it is about this same are there really between 160th Street and Harlem River and 59th Street and North River some two hundred newsstands at which Sunday newspapers are sold. The blinds were down, but the sale went on. And this practice strikes at the very core of the policy. A "Mail and Express correspondent" tells us that there were in his immediate neighborhood, in less than ten minutes yesterday afternoon, and Sunday papers were being sold.

Of course it is possible that a reporter might, on his way to church, be run over by a car or a horse carried out of a saloon; but could he pass this multi-tidinous display, knowing that at least twothirds of the five hundred newsstands on the west side were open? Certainly not. It is painfully evident that, in New York City, reporters for *Mail and Express* gather their news on Sunday, and that employees of the *Mail and Express* sell their goods on that day. Yet neither the *Mail and Express* nor the *Mail and Express,* on its own account, proposes to close its own Sunday department.
