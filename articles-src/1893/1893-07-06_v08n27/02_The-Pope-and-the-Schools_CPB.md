THE POPE HAS WRITTEN ANOTHER LETTER ON THE SCHOOL QUESTION IN AMERICA, IN WHICH, WHILE HE REAFFIRMS THE DECREES OF THE THIRD PLENARY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE, AND DECLARES THAT "Catholic schools are to be most sedulously promoted," HE SAYS THAT "IT IS TO BE LEFT TO THE JUDGMENT AND CONSCIENCE OF CATHOLIC PARENTS TO DECIDE WHEN IT IS LEGAL AND WHEN UNLIMITED TO ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO ATTEND PUBLIC SCHOOLS." TO THIS LANGUAGE THE MAIL AND EXPRESS TAKES EXCEPTION, SAYING, THAT IT "IS TO DECLARE, WHAT WE INDIGNANTLY REPUBLIATE AND RECENT, THAT TO ATTEND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IS UNLAWFUL. OUR LAWS," CONDINUES THE MAIL AND EXPRESS, "DO NOT LEAVE SUCH QUESTIONS TO THE JUDGMENT AND CONSCIENCE OF INDIVIDUALS. THE PROPRIETY AND AUTHORITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE DETERMINED BY THE EXPRESSED WILL OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE. IF WE HAVE NOT SURRENDERED THIS POWER OF DETERMINATION TO INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS, THEN CERTAINLY THE POPE HAS NO RIGHT TO CONFER SUCH A POWER, WHETHER FOR POLITICAL OR ECCLESIATICAL CONSIDERATIONS. TO ATTEMPT SUCH A THING IS AN IMPERTIMENT INTRUSION THAT WILL MEET WITH THAT SPIRITED PRESENTMENT WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS VISIT UPON THOSE WHO WOULD ENCOACH UPON THEIR LIBERTIES AND PRIVILEGES."

AS IS FREQUENTLY THE CASE, THE POPE IS RIGHT AND THE MAIL AND EXPRESS IS WRONG. Evidently THE EXPRESSION, "DECIDE WHEN IT IS LAWFUL AND WHEN UNLAWFUL," HAS REFERENCE NOT TO CIVIL, BUT TO ECCLESIATICAL LAW. THE POPE SIMPLY LEAVES IT WITH THE CONSCIENCE OF THE PARENT WHETHER HE WILL SEND HIS CHILD TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL OR TO THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOL; AND THAT IS JUST WHERE IT SHOULD BE LEFT. WE ARE NOT DISPUTING THE RIGHT OF THE STATE TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, OR EVEN TO INSIST THAT ALL CHILDREN SHALL HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN A COMMON SCHOOL EDUCATION; BUT TO DENY CATHOLICS THE RIGHT TO EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE IN THEIR OWN SCHOOLS WOULD BE TO DO A MONSTROUS WRONG; IT WOULD BE "OUT-HERODING HEROD."

THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NECESSARILY SECULAR; THEY GIVE ONLY SECULAR INSTRUCTION. THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT MORAL AND SCIENTIFIC TRAINING SHOULD GO TOGETHER; AND IN ORDER THAT THEIR CHILDREN MAY BE TAUGHT IN THIS WAY, THEY MAINTAIN PRIVATE OR CHURCH SCHOOLS, IN WHICH RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IS GIVEN. THIS IS THEIR RIGHT, AND TO DEPRIVE THEM OF IT WOULD BE A MOST UNWARRANTED EXERCISE OF GOVERNMENTAL POWER. THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM NEVER CONTEMPLATED SUCH A THING, AND NO TRUE AMERICAN WOULD TAKE SUCH A POSITION. IT IS AN OMINOUS SIGN OF THE TIMES THAT SOME SO-CALLED PROTESTANTS ARE READY TO ASSERT FOR THE GOVERNMENT SUCH DESPOTIC POWER, POWER VITERIY SUDVERSIVE OF THE MONSTEATS AND WEDEMOCRATS AS WEHRECKDY SUSTAINS THIS VIEW. NOR WILL THE COMMUNITY REGARD WITH FAVOR ANY RELIGIOUS OR SOCIAL WAY ON THE COMMON SCHOOLS, OR ANY JUDISE OF PUNISHMENT OF THOSE WHO ELECT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THEM.

TO WARGE A SYSTEMATIC WARFARE AGAINST THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING FROM SIMPLY MAINTAINING PRIVATE SCHOOLS FROM CHOICE, OR IN OBEEDANCE TO THE DICTATES OF CONSCIENCE. IT WILL BE A SAID DAY FOR AMERICA WHEN PARENTS ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR OWN WAY AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE.
