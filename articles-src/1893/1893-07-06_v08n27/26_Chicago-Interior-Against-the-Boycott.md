It is gratifying to know that some at least, of those who are zealous for Sunday closing of the Fair do not fly into a fit of resentment on learning that the Fair is to be open, and widen what they consider a breach of the law, by identifying themselves with worse than contract breakers, namely, with conspirators—who are criminals—and by urging upon all "Christian people" the imperative duty of boycotting "an institution which debases itself by desecrating the Sabbath in violation of the law of God and the law of the State." The Chicago Interior (Presbyterian), after setting forth the evils, in its view of Sunday opening, especially the disgrace sure to revert upon Chicago, queries thus:—

> But shall we boycott the Fair? Not unless we wish to give our sanction to the worst development of anarchistic tyranny. The Fair is ours. The people paid for it. Because we cannot prevent abuses is no reason why we should be deprived of just and lawful uses.

This is condemning the dishonorable boycott in even stronger language than has the SENTINEL, but no stronger than it deserves. The evil indicated is all in it. The use of the boycott is virtually an attempt to cover up by a really great evil what those who employ it simply consider an evil, but which is not so in reality.

In fact this whole work of securing Sunday legislation is a veritable piece of Jesuitical sophistry—that the means is justified by the end. Without speaking of how the means might work vastly more harm than could be compensated by the end, even if the end were a good one, history, reason, and the Scriptures force the conclusion that the end of Sunday legislation is evil. No one will allow that righteous means will produce evil results. Then, since the means is evil, and the end is evil, where can the good come in? "Do they not err that devise evil?"
