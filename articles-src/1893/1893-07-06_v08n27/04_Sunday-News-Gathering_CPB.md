WE ARE VERY MUCH AFRAID THAT THOUGH THE MAIL AND EXPRESS PUBLISHES NO SUNDAY EDITION,—AND NO EVENING PAPER EVER DOES,—IT IS NOT KEEPING SUNDAY AS IT WANTS OTHER PEOPLE TO KEEP IT. IN ITS EDITION OF MONDAY, JUNE 26, IT GAVE THIS ITEM OF NEWS CONCERNING THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION ON THE PREVIOUS DAY:—

THE LIST OF EXHIBITS CLOSED WOULD FILL TWO PAGES OF THE MAIL AND EXPRESS. TWO-THIRDS OF THE NEW YORK STATE EXHIBIT WAS ENTIRELY COVERED. TWENTY-EIGHT OF THE STATE BUILDINGS AND SHIPMENT NATIONAL BUILDINGS WERE CLOSED TIGHT. EVEN THE MOST INDIFFERENT OF THE VISITORS COULD NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE EXPASSED ORGANIZATION OF CLOSED OR COVERED EXHIBITS. THE NUMBER OF CLOSED FOREIGN DISPLAYS CAUSED GENERAL COMMENT. ALL THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT EXHIBITS WERE CLOSED. NONE OF THE PROMINENT NEW YORK VISITORS WERE TO BE SEEN ABOUT THE GROUNDS DURING THE DAY.

PERISH THE THOUGHT, THAT ANY "MAIL AND EXPRESSMAN" WAS "DESCRATING" THE "AMERICAN SABBATH" BY GATHERING NEWS for his paper on that day—but in what other way could that paper so confidently give items of news not published in the press generally, and which could in the very nature of the case be gathered only by observation?

Nor is it alone in the wilds of the Windy City that the reporters of the Mail and Express, the employés of the estate of the late President of the American Sabbath Union, ruthlessly trample upon the first day of the weed and break the revised edition of the fourth commandment which reads, "The first day is the Sabbath." Witness the following item of Harlem news, from the Mail and Express of the same Monday:—

It is stated that there are nearly five hundred saloons between 100th Street and Harlem River on the East side, and yet it is safe to assert that at least two-thirds of them were in full blast all day yesterday. The blinds were down, but the side doors were open and liquor was sold and carried away under the very eyes of the police. A "Mail and Expressman" saw two cans of beer carried from a saloon near the 126th Street police station in less than five minutes yesterday afternoon, and no attempt was made at concealment.

Of course it is possible that a reporter might, on his way to church, see two cans of beer carried out of a saloon; but could he, with that limited observation, know that at least two-thirds of the five hundred saloons, in a given district, were open? Certainly not. It is painfully evident that, even in New York City, reporters of the Mail and Express gather news on Sunday, and that while that journal would suppress the Sunday paper, it does not, on its own account, suppress Sunday news gathering for the Monday paper. We are afraid that the Lord does not like the Mail and Express, for we understand that he hates the hypocrite.
