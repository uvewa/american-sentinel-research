STRIFE for civil power on the part of the great religious bodies is now not only possible but inevitable in this country. This was so in the fourth century in Rome; and it is now equally true here. The very same steps that were taken at that time, have been taken here to lead up to this strife and contention.

Constantine professedly espoused the Christian religion. This he had a right to do; but he went beyond this. He went beyond his rights as a ruler. He had imbibed the old pagan idea that a ruler was to be considered as the "guardian of the public morale." And so by virtue of his position as ruler he said the religion of his choice should also be that of his empire. Thus, that which he, Constantine, called the Christian religion, became the imperial religion—the religion of his empire. This made it possible for the great contending religious elements to seek control of the civil power claiming that their religion was the Christian religion. And this resulted in the final supremacy of the greatest religio-political combination the world has ever seen.

The parallel is before us in this country. Justice Brewer believes in what he is pleased to call the Christian religion. This is just as far as he has any right. He may espouse any feature of any religion he may please, and put any interpretation he may choose upon his creed, if he has one. But he has no right either constitutionally or morally to decide that his religion is the religion of the Nation. When Justice Brewer, representing the people, clothed with judicial power received from the people, goes so far as to accept the old pagan idea that a ruler or judge is "the guardian of public morals," and decides that "this is a Christian Nation," thus saying that this religion is the religion of the Nation, to the exclusion of all others; he transcends the powers granted to him by the people, usurps rights and powers retained by the people, and makes an image to that Church and State despotism which has cursed the world for ages. The very first quotation which Justice Brewer gave to prove his position, was from Catholic authorities. Now his decision that "this is a Christian Nation," and his arguments, give an opportunity for the Catholic Church to come in and claim the country by virtue of the precedence of their church, their religion, over all others. And thus will be inaugurated a strife for power on the part of Protestants on the one hand, and the Catholic Church on the other, such as was never seen since the Dark Ages. Already is seen evidences of the coming struggle. Soon, very soon, "old controversies which have apparently been hushed for a long time will be revived, and new controversies will spring up; new and old will commingle, and this will take place right early." "The storm is gathering, the clouds are loading, ready to burst upon the world." And none will be more surprised than Protestants of this Nation when they see how they have paved the way for the subversion of all our country's rights, to the power of Rome, the foe of all our free institutions.—*H. F. Phelps, in Mankato (Minn.) Ledger.*
