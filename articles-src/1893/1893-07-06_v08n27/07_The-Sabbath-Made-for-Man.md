It is often argued that the Sabbath was made because man needed a weekly period of rest. This statement is based on the words of Christ, in answer to the question of the Pharisees when the disciples were plucking corn on a certain Sabbath day, "Behold, why do they on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful?" Christ's answer was, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." Did he mean by this that the Sabbath was made for man because he needed physical rest? That was not what the Sabbath was made for. God rested on the seventh day; but was it because he was tired and needed rest? In Isaiah 40:28 we have these words: "Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?" So it was not because he was weary that he rested "from all his works which he had made."

Then the question comes, Why did God rest on the seventh day? Because "in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is." His work was finished, and so he rested because it was finished. One of the definitions of "rest," given by Webster, is: "A cessation from motion or labor." So it was with God; he ceased from labor, or rested, on the seventh day.

"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God had created and made." The Sabbath is holy, because God sanctified it, and to sanctify anything is to set it apart for a holy purpose; so it is in this sense the Sabbath was made for man—for his spiritual and not his physical rest.

In Exodus 31:12-14, we find the Lord commanded the children of Israel on this wise: "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep my Sabbath, therefore; for it is holy unto you." Now, if the Lord made the Sabbath for man's physical rest, why did he not here command them to rest because they physically needed it? Instead, he told them to rest because the day was holy, and because it was a sign between himself and them. A sign of what? A sign that those who keep the Sabbath are the children of God; so to say that the Sabbath was given for physical rest takes all the sanctity from it. It does not tend to draw men nearer to God, and think of him as the Creator of all things, but men keep the Sabbath for selfish ends—to rest because they are tired. They think of self and not of their Creator. He who keeps the Sabbath as the Lord has bade him keep it, does not think of self; he does not rest because he is tired, but because in the Sabbath of the Lord, the day that God sanctified, there is a blessing for him, and he feels that blessing each Sabbath. It is to him the memorial of God's wonderful power in creation. The popular teaching by the clergy and others that the Sabbath was made for physical rest is one of the reasons why those professing to serve God do not reverence his Sabbath. People are led astray by those professing to be their teachers by such arguments to prove the sanctity of a day in the place of the one God blessed and called his day.

The following, from the Nashville Christian Advocate, is a fair sample of the arguments used to show that the Sabbath is a necessity from a civil standpoint:—

> If the Sabbath was made for man, then he needs it, and cannot get along without it. He needs it just because he is man. His constitution—physical, intellectual and moral—is such that it is impossible for him to dispense with the weekly period of rest without suffering damage in many ways. The law of the Sabbath is, therefore, of perpetual force. Given in the Decalogue, it is thus reaffirmed in the Gospel, and holds good for all time. The Christian accepts it as a divine institution, and keeps it for the fear and love of God.

"The law of the Sabbath is, therefore, of perpetual force," because it affords physical rest, says the Advocate. This is not biblical. After telling the children of Israel that the Sabbath was a sign between God and his creatures, and that it was holy, the Lord said, "Wherefore [for this reason], the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant." But the Advocate begs to differ with the Lord. It further says, "Given in the Decalogue, it is thus reaffirmed in the gospel." But does the Advocate keep the Sabbath given in the Decalogue? It does not. It keeps Sunday which is not the Sabbath at all. The fourth commandment says, "the seventh day is the Sabbath," but Sunday is acknowledged by all to be the first day of the week. The Advocate not only keeps Sunday itself, but teaches men to violate the command of God and observe it also; and uses such arguments as the foregoing to prove that the State should compel everyone to keep it. After speaking of the Sabbath as it was given to the children of Israel,—the purely religious Sabbath, as it calls it, the Advocate says:—

> So much for the purely religious Sabbath. With it the State has and can have nothing to do. But it is, nevertheless, the fact that the State, recognizing the practical importance of the Sabbath as a civilizing force, invest its observance with the sanctions of human law. This is not specifically in the interests of religion; it is simply a matter of public policy, and looks to the temporal welfare of the community. The Sabbath thus guaranteed by the State—and it is so guaranteed in nearly every American Commonwealth—is a political institution, a part of the law of the land, to be upheld and supported by civil authority, as really and truly as the laws protecting life and property. While it is of great value to all citizens, it has a special worth to the laboring classes. Any attempt to break it down or set it aside is really hostile to their interests. The abolition of the civil Sabbath means seven days' work for six days' pay.

There is no civil side to the Sabbath of the Decalogue; it is a purely religious institution, given for a religious purpose.

Sunday is, in a sense, a civil institution, because it was ordained by man; but it is, nevertheless, a church dogma, and therefore the State should have nothing to do with it. The Sabbath of the Bible and Sunday, the Sabbath of man, are two entirely different things. The one—the seventh-day Sabbath—is the Lord's, given that men might remember him as the Creator; the other—Sunday, or the first day of the week—is Satan's, given to draw men away from the Sabbath of the Lord, that they may be forever lost as he himself is.
