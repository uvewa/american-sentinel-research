The result of the fourth century Sunday laws was ruin to the church that sought and obtained them; and nothing but ruin can come from those of the nineteenth century. The same false theocratical theory prevails to-day among National Reformers, with the same object, namely, to dominate the State in the interests of the Church.

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union teaches that a "true theocracy is yet to come, and humanity's weal depends upon the enthronement of Christ in law and law makers." Once more: "The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law through the gateway of politics." Now put up against this the words of Christ himself: "My kingdom is not of this world."

There never was but one theocracy; that was the Jewish theocracy. But when that kingdom was overthrown by Babylon the decree went forth: "Remove the diadem, take off the crown. It shall be no more until He comes whose right it is, and I will give it to Him." Now from that day, to the end of time, if a theocracy should arise, it would be man-made, and would result in exalting man in the place of God. This was so in the fourth century, the result of which was Paul's "man of sin." 2 Thess. 2:1-6; the "Mother of harlots," of Rev. 17, which was "drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus." The history of that man-made theocracy is written in bloody persecution of all dissenters.

A little theocracy was set up in the wilds of New England, and the result was persecution; whipping the Baptists and hanging the Quakers. And those who have imbibed this false theocratical theory are seeking by the same means, namely, Sunday laws, to dominate the State to compel those who do not belong to the Church, to act as though they did. The Sunday theatre, the Sunday trains, the Sunday newspapers and Sunday games are like the ancient circus, competitors of the Church. The churches of to-day cannot bear competition; they want a monopoly. They have set out to secure a monopoly in the same way as the ancient church and, like the mother church, they will follow on, even by persecution, to compel all others to do as they do. Speaking of Sunday trains, etc., one of the leading workers among these reformers, M. A. Gault, says: "Our remedy for all these malific influences, is to have the Government simply set up the moral law, and recognize God's authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it." Mr. Edwards, D.D., says: "We want State and religion and we are going to have it." The Christian Statesman says: "Enforce upon all who come among us the laws of Christian morality." This language plainly says, "enforce," "lay its hand on any religion," except their own. This means persecution.—*Publius, in McIntosh Times, Minnesota.*
