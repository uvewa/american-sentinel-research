THERE is much truth in the following paragraph from the Nashville Christian Advocate, of June 15:—

> Nothing is more protean than the spirit of selfishness; it takes on a thousand forms and guises. Many people are saturated with it who imagine themselves to be perfect models of generosity. It is not identical with the greed for money, or place, or pleasure, though it frequently manifests itself as covetousness, as ambition, and as sensuality. The essence of it consists in the determination to have one's own way, without regard to the wishes and rights of other people.

These words are exactly descriptive of those professing Christians who are clamoring for Sunday laws. The Sunday movement is selfish throughout. The ministers think nothing of other people's rights so long as their pet day is exalted. The Advocate truthfully says the essence of selfishness "consists in the determination to have one's own way, without regard to the wishes and rights of other people." Why does not the Advocate practice what it preaches? In an editorial in the same issue it attempts to justify the State in passing Sunday laws on civil grounds,—because man requires a weekly rest-day. The right to rest at a certain time belongs alone to the individual. Sunday laws, on whatever plea, interfere with the rights of some, and therefore those who ask for them are selfishness itself. They are Christian only in name.
