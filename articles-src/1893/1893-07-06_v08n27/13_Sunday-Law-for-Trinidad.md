It has suddenly been discovered that the island of Trinidad is very much in need of a Sunday law, and the Governor has been requested by petition to furnish one. One enthusiastic advocate of the measure, writing to the Trinidad News, says:—

> A large majority of the population, Mr. Editor, are in favor of whole day closing on Sunday, and it is to be hoped the authorities will lose no time, as soon as the petitions are presented, in passing and carrying into effect the ordinance to make Sunday what it should be—a day of rest and holiness.

Mark the closing words of the quotation—this gentleman wants Sunday made a day of holiness by ordinance! Another correspondent of the same paper declares:

> We believe the whole scope of Christian ethics is to distinguish the Lord's day from the Jewish Sabbath.

Of course he wants Sunday, but not in the same way some others do. His is however a rather narrow view of Christian ethics.

The News itself favors the proposed ordinance on civil grounds, though admitting that "in some respects of the case it certainly is a religious question." The News thinks that "the desire of the promoters of the movement is simply to render it easier for those who wish to spend the day in worship to do so." It is the old plea to have the cross and the self-denial eliminated from the Christian religion by act of Parliament!
