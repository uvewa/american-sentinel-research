THE EDITOR OF THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN HAS BEEN OPERATING RECENTLY IN MASSACHUSETTS, AND AS OBEWHERE THE INQUISITION SPRINGS UP ALONG HIS TRACK. THE THING IS CALLED A SUNDAY PROTECTIVE LEAGUE. ITS OBJECTION IS STATED TO BE—

TO REPRESENT SABBATH-BREAKING, INTERMEDIATE AND IMPURITY, BY HOLDING PUBLIC MEETINGS, BY DISTRIBUTING TITERATURE, AND BY THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS.

AMONG OTHER THINGS, ARTICLE 5, OF THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THAT—

THE SECRETARY SHALL APPOINT AN INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE OF FOUR, KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF, THE FIRST OF WHOM SHALL ON THE FIRST WEEK OF EACH MONTH, THE SECOND ON THE SECOND, AND SO FOLLOWING, SECRETARY PERSONALLY WHAT VIOLATIONS—FIRST, OF THE CIVIL LAW, SECOND, OF THE HIGHER LAWS OF GOD—ARE IN PROGRESS, AND REPORT FULLY IN WRITING TO THE SECRETARY WHO SHALL IN TURN INFORM THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, SO FAR AS HE CAN WISSEY SO SO, AS TO VIOLATIONS OF THE STATE LAW, AND THE BOARD AS TO THESE AND ALL OTHER WRONGS RELATED TO THE WORK OF THIS ORGANIZATION.

THE SENTINEL HAS BEFORE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THESE LEAGUES, AND TO THIS SCHEME OF SEPIONAGE BY SECRETARIES UNKNOWN EVEN TO EACH OTHER, AND OF COURSE UNKNOWN TO THOSE AGAINST WHOM THEY ARE TO INFORM. IT IS A COWARDLY SCHEME DESIGNED TO DEFENT THAT WISE PROVISION OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL LAW THAT THE LEGAL AND MILITARY INJURY MUST BE HELD IN THE MOST HIGHESTLY ANNUAL PERFORMANCE.
