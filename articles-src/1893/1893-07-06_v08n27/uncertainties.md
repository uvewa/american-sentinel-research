# Uncertainties — v08n27 (1893-07-06)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. Several passages show obvious OCR degradation, particularly in articles set in ALL CAPS on pages 2–3 and in the short notices on pages 7–8.

---

## Page 2 — "The Pope and the Schools" (02_The-Pope-and-the-Schools_CPB.md)

Several passages in this article (which the OCR rendered in ALL CAPS) are garbled. The following are noted:

- **"REPUBLIATE AND RECENT"** — likely "REPUDIATE AND RESENT"
- **"CONDINUES"** — likely "CONTINUES"
- **"ECCLESIATICAL"** — likely "ECCLESIASTICAL" (appears twice; preserved as OCR has it since it may be original spelling)
- **"IMPERTIMENT INTRUSION"** — likely "IMPERTINENT INTRUSION"
- **"ENCOACH"** — likely "ENCROACH"
- **"VITERIY SUDVERSIVE OF THE MONSTEATS AND WEDEMOCRATS AS WEHRECKDY SUSTAINS THIS VIEW. NOR WILL THE COMMUNITY REGARD WITH FAVOR ANY RELIGIOUS OR SOCIAL WAY ON THE COMMON SCHOOLS, OR ANY JUDISE OF PUNISHMENT"** — this entire passage is heavily garbled OCR. The underlying text likely reads something like: "utterly subversive of the most sacred rights we possess as freemen. [Something] sustains this view. Nor will the community regard with favor any religious or social war on the common schools, or any device of punishment" — confidence VERY LOW. Second pass completed; OCR too degraded to reconstruct with confidence.
- **"OBEEDANCE"** — likely "OBEDIENCE"
- **"SAID DAY"** — likely "SAD DAY"
- **"TO WARGE"** — likely "TO WAGE"

## Page 3 — "The Inquisition in Massachusetts" (03_The-Inquisition-in-Massachusetts.md)

This article also rendered in ALL CAPS by OCR. Several garbled passages:

- **"AS OBEWHERE THE INQUISITION SPRINGS UP"** — likely "AS ELSEWHERE THE INQUISITION SPRINGS UP"
- **"TITERATURE"** — likely "LITERATURE"
- **"SECRETARY PERSONALLY WHAT VIOLATIONS"** — likely "REPORT TO THE SECRETARY PERSONALLY WHAT VIOLATIONS"
- **"CAN WISSEY SO SO"** — heavily garbled; likely "CAN WISELY DO SO" or similar
- **"SEPIONAGE"** — likely "ESPIONAGE"
- **"DEFENT"** — likely "DEFEAT"
- The final sentence beginning "IT IS A COWARDLY SCHEME..." through "...ANNUAL PERFORMANCE" is heavily garbled OCR. The underlying meaning is that the scheme defeats constitutional provisions regarding accusers being known to the accused. Transcribed as found; confidence VERY LOW.

## Page 3 — "Sunday News-Gathering" (04_Sunday-News-Gathering_CPB.md)

- **"EXPASSED ORGANIZATION"** — likely "EXPRESSIVE" or "EXPECTED" something; exact word unclear
- **"DESCRATING"** — likely "DESECRATING"
- **"the first day of the weed"** — clearly OCR error for "the first day of the week"
- **"arrisings the Methodists"** — page 4 continuation; likely "arraigns the Methodists" — transcribed as found

## Page 4 — "Is it a 'Cause for Rejoicing'?" (06_Is-it-a-Cause-for-Rejoicing.md)

- **"W. E. HOWELL"** — appears at the very end after a closing quotation. It is unclear whether this is the author of the whole article or a person being quoted in the closing paragraph. The article reads as one continuous piece; the final sentence "'We still hope that this disreputable scheming may, by some process, be stopped.' W. E. HOWELL." may be a closing self-attribution or an editorial device. Treated as an unsigned editorial with the closing attributed quote preserved in the body text.

## Page 7 — Advertisements (skipped)

Pages 7–8 contain advertisements for Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods, Religious Liberty Library, a pocket speller, Eagle Brand roofing, Everybody's Law Book, Abiding Sabbath and Lord's Day, and The Medical Missionary. These were not transcribed as article content per standing instructions.

## Page 8 — First item (19_Receiving-the-Sentinel-Unsolicited.md)

The opening notice on page 8 is very heavily garbled by OCR. The text reads:

> "BY JAY ONE HONKYING THE AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some travel, unless plainly omitted," Sampled Gaffney..."

This is clearly a standard boilerplate notice about sample copies, but the OCR rendering is essentially unreadable. The gist is that readers who receive the paper unsolicited should know it is a sample copy and they will not be billed. Transcribed as found; confidence VERY LOW. Second pass completed; OCR too degraded to reconstruct.

## Page 8 — "Christian Statesman and Bicycle Riding" (21_The-Christian-Statesman-and-Bicycle-Riding.md)

- **"if he cures his cycle"** — likely "if he rides his cycle" or similar; OCR error

## Page 8 — "Alfred Mallett" attribution

The author "ALFRED MALLETT" appears at the end of "The Sabbath Made for Man." In the known authors list, "Alfred Mallet" (one 't') is listed as uncertain (possibly "Alfred Mallett" with two 't's). The OCR renders "ALFRED MALLETT." Transcribed as found.

## Attribution: "B." in "Have They the Right to Do It"

Article ends with "B." — this initial does not match any known author in the known authors list. Flagged for review.
