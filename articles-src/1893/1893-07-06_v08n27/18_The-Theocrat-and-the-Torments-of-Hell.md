A NATIONAL Reform paper, The Theocrat, published at Johnstown, Pa., is very much disturbed because the World's Fair is open on Sunday; and blaming wicked editors, that is, editors who do not agree with The Theocrat, for the present dilapidated condition of governmental religion, our contemporary loses its temper and says:—

> Ungodly editors may rejoice because iniquity triumphs, but they should not forget that when their bodies are rotting in the grave and their souls are writhing in the torments of hell, that the truth of God will go marching on until the devil and all his followers shall be entirely overcome.

Now, this shows bad theology as well as bad temper, and both are very far from becoming in Christians. Peter and John were rebuked by their divine Master for wishing him to call down fire upon his enemies; but The Theocrat would do worse than call fire down upon those who do not agree with it upon the question of Sunday observance; it would consign them to the torments of the "orthodox" hell. The wish is father to the thought, and shows that the average National Reformer is a good man not to trust with power to punish "heretics."
