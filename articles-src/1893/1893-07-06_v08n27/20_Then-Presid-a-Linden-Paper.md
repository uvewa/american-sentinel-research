Then *Presid. a Linden* paper, says this note: "A joint committee of the two bodies of Mail and Express subscribers have made an elaborate report on Sunday recreation and the Sunday opening of museums. In the main they make no objection. They thought, however, that it is vital to the safety of the 'English Sabbath' and of the American home and institutions."
