N. B. CAPPS, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Wesley County, Tenn., was found guilty on the 17th ult., of maintaining a nuisance by Sunday work. We are not yet able to tell the outcome the case will take. This case was referred to in these columns two weeks ago in the Carroll County cases. The mistake was due to the fact that the convicting news of the arrest was written from Trezvant, which is in Carroll County. The statement was made that "N. B. Capps, a Seventh-day Adventist has been arrested here," etc. Our friends are requested to be very definite in giving us information.
