THE Signs of the Times says: "If the Sabbath is to be enforced as a hygienic measure, for the good of the public health, why not regulate by law the hours of sleeping and waking? A certain amount of sleep is requisite to health. If a law of rest for one demands a law of rest for all for one day in the week, why is not that just as true concerning the hours of the day? Sunday or Sabbath laws from every standpoint would be a roaring farce were it not for the possible persecution and necessary wickedness involved in them."
