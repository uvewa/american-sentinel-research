THE Michigan Christian Advocate, is in ecstasy that "the US Circuit Court gave occasion for rejoicing" in "the action of the authorities closing the gates of the World's Fair on the Sabbath." It is well that it rejoiced while it had opportunity; for evidences are this its joy has been turned into disappointment, its dancing into heaviness, and sorrow," for "the end of that mirth is heaviness."

Church and State have long pointed out that the tendency of all merely human power leads to tyranny and persecution, and not only works evil upon the affairs of the government, but it also works the other way of the most vital character to the Church. So while the Church's glories in whatever virtue or so-called religion as State's possession of civil power, it not only affords a theme on this side for the State, a codicil to prey upon its faith, and also introduces a more deadly poison into its own system, that forever fastens upon it the voracious greed of that vulture whose appetite knows no appeasement short of total consumption—the devil. Let the Advocate further says—

The sad page after page of history, in which without trembling, can then be witnesses promises brought to bear upon the work which Christ committed to his Church. He has plainly declared how his work must be done: "Not by might, nor by power [not by temporal power, not brought to bear from every possible direction] but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." As to the "thoroughness" of the work, the word of God, which is the sword of the Spirit (Heb. 4:12) is "quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." Heb. 4:12. The Lord has provided his "thoroughness" that will ever be ample for for the work of the Church.

The *Advertiser* continues:—

Perhaps some in the know of the world was put upon it as a spiritual power amongst the Christian people, and turn a nominal institution into a real one, by a faithful application of spiritual means.

The wishes of Christian people do not get their sanction nor come power from the State, simply because they are the wishes of Christian men, than those of any other people. The State has only to concern itself that its laws are obeyed. Morality, as between God and man, concerns grace through the State, and it matters not whether the influence from the external acts in conformity or opposition to religious standards. If they are in harmony with the natural rights of man, they should be recognized by the State, for this is the State's proper province. But to claim for the State that it should enforce the wishes of Christian people would lead inevitably to confusion and to an extinction of public or individual freedom, or to the establishment of a despotism unstinted and trampled into the dust. Exactly the same course that the concern is the concern of every citizen. The more persecution the fruit of the earth. The more trampled.

As to arriving at a national institution by a "faithful application of spiritual means," and at national conversion, the latter would be the proper thing to do; but the real fact about the former is that in undertaking to arrive at it through the people the State has not only attempted to control all the people who are not Christian, if not to that the institution is national so far as its Christianity is antichristian. And the Church by allowing it, allowing the State to do so thereby forming a prosecuting voice, by making such formations, and by actually allowing herself, nationally, to be so, thereby gives authority in the gradual making the creature and the tool of the civil power, having been the author and the means, to hold the bond sacred, and divest herself of its guilt.

The infidel elements, the Seventh-day Adventists, and the saloon—let us not forget that unsavory array of alleged segments—that unholy trinity of opposers of the nation's righteousness and the Fair's regulators and its to fix the Rod of wickedness upon a righteous people.

Again, the same, the more principle of religious opinion acts in concern. If infidel elements, saloon keepers greed and selfish, and Seventh-day Adventists are all held to be on the same ground, then the right of one in the line of observation is equal to the right of one in the line of protest from natural rights, or protesting against religious enactments, then the religious opinion cannot be used to enforce the law. Seventh-day Adventists are a God-fearing, temperate, law-abiding people. On just what ground the infidel asks for an open Fair the pious to say he asks it doubles the recognition of an infringement. But on the other hand in rights and laws of this government are granted him just the same as the so called Christian, all that is wanting is a clearer recognition of the rights of all and of the truth that those whose minds are free from prejudice, are often the quickest to see the truth. The Sunday closers, of course, are the interested parties; the opponents are often the quickest to see the truth and correct perspective; and those interested, are often the quickest to judge and go to tampering with things that do not rightly come within their own sphere. Personally, the writer knows of Seventh-day Adventists to be among the best people in the world.
