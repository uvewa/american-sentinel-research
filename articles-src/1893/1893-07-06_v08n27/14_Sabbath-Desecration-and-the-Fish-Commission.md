As the Mail and Express puts it, the Attorney-General of this State has decided that "the State Fish and Game Law Commission must prevent Sabbath desecration." The section of the Penal Code to which the Attorney-General refers provides that—

> All shooting, hunting, fishing, playing, horse racing, gaming or other public sport, exercises or shows upon the first day of the week, and all noise disturbing the peace of the day, are prohibited.

The Attorney-General says it is the duty of the State Commission and its officers to see that this provision is not violated so far as it relates to hunting and fishing. Whose duty it is to see that nobody takes any public exercise is not stated.
