THE Present Truth, a London paper, has this note: "A joint committee of the two Houses of the Convocation of Canterbury have made an elaborate report on Sunday recreation and the Sunday opening of museums. In the main they make no objection. They thought, however, that it is vital to the safety of the 'English Sunday' that no library, museum, gallery, etc., should be open for pay. They think that free opening, to a moderate extent, is compatible with the spirit of the fourth commandment, but utterly fail to indicate how there can be any possible connection between the fourth commandment and the English Sunday."
