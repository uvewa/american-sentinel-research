SUNDAY opening of the Columbian Exposition does not appear to be the great success that was anticipated. June 25, the paid admissions were only 62,028, while for the three preceding days the average attendance was 120,000.

THE advocates of Sunday closing, from a religious standpoint, of course seek to make it appear that the small Sunday attendance is largely due to the respect which the masses entertain for the day itself; and in some communities this might be accepted as the proper explanation, but it is scarcely true of Chicago. The true reason will probably be found in the fact that on Sunday twenty-eight State and thirteen national buildings are closed, while a large number of individual exhibits are covered.
