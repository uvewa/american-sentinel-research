At a union meeting held in the Hebron, Pa., Lutheran Church, on the 18th ult., a paper was adopted, without a dissenting voice, part of which is given here:—

> It is with profound sorrow and sense of humiliation that we have heard of the decision of the Appellate Court declaring the gates of the Columbian Exposition open on the Sabbath. We deplore this action and utter our solemn protest against the profanation of the holy day for purposes of gain that is contemplated. We recognize the fact that the struggle on behalf of the Sabbath in this country is not ended, and we pledge ourselves anew to do what lies in our power to maintain and defend the law of the Lord in regard to a day of rest.

Is it ignorance or is it wilfulness on the part of these people? They pledge themselves anew to do what lies in their power to maintain and defend the law of the Lord, and yet they violate his law week after week. They work on the Sabbath enjoined in the Decalogue, and observe another day. These same people, when told that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is still binding upon Christians, will tell us that the law is abolished. This is inconsistent. Christians can never be the means of converting unbelievers so long as they are not consistent in their teachings.
