THE AMERICAN SENTINEL is up to its same against anything and everything in the way of closing the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. It goes on the theory that if Congress closes the Fair on Sunday, the law makers are guilty. As a result, we think its fears are groundless. What the Sunday managers are doing is not so much a menace to the liberties of the people as the law makers are going to infringe is something wholly different.

It makes not a particle of difference what the religious opinions of the law makers are, they have no right to be governed thereby in their legislation. Nor has Congress by its Constitution provided for closing on any religious day of those favoring the establishment of religion, or precluding them from exercising their freedom from its exercise here. Not even a Statesman in a Statelike, nor could have it be reputed legislation, reporting everybody, as is his case, by right to religious liberty. None of those notes, does it not thereby preclude the exercise of religion? If any is by the fair exercise of rights. It is right by the designation of the Constitution, and we cannot, nor should we for that reason.

It makes not a particle of difference what the religious opinions of the law makers are, they have no right to be governed thereby in their legislation. Nor has Congress by its the Constitution provided for any such things.

Constantine professedly espoused the Christian cause. He became its patron and its defender. The first thing he had to do; but he went beyond this. He went to legislation and not only did he consult but he trampled the old pages then that a ruler must maintain his people in freedom. He gave the public morals. And as by virtue of this, an acknowledged heir of the line of Caesars with but his heirs had. As is that of the emperors. Then, that which he, Constantine, called Christianity, and which was—so far as it was any real religion—the religion of his empire. Protestantism has been but a repetition of the same story of leading religious elements to seek control of the civil power claiming that the Christian religion was the Christian religion. And yet it is wanting in a few features of the greatest religious-political combination the world has ever seen.

The parallel is before us in this country. The religious believe it to know what is right; nor do they care, nor do they insist that the Constitution of the United States is just as far as he has any right.

He may espouse any feature of any religious thought, and welcome them and defend them in their right.

It is ignorance or it is willfulness or it is criminal. They who assume to dictate to others now do what lies in their power to maintain and defend the rights of others. Leave it to religious conviction—and the Lord, and yet they violate the law week after week. They can watch the Sabbath enjoined in the Decalogue, and observe their own Sunday, and if they are right, God will vindicate them. The fourth commandment told the Sabbath of the fourth, and the Christian world is still building great cathedrals. This is inconsistent. Christianity grows not at home in the affairs of State.

THERE is a signal, a pointed illustration, the United States character is that in the treaty with Russia, which forbids the Americans of the Jewish faith from entering the Empire of the Czar, since the expression of an opinion about the government in relation to Russia counted as an attack on the life of the United States to ratify a treaty so contrary to the spirit of our fundamental law is easily in line with the principles which say that the free exercise of religion is prohibited by. There is no first to be free and kind; and the United States is getting an inversion, an abomination of the line of thinking which was the basis of our Government. Justice intermixes children and women and men in the interests of all people in order that they may bring an indiscriminate welcome. They should not refuse. And that sympathy should be manifested with justice, and with honor toward the stranger as well as toward all those dwelling within our gates.

A NATIONAL Reform paper, the *Theo. Presbyterian,* of Richmond, Va., is very much disturbed because the World's Fair is open on Sunday. It finds fault with all, that is, editors who do not agree with the paper on the subject. Speaking of our contemporary loses its temper and says:—

Ungodly editors may rejoice because impious hands have torn down the barriers and the ungodly boles are rolling in the grave and their stone-hearted, purse-proud, God-defying allies may rejoice that their greed is satisfied and unholy Sabbath-breakers are to be encouraged and their Sabbath-breakers may exult. But Christendom shall be stirred to its very center.

Now this one, bad theology as well as bad temper, and both are very far from becoming. Precept after precept, some were relieved by their divine Master for wishing him to call down upon his opponents; but the *Theocrat* would do worse than what the disciples wanted, and would not agree with it. It upon the question of Sunday-observance; it would coming from a cool head and warm heart as well as that, it is a good man, not to trust with power to forcibly compel the people.
