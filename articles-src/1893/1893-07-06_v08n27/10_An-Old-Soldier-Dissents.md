[In Memorial services at Berry Conner, N. Y., an old soldier was asked, without a dissenting voice, to speak in behalf of the "American Sentinel." One at that memorial said he had always been a Protestant and wanted to say something in favor of the principles of civil and religious liberty, as set forth in the Constitution, and dissenting with the theology of the majority of the churches of the day.]

The so-called "American Sabbath" is wholly unscriptural, and to enforce its observance by law is wholly un-American. Let right, truth, and liberty prevail in all things.

"Jesus Christ is ruler of this world!" you say. Not now. He is the rightful heir to the world, but is now sitting at our Father's right hand, waiting for the day that shall be the crisis of the ages, and now, in prophesy; then he will return to take his kingdom; "and the kingdoms of all the wicked kingdoms of Satan shall be cast into his lake of fire, and Satan's kingdom and reign here perennially forever. Seeing men either are wholly on his or Satan's side, should we not be as fearful of defrauding the living of liberties, if Satan has had no fear of defrauding all of liberty?"

"Is it law? Can make hypocrites by outward observances of forms and ordinances, but law cannot touch the heart; no man can make men better."

The Christian band of which of the leading denominations of America being clearly pointed to be his corporate here, to cite in the ranks the ruling of Allen S. Johnson or Mr. Johnson, Yr., by Talmage, Joel Miller, Mr. McAllister, or some other man of prominence, as the American church recognized, as the nation is to be recognized, the law-abiding citizen, and he fought for the principles of true Americanism—including religious liberty; and—as far as we know he believed he was allowed and right if not to believe, and to advocate his own views. Laws are for the protection of our liberties and our rights of citizenship; no just-minded ruler could disagree on this point.

The "American Sabbath" is well said—well said, yet it is at the same time sadly, for it is man made. There is no question about it: it is man's work. Christ died for the Sabbath, but he did sanctify and bless a day—the seventh day, the Lord's holy day. There is not one word in the Bible showing Sunday to be more sacred than any other day; therefore men should come modestly by nothing that robs our day of the prestige, sanctity and authority to belong to a man-made, "American Sabbath." Having full liberty to live and observe their Sunday, ought to satisfy them; setting up human laws that make it criminal—an offence in law to labor—placing men in the position of slaves in landing on men a counterfeit Sabbath. Let soldiers, as they love the liberty, for which they fought, never by word or deed assist in foisting bigotries that cannot possibly be in accord with their consciences, but let us "war a word and try" to sustain the country's religious liberty.
