IMMEDIATELY after the decision of the Court of Appeals permitting the Fair to be opened on Sundays, Attorney-General Olney was credited with the opinion that as every appropriation made by the Government was coupled with the Sunday-closing proviso, the decision might result in closing permanently every Government exhibit, and that in any event no more Government money could be used for the Fair. Now it is stated that the Attorney-General is of the opinion that the several appropriations made by Act of Congress, approved August 5, 1891, in aid of the World's Fair, Chicago, including the appropriation made for a Government exhibit, "are as available now as before the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals permanently opening the World's Fair on Sunday," with the single exception that no more money ought to be paid to the Illinois corporation known as the "World's Columbian Exposition."
