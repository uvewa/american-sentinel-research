A few more Advocates, M. E. Church, W. W. Marvill, et al., arrested at Easton, Queen Annes County, Md., for Sunday work. Maryland seems determined to outdo Tennessee in the infamy of religious persecution.

As usual all the facts connected with these cases show that the arrests were made to satisfy religious bigotry. The reasons were both, over work, not to members of other churches.
