THE advocates of Sunday closing, from a religious standpoint, of course need to make it appear that the small Sunday attendance is largely due to the respect which the masses entertain for the day itself; and in some communities this might be accepted as the proper explanation, but it is scarcely true of Chicago. The true reason will probably be found in the fact that on Sunday twenty-eight State and thirteen national buildings are closed, while a large number of individual exhibits are also covered.
