N. B. CAPPS, a Seventh-day Adventist of Weakley County, Tenn., was found guilty on the 27th ult., of maintaining a nuisance by Sunday work. We are not informed what course the case will take. This case was referred to in these columns two weeks ago as being in Carroll County. The mistake was due to the fact that the letter conveying news of the arrest was written from Trezevant, which is in Carroll County. The statement was made thus: "N. B. Capps, a Seventh-day Adventist has been arrested here," etc. Our friends are requested to be very definite in giving us information.
