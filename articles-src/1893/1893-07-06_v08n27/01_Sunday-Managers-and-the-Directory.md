THE Sunday managers resorted to the United States courts and got swamped the first thing. "All" they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."

They called upon the courts to decide their question. And the courts did decide it. And now they refuse to accept the decision which their resort to the courts, and now refuse to accept the decision because it is not what they wanted.

Well, they, as they are determined to have it their own way anyhow, what in the world did they want with the courts in the first place? All they ever wanted the courts as a tool in enforcing their demands and their will upon the property and people of the United States. And having failed in that, Bishop Merrill, for the Methodist Church and other "denominations," announced that they will pursue a "civic" means that "makes the World's Fair will be a financial failure." Was there ever, or could there be, a clearer case of "rule or ruin"? It is true that Bishop Merrill has since discovered that he could not carry the whole Methodist Board with him in that; but this does not affect the principle, nor indeed change his disposition. Neither have all these demonstrations "changed the situation."

They unqualifiedly denounced the Directory of the Fair as "anarchistic" and their action as "violation of law," and "anarchy" is conspicuous and rebellion in character;" etc., etc., at their pleasure when the Directory opened the gates on Sunday in pursuance of what they supposed to be a proper interpretation of a law of which Judge Grosscup—the only judge of the lower court who was right— said that it was "so ambiguous that it required a construction of the law-officers of the Government; so ambiguous that of the three judges sitting, there is a difference of opinion between them respecting its effect. And now these very ones themselves openly and intentionally disregard the plain decision of the United States Court which they themselves called for!"

Now if the action of the Directory in construing a law "so ambiguous," was "anarchistic" and "rebellious," then what is the action of the church managers who are intentionally disregarding the plain and unmistakable decision of this high court, whose jurisdiction they themselves invoked? Judge Grosscup plainly declared: "In local corporations to be left to law knowers precisely what is meant, when this court is divided as to what is its meaning" "it is not fit or room for any such inquiry in behalf of the action of the church managers in the demanding the closing of the court which is not at all ambiguous, and about which there was no division of the court. There was ample room for the Directory to act innocently in what they did. There is no room whatever for the church managers to act innocently in what they are doing in this matter.

The Directory stated plainly beforehand that they would abide the decision of the court. And they are doing this; not doing wrong they would accept it in good faith and conform to it in good faith. But neither before nor after, did the Sunday managers make any such statement. In place of that, they announced beforehand that they will not of any such thing; but will make the Fair "a financial failure;" and all because that, in the law proceedings which they had required, things did not happen to accomplish their purpose to rule the country. Of course it is always understood that especially the party in a case that takes legal proceedings shall accept in good faith the final decision. With the other party it is not necessarily so; for he may be dragged into it, and forced into court by the course of the initiative, and he is not bound to accept any decision because the whole procedure may be one of compulsion, and therefore wrong from the beginning.

Now with the initiative it is as not. It is in the nature of things, it inheres in the very idea of legal government, that the party who resorts to the law, the party who begins legal proceedings, shall accept in good faith the final decision. Otherwise there is no use of legal government; violence becomes the only procedure, and might is the only source of appeal. And that is anarchy indeed.

Now it is the everlasting truth that the Sunday party did take the initiative, and have kept it, from the first inception of the act of Congress clear up to this final decision of the courts. And now, instead of accepting the final decision in good faith, they do not accept it at all; but resort to violence. The party of the second part, the party that was dragged into the proceedings into court, freely announces beforehand that if the decision is against them, they will accept it in good faith, and act conformto it. The party of the first part, the party who takes and who have held the initiative from the beginning, openly disregards and refuses to accept the final decision, and boldly announces beforehand its purpose to make this the ruination of the Fair. And then they will make the Fair "a financial failure." And also the ones who so manifestly deserve the cognomens of "anarchistic" and "rebellious"!!

The sum of the whole matter is this: It is essential to the very idea of constitutional legal government that the party who takes the initiative in legal proceedings shall accept in good faith, and so conform to the final decision; not to do, and not to act the same as though there had been no decision after the final decision has been made, is in itself to renounce legal government and is essentially anarchistic and rebellious. The Sunday party in this case has been from the beginning, the party of the initiative in this the legal procedure. This party instead of accepting in good faith the final decision, openly ignores it and refuses to receive its benefits; completely and refuses to receive—the boycott—that decisions has been rendered; it therefore follows invariably, and the demonstration is complete, that the matter is truly the action, and the only one, which is indeed "anarchistic and rebellious."
