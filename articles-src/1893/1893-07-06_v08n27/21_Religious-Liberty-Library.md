No. 10, of the *Religious Liberty Library* just out, therefore, is a practical way. "*Religious Liberty and the Mormons*" Christianity. This tract has a single justification of the claim so confidently made by the *Mail and Express,* Sunday and religious legislation rest on the same grounds, and are equally justifiable. It is a disposition, an arrangement of polygamy on the basis of natural rights, and a logical sequence of the right of man to keep any day of the week as a day a season of rest or worship to papers. 16 pages.
