THERE is quite a general protest in the United States against the clause in the treaty with Russia, which binds the American Government to extradite refugees accused of attempts on the life of the Czar, since the expression of an opinion adverse to the Government is in Russia construed as an attack on the Czar. But those who protest do not seem to realize that such an action on the part of the United States Government is exactly in line with the principles which many of them are advocating. Where the free exercise of religion is prohibited by law, there can be no freedom of any kind; and the United States is getting an unenviable notoriety in the line of interfering with religion. When, as in Tennessee, grand juries interrogate children and women as to what is said in religious meetings, in order that they may bring an indictment against God-fearing men, it is no wonder that sympathy should be manifested with Russian oppression.—*Present Truth, London, England.*
