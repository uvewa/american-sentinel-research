R. H. McDONALD, of San Francisco, publishes this in one of his monthly tracts:—

> California alone, of the forty-four States and four Territories of the United States, is the only one without some form of a Sunday, or one day in seven as a legal rest day. Do not your cheeks tingle with shame when you think of this?

To Dr. McDonald's question, the San Francisco Examiner makes this apt reply:—

> My good man, they do not. Following the commandment, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," I fail to find the words, "Governments shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."

It is strange that all men cannot see the incongruity of Sunday laws.
