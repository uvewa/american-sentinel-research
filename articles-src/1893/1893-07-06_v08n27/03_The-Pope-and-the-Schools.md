THE Pope has written another letter on the school question in America, in which while he reaffirms the decision of the Third Plenary Council, at Baltimore, in 1884, that "Catholic schools are to be most sedulously promoted," he is willing for it to be left to the judgment and conscience of Catholic parents to decide whether it is lawful and when unlawful to allow their children to attend public schools. To this language, the *Mail and Express* takes exception, saying, that it is to declare what we religiously republicans and expect that to attend the public schools under certain circumstances is unlawful. "Our laws," continues the *Mail and Express,* "do not trench upon the religious sentiment and conscience of individuals. The rights and duties of American citizens are determined by the expressed will of the whole people. We have not surrendered this power of determination to individual citizens, nor certainly the Pope has no right to confer such a power, claiming the right of Pontifical legislation or toleration. To attempt such a thing is an impertinent intrusion that will meet with that spirited resentment which the American people always visit upon those who meddle with their constitutional rights and privileges."

In the present case, the Pope is right, and the *Mail and Express* is wrong. Whether the exercise of a right or duty "is lawful and when unlawful," has reference not to civil law, but to moral law. The Pope simply leaves it with the conscience of the parent whether he shall send his child to the public school or to the parochial school; and to complain of that is to deny the right, and is also putting the right of the State to mandate in the matter of education. That Catholic children shall have opportunity to gain the education demanded by the State, is certain. But to deny the right of the Catholics the right to educate their children as they see express in their own schools would be to do a monstrous wrong; it would be "un-American" indeed.

The public schools are necessarily secular in their instruction. Any other theory leads to tyranny and persecution. There are a great many people who think that moral and mental training which they desire may be taught in this way, they must be at liberty to have schools in which religious instruction is given. This is their right, and to deny it to them would be a most unwarranted exercise of governmental power. The American common school system never contemplated such a thing, and no true American would take such a position. It is an ominous sign of the times that some so-called Protestants are ready to assert for the Government such despotic power, power utterly subversive of the principles upon which this Government was founded, turned over to the tender mercies of man to their own schools whilst claiming to be Protestants. A Protestantism that would deny their fellows the privilege of maintaining private schools in addition to the education of their own offspring. The privilege is protected by immutable rights.

The *World* says:—

very certain. But this is a free country. While we are for the public school system, and insist that school attendance on the public schools will be that on which the law insists, we would not prevent private schools for those, and on the second reading of the school question, the Archbishop said Catholic attendance could be excused on Wednesday maintains this view. No will set up this claim, to exercise by all lawful means the control of those who elect to send their children there.

To wage a systematic warfare against the public schools by a declaration upon a thing from simply establishing a parochial school on the next corner is a distinction of conscience. It will be a sad day for this country when parents are denied the right to educate their children in their own schools if they so elect to send their children there.
