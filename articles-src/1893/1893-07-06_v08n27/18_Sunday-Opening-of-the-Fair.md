IMMEDIATELY after the decision of the Court of Appeals permitting the Fair to be opened on Sundays, Attorney-General Olney was credited with the opinion that as every appropriation made by the Sunday movement was occupied with the Sunday closing proviso, the decision might result in closing permanently every Government exhibit; and that in any event no more Government money could be used for the Fair. Now it is stated that the Attorney-General, in the opinion of his the several appropriations made by Act of Congress approved August 5, 1891, and of the World's Fair, Chicago, including the appropriation made for a Government exhibit, "are as available as before" the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals permitting the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, with the single exception that money now might not eligible to be paid to the Illinois corporation known as the "World's Columbian Exposition."

The expressed majority of Sunday that treated itself then into the famous manner that recently concluded at New Bedford, Mass., and was met by the plea of the attorney to score a point against the principle. The presiding justice ruled that a certain dress required was opposed to the principle of that cause and that of whatever its existence the presiding justice, this in the prisoner's sister had asked what she thought was due. Repeating this question to the jury, the attorney said, "Why the morning of the Sabbath should have been enough to learn that this crime was entirely done; let her ask the question." But it was "Guaranteed" of Sunday is not a capital offense even in Massachusetts, the jury returned an acquittal, rightly, notwithstanding the fact that this she burned an old dress on that day.

It is gratifying to know that some at least, of those who are zealous for Sunday closing of the Fair do not get by this into a sort of condemnation in the insisting that if the Fair is to be open, and when what they connected it is a broad, or of law, by identifying themselves with worse than contestants on the side of the law, saying all who disagree are criminals—and by urging upon all "Christian people" the imperative duty of boycotting "an institution which" by its base itself by desecrating the Sabbath in violation of the law of God and the law of the State." The Chicago *Tribune* (*Presbyterian*), after setting forth the evils, in the view of Sunday opening; especially the disgrace—as they say—upon the religion of Christianity, Chicago, question thus:—

But should not every good friend of Sunday observance wish to give our sanction to the novel development of Sunday observance? Should we not stand aloof from it? should we not refuse to be paid for it. Because we cannot prevent the injustice why say it is to be found not in the opposition to it.

This is condemning the dishonourable boycott in even stranger language than has the *Sentinel,* but no stronger than is deserved. The evil is indicated in all its degrees. The use of the boycott is virtually an admission of defeat; and so ought to tell what those who employ it simply consider evil, but which is not so in reality.

Not that the work of meeting Sunday legislation is a veritable piece of fanatical egotistical self-interest, the reasons justified by the end. Without speaking of how the means work only more harm than could be compensated by anything accomplishable by the end. But history, reason, and the Scriptures force this conclusion: that the end of Sunday legislation is evil. No one will allow that righteous will produce evil results. Time, since the means is evil, and the end is evil, where on the good come in? "Do they say that our third don't level off it?"
