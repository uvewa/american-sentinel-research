It is often argued that the Christian Sabbath was made because man needed a weekly period of rest. This statement is a perversion of the words of Christ, in answer to the question of the Pharisees who were thus rebuking him. Picking corn on a certain Sabbath day, he said, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." What did he mean by this that the Sabbath was made for man? That was not at the time of creation but was as man has been was tired and wearied and needed a day of rest. That was not what he said at the first. That creation. "Haste thou not heard? was it not told thee from the beginning?" He, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary." Yet he rested the seventh day.

Then the question comes, Why did God rest? Was he tired? Oh no. He rested because the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, was finished, and so he rested because it was the fact given by Webster, is to "stop work or toil; cease from labor or exertion." He ceased from labor, or rested, on the seventh day. Then a day was set apart as a memorial—"God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made." The Sabbath is holy, because God has sanctified it, and has made it something which men cannot undo, should make it so set it apart for a holy rest, a portion of time set apart for his worship.

In Exodus 11:13-14, we find the Lord speaking to Moses thus: "Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you."

And the Lord quite plain in Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. "Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you."

Now, you can see that the Sabbath was not made for man merely because of man's physical rest, why did he not make the Sabbath for the animals also? He made it for man because it was the sign of the great relationship between himself and God, and it was holy, between himself and them. A sign of what? A sign that "I am the Lord that doth sanctify you," the children of God; is to say that the Sabbath was given for always and it takes all the sanctity from it. It does not tend to draw man nearer to God, and think of him as the Creator of all things, but men are not merely lying down and sleeping because they are tired. They think of all and each of the Creator. He who knew that the Sabbath and the Lord has bade him keep it, does not think of self; he does not rest because he is tired, but because in the Sabbath of the Lord, the day God sanctified, there is a blessing for him, and he feels that blessing each Sabbath. It is to him the memorial of God's wonderful power in creation. The popular teaching by the clergy and others professing to serve God do not recognize that the Sabbath was made for physical rest, not for our worship, but as an aid to those professing to serve God do not recognize it. Happily, they are obliged to set forth their position by their teachers by such arguments to prove that Sunday is the day in the place of the one God blessed and rested upon.

The following, from the Nashville *Christian Advocate,* well illustrates the arguments used to show that the Sabbath is such; it is a civil rest day.

If the Sabbath was made for man, then the need for it is just as universal and as perpetual as man. He is concerned—physically concerned—about it. The body requires periods of rest as it has a physical constitution—a physical constitution adapted to sustain damage in equal ratio with the exertion. Given in the Decalogue, it is this confirmed and strengthened as a moral duty; but the need of it is physical in nature as is the fact in the first and in the last of things.

"'The Sabbath was made for man'—of perpetual force," because it affords physical rest and worship and devotion. True; but it is not physical. After telling the children of Israel that the Sabbath was a sign between God and his creatures, and that it was the Lord's, the Lord says, "Wherefore" for this reason, the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. But the *Advocate* does not seem to understand this, for it says:

"Given in the Decalogue, it is thus confirmed and strengthened as a moral duty; which is not the Sabbath at all. The fourth commandment points out the Sabbath as the Lord's, "the Sabbath;" but Sunday is acknowledged by all to be the first day of the week. The *Advocate* not only keeps Sunday itself, but teaches men to violate the command of God and observe it; and it also uses such arguments as would logically lead to the conclusion that compelled everyone to keep it. After all, the commandment was not given to the children of Israel—the purely religious—wholly religious, in the affections of the Sabbath and the Sabbath.

So much for the purely religious element in the first two in that and now have nothing to do. But let us take the purely civil element, the working force, invest in observation with the sanctions of law and experience, give it a definite place in our system of police and political economy, and it holds an immovable place, looks to the temporal welfare of the citizen through the State and its law. The American Commonwealth is a political institution, supported by civil authority, as really and as sacred a thing as any. Neither the country, have a State that doesn't carry a ban on Sunday work in its statute books.

THERE is much truth in the following paragraph from the Nashville *Christian Advocate*:—

Nothing is more pitiable than the spirit of militancy in religious organizations. Religion that does not cultivate gentleness, that does not aspire to its perfect models of generosity is but religion in name only. Religious tyranny is an anomaly which assumes to direct and to control the conscience, an audacity; and as morality, it is as if one would lead others to wisdom by a one's way, without regard to the wishes and feelings of others.

These words are exactly descriptive of those professing Christians who are claiming that Government shall enforce Sunday observance by legislation throughout the country and the movement is solidly throughout. The Sunday closers maintain their religious rights so long as their pet day is established. The *Advocate* truthfully says the essence of religion, given for a religious purpose.

Sunday is, in a sense, a civil institution, because it was ordained by man; but it is, in this sense, a civil institution not of the State. For the State should have nothing to do with it. The Sabbath of the Bible and the Sabbath, the Sabbath of man, are two entirely different things. The one—the seventh-day Sabbath—is the Lord's, given to rest and man might remember him as the Creator; the other—Sunday, or the first day of the week—is Sunday, given to keep man away from the Sabbath of the Lord, that they may be forever set to his worship.
