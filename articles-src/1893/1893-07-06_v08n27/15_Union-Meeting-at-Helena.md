A union meeting held in the Helena, Pa., Lutheran Church, on the 18th ult., a paper was read, without a dissenting voice, that a protest, be entered against the Columbian Exposition being kept open on Sunday, and that it is given a favor.

We are very sincere and earnest of conscience and our hope for the future of the Christian Republic rests upon the Columbian Exposition open on Sundays. We deplore its opening on Sundays, though it be inevitable, its influence is contemptible. We recognize the fact that in the state of this Christian Republic we must champion and strengthen and defend the same in its defense.
