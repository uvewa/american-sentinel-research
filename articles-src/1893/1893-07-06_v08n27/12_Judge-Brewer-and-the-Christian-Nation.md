When Justice Brewer, representing the Supreme Court, says in a decision reviewed from the people, goes so far as to accept the old claim that a ruler is a judge or "the guardian of public morals," and that "this is a Christian Nation," thus saying that this religion is the religion of the Nation, to the exclusion of all others; he transcends the powers granted him by the people, tramples upon rights and powers retained by the people, and makes an insult to that Charter which has long forgiven. The very first question should be, Who had the first right to political consideration, was from Catholic authorities. Now he declares that this is a "Christian Nation," and this argument, gives an opportunity for the Catholic Church to accept and claim the country by virtue of the very decision which was expected to give Christianity a preference, a preference over all others. And this will be the issuing thing. A strife for the old contest between the Protestants on the one hand, and the Catholic Church on the other, each as we never saw since the Dark Ages. Already there is some evidences of its coming struggle; the lines of battle are forming, and what have apparently been hushed for a long time are renewed; and a terrible collision will spring up, new and old will be found in the conflict of the contest early. "The storm is gathering, the thunders are rolling, and it will spread over the world." And none will be more surprised than the Protestants of this Nation when they see how they have paved the way for the subversion of all their natural rights, to the power of Rome. *H. N. M.* in *Muskoka (Minn.) Ledger.*
