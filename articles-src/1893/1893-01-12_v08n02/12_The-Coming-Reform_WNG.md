Many are the efforts at reform in this morally and politically corrupt age. This fact is of itself a striking evidence of the need of reform. Of the attempts at political reform, it may be said that many of them are evolved from the struggle for party pre-eminence and personal gain. Of the proposed moral reforms, many are set in motion by zealous, well-meaning people who are sadly mistaken both as to possible results and the means by which to secure practical and permanent reform.

There is one prominent peculiarity about the efforts of most moral reformers, and that is they seek reform through civil law. And one peculiarity of such so-called reforms is that they invariably fail of the professed purpose, and when fully developed always end in the persecution of dissenters. It is unnecessary to repeat history to demonstrate this point, as it is patent even to ordinary readers. The present is the center of interest.

There is a growing mania for some kind of political church. The churches have so far lost their spiritual power and influence that it may well be said, "Babylon is fallen." The idea was voiced by a leading modern reformer that through Christian politics we must recognize Christ as the great world-force for righteousness and purity. Professed Christians seem to have lost sight of the principle, laid down by the Lord himself, that "it is not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." There is a general disposition to appeal to the civil law making power for the legal enforcement of morality, the power of the Spirit of God being virtually ignored.

A few months ago, a certain minister of this city, I suppose in echo of a like suggestion which had been advanced in other places, advocated the organization of a "Civic Church." The object was to unite all, in or out of the existing churches, for the purposes of moral and political reform. Under the present regime the masses of voters in the churches are loath to forsake their old party affiliations, and the self-styled reformers are unable to concentrate a sufficient force to carry their pet hobbies through an election. Many in the churches may inwardly sympathize with the hobby that may be for the time before the people, but they naturally like to be on the strong side in a political contest; and fearing that their votes would not sufficiently strengthen the reform to enable it to win, yet might so weaken the old party as to cause it to lose, they dare not take the chances of being left out altogether. So if all reform sympathizers could be brought together in a kind of church relationship their obligation to work together would be morally strengthened.

In San Francisco, during the recent campaign, a scheme was promulgated at a minister's meeting by which a species of censorship could be placed upon all candidates for office, the censors to report upon the character and fitness for office of all such candidates. Of course this committee would be composed of ministers or leading churchmen, and would constitute a kind of nominating committee for the faithful.

And now comes another California minister and proposes to organize in this city a Prohibition Church. He holds out to prohibitionists about the same inducements that the Civic Church advocates do to the mass of professed municipal reformers, that is, combine in church relationship for more effective work. Of the purpose of civil government, he placed the moral and spiritual interests of the people in the van. He said the minister who objects to partisan politics is a hypocrite, a coward, and an infidel.

Of the particular tenets of a Prohibition Church, this leading exponent says that in regard to the fatherhood of God, the divinity of Christ, and the inspiration of the Scriptures, there would perhaps be no deviation from the ordinary views of the orthodox churches. But there was nothing definite laid down excepting that the church should take cognizance of the political acts of its members.

And this seems to be the trend of the modern idea of reform—a political church. There are as yet many different ideas about how to get at it effectually, but they all have the same end in view. It is an open question whether so-called Protestantism will succeed in organizing a new church for the purpose of controlling the State, or eventually fall into the lap of the "mother church"—the Roman Catholic. The latter has had long experience in that line, has all the necessary machinery in practical running order, and has already the inside track in the race for governmental recognition. However this may be, the political church is the coming "reform," and Church and State, not only in principle but in fact, is the goal.
