On December 17, Senator Proctor, of Vermont, presented in the Senate of the United States, the following communication from the legislature of Vermont:—

*Joint resolution in support of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment to Constitution of United States.*

Whereas, there has been introduced into the Congress of the United States a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States, designed to prevent the several States from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, or favoring any particular form of religion or religious worship, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking, which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control, Therefore,

*Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives*, that our senators and representatives in Congress be and they are hereby requested to use their influence to promote the adoption of said proposed amendment by the houses of which they are members.

The legislature of Vermont is thus the first of the State legislatures to lend itself and its influence to this deceptive measure. It is well known by those who see and understand the true animus of this proposed amendment, that it is really a sectarian measure, and that it actually looks to an establishment instead of a disestablishment of religion.

The first phase of the amendment, the Sixteenth, concerns a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in the Senate of December 8. Its rallying symbol is the mouths of those who are opposed to the Sixteenth Amendment. Its adopters have looked sequentially that its adoption would and affect the religious laws of the different States—that they would then constitute to enforce Sunday observance, punish for Sunday blasphemy, and carry out in the end of all legal religion in the statutes books, without any reference to the plan or part of the institutions injunctions whatever. But for one thing, and the only one thing, which is in this amendment—and that is prohibiting money for sectarian purposes. That is right; no money raised by taxation or public money might be used to further the interests of the Church. Before the Supreme Court shall decide is the Christianity of this "Christian Nation," not a dollar to that sect which is called Roman Catholics.

In the Senate on the same day, Senator Davis presented "a petition of the National Pra Patria League for the Protection of American Institutions" signed by president and secretary, "praying Congress to make no more appropriations for sectarian Indian schools."

This is the league which presents the biggest prayer-meeting to every session,—Bless us, us collectively, but no more. That which we have heretofore shared with the Roman Catholics, we will keep, if only you will bless us, and we evermore.

W. H. M.
