PERIODIC rest days are quite numerous among different peoples. The Mohammedans worship on Friday, the supposed day of Christ's crucifixion; the Seventh-day Adventists, the Seventh-day Baptists, and other Sabbatarian Christians observe the original Sabbath; while the Catholics and the large majority of modern church societies observe the first day of the week. And now a student of Moody's institute in Chicago informs us that their rest day is Monday—not exactly a holy day with them, but a day sacredly set apart for physical rest.

This reminds us of the unjust and unconstitutional attempts to make laws deciding which day is the proper rest day for all, and then using the governmental machinery to force it upon all. The glory of the Church in America is that we have developed the most prosperous, the most liberal, and the most moral Church in the world by freedom in religion—by absolute separation of Church and State. And why should we now, after over a century of unparalleled advancement and prosperity in our religious life, seek to revive the old laws of compulsory religion—long since dead—that took every iota of life out of the religions of the Old World and left in their stead an empty shell, a whitened sepulcher, a dead form which in most countries, as in France and Italy, is perhaps worse than, or as bad as, no religion at all. Enforced religion is not religion; it is merely hypocrisy, what the Saviour condemned as the worst of all sins.

Let the people of America then take a lesson from the world's history. If we would preserve the purity of our religion; if we would guard the sacredness of our Sabbath, let the Government keep its hands off. The Sabbath in Europe with its debauchery and vice shows us what the law brings forth. The Sabbath in America which is infinitely better shows us what freedom can accomplish. Religion supported by the power of God has proved to be the most powerful agent for good the world has ever seen; but religion enforced by the governments of earth has been the most tyrannical and diabolical agent that history brings to view.

The inevitable conclusion that must be drawn, then, is that for the good of morality and religion, for the good of the Church and the Sabbath, Congress should remove the impious hand that it has placed upon a religious ordinance and let the freedom in religion that has reigned in America for the past century still hold undisputed sway. Congress has not a shadow of a right to legislate on the Sabbath question. Let each individual decide for himself the morality of attending the World's Fair on the first day or on the seventh day of the week, as each individual will for himself, and for himself alone, be held accountable. It will be a day of ill omen for both the Church and the State when the goddess of liberty is disenthroned and religious intolerance enthroned in her stead.

In America all have equal rights, and these equal rights must be insisted upon. The Sunday keeper has no more right to enforce his ideas upon a seventh-day observer than has the latter to force the Sunday keeper to observe Saturday; and neither has the right to prescribe for the unbeliever either the quality or quantity of his religion.—Harvey Daily Press.
