A CHICAGO paper inquires: "Will the Indian understand that this is a Christian Nation?" Well, naturally, since they have been furnished with copies of the Supreme Court decision of last February, detecting it is to be much. Their experience with the average Indian agent should teach them anything of that kind. It is stated that the Government is now owing the Arapahoes and Cheyennes, as a tribe, per head, and bonuses of failure to pay this money these Indians are in danger of starvation.

It is further stated that of the money due to these Indians at the last regular payment ($500,000) they received only $187,500; the "balance" having been absorbed in fees to pay lawyers for making out the aforesaid payment of each Indian. So says the Chicago *News*, which also adds the information that "the tradesmen have been made enormously and inexplicably reduced by one-half;" and that "as usual, the trouble lies with the agencies by which the contract was to be carried out—with the agencies which have the nation-giving in charge and with the system by which the Government, instead of putting the full amount of promised money rights in the Indian's hands, lets him get it through a lawyer and a process of mulcting."

It is very evident that it will require something more than a decree of the Supreme Court, or even an act of Congress to make this a Christian Nation.
