Morristown, Tenn., Nov. 14, 1892.

A. F. BALLENGER, Esq.—Dear Sir: I have expressed in the Patriot, very emphatically, my disapproval of the punishment of these west Tennessee farmers who rest on Saturday and work quietly on Sunday.

But I see a worse sight every Sunday—engineers firemen, conductors, brakemen, ticket sellers, postal clerks, who do not rest on Saturday, but who are forced to work on Sunday or lose their bread. They get no more pay for seven days' work than they would for six days' work if the seventh day were kept free from the running of trains.

The National Religious Liberty Association ought to feel as much interest in the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are deprived of the liberty of worshiping God on their Sabbath, as it does for the dozen men who have been improperly imprisoned. But it don't. Isn't its name a sham?

Yours truly,

JAMES B. CONVERSE.

Chicago, Ill., Dec. 24, 1892.

REV. JAMES B. CONVERSE,
Editor Christian Patriot,
Morristown, Tenn.,

Dear Sir: Your favor of November 14 has been received, but on account of a press of work at the time it was received and a trip to the scene of the persecutions referred to in your letter, I have delayed answering until now. I proffer thanks to you in the name of common humanity for the words of condemnation written or spoken by you against the barbarous treatment meted out to the Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee.

However, your charge of "sham" against the National Religious Liberty Association because it does not agitate for a law to compel railroad employees to avail themselves of their inalienable and constitutional right to rest or worship on Sunday as they choose, is uncalled for and unjust. Our association was organized to advocate religious liberty for all men irrespective of creed or nationality, and not to compel men to exercise their rights. Your statement that railroad employees are "forced to work on Sunday or lose their bread" is contradicted by Rev. W. F. Crafte, the most ardent Sunday law advocate in the United States, in his "Sabbath for Man," page 428, as follows:—

Among other printed questions to which I have collected numerous answers, was this one: "Do you know of any instance where a Christian's refusing to do Sunday work, or Sunday trading, has resulted in his financial ruin?" Of the two hundred answers from persons representing all trades and professions, not one is affirmative. . . .

There are instances in which men have lost places by refusing to do Sunday work, but they have usually found other places as good or better. With some there has been temporary self sacrifice, but ultimate betterment. . . . David said that he had never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. I have, but I never knew a case, nor can I find one in any quarter of the globe, where even beggary, much less starvation, has resulted from courageous and conscientious fidelity to the Sabbath.

The "sham" in the case is on the other side, and what is more, the workingman has discovered it. The following quotations from the Michigan Sabbath Workhouse, the official organ of the Michigan branch of the American Sabbath Union, in its issue of October, 1891, has helped to open their eyes. It said:—

In sustaining the American Sabbath Union, the churches are preparing the way of the churches and making their paths straight. Close up the Sabbath saloon, and make it impossible to run the theaters; shut up the cigar stands, ice cream saloons and soda water fountains; and prevent base-ball playing; put an end to railroad and other Sabbath excursions, and the masses will more easily be turned to the house of God. Break down these sacrilegious but fascinating amusements, and the church will have the right of way to the masses.

If the churches of this State were to contribute $10,000 this year to assist the American Sabbath Union to push its work, they would, in our judgment, make for themselves the finest possible investment. Money so invested would soon return to them with fine rates of interest. The money now spent in Sabbath deservation by those who are largely in sympathy with the churches, but who are led off to the parks, on excursions, and to other places where money is spent freely, by the enchantment of music and scenery, would, if our Sunday laws were enforced, return to the churches and contribute to their support, and would find it much cheaper to do so than it now is to support the places and institutions they now do. The churches ought to sustain very liberally the Union out of self-defense, and they will doubtless do it.

It thus appears that the tears shed over the poor, "enslaved workingmen," by the American Sabbath Union and kindred elements, are "crocodile tears," shed as an "investment" upon which it is expected "fine rates of interest" will be realized. As stated above, the workingmen have discovered this, as is apparent, first from the following quotation which appears in the Switchmen's Journal, of July, 1892, the "Official Organ of the Switchmen's Mutual Aid Association of North America":—

The discussion relating to Sunday laws seems to be adapting itself to the various shades of sentiment in different places. In the United States, where a State religion would be at a discount, the advocates of Sunday laws tell us in their public meetings that it is only a civil rest day that they want, leaving the statement, that they will bring out the religious idea as soon as practicable, to be spoken in the ears of supposed friends. But in the Queen's dominions, where the people are accustomed from long practice to endure the hollow faces of submitting to a creed supported by a civil parliament, the defender of Sunday legislation talks right out, saying that a meeting called to create such sentiment is religious, and opens it accordingly with the doxology and prayer.

History abounds in illustrations of the expressions of surprise and disgust from the workingman's self-constituted guardians that workingmen refuse to dance when the Sunday law advocates so studiously fiddle. But laboring men are wide awake and have discovered, they think, that this "antagonism to Sunday labor is more theological than humanitarian," and that this mourning for the "slaves of the nineteenth century" partakes largely of the nature of "crocodile tears."

Again, the Locomotive Firemen's Magazine, the "Official Organ of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen," in its issue of November, declares that the Sunday closing movement is characterized by the spirit of "bigotry, duplicity, and phariseeism" and "witch-hanging and Quaker-whipping Puritanism;" and in speaking of the methods employed, the magazine charges, "vulgar duplicity," "deliberate fraud," "bold misrepresentation," etc.

If time and space would permit, these opinions could be multiplied from other sources, but this will suffice to show that the laboring men of the country do not appreciate this profuse and gratuitous sympathy. It is not only unsolicited and unappreciated but they actually repel it, knowing that it is more "theological than humanitarian," and that it is regarded by these theologians merely as "the finest possible investment" which will "soon return with fine rates of interest." It will be some time before this "sham" sympathy for the working-man will succeed in deceiving him into selling his liberties to ecclesiastical corporations. To adopt the idea of another: You can fool some of the workingmen all the time, and all the workingmen some of the time, but the time has not yet come when you can fool all the workingmen all of the time.

And now allow me in closing to advise you to cease wasting sympathy on the workingman. He does not need it, and does not ask it, and much prefers to interpret his rights for himself, and adopt his own measures for securing them.

If you were to take your Bible and convince the workingmen that Sunday is the Sabbath, and with the gospel of Jesus Christ quicken his conscience, you would not need to be agitating for a law to compel him to assert his right, which he already possesses, to a day of rest and worship; he would do this for himself, and, like the Seventh-day Adventists of Henry County, Tenn., would go to prison and the chain-gang rather than violate his conscience. But the secret of the whole situation is in the fact that there is no Bible authority for Sunday observance, and the laboring man knows there is none, and the Sunday law advocates confess there is none when they appeal to the civil government to enact a law to supply the lack of such authority. The more you investigate this question the more will you discover that you are enlisted on the "sham" side of the controversy. That you may investigate and early arrive at the real truth of the matter, is the hope of

Your friend,

A. F. BALLENGER.
