NOTE.—Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend; and all readers of the SENTINEL whose subscriptions are about to expire, will find orders from those who have not yet ordered or special remittance, those who have not ordered and desire to see our special terms of subscription.

While this paper is being printed the question on Mr. Durborow's resolution "to repeal the religious legislation pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition," is in progress. We hope to give a good report of the hearing next week. Prominent among the advocates of unconditional and absolute repeal is Prof. Ely, of the Law Department of the Baltimore University, now at J. C. as representing the SENTINEL. "The Law of Sunday" our editor-inchief, who has so often discredited the American and the State Church, is also on the ground with his invincible logic and unanswerable arguments. The promise of contentions two men hearing will be, as Mr. Crafts remarked of the report of a former hearing, "a mighty interesting time."

The journal, of Hart, Mich., makes the timely remark that "the society that undertakes to affiliate with any politician in its course is later or doomed to the ignominious past. And there is no question to-day which is as materially affecting the inward course of our churches, their good work and influence, and the one of politics. You can hardly attend church nowadays but the listener and the private society and political influences are upon you. He is no more in secret; he is with private and political parties, all the time. It is almost time that ministers interested to save the church, and left the work of politics to the politicians, and outside of the church."

*Hart and Epvie Reporter* has the following which is very properly entitles, "A Pertinent Question"—

A question is asked to let every observer whether if the State has a right to take one per cent of a man's income from him for his lost day salary per cent, it has not also a right to take salary per cent, and give the below rest also.

This is a logical deduction, and strengthens the impression that the saltimated and dives labor too has a new born would for the remembrance.

Suppose the question were, if the State has the right to take one-seventh part of a man's time from him by means of a Sunday law, has it not also the right to take advantage of the time and labor which the only the one-seventh for himself? And if the State has the right to regulate Sunday keeping in the interest of morality, might it not with, equal propriety require the study of the Scriptures, and

familiarity with certain religious tenets conducive to morality? Logic is logic; and consistency would be consistency were it not that he rashly transforms it into a jewel.

NEW ORLEANS which has long been noted for its disregarding of Sunday, is now moving in the matter of enforcing the law. The district attorney has taken things into his own hands, and is not only personally experimenting the matter, but has filed information against the chief of police for lax-enforcement in office because of his neglect to make arrests without warrants.

The editor of the Christian *Statesman*, now in Washington looking after the interests of "the American Sabbath," says in his paper of the 7th inst., "On Feb. 16, the Washington, was found on the table of the Secretary of the Bureau of Education a copy of the AMERICAN SENTINEL which the printers and industrious Seventh-day Adventists send regularly to every congressman. And the copy had been read. This is gratifying! We were aware of the fact that the SENTINEL was being read by members of Congress, but glad to have the readers of the *Statesman* know about it.

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has again affirmed the Sunday law of that State, this time in the case of Daniel Matthews. Mr. Matthews was convicted under the act of 1794, which provides that:

*If any person shall do or perform any worldly employment or business on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday (works of necessity and charity only excepted), every such person so offending, shall for every such offense, forfeit and pay to be collected by distress, or in man or in man shall be obliged or neglect to pay the said sum, or goods and chattels can not be found, wherever to be seized or taken, he or she shall suffer as they impose the home of commerce of the proper authorities.*

The Supreme Court is affirming the decision of the lower court, gives as its opinion that the law upon the subject is plain, and it could do nothing but interpret it as it did and confirm Mr. Matthews' conviction. The court says that the framers of the act of 1794 could not foresee the growth of newspapers, or that they would possibly have exempted them from the provisions of the act. The court, in conclusion, commends the act, but says that if the too rigorous enforcement of its provisions may lead to, its repeal, and that it is in more danger from its friends than from its foes.

Commenting upon this decision, the *World*, of this city, says:—

The publishers of Sunday newspapers, and all other violators of this man-given law, should insist upon its literal enforcement. That is the only way pointed out by President Grant to secure the repeal of an odious law.

The result will probably be that the law will be more rigidly enforced than ever before; but that will not tend to in

repeal; the trend of the times is not in that direction. Apostate Protestantism finds itself entrenched in the civil laws of this country, and it will not surrender one inch of vantage ground.

"BAPTIST Quarterly" Review has a brief editorial, "Persecution of Christians by Christians! Still Being Vigorously Prosecuted in Tennessee," in which the following brief facts are stated.

The Protestant Inquisition is in active operation in several counties of the State of Tennessee. Its ferocity of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages cannot be applied to these cases of persecution in Tennessee, yet the spirit that prompted the burning fires of Smithfield, and all the other fires that have been lighted in an effort to prevent the same intolerance are as here exhibited. If the fact Inquisitor. In every county of the State of Tennessee, which at Rome to take its place, the prisoners to take theirs, but all were Seventh-day Adventists who had all dared to work on Sunday. Five or more of these conscientious, God-fearing men and women are now in prison; ten times this number were indicted. For scores of years the details of the Misdemeanor century should without a single Sunday observance law conviction. It seems unthinkable but it is actual fact. The men are sentenced to the grand purpose.

The facts as correctly given by the *Review*, but it does not convey the true idea as to why Christians are being persecuted by Christians. Christians do not prosecute. Those professing to be Christians may, in practice, but a truly devoted Christian indeed is to be a follower of Christ, to even as he walked; and Christ never persecuted. Two prominent conventions which we believe the editor of the *Review* has yet to learn the full meaning of will enable him to set this persecution in its proper relation and establish to hear the name of Him who said, "Love your enemies."

"*Speaking* of the Religious Liberty Lobby," published the National Religious Liberty Association, in use of the latest things about which we have or will prepare. The subject is 'Church and State,' and while the writer A. F. Ballenger, is a partisan, bur, treats it in a most interesting, valuable, yet international that exceedingly interest. Others were Rev. T. H., Jr. of Church, while we use the, W. F. Crafts also in his very able article. "Sunday is in the United States, the direction." *Law Register*, for November, used not be told in the reader of its kindness of. Mr. "Church and State" has sixty pages, and sells for ten cents per copy, of course, and the address for this publication is the National Religious Liberty Association of 243 South Boulevard, Battle Creek, Mich. Mail orders may be sent to same address.

*Speaking again of the SENTINEL of January 5, Superintendent Crafts, correspondingly in the correspondence appropriately says on the American Sabbath Union's new representative.*
