THE Cleveland Citizen publishes a scathing editorial review of the repeater's methods, in petitioning for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, used by those who have had charge of the gathering of petitions to Congress and the World's Fair Commissioners for the closing of the Fair on Sunday. What possible credence can be given to those who will be guilty of such preposterous falsification as that of sending in from Pennsylvania a petition three times larger than the entire census of the State? In what light should the public view those who attempt so brazen a fraud as this? There is food for thought in the editorial of the Citizen beyond the mere facts there given. It is reprinted here:

"The methods whereby Congress was induced to provide for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday are fraudulent on their face. The Sunday closers boast of having procured 25,509,132 votes. It is interesting to note how these votes were procured. It seems that at every church convention that has met during the past two years each delegate voted every man, woman and child in his State, city, and country, as being in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, without canvassing the vote, or asking anybody's consent. Ohio's vote is put down at 4,104,396, which is more than the total population of the entire State. There are at least 1,000,000 children in Ohio, which would reduce this vote to at least 3,000,000. As there are less than 1,000,000 adult church members in the State, and as a large proportion of these are in favor of Sunday opening, at the highest estimate it is doubtful if 500,000 of the people of Ohio are in favor of Sunday closing.

The labor organizations which have expressed themselves at all upon the subject are strongly in favor of opening the Fair on Sunday. As the votes include all the people of the State, the question naturally arises, What right have the church people to count everybody without their permission? The whole thing is a pious fraud on its face. But the enormity and audacity of the fraud is revealed in the vote accredited to Pennsylvania. The churches modestly sent in 15,552,472 votes for that State. As it happens that Pennsylvania has a population of only 5,000,000 it is very evident that every man, woman and child in that State were counted three times for Sunday closing, without their consent.

"Michigan is toted in with a vote of over 1,000,000 larger than her entire population, and most of the other States are credited with votes that are evidently fraudulent.

"These frauds have aroused intense opposition in Illinois, and especially in Chicago, and petitions in favor of Sunday opening are being collected everywhere. Notwithstanding the opposition of the church people and the busybodies who are trying to impose their ideas of Sunday on the people, there is good reason to believe that the Fair will be opened on Sunday."

In reference to this and similar articles which are appearing in various papers throughout the country, the Christian Statesman, of December 3, has the following to say, editorially:—

WORLD'S FAIR PETITIONS AND PETITIONERS.

Infidel papers and Sunday papers are republishing a charge of contradiction in our statements about World's Fair petitions to Congress, which, as first made by Seventh-day Adventist papers, we did not think it worth while to answer. We ask that the reply now made shall be published as prominently as the charge.

The Statesman confirmed, by a detailed statement, the accuracy of Senator Hawley's statement, that forty millions of petitioners in the Christian families of this country are represented by the petitions for Sabbath closing at the World's Fair. This is alleged to be contradicted by the statement we quoted from Senator Pettigrew that Pennsylvania sent one-fourth of all the signatures since there are not ten millions of people in Pennsylvania.

But petitions and signatures are not synonymous and "one-fourth of all the signatures" or "one-fourth of all the petitions" does not mean one-fourth of all the petitioners, as the petitions differ from those representing the vote of a country of which of a score of members to a vote of a conference representing millions. In the case of a Methodist General Conference two signatures stand for millions.

Another inconsistency is alleged in our statement that 150,000 petitions sent out only 10,000 name back when 100,000 might have come. If that be so, says the profound mathematician who edits the Sunday Leader, of this city, only six per cent. of the Christians can have petitioned. But the 10,000 petitions, many of them adopted by church congresses of ministers and laymen acting for whole denominations present the forty millions of whom Senator Hawley and the Statesman spoke. The other petitions were only desired as local ratifications of action taken by national and State bodies, which ratifications were desirable but were felt by many to be unnecessary. They would have increased the number represented scarcely at all, but were somewhat of the nature of ratification meetings after a party convention has nominated a candidate. There were enough of these ratifications to abundantly prove that the action of the church congresses represented faithfully the substantially unanimous wish of their constituents, not a mere majority of them as does the action of our national Congress. The writer in three years of campaigning, taking the vote of congregations almost daily on these petitions, has rarely found a negative vote, though the opportunity is given equally to both sides.

The Catholic Church is divided on this question, half its archbishops on each side in the Independent symposium. The Episcopal, Unitarian and Universalist churches also are divided.

But the other churches, north and south, have shown themselves united in favor of Sabbath closing to a degree they have never shown in any other movement. We desired the additional petitions not to swell the numbers or indicate more clearly the desires of the churches, but rather to emphasize and intensify their demand by 90,000 more amens.

Is this a reply? It is not. If it means anything it is a confession. There are figures which show this to be so, and here they are,—a tabulated statement of the number of petitioners, who have in good faith sent in their actual signatures to petitions asking the Sunday closing of the World's Fair:—

Three hundred and fifteen thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four petitioners for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. This is all. But have they ever mentioned these? Never! It was "forty millions of whom Senator Hawley and the Statesman spoke," and fifty millions which Colonel Shepard claimed in Washington, before committees, and in Chicago. These inflated figures were obtained through resolutions, where, as the Statesman says, "in the case of a Methodist General Conference two signatures stand for millions." But so anxious were they for exaggeration that they overestimated even this one half. The tabulated statement of the numbers claimed to be represented by resolutions shows this:—

|   | Resolutions | Representation claimed. |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Alabama, | 1 | 3,700 |  |   |
|  Arkansas, | 1 | 4,727 |  |   |
|  California, | 5 | 22,093 |  |   |
|  Delaware, | 2 | 5,832 |  |   |

|  Iowa, | 12 | 34,050 |  |   |
|  Kansas, | 11 | 315,593 |  |   |
|  Kentucky, | 11 | 266 |  |   |

|  Maryland, | 5 | 40,000 |  |   |
|  Massachusetts, | 6 | 9,636 |  |   |
|  Michigan, | 13 | 4,096,240 |  |   |
|  Minnesota, | 6 | 5,000 |  |   |
|  Mississippi, | 2 | 83,000 |  |   |
|  Missouri, | 16 | 233,804 |  |   |
|  New Jersey, | 4 | 283,000 |  |   |
|  New York, | 11 | 300,312 |  |   |
|  Ohio, | 20 | 4,104,396 |  |   |
|  Pennsylvania, | 64 | 15,552,473 |  |   |
|  South Carolina, | 1 | — |  |   |
|  Texas, | 3 | — |  |   |
|  Vermont, | 6 | 21,800 |  |   |
|  Virginia, | 1 | — |  |   |
|  Washington, | 5 | 43 |  |   |
|  West Virginia, | 2 | — |  |   |

A comparison of the figures here claimed for Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, with the census statistics of these States establishes all the claims of fraud that have been made, and shows how three hundred thousand petitioners have been multiplied to twenty-five, forty, and fifty millions. This is the second time that such tactics have been resorted to by the same men. In this connection No. 19 of the Sentinel Library, "Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts Against the Editors of the AMERICAN SENTINEL," pp. 44 to 64, is exceedingly interesting and valuable reading.
