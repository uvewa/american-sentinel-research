THERE is no contest in the religion itself of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The invitation, the entreaty, is, Come. The offer of the ambassadors of Christ is a personal one. Jesus says, "Whosoever will, let him come." Isaiah pleads: "Turn ye, oh, turn ye, for why will ye die?" The gospel simply says to all and it may safely be set down that whatever church proposes the use of compulsion or advocacy of religious legislation, is not of the gospel.—*Signs of the Times.*
