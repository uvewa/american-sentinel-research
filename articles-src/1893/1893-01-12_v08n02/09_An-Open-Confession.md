The introduction of resolutions in the Department of Representatives having for their object the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, brought to Washington the half century of the American Sentinel. Rev. H. H. George, Rev. W. F. Crafts, editor of the *Christian Statesman*, and others. A representative paper interviewed them, and makes this report:—

Rev. H. H. George, Field Secretary of the National Reform Association. Rev. W. F. Crafts. Rev. H. B. Gibbons, Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union. Also Mr. Elliott F. Shepard. Also Mr. Crafts, Honorary Secretary of the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association and Secretary of the American Sabbath Union. These are the chief efforts that are being made to repert the World's Fair open on Sunday. Mr. Crafts said: "We ask only the nine points of law, possession," but admitted that much of the argument was based on no constitutional grounds for which to resort to religious legislation in connection with the Fair; the most effective argument he could afford to repeat. The local representative of labor organizations said he had been instructed to approve, the labor unions, said, in a decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court as a basis for the movement; "and most of the national organizations known by their resent act in giving their printing under his superintendence and direction. In connection with the Breckenridge bill now before the Prohibition in the House, which is expected to pass, a report was read showing how much of the closing was made a law. These and other facts were used to be taken by many of the congressmen for the purpose of securing a Sunday law. The question is not only to pass or not only the bill be defeated, but it must not go through."

This bears evidence of being a fair and full reproduction of the thought and feeling of the men interviewed. The propositions are clearly presented by conclusions from the views which they expressed. Our men have simply amplified the very explicit words, that "while of those who now of the many clergy," and of those to it not based on constitutional grounds, but on the power of a law obtained, premising at a force that "we ask only the nine points of law, possession. But they are asked to repeal." This is a column devoted to their statements. What was previous was unconstitutional. These men now openly acknowledge that they have threatened and coerced congressmen into voting for and passing an unconstitutional measures, and then use that argument of unconstitutionality as to whether they themselves that managed to pass through, full bill, which, they say, permitted the "Sabbath law" be "unconstitutional is for the older. And that, having coerced congressmen that at their influence they could pass that unconstitutional legislation, laded their oaths and shown themselves the character of the bill. Having been told to them, insolently remind them that they did pass the bill, "the Sabbath law," and an unconstitutional measure too, and now demand as with a threat, that they declare that they shall control Congress to pass a Sunday law, and it is a test. The labor organizations that work here, that here upon a majority in the House to repeal legislation acknowledge to be unconstitutional. How far have these men grown in a year? Are they not a great? It is only a matter of time, or of the civil law, a terrible experience of the sin was entailed by a smaller portion of the Church upon the nation.

But, however applicable this argument, it must not be supposed that the propriety priests of unconstitutional religious legislation may be to the institution they last

in mind, there is another "Durborow resolution." It has been reprinted once here already, but is worthy of reiteration, and that is House Resolution 140.

To repeal the religious legislation pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition.

It is very evident that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

*Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled*, (two-thirds of each Congress assembled) one hundred and ninety-two, making the observance of Saturday or Sunday of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus. All statutes, laws and parts of statutes, arts, industries, manufactures, and not only the product of the regulated authority therefor.

Resolved by the same authority therefor, that the said exposition shall not be opened on Sundays, or in carrying out the act of Congress of August 5, 1892, entitled "An act to provide for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America, to aid in the representation of the arts, industries, manufactures, applications of the arts and resources of the United States, and the same is hereby, amended so as to leave to the discretion of said commissioners the power of the regularly constituted authority therefor.

"This is not either phase of religious legislation. 'This is not' an inconsequential as the one they are asked to repeal." Will not congressmen repeal a law which they are now told by its authors, and supporters was not based upon the Constitutionality they are sworn to support?
