those sympathy. It is not only unsolicited and not appreciated but they actually repel it, knowing that it is mere "theological those humanitarian; and that it is required by those theologians merely "as 'the front possible instrument'" which will "in course convert with free rates of interest." It will be some time before this "sham" sympathy for the working man will succeed in deceiving the workingmen to the extent required by the situation. To adopt the idea of another. You can fool some of the workingmen of the times some of the workingmen some of the time, but the time can not yet come when you can fool all the workingmen all of the time.

And now allow me in closing to advise you to cease wasting unsolicited sympathy on the workingman. He does not need it, and it and as such, must purpose to interpret his rights for himself, and adopt his own measures for securing them.

If you were to take your Bible and convince the workingmen that Sunday is the Sabbath; and with the gospel of Jesus Christ explains his conscience, you would not seek not to co-legislation for a law to compel him to leave his right, which he already possesses, to a day of rest and worship, by law to compel him to leave his rights; he would be ready possesses. A Seventh-day Adventist of Henry County, Texas, would give respect to the man of the ruling party rather than violate his conscience. But the secret of the whole situation is that in the fact that there is no Bible authority for Sunday observance, and the laboring man knows them is none, and the Sunday law advocates condemn there is none when they appeal to the civil government for law to supply a law to supply the lack of such authority. The more you investigate the question the more will you discover that you are enlisted on the "sham" side of the settlement. That you may investigate and early arrive at the real truth of the matter, is the hope of

Your friend,

A. F. BALLENGER.
