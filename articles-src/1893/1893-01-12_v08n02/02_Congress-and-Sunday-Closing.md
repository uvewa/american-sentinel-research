With reference to the action of Congress in conditioning the appropriation to the World's Columbian Exposition upon the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, it is sometimes urged that in granting money, Congress has the right to impose conditions. This is true, however, only with certain limitations. Congress has no right to make any "law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." And Congress can not do indirectly that which it has no constitutional right to compel conformity to a religious dogma, it certainly has no right to purchase such conformity; and the attempt to do so is certainly unconstitutional. Of the Sunday closing measures, we may well say, as in 1829, a committee of the United States Senate of the proposition to continue Sunday said:—"If the measure recommended should be adopted, it would be difficult for human sagacity to foresee how rapid would be the consequences, or how numerous the train of measures, which would follow, involving the dearest of all rights—the rights of consciences."

If Congress may impose Sunday observance upon the World's Columbian Exposition as a condition of receiving an appropriation, why may not the same power impose either that or any other religious rite as a condition to receiving any thing from the Government? Might not Congress with equal propriety make the granting of public land, even to actual settlers under the Homestead law, contingent upon an agreement that said land should never be cultivated on Sunday? or even require that the applicant for a patent to one hundred and sixty acres of the public domain should be a member of some church? And might not similar conditions be required of the recipients of any thing of value from the Government? We can only guarantee that such things shall not be in the premises, for the Constitution provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" and if that be disregarded, who can foresee the ultimate result? It would, indeed, "be difficult for human sagacity to foresee how rapid would be the consequences, or how numerous the train of measures, which would follow, involving the dearest of all rights—the rights of consciences."
