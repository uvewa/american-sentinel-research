The introduction of resolutions in the House of Representatives having for their purpose the repeal of the religious legislation of last session for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, brought to Washington the field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, Rev. H. H. George, and W. F. Crafts, editor of the Christian Statesman. A reporter for a Washington paper interviewed them, and makes the following paragraph:

Rev. Dr. H. H. George, Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, Honorary Secretary of the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association and other reform organizations, came to Washington yesterday to resist the efforts that are being made to repeal the World's Fair Sabbath closing law, which they find "has not only the nine points of law, possession," but also a united majority of Congress in its favor still, while those who favor its repeal, many of them do so on constitutional grounds to which the Durborow resolution, presenting as it does a new Sabbath law, is as inconsistent as the law they are asked to repeal. The local representatives of labor also declare that the best allies of the would-be openers, the labor unions, will no longer aid the opening movement, as the World's Fair Directors' pretended interest in the workingsum has been unmasked by their recent act in giving their printing to a non-union office. It is also found, said Mr. George last night, that a majority of the World's Fair Committee in the House, which is expected to vote for repeal, voted the other way when Sabbath closing was made a law. These and other facts make the representatives of closing here feel that if the protests and letters against repeal continue to pour in not only will the bill be defeated, but it will not even be reported.

This bears evidence of being a faithful reproduction of the thought and feeling of the men interviewed. The reporter has clearly presented in condensed form the views which they expressed. One point made is especially worthy of notice, that, "while of those who favor its repeal, many of them do so on constitutional grounds to which the Durborow resolution, presenting as it does a new Sabbath law, is as inconsistent as the law they are asked to repeal." This is a voluntary confession that the Sunday closing proviso was unconstitutional. Congressmen should make a note of this. These men now openly acknowledge that they have threatened and wheedled congressmen into voting for and passing an unconstitutional measure, and then use the argument of unconstitutionality, which they ignored then, against the passage of another bill, which, they say, presents "a new Sabbath law" "as inconsistent" as the other. And then, having reminded congressmen that at their instance they have passed an unconstitutional law, violated their oaths and shown themselves recreant to the trust the country has confided to them, insolently remind them that now "possession is nine points in the law," and an unconstitutional law has "possession." More than that they declare that they shall control Congress to that extent that they can positively count upon a majority in the House to uphold legislation acknowledged to be unconstitutional. How have these men grown so great! Are they so great? Or is it only another exhibit of the old fable, where the size of the ox was emulated by a smaller animal of a similar voice?

But, however applicable this argumentative boomerang, thrown by these high priests of unconstitutional religious legislation may be to the resolution they had in mind, there is another "Durborow resolution." It has been reprinted once here already, but is worthy of reiteration, and that is House Resolution 177—

To repeal the religious legislation pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition.

WHEREAS the United States Constitution specifically states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Therefore, be it

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the act of Congress approved August fifth, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, appropriating five millions of Columbian half dollars to provide for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus by holding an international exposition of arts, industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mine, and sea in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois, on the condition that the said exposition shall not be opened to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and also that section four of "an act to aid in carrying out the act of Congress approved April twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and ninety, entitled, 'An act to provide for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, by holding an international exposition of the arts, industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mine, and sea in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois,'" be, and the same is hereby, amended so as to leave the matter of Sunday observance entirely within the power of the regularly constituted authorities of the World's Columbian Exposition.

This is not another phase of religious legislation. This is not "a new Sabbath law, as inconsistent as the one they are asked to repeal." Will not congressmen repeal a law which they are now told by its authors and supporters is inconsistent with the Constitution they are sworn to support?
