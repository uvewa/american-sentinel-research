The following communication from the *American Sentinel* is worthy of note as showing the view taken by many of our great daily papers:—

ALONZO EDITORIAL. In your paper of Dec. 15, 1892, intended to be sauced, you ask on the general principle of majority rule, whether Sunday legislation was right would no minority have a right to protest; or, to put it plainly, is the law to provide that all labor done on the seventh day of the week shall be as the labor done on the other six days, without respect to the wishes, with the religious devotions of those who observe that day?

The question of rights is not one to be settled by majorities. No majority, however large, has any legitimate right whatever to deprive the minority of any natural right. To make it perfectly plain: you can not do theoretical or exact justice. Of those people that Sunday laws are necessary for the ninety-nine who wish to rest on that day, the small minority of one in a hundred, how much more with the ninety-nine busy around him, can not the minority rest while the one works? Certainly they can.

The fact is that it is not the mine of Sunday work that disturbs the minority in this, but the knowledge that the one dissents from them on a vital, religious question. At Springfield, Tenn., a number of railing railroad trains at first decided the Sunday keepers, while a single Sabbath-keeper looked in his garden of potatoes, a stoppage in his back arm, constituting "a nuisance to the community and detrimental to the best interests and the dignity of the State!" The ninety-nine Sunday keepers could no more rest while one did not observe Sunday in the same way because they can not rest while no living being in this world works, not because they will not rest while that one man dissents from their religion and explanations of his dissent by Sabbath rest and Sunday work.

The courts of Tennessee and the State of Illinois Circuit Court for the Western District of that State have virtually admitted that this is so; and it is vain to deny it.

The Seventh-day Adventists, of whom Mr. Covertners, wrote, keep the original, divinely-appointed seventh-day Sabbath because they believe it to be a vital point. They sometimes believe they God demands it, and they sometimes obey God rather than man, because they fail to find a single idea of authority for Sunday observance in all the Bible, and they most emphatically decline to be bound by the authority of man in religion, to substitute another day and because they are all honest and firm real believers who teach that the final test of faith with this government will be on this question. Will God excuse these people from the penalty attached to a violation of his immutable law simply because a majority chose to believe such practice observance than according to his direct command? The fact of the matter is: Sunday is not, never was, and never will be, the Sabbath; and God does have, and will have, something to say about this.

The question which the editor of the paper that made these observations answered in the *Sentinel* of Nov. 3, 1892, is the one of natural rights.

Sunday legislation is not based on the true principle of a law securing to all men their natural rights.

The laws against murder, theft, and adultery are not based upon the law of God, but upon the inherent rights of man to life, and the possession of life; and man practically his own.

Sunday laws are founded on the charge that God is insulted, dishonored and robbed, and that his law of wrath will be poured out upon this Government if the fourth commandment is not incorporated in its laws.

The one universal and sufficient basis of civil government is the principle of natural rights of men. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men."

We are not dependent upon revelation for a knowledge of the natural and religious; merely upon philosophical, social beings, for the Creator has written the laws that relate to human welfare in the very nature of things, as well as in the great book of nature, as well as in the revelation of his will. Their authority is recognized in the words already quoted from the Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident." On the other hand the principles of God's

moral law are not self-evident. It is true that they appeal to man's better nature when brought home to his conscience by divine Spirit; but it is nevertheless true that no man can not "by searching find out God." It is, rather, upon the ground revealed in nature, and not upon the law revealed in nature, and not upon the law revealed in nature, and not upon the law of morals.

It is a divorce from the revealed stand, that God could never become the administrator of civil law. Because civil law is a law of forces, not of sentiment; a law of conduct; it is a moral law; and God as such administrator would have to execute it himself or else abdicate his office. For when any man takes the law of God as a civil law, he makes himself God's interpreter and administer the law of God, an officer of that law in all matters. What does God require but, What does the State require? Nay, What does the law of God say? but, What does the State say about the law of God? And the thought and loyalty would be diverted from God to his interpreter, the State.

And not only would men seek merely to know the will of the State, caring little whether or not it was in accord with the will of God, but the State, being the divinely ordained keeper of the conscience through the civil law, lest, did himself would it not be a sin to override the civil law, and what the State prohibited would be sin; and thus the State's law would be exalted as the revealer of the real purpose of the divine. For it is self-evident as good that God would clothe the State with authority to define sin and enforce his law that God will hold the subject responsible for the law-commands of the State.

It is a mistake to suppose that civil government is a Christian, or that it exists only for Christians. It belongs to the race as a race. It is that most perfect civil governments exist in so-called Christian lands, and this is because Christianity recognizes and teaches that every man is free, follows that the State had a key right to be free, and what the law should do. To forbid certain things simply because they are contrary to the principles of morality are morally wrong. All legitimate authority, not based upon the law of God but from the moral law, which is, is a matter of course, but from the law of nature, which is self-evident.

We do not maintain, however, that the State may not forbid what has in the light of Christianity is seen as a sin; but if an invasion of inalienable rights, Christianity has not influence in the world as in no other religion has ever had, the influence,—its is to civilize and to enlighten,—and while people of all religions come in contact, it Christianizes all who will receive its blessings and accept its teachings. As a nation becomes civilized through the influence of Christianity upon the people who compose that nation, the laws become better and better; the rights of the people are more fully and more and tolerantly protected. Nations become imbued with the principles of Christianity but by a more powerful energy and acknowledge the rights of nature, and this change must be effected naturally by more liberal laws and by a more equitable administration of existing laws.

But true Christianity never leads to a union of Church and State. Christians who are made free by Christ never seek to compel others to be free. True Christianity will recognize God as the only moral Sovereign, and he will have not an equal

free in all matters of conscience as he himself desires to be. The true Christian will love others as himself, and hence, could never consent that another's right should be abridged in order that he might the more fully enjoy his own. Christians are governed by the Golden Rule. But Catholics have condemned that rule.
