THOSE "mass-meetings" of the American Sabbath Union in Chicago, held for the purpose of representing that public opinion in that city is clamoring for Sunday closing of the World's Fair, remind one of that historic occasion in the annals of Great Britain, when three tailors, of Tooley Street (London), met and drew up and signed a petition to Parliament, heading it, "We, the people of England."

W. A. SPICER.
