A CHICAGO paper inquires: "Will the Indian understand that this is a Christian Nation?" Well, scarcely, unless they have been furnished with copies of the Supreme Court decision of last February declaring it to be such. Their experience with the average Indian agent never would teach them anything of that kind. It is stated that the Government is now owing the Arapahoes and Cheyennes, about $18 per head, and because of failure to pay this money these Indians are in danger of starvation.

It is further stated that of the money due to these Indians at the last regular payment ($250,000) they received only $187,500, the balance "having been absorbed in fees to pay lawyers for making out the allotment papers of each Indian." So says the Chicago News, which also adds the information that "the rations of beef have been suddenly and inexplicably reduced by one-half;" and that "as usual, the trouble lies with the agencies by which the contract was to be carried out—with the agencies which have the ration-giving in charge and with the system by which the Government, instead of putting the full amount of promised moneys right in the Indian's hands, lets him get it through a lawyer and a process of mulcting."

It is very evident that it will require something more than a decree of the Supreme Court, or even an act of Congress to make this a Christian Nation.
