THERE is no coercion in religious matters in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The invitation, the entreaty, is, Come. The office of the ambassador of Christ is to persuade men. Jesus says, "Whosoever will, let him come." All Heaven pleads: "Turn ye, oh, turn ye, for why will ye die?" This is the gospel plan, and it may safely be set down that whatever law it is, from whatever alleged source, which would compel a man to observe any religious ordinance whatsoever, is not of the gospel.—Signs of the Times.
