The last week in November the Western Pennsylvania Sabbath Association held its first annual convention at Pittsburg. A significant incident of its proceedings was the failure of the "Law and Order" attorney, William Yost, to meet his appointment to speak, because, according to his letter of apology, he had "thirteen Law and Order appeal cases to hear in criminal court" and could not be present. This it was said was regretted because he was expected to be "loaded on the Sunday question."

The Pittsburg Leader, of November 30, referring editorially to the convention has this to say:—

"A contemporary, commenting on the demand of the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association for a 'Christian Sabbath,' pertinently suggests that the term 'Christian' needs a definition at the hands of the association, the present disposition among the Sabbatarians being seemingly to take it for granted that there is but one kind of Christianity and that it is limited to the particular sects which advocate blue law enforcement.

"One orator at yesterday's convention said that the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that 'this is a Christian Nation and as such the Christian Sabbath should be observed as befits a religious people.' This would be a clincher if the speaker could only have gone on to show that the Supreme Court not only ruled in favor of compulsory Christianity, but indicated the particular sect or group of sects which was to lay down to the people the final interpretation of what is meant by the 'Christian Sabbath,' which, we are told, it is legally and morally obligatory on all American citizens to observe.

"As it is, there is a wide diversity of opinion concerning the manner of observing Sunday. Reformed Presbyterians and some United Presbyterians want everything to come to a standstill except the churches; plain Presbyterians are a trifle milder; Methodists and Baptists are milder still; Episcopalians are liberal and believe in allowing considerable freedom of action to humanity on its 'day off;' Catholics are perhaps mere liberal than Episcopalians on this question and hold that innocent amusements are permissible on Sunday; Unitarians occupy about the same position as Catholics; Seventh-day Baptists do not recognize Sunday as the genuine 'Sabbath' at all, and other denominations entertain a diversity of opinions running all the way from the gloomy severity of the Covenanter doctrine down to the broadest liberalism.

"The Sabbath association unquestionably does not represent all these forms of religion and can not, therefore, claim to be a purely popular agency. Why then appropriate the term 'Christian' and assert a monopoly of its application? Would it not be more sincere and more equitably indicative of the origin and purposes of the blue-law movement to say, 'We, the allied Reformed Presbyterians, etc.,' instead of 'We, the Christian people'?"

"Disguise the movement as they may, its supporters can not strip it of its strictly sectarian character nor conceal their design of subordinating all other interests to those of a few denominations which do not comprise anything like a majority of the citizens of this great country.

"We would suggest to those people accordingly that they give 'prayorful consideration' to the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States which says: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' and also to section 3, article 1, of the Constitution [of Pennsylvania], which says: 'No human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship.'"
