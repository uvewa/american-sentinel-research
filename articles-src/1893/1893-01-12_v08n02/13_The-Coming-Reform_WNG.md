MANY are the efforts at reform in this naturally evil political society, but the fact is of itself a striking evidence of the need of reform. Of the many attempted reform, it may be said that many of them are revived from the struggle for good of pre-eminence and personal gains. Of the purely moral reforms, some which are set in motion by zealous, well-meaning people who are only militant; both as to the results and the means by which to secure practical and permanent reform.

There is one prominent peculiarity about the effects of most moral reformers, and that is a mixture of religion and politics. And one peculiarity of such politically religious reformers is that they have no settled purpose, and when fully developed, there is no telling where they will land out. It is unnecessary to repeat history to demonstrate this point as it is patent even to ordinary readers.

There is a growing mania for some kind of a political church. The churches have at last lost their spiritual power and influence and find that it may well result, "Babylon is fallen." The idea was voiced by a leading reformer that Alonzo T. Jones had predicted, who must recognize Christial as good, would demand for righteousness and the rights of the people. The churches have lost sight of the principle, laid down by the Lord through his prophet, "Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." There is no basis for a position in opposition to the civil law making power for the legal enforcement of morality, by the power of the Spirit of God being substituted therefor.

A few months ago, a certain minister of the city made, I suppose in echo of like other places, advocated the organization of a Christian Church. The object was to reform, as out of the existing churches a new religious order and a new political platform. Under the present regime the people are not sufficiently enlightened to forsake their old party affiliations, and the old political rallies are unable to concentrate a sufficient force to carry the reform through as a whole.

In San Francisco, during the last campaign, a scheme was proposed at a Presbyterian ministerial meeting by which a special of committee should canvass the churches for date for office, the censors to report upon the character and fitness of each and every such candidate. Of course this committee would be composed of ministers or leading churchmen, and would constitute a kind of nominating committee for the faithful.

And now comes another California minister with a grand proposal to organize in this city a Prohibition Church. He holds out to its parishioners that the name means not that the Civic Church advocates do that, in condition its church membership for more effective work. Of it in that purpose of civil government, he places the moral and spiritual interests of the State above in their proper relation with those who objects to partisan politics in a hypothesis of a Prohibition platform.

Of the particular tenets of a Prohibition Church we know nothing; but if it is to regard to the fatherhood of the God, the divinity of Christ, and the inspiration of the Scriptures, there would perhaps be no deviation from the ordinary "state of the orthodox churches. But there was nothing that is done now accepting the fact, the church shall take cognizance of the political matters.

And this seems to be the thrust of the modern idea of clerical politics, a political church. The ministers and officers of the churches are not yet in effective politics, but they have got to get at it effectually, but they all keep a line in the water. And the constant question whether so-called Misguided and the question what result establishing a church for the purpose of controlling the State, or politics to define sin and enforce his law for the purpose of supporting the churches—the "Roman Catholic." Yet in the past he held his experience in that line, and all the necessary machinery for organization, a rolling press, and has already the fullest track in the force for governmental monopolies. However they have a pure political church in the coming "reform," and Church and State, and State and Church, will be united in fact and in sentiment in fact, is this, is the gospel.
