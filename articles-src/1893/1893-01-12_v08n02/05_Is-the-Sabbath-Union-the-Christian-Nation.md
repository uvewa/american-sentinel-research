The last week in November the Western Pennsylvania Sabbath Association held its first annual convention at Pittsburg. A significant incident of the opening session was that "a member of the 'Old Order' attorney William Vost, 'to read an order of court setting aside proceedings in criminal court' and could not be present. That it was said was rejected because he was expected to be 'listed' on the Sunday question."

The Pittsburg *Leader*, of November 10, stated the following editorially on the convention:—

A contemporary, commenting on the demand of the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association for a Sunday closing law, pertinently suggests that the term "Christian" needs a definition at the hands of the association, the present disposition of the Sabbatarians being resolutely to take it for granted that there is but one kind of Christianity and that it is limited to the particular sects which advocate the law's enforcement.

It would seem that the Supreme Court of the United States had settled all this, for the Supreme Court says this is a Christian Nation and as such the Christian Nation the Sunday should be observed and held as a religious people. This would be a clincher if the supreme court could only have gone on to show that the Supreme Court not only ruled in favor of composite Christianity, but indicated the particular sect or group of sects that the law would now lay down to the people the final interpretation of what is meant by "Christian." Sabbath, whist, we are told, it is Aquilla Christianity.

"As it is, there is a wide diversity of opinion. Thus the Reformed Presbyterians hold that keeping the Sabbath means not doing Sunday. Reformed Presbyterians and some Friends hold that it makes everything to come to a standstill except the churches; plain Presbyterians are a trifle milder; Methodists and Baptists are milder still; Episcopalians more lenient and believe in allowing considerable freedom of action to humanity on the 'day of.' Catholics are perhaps more liberal than Episcopalians on this question and hold that the usual amusements are permissible on Sunday. Unitarians occupy about the same ground as the Catholics on this point. Baptists do not recognize Sunday as the Sabbath, holding that Saturday is. Other denominations entertain a diversity of opinions running all the way from the gloomy

severity of the Covenanter doctrines down to the broadest liberalism.

"The Sabbath association incautiously does not represent all these forms of religion and can not, therefore, claim to be a purely religious agency. Why then appropriate the term 'Christian' and with it a monopoly of all applications? Would it not be more sincere and more equally indicative of the origin and object of the law to have the words of the old song, 'We, the allied Reformed Presbyterian bodies, demand these rights for the pure nation and people.'

"Dignity the movement as they may, its supporters can not strip it of its strictly sectarian character nor conceal their true sign of subscribing all other interests to those of a few denominations which do not comprise anything like a majority of the citizens of this great country.

"We would suggest to those people who feel that they grew their power from 'attention' to the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States which says: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;' these also to section 3, article 1, of the Constitution of this State which says: 'No human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and no preference shall ever be given by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship.'"
