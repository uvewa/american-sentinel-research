MANY of our good women in America think they could do much to save the country from the influence of the Catholic Church if they were allowed to take part in political matters, and are working in this end. Besides many of our Catholic men are being carried away with the same vain hope.

At a recent political meeting held by the City Committee of Independent Women Voters of that city were the chief speakers, this statement was made: "We must have the help of women in our political matters in order to save this country for righteousness."

The ideas and lessons were, that the country was being filled up so fast with Catholics that unless the American women came to be voters in all the affairs of State that this country would soon be Catholic country. Therefore, the argument said, we must have the help of women to save it. Somebody even boldly advanced the argument the fact that if Protestant women did not get to vote Catholic women would be entitled to the same privilege, and consequently would all vote for Catholicism, making this country more the American women would the anti-Catholic.

It is plain to be drawn that their ideas of the country the "God and right and Christian" was by means of religious legislation, for said the minister: "I never heard in a holier duty than that of voting;" and there will be had more room "for the Congress claims to be had for the man who would not vote. Moreover, by making compulsory voting in this country by all its citizens or take away their right of

citizenship in order to save the country in righteousness." All these sentiments were unanimously approved by the large congregation present.

Voting is a political obligation. It is "a holy duty" in a man one can; then it follows that it ought to be equally of importance with religious duties, and all who do not vote should be censured "as disloyal citizens and enemies of the State of Affairs of State); for they are going to require "compulsory voting" to take away the right of citizenship from all who will not vote. It is plain to be seen from these statements that the religious leaders of this age are fast becoming the leaders in politics; and when they get the power into their hands bigotry and intolerance will prevail.
