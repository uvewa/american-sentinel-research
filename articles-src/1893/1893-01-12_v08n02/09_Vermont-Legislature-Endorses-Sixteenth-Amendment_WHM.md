On December 22, Senator Proctor, of Vermont, presented in the Senate of the United States, the following communication from the legislature of Vermont:

Joint resolution in reference to proposed Sixteenth Amendment to Constitution of United States, now pending in Congress.

WHEREAS, there has been introduced into the Fifty-second Congress and is now pending therein, the following proposed form of Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, viz:

"No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of forming, maintaining, or aiding by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control;" Therefore,

Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives, that our senators and representatives in Congress be, and hereby are, requested to take all proper measures to secure the approval of said proposed amendment by the houses of which they are members, respectively.

The legislature of Vermont is thus the first of the State legislatures to lend itself and its influence to this deceptive measure. It is well known by those who see and understand the true animus of this proposed amendment, that it is in reality a sectarian measure, and that it actually looks to an establishment instead of a disestablishment of religion.

The first clause of the amendment, which is a reiteration of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, is but sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal in the mouths of those who are promoting this Sixteenth Amendment. They have declared unequivocally that its adoption would not affect the religious laws of the different States,—that they would necessarily continue to enforce Sunday observance, punish for blasphemy, and carry out all the rest of the legal religion in the statute books, without any reference to this part of the constitutional injunction whatever. But the one thing, and the one only thing, which it does prohibit, is the use of public money for sectarian purposes. That would mean what? It would mean that public money might be used to further the interests of that Christianity which the Supreme Court shall decide is the Christianity of this "Christian Nation," but not a dollar to that sect which is called Roman Catholic.

In the Senate on the same day, Senator Dawes presented "a petition of the National Pro Patria League for the Protection of American Institutions" signed by its president and secretary, "praying Congress to make no more appropriations for sectarian schools for the Indians."

This is the league which presents the Sixteenth Amendment—its prayer to Congress is,—Bless us, us collectively, but no more. That which we have heretofore shared with the Roman Catholics, we will give up, if only you will bless us, and no more!
