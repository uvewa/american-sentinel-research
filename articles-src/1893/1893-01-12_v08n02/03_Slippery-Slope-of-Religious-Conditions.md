IF Congress may impose Sunday observance upon the World's Columbian Exposition as a condition of receiving an appropriation, why may not the same power impose either that or any other religious rite as a condition to receiving any thing from the Government? Might not Congress with equal propriety make the granting of public land, even to actual settlers under the Homestead law, contingent upon an agreement that such land should never be cultivated on Sunday? or even require that the applicant for a patent to one hundred and sixty acres of the public domain should be a member of some church? And might not similar conditions be required of the recipients of any thing of value from the Government? Our only guarantee that such things shall not be is the provision of the Constitution that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" and if that be disregarded, who can foretell the ultimate result? It would, indeed, "be difficult for human sagacity to foresee how rapid would be the succession, or how numerous the train of measures, which would follow, involving the dearest of all rights—the rights of conscience."
