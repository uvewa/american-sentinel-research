Becoming rest days are quite numerous this year. Aside from the various religious festivals on ordinary days—Thanksgiving, for instance, which was on Friday, the supposed day of our Lord's crucifixion—we have Adventists, the Seventh-day Baptists, and other Sabbath-keepers, Christians of the original Sabbath; while the so-called Christians of the Sundayites, which include the large majority of modern church people, have their weekly rest day on Sunday. And now a student at Moody's institute in Chicago, advocates that Tuesday—not Monday—not exactly a holy day with religion but a day properly and solely for physical rest.

This reminds us of the unjust and unconstitutional attempts to make laws deciding which day in the proper one of rest for all, and thus giving the government, or religious forces, to force it. What glory of freedom in this country is that we have always, or the most progressive, the most liberal, and the most Christ-like of all? The world is free; of its religion—by whatever holy day. Then considering all of the above, why should we now, after over a century of unparalleled advancement and prosper-

ity in our religious life, seek to revive the old laws of compulsory religion—long since dead—that took every idea of life out of the religion of the Old World and left in their stead an empty shell, a withered sepulcher, a dead form which in most countries, as in France and Italy, is perhaps worse than, or at any, no religion at all. Enforced religion is not religion; it is merely hypocrisy, what the world of people can see through.

Let the people of America then take a broad, liberal, and Christian view, and would preserve the purity of our religion; let the Government keep hands off the Sabbath, let the Government keep its hands off. The Sabbath, in Europe with debauchery and vice shows us what the forced observance brings. That is done to us which is infinitely better allows us what freedom can accomplish,—for religion supported by the power of God has proved to be the most powerful agent for good the world has ever seen; but religion enforced by the government of earth has been the most tyrannical and shameful disgrace that history brings to view.

The first motion of reform, then, is that for the good of morality, the country is to set right before us a religious ordinance and let the freedom of religion that has supplied its life for the past century still hold undisputed sway.

Congress has still a shadow of a right to legislate on the Sabbath question. Let each individual decide for himself the matter of attending the World's Fair on the first day or on the seventh day of the week, as each individual will for himself. Let each choose for himself and his family. He will then be free, he will accomplish his own, also. It will be a day if it come for the good of all liberty of the best accomplishment, of liberty is classifiedeternal in the ages.

These equal rights must be insisted upon, for the Sunday keeper has no more right to enforce by laws upon a seventh-day observer the law's force to every first day Sunday keeper to observe Saturday; and neither has the right to prescribe for the unbeliever either the quality or quantity of his religious exercises.
