What kind of citizens does a State want, in order to be prosperous and enjoy a reign of harmony and peace within her borders?

In a recent number of the SENTINEL it was shown by the Scriptures that the seventh day as the Sabbath could not obtain recognition as anything but a wholly religious institution, which men could not violate without violating their consciences; and this is true; for the first day of the week, if regarded by them as a rival to the true Sabbath, occupies the same vantage ground. Jehovah looks upon it as such, they could not observe it with any grace; that which they believe would displease him, and which, therefore, their consciences would not allow them to do. It is not with them, merely a matter of convenience or of choice, of conscience, or even of civil rights; it is with them a matter of religion.

But most readers of the SENTINEL know that our States have for the express purpose of compelling all that considered themselves to be at the present time, authoritatively bailed, to stop on a certain day. And this notwithstanding the fact that the authorities are indicting, imprisoning, and fining those who will not so stop. They do not this, and why, as we have said, and this, because it is in the interest of sectarian conventions.

This leads us to the inquiry, What does the State want? Does the State want citizens who will violate their consciences, who will deliberately do what they believe to be wrong? Will the persons who will violate its conscience on one point, also violate it on another? Is it not deliberately do what he believes to be wrong toward God, will he not do the same toward his fellow-men?

And then what will restrain him from crime? Not the fear of God—not respect or propriety, besides his fear of the law! Would he be the less honest, less upright, less careful, striving to promote the peace, credit, and prosperity of the community, such as the State would have her citizens be? Never; he would not.

The man who surrenders his conscience upon one point weakens it upon every other point. This is the immediate effect; and the ultimate effect, toward which he will continuously move will be the loss of conscience upon all points. Does the State want that kind of citizens?

Which would the State prefer—a citizen who, though he rests upon the seventh day, which is not a brave, manly, upright citizen? or one? or a weak one which has surrendered its manhood? a citizen with a conscience a regard for the rights of his fellow-men? or one who will steal, cheat, lie, and do anything else that he left when he considers it is safe and to his advantage to do so? Does it want citizens like the greatest sovereign of Spain and Italy and the other crowning reigns of Italy and Spain and other countries where freedom of conscience are stifled by religious legislation? or like the manly ones that have sprung from the recognition of the right of the home of the brave," under the grand government of the principles of civil and religious liberty?

The answer is obvious; and, therefore, whenever a State tries to coerce the conscience of one of its citizens, it is striking directly against its own interests, interfering directly with its own growth. If the citizen does not yield, he is sent to jail, which means a loss to the community and an expense to the State; and if he does yield he surrenders his manhood and becomes a weaker citizen. The fact is simply that the people of Tennessee face facts so obvious.

L. A. SMITH.
