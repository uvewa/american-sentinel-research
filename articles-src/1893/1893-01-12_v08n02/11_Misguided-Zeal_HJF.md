Many of our good women in America think they could do much to save this country from the influence of the Catholic Church if they were allowed to take part in political matters, and are working to this end. Besides many of our leading men are being carried away with the same vain hope.

In a recent political meeting held by the City Committee of Independent Women Voters of Boston, in which two prominent ministers of that city were the chief speakers, this statement was made: "We must have the help of women in our political campaigns in order to save the country for God and righteousness."

The ideas advanced were these, that the country was being filled up so fast with Catholics that unless the American women came to be voters in all the affairs of State that this country would soon be a Catholic country. Therefore, the speaker said, we must have the help of women to save the country. All seemed to entirely overlook the fact that if Protestant women were allowed to vote the Catholic women would be entitled to the same privilege, and consequently would help the Catholic cause more than the American women would the anti-Catholic.

It was plain to be seen that their ideas of saving the country "for God and righteousness" was by means of religious legislation, for said the minister, "I never did a holier duty than that of voting;" and he added that he had more respect for the common dude than he had for the man who would not vote. Moreover, he said, "The time must come when we shall have compulsory voting in this country by all its citizens or take away their right of citizenship in order to save the country in righteousness." All these sentiments were unanimously approved by the large congregation present.

If voting in political matters is "as holy a duty" as a man can do, then it follows that political matters are of equal importance with religious duties, and all religious persons must take a part in the affairs of State; for they are going to have "compulsory voting" or take away the right of citizenship from all who will not vote. It is plain to be seen from these statements that the religious teachers of this age are fast becoming the leaders in politics; and when they get the power into their hands bigotry and intolerance will prevail.

H. J. FARMAN.
