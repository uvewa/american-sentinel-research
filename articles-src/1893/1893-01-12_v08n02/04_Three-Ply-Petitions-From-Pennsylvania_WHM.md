The Cleveland *Citizen* publishes a searching editorial review of the repository methods in petitioning for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by those who have had charge of the gathering of petitions for Chicago's Sunday. Fair Commissioners for the closing of the Fair on Sunday. What penalties or fines can be given to those who will be guilty of such propositions falsification as that of sending in from Pennsylvania a petition three times larger than the population of the State? In fact what right had the public ever those who attempt to secure a fraud as this? There is food for thought in the editorial of the *Citizen* beyond the mere facts there given. It is stated:—

"The Sabbath Union has been indefatigable in its effort to prevent the World's Fair from opening its gates on Sunday. Whether the petitions they gathered indicated to provide for the closing of the Fair, or not, the Sabbath Unionists took them on their face. The Sunday closers boast that they had 10,000,000 petitioners. It is interesting to note how these were represented. It must not at every time be forgotten that a convention that has met during the last year and has sent resolutions and has always telegraphed every man, woman and child in his State, city, and church has also signed every petition the World's Fair on Sunday, without consulting the man, or asking his consent.

"Ohio's vote is put down at 4,106,000, which is more than the total population of the State. In Ohio there are about 1,000,000 children of all ages, and about 90,000 of no church.

"As a matter of fact there are 1,000,000 easily, church members in the State, and as a large proportion of these are in favor of the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, it is doubtful if 50,000 of the 4,000,000 of Ohio are in favor of Sunday closing.

"The labor organizations that work on Sunday had resolutions sent to the World's Fair Commission from Chicago, and are strongly in favor of the Fair on Sunday. As the vote touched all the people on the State, the question naturally arises, What right have the church people to count everybody without their permission? To be sure this is a pleasant game in this 'Christian Nation.' It sets the argument for Pennsylvanians. The churches modestly sent in 15,312,472 votes for that State. As it happens that Penn-

sylvania has a population of only 5,000,000 it is very evident that every man, woman and child in that State were counted three times for Sunday closing.

"Michigan is listed in with a vote of over two millions, Maryland has one million; and most of the other States are credited with more than extravagant fraudulency.

"These frauds have aroused intense opposition in Illinois, and especially in Chicago, and petition in favor of Sunday opening are being collected everywhere. Notwithstanding the opposition of the church people and the busybodies who are trying to impose their ideas on Sunday on the people, there is good reason to believe that the Fair will be opened on Sundays."

In reference to this and similar articles which are appearing in secular papers throughout the country, the *Christian Statesman*, of December 8, has the following to say, editorially:—

WHAT'S FAIR, FRIENDS AND PETITIONERS.

"The opening of the World's Fair has been made a charge of counterfeiting in our missionary work! The petitions for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair are denounced as frauds first made by Seventh-day Adventist papers, as if not much is worth while; but now it has found lodgment in some secular papers, and is put as prominently as the charge.

"The fact is it is worth while to get a detailed statement of the figures. It will be remembered that forty million of petitioners in the *Christian Statesman* is the National Reform estimate of petitioners for Sabbath closing at the World's Fair; that 'its list is endorsed to be voluntary by the signatures affixed to petitions as indicating the wish;' that 'about one-fourth of all the signatures show that there are not six millions of people in Pennsylvania.'

"But petitions and signatures are not synonyms; 'one-fourth of all the petitions' does not mean one-fourth of all the signatures. What we have published or endorsed is simply the resolution of every church of a score of members to a vote of a thousand was endorsed by the resolution or by the signatures of not more than 100.

"But misrepresentation is alleged in our statement that 150,000 petitions and only 10,000 (?) of these carried signatures. But, according to the Sunday *Leader*, of this city, only six per cent of the Christians in fact signed petitions. And the whole matter of the number, whether individual church congresses of ministers and laymen acting officially in connection with the religious agencies—is the matter which confuses the opponents most—all the business of those whom Senator Hawley and the *Statesman* termed or named 'church committees,' who were church bodies whose ratifications were disallowed, and being represented by the chairman, nominated a candidate. There were enough of these signatures to absolutely warrant the call for the fully the substantially unanimous wish of these ten millions; and the votes of each one of the writers in their years of campaigning, taking the country vote by vote, has been so confirmed the question, has rarely found a negative vote, though the effort has all along been made on both sides, and half the archdrugs on each side in the *Independent* have had their say. That is the way the petitions have been gathered,—all fair and above-board.

"But the other churches, north and south, have been going forward on this matter with a thoroughness to a degree they have never shown in any missionary cause, but their vote is their own: it clearly the desire of the churches, but rather to embarrass the churches' their demand by 90,000 to 1."

Is this a reply? It is not. If it means anything it is a confession. There are no figures which show this to be so, and therefore no denial is attempted. But as to the number of petitioners, who have in making up the totals, attended more closely to petition making the Sunday closing of the World's Fair:—

Three hundred and fifty-eight thousand, or a total of the petitions were presented for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and they represent an actual petition whatever these? Never! It was "forty millions of whom [Senator Hawley] and the *Statesman* speak," and fifty millions which Colonel [Shepard] claimed by investigation, before communities, and in Chicago. Those inflated figures were obtained through resolutions, where, as the *Statesman* says, "in the case of a Methodist General Conference two signatures stand for millions." But no audacious exaggeration that was ever conceived or attempted even this can half. The table of figures can be made clear enough to be represented by resolutions shown above.

A comparison of the figures claimed for Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, with the census standing of these States establishes all the claims of fraud that have been made, and shows that three hundred thousand petitioners have been multiplied to twenty-five, forty, and fifty millions. This is the second time that such tactics have been resorted to by the same men. In this connection No. 15 of the *Sentinel Library*, "May Wilbur F. Crafts Against the Editors of the American Sentinel," pp. 1 to 16, is exceedingly interesting and valuable reading.
