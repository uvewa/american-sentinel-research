**OCR Quality:** Generally good. Mistral OCR handled the B&W scanned pages well.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Masthead
- **Issue:** "WILLIAM H. MCKEN" appears to be an OCR error for "WILLIAM H. McKEE"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Known associate editor is William H. McKee (WHM), and this appears to be a misread of "McKEE"

### Page 6, Article by W. N. Glenn
- **Issue:** Date at end of article reads "Oakland, Cal., Dec. 30, 1893"
- **Transcribed as:** "Oakland, Cal., Dec. 30, 1893"
- **Confidence:** HIGH (transcribed exactly as printed)
- **Note:** The year 1893 is anomalous since this is the January 12, 1893 issue. This is likely a typographical error in the original (should be 1892) but has been preserved exactly as printed per transcription rules.

### Page 7, Author Attribution
- **Issue:** Author signature "W. A. SPICER" appears for the short article "The People of Chicago"
- **Transcribed as:** "W. A. SPICER" with author_short "WAS"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Clear signature at end of article; not in known authors list, added as new author

### Page 7, Typo in Year
- **Issue:** Running head shows "JAN. 12, 1883" (should be 1893)
- **Confidence:** HIGH that this is a typo in the original
- **Action:** Preserved exactly as printed per transcription rules

### Page 7, Advertisement OCR
- **Issue:** Several unclear words in advertisements (e.g., "SENDS" for "BINDS", "ELWEX" unclear)
- **Action:** Advertisements were skipped per instructions; not relevant to content transcription

All transcriptions preserve original spelling, punctuation, and capitalization exactly as they appear in the Mistral OCR output.
