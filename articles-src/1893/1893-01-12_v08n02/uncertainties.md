# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, January 12, 1893 (Vol. 8, No. 2)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from B&W 300 DPI scans. The print quality varies across pages, with some text being difficult to read due to small font size, blurred characters, and tight column spacing. Multiple passages required best-judgment readings.

## Article 01: Souvenir Coins and Sunday Opening (Page 9)
- No significant uncertainties.

## Article 02: Congress and Sunday Closing (Page 9)
- **Opening words**: The opening of the second editorial paragraph is difficult to read. The decorative initial capital and the following words are unclear. Transcribed as "While the action of Congress" but could be "With reference to the action of Congress" or another formulation.
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** The large initial letter and the following lowercase letters are partially obscured or merged. Context suggests this is about Congress conditioning the appropriation.

## Article 03: A Christian Nation? (Page 9)
- **"detecting it is to be much"**: This phrase is uncertain. The text reads something like "detecting" but the exact word is unclear.
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** Small type and blurred characters.
- **"nation-giving"**: Transcribed as "nation-giving" but could be another compound word.
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 04: Three-Ply Petitions From Pennsylvania (Pages 9-10)
- **Table of petition statistics**: The table on page 10 was very difficult to read. Many state names and numbers are partially visible but not fully legible. The table has been described generally rather than transcribed cell by cell.
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** Very small print, compressed columns, numbers partially obscured.
- **"What's Fair, Friends and Petitioners"**: The subheading is readable but some words in the quoted Statesman text are uncertain.
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM

  - **Confidence:** LOW

## Article 05: Is the Sabbath Union the 'Christian Nation'? (Pages 10-11)
- **"William Vost"**: The attorney's name is unclear; could be "Vast" or another name.
  - **Confidence:** LOW
- **"Aquilla Christianity"**: This word is uncertain. May be a proper noun or could be "a quillachristianity" or similar.
  - **Confidence:** LOW

## Article 06: Rights of the Minority (Pages 11-12)
- **Opening letter attribution**: The name or source of the letter writer at the beginning is unclear. Transcribed as "ALONZO EDITORIAL" but this seems wrong.
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** The letterhead/attribution is in small or stylized type.
- **"Mr. Covertners"**: The name of the Seventh-day Adventist person mentioned is uncertain.
  - **Confidence:** LOW
- **Multiple passages**: This long article has many passages where the exact wording is uncertain due to small print and blurred text. The overall argument is clear but individual words throughout may be inaccurate.
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM overall

## Article 07: What Does the State Want? (Page 12)
- **"authoritatively bailed"**: Uncertain reading. Could be "authorized" or similar.
  - **Confidence:** LOW
- **Last paragraph**: "The fact is simply that the people of Tennessee face facts so obvious" — the ending seems abrupt and may be incomplete or inaccurately read.
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 08: The Vermont Legislature Endorses the Sixteenth Amendment (Page 12)
- **"Pra Patria League"**: Could be "Pro Patria League" — the text is small.
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** "Pro Patria" is the expected name of the organization.

## Article 09: An Open Confession (Pages 12-13)
- **Multiple names and titles**: Several proper names are difficult to read with certainty.

  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Durborow resolution text**: The exact wording of the House Resolution 140 text is uncertain in places.

  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 10: Misguided Zeal (Page 13)
- **"City Committee of Independent Women Voters"**: Organization name may be slightly different.
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 13: The Coming Reform (Pages 13-14)
- **Multiple passages**: Many phrases in this article are uncertain due to small and blurred text. The general argument about churches entering politics is clear, but specific wording throughout is uncertain.

## Overall Assessment

This issue presented significant OCR challenges throughout. The B&W scans, while generally legible for headlines and larger text, made many passages in the body text difficult to read with certainty. The three-column layout with tight spacing exacerbated the difficulty. Many articles contain passages where the transcription represents a best-effort reading rather than a confident transcription. A second pass with higher-resolution scans would be beneficial for verifying numerous uncertain readings throughout the issue.
