WHAT kind of citizens does a State want, in order to be prosperous and enjoy a reign of harmony and peace within her borders?

In a recent number of the SENTINEL it was stated that those who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath could not observe the first day of the week also without violating their consciences; and this is true, for the first-day Sabbath being regarded by them as a rival to the true Sabbath—the seventh day—and believing that Jehovah looks upon it as such, they could not observe it without doing that which they believe would displease him, and what, therefore, their consciences would not allow them to do. It is not with them, merely a matter of personal preference, of convenience, or even of civil rights; it is also a matter of conscience.

But as most readers of the SENTINEL know, some of our States have laws for the purpose of compelling all their citizens, irrespective of belief, to stop work on the first day of the week; and in Tennessee the authorities are indicting, imprisoning, and fining seventh-day observers who will not do this, and who, as we have said, are controlled in this matter by their conscientious convictions.

This leads us to the inquiry, What kind of citizens does the State want? Does it want citizens who will violate their consciences, who will deliberately do what they believe to be wrong? Will not the person who will violate his conscience on one point, also violate it on another? If he will deliberately do what he believes to be wrong toward God, will he not do the same with respect to his fellow-men?

And then what will restrain him from stealing, committing murder, or adultery or perjury, besides his fear of the law? Would he be the brave, honest, upright citizen, striving to promote the peace, order and prosperity of the community, such as the State would have her citizens to be? We trow not.

The man who surrenders his conscience upon one point weakens it upon every other point. This is the immediate effect; and the ultimate effect, toward which he will swiftly move will be the entire loss of conscience upon all points. Does the State want citizens of this class?

Which would the State prefer—a citizen who is conscientious in his action? or one who is not? a brave, manly, upright citizen? or a coward who has surrendered his manhood? a citizen with a conscientious regard for the rights of his fellow-men? or one who will steal, cheat, lie, and do anything else that is bad when he considers it safe and to his advantage to do so? Does it want citizens like the fawning, cringing masses of Italy and Spain and other countries where freedom of conscience was stifled by religious legislation? or like the manly ones that have sprung up in our own "land of the free and the home of the brave," under the grand governmental principles of civil and religious liberty?

The answer is obvious, and, therefore, whenever a State tries to coerce the conscience of one of its citizens, it is striking directly against its own interests, interfering directly with its own prosperity. If the citizen does not yield, he is sent to jail, which means a loss to the community and an expense to the State; and if he does yield he surrenders his manhood and becomes worthless as a citizen. It is a pity that the people of Tennessee can not see facts so obvious.

L. A. SMITH.
