The Soldier, a paper published at Columbia, S. C., in the interests of the Sunday Sabbath, has, in its issue of June 15, about as much bald-faced Sunday sophistry and so-called National Reform as is ever seen in one paper.

The Rev. Geo. S. Mott, vice-president of the American Sabbath Union, has a long article entitled, "Saturday or Sunday, Which?" in which he takes up the question of Sabbath observance as it is held by the Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists.

He says that while they "hold most of the doctrines designated as evangelical, and are a wealthy class of citizens," yet they "have placed themselves in antagonism to the movements for preserving the safeguards which now protect Sunday. And this opposition on the part of the leaders has assumed a violence that partakes of rancor, and a pride of opinion that will be satisfied with nothing short of the obliteration of Sunday from the creed of Christendom." "They confront and oppose the friends of Sunday by the press and before legislatures." "They hold that while the seventh day is the only Bible Sabbath, every one should be left perfectly free, so far as civil law is concerned, to observe any day, or no day at all, according to his own pleasure, or his own sense of duty to God. On this point their influence and arguments are necessarily on the side of those who would remove the safeguards which protect the civil side of Sunday."

Now, put this with what we find in the same paper from the editor on the purely "civil side" of Sunday: "Seventh-day Sabbatarians are trying to break down our established day of rest and worship. Should they succeed in this, we would have no rest day. To destroy the one now existing would leave us Sabbathless, for they could establish no other." And then on the same page he asks the mournful question: "If we give up our Sabbatha [civil Sundays] how shall we reach the people with the gospel?" But what about these Sabbatarians? do they never reach any body with the gospel? It would seem so from this; yet "they hold most of the doctrines designated as evangelical."

Well, if they hold "most of the doctrines designated as evangelical" by these other churches, what is that which they do not hold? It must be the "civil Sunday," and as they have not this, they have not the gospel? Then what is that "gospel" by which these self-styled reformers mean to reach the people? It certainly can be none other than this civil Sunday.

And how do they intend to "carry" this "gospel" to the people? by going out into the world as sheep among wolves? No; for in speaking of the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, The Soldier says: "We do not propose now to be defeated by a mercenary and godless board of local managers, who thus defy God and man;" and then, after calling the Local Directory of the World's Fair "incorrigibly wicked" and "past hope" and "not only Sabbath breakers but swindlers and liars," and "virtually stealing the appropriation," the editor quotes from the Alabama Christian Advocate the following:—

> The fact is the religious sentiment of this Christian country has suffered enough at the foul hands and putrid breath of the hoodlums, gamblers, and scoffing infidels of the land. Is it possible that the executive head of this great Nation—the President—whose duty it is to see that the laws are enforced, will stand idly by, fold his hands, and see a Chicago rabble tread under foot a law of Congress? . . . Must the great principles of American liberty be prostituted to baseness and corruption in order to foster the interests of a godless and shameless crew of shysters and charlatans? God forbid! Let the moral and religious forces of the country [the President and the militia] be marshaled against this iniquitous plot and nefarious scheme of bad men.

I need add no comment to these words; any one can see that such language comes not from Him who said, "If any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not, for I came not to judge the world but to save the world." And, "Put up again thy sword into his place, for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."

What will become of "dissenters" when such men as these got control of the civil power? Surely the rack and thumbscrew can not be far distant.

J. O. JOHNSTON.
