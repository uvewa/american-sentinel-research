WE are asked to explain the statement made two weeks ago in these columns to the effect that the Sunday closing provision in the World's Fair bill "is" in no sense law. The phrase used did not express closely the thought in the writer's mind; what he is permitted did not require the closing of the Fair on Sunday, but did propose to secure such closing by making it the condition of a gift. It was as far as Congress could go, for in no other way could Congress control the actions of a State corporation operating within the boundaries of a sovereign State. That Congress did however bend the line it crosses, the legislature, judiciary, and executive, and did just as fully commit the Government to the championship of Sunday as though in the terms it had been mandatory. The proviso is law, in just the sense that every other act of appropriating money is law, when passed by both houses of Congress, and signed by the President. This view of the matter is in direct keeping, both with all that the SENTINEL has ever said on the subject and with the legal decisions that have been had, exception that of Judges Woods and Jenkins, which was overruled.

We print on page 228 of this paper under the heading, "Persecuting Sabbath Keepers at Ford's Store, Md.," an account of the trial of one Adventist before a Justice of the Peace at that place, and the acquitment of another case, that of Mr. Marvell.

MR. MARVELL was arrested with only the pretence of a warrant. The paper which purported to be a warrant was not a warrant in any sense. Therefore, after taking the matter under advisement for one week, as related in the account on page 228 by Mr. Ford, the justice issued a warrant and upon that Mr. Marvell was again taken into custody.

This case was tried on the morning of the 11th inst., and though there was no evidence to justify such a conclusion, Mr. Marvell was found guilty. The case was appealed. The fact is that it requires no evidence to convict an Adventist in Maryland of Sunday work. The charge is sufficient, and when the accused can prove that he did not work, his conviction is a foregone conclusion.

In Mr. Marvell's case the constable was made the charge against him, and who arranged him, and who will get the fees, came to him the evening before the trial and said that he did not actually see him doing any work, and that if he would swear that he was not working that would settle it. This Mr. Marvell declined to do, and the next morning he was promptly convicted.
