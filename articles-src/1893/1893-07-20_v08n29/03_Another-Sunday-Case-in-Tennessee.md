THE International Religious Liberty Association has received information of a case in the court of last resort in that State in which a man was convicted and the statute held valid in Tennessee, of indicting for public nuisance. Several of the States, because they habitually labor on Sunday, etc., as the SENTINEL has frequently explained, no statute in Tennessee authorizing such prosecution, but the courts of that State have held that the common-law covers the subject and have entertained such indictment where the evidence consisted of Sunday labor and nothing more.

The first attempt to maintain an action of this kind in Tennessee, so far as we know, was about 1885, before the State Supreme Court holding that while Sunday was recognized as a day of rest and was, therefore, fixable under the law forbidding unnecessary labor on that day was a nuisance, and was not subject to indictment as such. And the court held that, as had also like courts in other States that have taken precedents of common law, and that where a statute exists on any subject, it and not the common law must govern.

The case referred to was that of a barber, an Adventist, who kept open shop on Sundays. The date of the case was about 1885. The decision stood unchallenged for several years, until some change occurring in the court, the case was reversed when another case was brought in 1891; this latter case, that of a man, also a seventh-day Adventist, reading at Spring City, in Rhea County.

The indictment charged Parker with following his usual occupation, that of blacksmith, publicly, upon Sunday, in the month of April, 1892, and upon other occasions, the specific charge being that his usual habit to work in his shop on Sunday to the disturbance of persons in the community. On the trial of the case at the Circuit Court of Rhea County, Parker was convicted, and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court from the judgment of the Circuit Court was affirmed, the Supreme Court holding that the repetition of the acts of Sunday labor constituted a nuisance, and was therefore indictable.

It does not appear from the records of this case that the court or the attorneys were aware of the previous decision in a similar case, and the former case was entirely overlooked, as no mention is made of it in the report of the case in 6 Lea., page 476. The defense upon appeal seems to have been that the defendant, kept another day, namely, Saturday, sacredly as the fourth commandment; and that nobody was disturbed by the work. The court disposed of these contentions as it is a well established principle of law, that "it is no excuse of complete personal duty" the reduction of a practice details by setting up a conscientious belief, however sincere, upon him to violate it." The peans of the court was by Justice T. Ringgold.

I have not yet been able to give this case a brief except through this own statement of it; this account being necessarily subject to its correction or impoverishment of the reference. "The indictment charges," says the court, "that Parker on the — day of April, 1892, being of the force would not do would be so that nobody was disturbed by work but this is held to be immaterial. If it be true and the result of the practice, of it might not the suggestion of a day of rest and quiet call to the attention of the community the loss of an opportunity to rest, might it not the result of the conviction. The answer to these questions obviously is that any person was entitled their regular day of quiet, and rest, its intrusion with labor was to be resented and as an invasion of the right to be sure to have been open to all."

A nuisance that does not annoy is an anomaly. "All that is necessary is to show, 'That which annoys or gives trouble and vexation; that which is offensive or noxious.'"

In Tennessee cases that cover in other States in Tennessee on that day if Parker had worked on his in the neighborhood of persons of Sunday, then there is nothing to show that Mr. Parker had worked to his the disturbance of anybody; yet the court held that a nuisance—it is that which is, and undertook to forfeit. The annoyance that the law sees fit to imagine is that when every man knows that he habitually worked in his blacksmith shop on Sunday because behind a high board fence. It was the very fact that in the cases in Tennessee, might experience in seeing his neighbors of Mr. Parker working on Sunday, and that the Knoxvillians felt a contrary call to the court's ruling. It was the court's ruling that it was disturbance of religion indifference; and if such annoyance can be recognized by the court, then no one who disbelieves in the communion of the community, to take cognizance.

Section 2289 of the compiled statutes of the State of Tennessee, provides "That any person who shall on Sunday publicly or privately, work at any trade or manufacture, or do any other thing tending to any religious establishment or mode of worship, or privately disturb any person, of the worship of a number of different of the people or any family is guilty of the offense of disturbing or being protected in that worship to the extent provided under this statute."

Under such construction of this statute would extend, that a preference is given by law to the religious duty of the Sunday observer over those who observe another day, not giving everybody to pay some deference to the religious observance of Sunday keepers, interests of Roman Catholicism than in the interests of American Protestantism. But both sects that regard the day as sacred by rest and abstention from secular occupations are treated alike, and are alike protected in the holdings of the Constitution of the United States. No day is id naturally found, is the test, tain that something is a nuisance which no annoys nobody.
