Rhea County, Tennessee, is about to proceed against those who do not square their lives by the established religion of the State, and keep the venerable day of the sun, the legal Sabbath of the State of Tennessee. In his charge to the Grand Jury at Dayton on the 3rd inst., Judge Traynor referred to the Seventh-day Adventists, ridiculed their observance of Saturday, and said that the Mormons might as well contend for the privilege of practicing polygamy. The Adventists have an academy at Graysville, in Rhea County, and as everywhere else their reputation for fair dealing, and exemplary lives is excellent. The only charge against them is concerning the law of their God. What the outcome of the judge's charge will be remains to be seen.
