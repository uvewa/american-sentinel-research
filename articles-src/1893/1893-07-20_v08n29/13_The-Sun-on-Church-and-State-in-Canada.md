THE SUN, in some respects the best of the New York dailies, in every sentence of the associates of Canada, as we prefer to call it, for political union of the British with the United States. Three contributions to Canada urged against political union with the States: (1) Loyalty to the British Crown; (2) Loss of national identity; (3) The provision of the Federal Constitution prohibiting any union of Church and State.

It is of course the Roman Catholics who objects to political union with the United States on the ground last stated, namely because Congress is by the Constitution prohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. And this objection the *Sun* undertakes to remove, not by showing the Remainder the integrity of Church and State union, and the justice of religious liberty, but by assuring the papists of Quebec that their province could become a member of the American Union and still retain the ecclesiastical establishment. This is perhaps technically true, but it would be so true if the courts were to give to the First and Fourteenth Amendments the broad application of which they are capable. But whether true or not, it is a shame that a leading American newspaper should be willing to thus sell the American birthright for a mess of pottage.
