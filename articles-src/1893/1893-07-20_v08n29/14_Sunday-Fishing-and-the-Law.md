Now the Mail and Express says that "Attorney-General Rosendale has sent a written opinion to President Huntington of the State Commissioners of Fisheries, to the effect that Sunday fishing does not come within the scope or meaning of the law for the protection and preservation of fish and game. He further declares that the provisions of the Penal Code, Section 265, as to fishing on the first day of the week, is an act for the observance of Sunday, but that the fish and game protectors have no statutory duty and possess no powers in respect thereto "more than any other citizen."
