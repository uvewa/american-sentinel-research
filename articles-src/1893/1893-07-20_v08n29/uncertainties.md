# Uncertainties — v08n29, July 20, 1893

## Masthead

- **OCR reading:** "WILLIAM H. MURKE" listed as associate editor.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** "WILLIAM H. MURKE"
- **Confidence:** LOW — The known associate editor for 1893 is W. H. McKee (WHM). "MURKE" is almost certainly an OCR misread of "MCKEY" or "MCKEE." However, the masthead text was transcribed as it appeared in the OCR. The article on page 3-4 is signed "W. H. M." and dateline "Chicago, July 10" which aligns with W. H. McKee.
- **Note:** Article 04 correctly attributed to WHM (W. H. McKee) based on known initials, despite OCR rendering the masthead name as "MURKE."

## Page 3 Running Header

- **OCR reading:** "JULY 20, 1895. AMERICAN SENTINEL. 227"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Note:** Date reads "1895" but should be "1893" — this is a running page header OCR artifact. The correct date of publication is 1893-07-20 as confirmed by page 1 masthead. Ignored as page header artifact.

## Page 4 Running Header

- **OCR reading:** "AMERICAN SENTINELS" (plural)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Note:** OCR artifact — the publication name is "AMERICAN SENTINEL" not "AMERICAN SENTINELS." Ignored as page header artifact.

## Article 6 — "National Reform in the South"

- **Author:** Signed "J. O. JOHNSTON" — not in the known authors list.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — initials and full name clearly given at article end.
- **Note:** New author; initials JOJ used for file naming.

## Article 7 — "Persecuting Sabbath-Keepers at Ford's Store"

- **OCR reading:** "John 15, 2:3" in the body of the article.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** "John 15, 2:3"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — This appears to be a Scripture reference to John 15:2-3 or possibly John 16:2-3 (which reads "they shall put you out of the synagogues…"). The OCR rendering "John 15, 2:3" is unusual notation; transcribed exactly as it appeared.

- **OCR reading:** "killoth" in the Scripture quotation ("whosoever killoth you").
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** "killoth"
- **Confidence:** LOW — This is likely an OCR misread of "killeth" (archaic form of "kills"). Transcribed as rendered in OCR since the original may contain a non-standard spelling or OCR error; flagged here.

## Article 8 — "'Jeroboam Has Followers Yet.'"

- **Author:** Signed "H. E. ROBINSON" — not in the known authors list.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — initials and full name clearly given at article end.
- **Note:** New author; initials HER used for file naming.

## Article 8 — "'Jeroboam Has Followers Yet.'"

- **OCR reading:** "ten tribes of Ishael"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** "ten tribes of Ishael"
- **Confidence:** LOW — Almost certainly an OCR misread of "Israel." Transcribed as rendered; original likely reads "Israel."

## Article 12 — "A Word of Explanation"

- **Note:** Page 8 contains multiple distinct editorial items separated by topic shifts. Each has been given its own file. The editorial column on page 8 does not have a single overarching title; individual items are identified by topic.

## Article 14 — "Sunday Fishing and the Law"

- **OCR reading:** Quotation ends with an internal quotation mark that may be a typographic artifact. Transcribed as rendered.

## Advertisement items on pages 6-7

- **EAGLE BRAND / THE SCHOOLS** advertisement — skipped (commercial advertisement, not article content).
- **"EVERYBODY'S LAW BOOK"** advertisement — skipped (commercial advertisement).
- **Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods** advertisement — skipped (commercial advertisement).
- **RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE MORMON QUESTION** — This is an advertisement for a tract published by Pacific Press. Skipped as publisher advertisement.
