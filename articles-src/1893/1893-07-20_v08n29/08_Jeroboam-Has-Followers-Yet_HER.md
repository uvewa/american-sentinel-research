The above quotation is the closing sentence in an article entitled, "Seventh-Day Adventism," and signed "Truth," published in the Kent News, of Chestertown, Md., July 1, 1893. In order that all may see the "truth" in that statement we will look at the history of Jeroboam and compare it with his "followers." Yet Jeroboam was chosen to reign over ten tribes of Ishael. After a period of prosperity he began to fear the people under his charge would revolt, "Whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." Having substituted false gods in place of the true the king next appointed a feast day in their honor and for their worship. "And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah. . . . So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart." 1 Kings 12:28, 33.

It will be observed that the Lord had appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, but the king Jeroboam, had appointed his feast day on the fifteenth of the eighth month. No doubt he "devised of his own heart" that the particular day God had commanded was not so worthy of regard as the one ordained by himself to commemorate the deliverance of the people from Jewish customs into the fuller liberty he had inaugurated. One thing however troubled him; there were men that would not join in this idolatry, for we read: "And behold there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Bethel; and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord; behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee."

This was more than the king could endure. Here was a man preaching against the religious laws of the land and refusing to obey the king and magistrates in that respect. The peace and dignity of the nation demanded prompt action, so, "It came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him." Jeroboam had the law on his side, and he did not propose to have his holy days denounced, so he gave orders for the prophet to be arrested. Perhaps he reasoned that this was not persecution, it was only enforcing the law.

Now let us apply these principles in the career of Jeroboam, to the two classes mentioned by "Truth" and see where "Jeroboam's followers" are found. Evidently the writer of the article mentioned, intended the sentence to apply to Seventh-day Adventists, whom he accuses of doing a "nefarious work." Is it the case that Seventh-day Adventists have gained control of the civil power and are now using it for the arrest of those who differ with them in religious faith and practice? Such a thing has never been known, and they repudiate any desire for such authority. They are not followers of Jeroboam in that respect. How is it in reference to the holy-days commanded by the Lord, have they substituted some other days? Their very name signifies that they observe for the Sabbath the very day of the week commanded by the law of God. In fact "Truth" acknowledges that therein lies their chief offense; he says:—

> Their mischief comes of their teaching in reference to the Sabbath day. They seek to show the unwary that unless we keep the seventh day instead of the first, they violate the law, and in so doing they are an unpardoned sinner before God, no matter how strictly they may keep the other provisions of the sacred Scriptures."

Certainly then they are not the followers of Jeroboam in this particular. We are compelled, therefore, to see if the application will fit any better when used to describe "Truth" and his fellow-men. The first thing that meets our view is that "Truth" desires the first day of the week to be kept holy instead of the seventh—"devised of his own heart"—that this day is more fitting for Christians than the one sanctified by the Lord. It certainly looks as though Jeroboam had many followers, and "Truth" may be hit by his own boomerang. Again it will be noticed that "Truth" and his followers have secured the aid of civil laws to enforce their so-called holy-day, thus proving their kinship with Jeroboam. Another feature of resemblance is that they are greatly disturbed because some prophet of the Lord speaks against their man-made institutions. Then "Truth" after severe censure for such "nefarious work," says:—

> And if such teachings are not stopped matters will grow worse. How long our rulers mean to endure all this, and how long our tax-payers are willing to pay the constantly increasing cost of court expenses these men are imposing on the people, remain to be seen."

And then the next sentence is "Jeroboam has followers yet." Whatever he meant, the only correct idea to be drawn from his words and its illustration is, that just as Jeroboam stretched out his hand and said, "Lay hold on him," so "our rulers" are to say, Lay hold on the men that speak against our Sunday laws; and "Truth" wants to know how much longer they will wait before measures to stop such teaching shall be made.

Verily Jeroboam has many followers, and "Truth" is one of them. It may, therefore, be well for us to see the result of the king's effort. "And his hand, which he put against him dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him." So our modern Jeroboams by invoking the sword are quite likely to perish with the same weapon. When they have stretched out their hand against Adventists they may not be able at pleasure to pull it in again. Then the king asked the man of God to entreat for him that his hand might be restored and it was done. But, alas! when his followers shall find themselves overtaken by the righteous judgments of God, and shall wander from sea to sea seeking some man of God to give them the word of the Lord, it will then be too late. Oh! that the followers of Jeroboam might now listen to those who plead for Jehovah and his word.
