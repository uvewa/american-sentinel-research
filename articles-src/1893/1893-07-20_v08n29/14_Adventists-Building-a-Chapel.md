THE Adventists are building a very neat chapel at work at Ford's Store, Md., and some of the native Sunday keepers denounce a high profession in another church and also a wonderful form of all the churches in their approach to the interests of the man of affairs. It is marvelous what some people will do in the interests of religion.
