THE Wanamaker suit against the World's Fair Directors, to compel the Sunday closing of the World's Fair still remains undecided. It would seem, from the treatment which it is receiving at the hands of Judge Jenkins, that he is either very much averse to rendering a decision in the case or else considers it a frivolous suit. After the hearing had upon the matter before Judge Jenkins, the decision was withheld until after the return of the judge from a short Fourth of July vacation; but upon taking his seat upon the bench last Friday, he gave no attention to the matter and it was privately given out that no decision would be rendered in less than a week. There is no question of the frivolousness of this litigation as brought by Wanamaker & Brown. It contravenes completely, the previous contention of the Sunday closers and is, in all respects, clearly brought solely for the purpose of continuing the contest and multiplying litigation, if possible, to a wearisome degree with the expectation of creating by persistency a change of public opinion and feeling upon the Sunday opening question. In regard to this suit from a legal and business point of view the Chicago Herald says editorially:—

> If such a case as this can be maintained there is an end to all directory rule of corporations. When stockholders appoint a board of directors to carry on the business of their company they must abide by the discretion of that board in the management of the company affairs, and if dissatisfied their only remedy is to change the board in the constituted way. Of course, if fraud appears, that is a different thing, and in such an event the courts might take cognizance of it, but where doing this or that particular thing is solely a matter of judgment, the stockholders are bound by the judgment of the directors. It would make a nice confusion of affairs if a disgruntled stockholder in a corporation could whenever he chose, haul his directors before the court for doing something that his judgment didn't approve. The directory of a bank might make a loan, and the directory of a railway might lower its rates, the directory of any sort of a corporation might expend money in improvements that in every instance might be injudicious, but could it be tolerated for a moment that this mere matter of discretion could, at the whim of a stockholder, be brought before the court? There would be no end of litigation if this were so.

Although this Wanamaker suit seems to have scarcely no standing in the court, yet the Sunday opening of the Fair throughout the entire period of the existence of the Fair is not yet by any means a fixed fact. It has been said in a previous Chicago letter to the SENTINEL that the decision of Judge Fuller and his associates, in the Court of Appeals, made it certain that the World's Fair would be open on all Sundays of its existence, hereafter, but further developments go to show that such is not, by any means, necessarily true. The Sunday attendance has not been large and therefore as there is no evident financial gain to be had from Sunday opening, some of those who previously advocated it are beginning to change front and desire that the Fair be closed. This growing feeling is supplemented by the action of the National Commissioners who have taken up the Sunday closing matter again with considerable vim. Commissioners Hundley and Tousley have united in the presentation of a resolution reviewing the question of Sunday closing as it has been previously before the commission and the local board, and containing this paragraph:—

> Resolved, That the rule now being enforced by the World's Columbian Exposition for the purpose of opening the gates of the Exposition on the Sabbath day is in violation of the rule jointly adopted and promulgated by said Exposition and said commission, and is being enforced without the consent or authority of the World's Columbian Commission.

This resolution is the subject of daily bitter debate at the meetings of the commission. What the result of the renewed agitation will be is very uncertain. In the meantime the natural, reasonable and proper solution of the question, presented at the Fair itself, seems to be ignored by all parties to the controversy. The exhibitors at the Fair follow their own personal choice, whether influenced by conscientious scruples or by motives of personal convenience; those who wish to close their exhibits on Sunday do so; and those who desire to hold them open do so; and those who wish to attend the Fair on Sundays may be found there to the number of fifty to seventy-five thousand each Sunday, and at the same time, those who for any reason whatever wish to remain away are not there and feel no necessary compulsion to be there. That such is the proper solution of such a question, without the intervention of Congress or the courts in any degree seems not to enter into the minds of any interested in the matter. But even if it did at this stage of the proceedings, it would be a futile second thought, for Congress and the courts have committed themselves to the attempt to enforce the Sunday closing and their procedure is upon record irrevocably. The legal and legislative propriety of such a course has been established in such terms that it cannot be hoped that it will ever be repealed or overruled.

The Baptist and Methodist meetings are still weekly arenas of debate in condemnation of the Directory of the Fair and its Sunday opening measure. The Baptist ministers' last move was to appoint a committee to interview the members of the local board and attempt to secure Sunday closing by one means or another. It is not at all impossible that the storm which swept over the city last Sunday evening doing some slight damage to the buildings and the terrible loss of life at the burning of the cold storage building the next day, will be turned to account as evidences of divine displeasure at Sunday opening. It is well known that a visitation of the Fair by such calamities has been made a subject of prayer and these calamities may very naturally be considered in answer to these petitions.
