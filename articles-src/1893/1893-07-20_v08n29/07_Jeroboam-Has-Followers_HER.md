The above quotation is the closing sentence in an article entitled, "Seventh-day Adventists," and signed "Fulton," published in the *Knox Courier,* of Chasteltown, and July 4, 1893. In order that all may see the "truth" in that statement we will compare it with the record of Jeroboam's part with his "followers." 1st. Jeroboam was chosen to reign over ten tribes of the Israel nation, this was the result of the sin. Jeroboam was not Israel. Next it began in a fear a fear that the people would go up to Jerusalem from their place to worship God, and that the king took counsel and made two calves of gold, and said unto the people, "It is too far for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. Having established false gods, on places of the true the king next appointed a feast day in that kingdom and the eighth month. "And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, he took upon the altar of sacrifice.

So he offered, that is he exercised civil authority in the establishing of "a feast day the eighth month, even in the day which he had devised of his own heart." 1 Kings 12:19, 32.

And Jeroboam made in Israel as if the Lord had appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, but thinking Jeroboam had appointed his feast day on the fifteenth of the eighth month. No doubt he "devised of his own heart" that the particular day God commanded should so or worldly of regard as the one conducted by himself to commemorate the same event. And while the civil ruler carried the customs into the fuller liberty he had in establishing a day of worship for them; them were men that would not join in this idolatry, for we read: "And he held there shall a man of God out of Bethel, and Jeroboam stood by his altar to burn incense. And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord; behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and man's bones shall be burnt upon thee." Here was a man preaching against the religious establishment, and refusing to obey the king and magistrates of the nation demanded prompt action, so it came to pass. What king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, "Lay hold of him." And Jeroboam had the law on his side, and did not propose to have a his holy day disturbed, and his religion, and still, the prophet to be arrested. Perhaps he realized that any one who opposed his religion was only enforcing the law.

In the matter of the career of Jeroboam, to the two claims mentioned in "Truth," and men and other "Jeroboam's followers" are found. Evidently the writer of the article mentioned, intended the sentence to apply to Seventh-day Adventists, whom in certain respects a "nefarious work." It is the case that Seventh-day Adventists have gained control of the civil power and are now able to if the arrest of those that differ with them in their observance of a day of rest. Such a thing has never been known, and never will be till the spirit of persecution dies. They are not followers of Jeroboam in any respect. How is it to reference to the holy-day commands by the Lord, they have diligently observed which ever day? Their very name signifies that they observe the Sabbath (seventh day) of the rest week commanded by the law of God. In this "Truth" "acknowledges that Adventists are their chief offender; he says—

There indeed comes of the teaching of the world shall not be tolerated by the church authority that unless we keep the seventh day of the week, which is the only Sabbath, we are sinners they are as unjustified above before God and the world as they can be.

Certainly they are not the followers of Jeroboam in any respect, and if others are compelled, therefore, to see if the principles of the civil law, the commandments, "Truth" and his fellow-men first find that, then these men came to do this. "Truth" defines the first day of the week to be "our holy sabbath day of rest"—"devised of his own heart"—"that this day is more for rest Christians than Sabbatharians," now, the statement really looks as though Jeroboam had established a holy day "of his own heart" by his own commanding. Again it will bear noting that "Truth" says that the Adventists have secured the aid of civil laws to enforce their sabbath-day keeping, proving their kinship with Jeroboam. Another feature of resemblance is that they are greatly disturbed because some prophet of the Lord speaks against their man-made institutions. Then "Truth" also never ceases for such destruction.

And if such teachings are not stopped native all over this, and how long our his papers are forced to pay the constantly increasing cost of keeping the Fair open on Sundays.

And then the next sentence of the article against law followers yet. Whatever it results, the evil cannot close its last page from its words and its illustrations as that of intolerance and direction attached to the rest of the Sunday laws was the whole thereof. "Truth" says that Sunday keepers "are to say, Lay hold on the rest 'Truth' wants to know how much longer this institution a "teaching" of the Adventist teaching shall be made.

And if Jeroboam has any followers, and "Truth" is one of them. It is many, it is the same as that of Jeroboam. "Not of the king's effort." "And he again spoke, that he could not pull it in again the same. So it must concern Jeroboam going as to whether and quite unlikely to punish with the hand against the prophets that spoke from the word of the Lord? but the civil power will not be able to pleasure to pull it in again until the same, though that is the end to entrust for him that his best of influence was the hand.

But when Jeroboam's followers shall find also a man who standeth for the religion of truth, his sovereign; and out Jeroboam's religion, of God, and shall wander from any of the word of the Lord, it will then be time to talk about "Jeroboam." Till then Jeroboam might now claim his followers from that among those who oppose him.
