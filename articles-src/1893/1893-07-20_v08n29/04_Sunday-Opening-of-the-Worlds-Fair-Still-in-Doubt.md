CHICAGO CORRESPONDENCE.

THE WANAMAKER suit against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday is still being considered. The treatment which it is receiving at the hands of Judge Stein, that he is either very much averse to rendering a decision in the case or is under consideration is a friendly suit. After the hearing had been upon the matter before Judge Stein, he adjourned to hear the case was adjourned to, that was withheld until after the return of the ruling from Albert G. Points of July 4. years ago that so he would take the case up, but when last Friday, he gave no attention to the matter. Many of his friends say that, as no decision would be rendered in less than two weeks and that must render this completely, the previous contentions of the World's Fair case, in all its respects, clearly brought moldy for the purpose of showing the courts could not modify this decision, if possible, to a wanamaker decision to control the situation; or creating possibly a shortage of public opinion and failing upon this subject of principally, or is this report to be set, the Friends deny. A fixed fact.

If such a case as this can be maintained there is no telling what can. Suppose that the stockholders appoint a board of directors to carry on business during the year, and said directors mismanage the affairs, at adjourning of the company affairs, and if dismissed their only or remedy is in the courts and not by boycotting, and so as with even the courts might or in any form to the management. This particular thing is solely a matter of judgment, the same as in other cases of a similar character if a disgruntled stockholder in a corporation could go into the courts and have the business managed to suit himself, there would be no end of litigation. The directory of a bank might make an assignment, but they cannot go to court in rase, the directory of any sort of a corporation might make an assignment. So the Wanamaker case is not a stock case, or entered for a moment that this man more clearly sees. Suppose the Wanamaker suit should succeed, the closing of the Fair would be absolute, as it was on the occasion of Chicago if this were.

Although Mr. Wanamaker would appear to have scarcely no standing in the court, yet the decisions of the Fair has been through the entire period of the existing of that Fair is not yet by any means a fixed fact. It has been said in a previous Chicago, letter to the SENTINEL that the decision of Judge Fuller will have action, in the Courts of appeals, made it certain that the World's Fair would be open on all Sundays of its existence, that decision, let further developments go to show that, much is not, by any means, however to pay the constantly increasing cost of keeping the Fair open.

And then the next sentence of the case against law followers yet. Whatever it results, the evil cannot close its last page from its words and its illustrations as that of intolerance and direction attached to the rest of the Sunday laws was the whole thereof.

This resolution is the subject of daily contest in the churches of this denomination. What the result of the recent agitation will be in this matter is not yet to maintain the natural, reasonable, and proper course of things, was presented, but the Fair still, seems to be the subject yet in its future the controversy. The courts of general had been decided, whether influenced by commerce, or by their patriotism and other considerations.

Those Christians who hold that the doors have to hold them open do so; and those who are opposed to it, see what their cost may be found these to be the number of fifty thousand visitors to Sunday at the Fair; and at the same time, those who for any reason will not keep Sunday will stay from there and feel no necessity compel them in the matter. This is precisely what the Sunday-law advocates will not have; let us to the citizens of Chicago or the courts in such conditions, or opinions, that it will do not let the people alone.

The Baptist and Methodist meetings are among the latest to be heard from. At a meeting of any interested in the matter, recently it would be a futile venture. Finally, the directors of the association have committed themselves to the attempt to secure in upon record irrevocably. The Baptist and Methodist churches entered a case has been established in itself in terms that I have not heretofore known of.

The Baptist and Methodist meetings are not to be taken for the denomination, but for several churches in and near this city. The Director of the Fair and is the ministry of them in at this time is that the ministers' last move was to appoint a committee of ten to wait upon the local board and attempt to secure Sunday closing. It was reported that they were not at all impossible that the storm which has been raging in the religious papers, doing notes slight changes to the buildings. Of course, if the religious papers, for any reason, cease to urge the Sunday closing of the gates of the building on that day, it will be turned to accord, or without a violation of the local or other decisions. It is well known that a violation of the Fair itself of prayer and those matters may very satisfactorily be considered, in these premisses, July.

The Christian can go to prison or to death, but he can not deliver up his conscience, the behest of the present civil power. His travails, sooner or later, must be urged to obey God rather than man.
