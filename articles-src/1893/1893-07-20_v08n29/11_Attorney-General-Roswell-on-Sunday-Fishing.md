Now the *Mail and Express* says that "Attorney-General Roswell has sent a letter to the chairman of the Fish and Game of the State Commission of Fisheries, to the effect that Sunday fishing does not come within the scope or meaning of the law for the protection and preservation of fish and game. He further declares that the provisions of the Penal Code, Section 265, as to fishing on the first day of the week, is an act for the observance of Sunday, but that the fish and game protection laws have no statutory duty and possess no powers to respect therefor "more than any other citizens."
