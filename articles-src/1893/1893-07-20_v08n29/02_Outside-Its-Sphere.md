THE decision of the Federal Appellate Court in relation to the right of the United States to enforce the closing of the World's Fair on Sundays ought to serve as a reminder to Congress to confine itself to its legitimate province of legislation as defined by the Constitution of the United States. That instrument does not authorize the national Legislature to make Sunday laws to be enforced in the States outside of the Federal service. As a matter of course the weekly day of rest is observed by the United States courts, the departments in Washington, the Federal offices throughout the country, and the army and navy. The Constitution also provides that Sunday shall not be included in the ten days within which the President may return measures passed by Congress without his approval, but beyond these matters the Sunday observance does not come within the sphere of the general Government. The attempt of Congress to do by indirection what under the provisions of the Constitution it could not do directly, apparently has failed. It is to be desired, but it can hardly be hoped, that no such attempt will ever be made again.—*Buffalo Courier.*
