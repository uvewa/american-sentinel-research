THE decision of the Federal Appellate Court to reinters the right of the United States to enforce the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, has been seized upon by the reminder to Congress, to confirm that it is the legitimate province of legislation authorized by the Constitution of the United States. That information does not authorize the national Legislature to make Sunday laws to be enforced in the States outside of the Federal service. As a matter of course the weekly day of rest chosen by the United States courts, the departments in Washington, the Federal directories, the discovery, and the army and navy. The Constitution provides that no bill, etc., shall not be included in the ten days within which a bill becomes a law after having been passed by Congress without his approval, but beyond these matters the Sunday observances not come within the sphere of the general Government. The tempt of Congress to do by indirection what the provisions of the Constitution it could not do directly, apparently has failed. It is to be hoped, but it can hardly be hoped, that to such attempt will be made again.—*Public Spirit.*
