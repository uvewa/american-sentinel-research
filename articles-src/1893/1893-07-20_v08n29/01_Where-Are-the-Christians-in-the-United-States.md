WHERE are the Christians in the United States?

This is a pertinent question just now when those who not only profess to be Christians, but who pretend to be the very representative of Christianity itself, persist in the use of force, even to the employment of armed troops, to secure the recognition and observance of religious institutions.

Of course, the use of force, and armed force at that, has been involved in the Sunday-law movement from the beginning; and we have been telling the people all the time; but the people would not believe it. But now, when the Sunday forces have come to the very last step of urgency and repeatedly calling for force to secure and enforce Sunday observance at the World's Fair, it is not possible that the people to whom we have told the terrible wickedness of a religious despotism in this Sunday movement, that there has as long time gotten no better.

They did not get the troops—and they have got the Fair shut either—but— that is not to their credit. That they did not get the troops, did not take out of them the disposition to use the troops even now, if they could get them. Force is the thing, in itself, and armed force is the last straight of any resort to force to any end at all. And the failure to get the troops that they so loudly called for, and especially their signal defeat in the courts, instead of taking out of them the disposition to use force to compel Sunday observance, will only increase their determination even to desperation, to secure their idolized Sunday at cost of any available or possible force.

This is demonstrated plainly enough by the fact that they swept upon the United States courts to decide the question of Sunday closing, and when the courts decided for Sunday opening, they at once announced a general and determined boycott of the Fair. They voluntarily entered their cause in the courts, and themselves take the initiative in calling upon the courts to decide the controversy; and then when the decision goes against them they refuse to abide by it. This demonstrates that they are determined to have their own way anyhow; and that the only thing that they asked upon the courts for, was to have the courts do their bidding and to execute their arbitrary will upon the people, precisely as they wanted the troops called to do their bidding and execute by the bayonet their arbitrary will upon the people. Their whole course of procedure is all a piece.

BUT the particular thing about which we are inquiring just now and in this connection is, Where are the Christians in the United States to positively demonstrate and protest against the worse than a travesty, the entire subversion, of the Christian name and profession? Or is it enough to discommendance only the extreme measures to which those have gone who have called for armed troops. There is no merit whatever in protesting against the use of troops to secure Sunday closing, so long as any countenance is given to Sunday laws of which armed troops are only the consequence.

OUR religious papers—the *Northwestern Christian Advocate*—has characterized as "rebels" and "the scum" the action of Sunday managers who have called for the troops, and others. *The Christian Advocate* has not actively added this same nail in these same yet in every way as evil—but it can be taken up to this one. To secure the Act of Congress requiring the closing of the Fair, those same individuals used upon congregations and senators threats of deprivation of office by loss of votes—the only force then at their command. And so far was the *Northwestern* or any other one of the family of *Advocate* from seeing this, any more than the *Christian Advocate,* that they all actually took part in it. Yet this is the same and precisely that is invoking the additional force which they had gained by getting Congress to surrender to them its national power so the threats of the only force that was formerly at their command.

Of course nobody can deny that it is that result; or more. But the point is that there is no strength in any protest against the results of this class of work, while taking an active part in all the manifestations of the same evil up to this. Where is the difference between the zeal that would put bayonets into the people, and the zeal that puts people themselves into jail for from thirty to sixty days, when both acts mean to make people recognize the righteousness of Sunday keeping. As it is "unchristian and anti-American for troops to compel the World's Fair folks to recognize" Sunday; then what kind of result is it that compels a woman or a fine or go to jail to make her recognize Sunday. And when, also, religious papers sanction the zeal that fine and imprison men and women for the following their honest convictions on Sunday, then where is the virtue in calling in question the zeal that would, by armed troops, keep men and women from finding honest employment at a World's Fair on Sunday?

The truth is, the zeal that calls for or sanctions the enactment of Sunday law of any kind, is precisely the same zeal that calls for and sanctions their enforcement by armed troops.

And if any are not prepared to go all the way they do not start on that road. There is no half-way place, nor any other stopping-place. And above all, there is no stopping-place when there are those who go as far as the very ones who we have met in this very cause till its very limit, which has brought them to this in the same zeal and has same respect in doing the same above. And if any find at last to go with them the full length, then they are to renounce the whole road and not go with them at all.

THERE is no other remedy. There is no other course for Christians. If anybody else, can take us at this matter now. The whole movement on the part of the churches most absolutely repudiates the whole thing or else be partaker of these evil deeds. The word of the Lord says, "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins."

And whoever is partaker of her sins, will be also partaker of her judgments and of her plagues. And these are, "hateful, and she saith in her heart, . . . I shall see no sorrow; . . . therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning, and famine. And she shall be utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her."

Or the early time of the Reformation the historian relates that "One portion of the reform was to seek alliance of the faith with the arm of the prince: and this is precisely the result,—not victory, but full devastation." And this is precisely the situation to-day. And to-day, as then, all who will escape this destruction and desolation must turn away from this evil combination in all its details and take the course of that other portion of the early Reformation and the right course of all true reform. "Another portion looking up to God was hungered to reject the powers of the flesh, and by the eye of faith secure a noble victory."

JESUS Christ has spoken "with authority." "The Sunday-law managers called upon the courts to secure" close the Fair on Sunday. From this they ought to learn the gates. From this they ought to learn where. From the "authority" that this gives, where teach, that then those who profess to teach Christianity teach the people to "put not just the opposite of what they teach—where then expect them to help find hindrance, where they expect victory they found defeat, where they expected victory they found destruction." "Put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man, in whom is no help."

Will not the Sunday managers learn this lesson? No, they have not so far. They will not be stopped by this. Will they not make them more determined? Let them take care, those who indeed get full power to carry on, by their apparent victory, the more terrible their apparent victory, the more terrible will be their sure defeat. And when they set not from their evil course, all will the Christians now turn away; and these—"We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one to his own country; for her judgments reacheth unto heaven and is lifted up even to the skies." "My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the Lord."
