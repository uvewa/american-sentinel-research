We are asked to explain the statement made two weeks ago in these columns to the effect that the Sunday closing proviso in the World's Fair bill "is in no sense law." The phrase used did not express clearly the thought in the writer's mind. The act in question did not *require* the closing of the Fair on Sunday, but did propose to secure such closing by making it the condition of a gift. This was as far as Congress could go, for in no other way could Congress control the actions of a State corporation operating within the boundaries of a sovereign State. The act of Congress did however bind the Government, the legislative, judicial, and executive; and did just as fully commit the Government to the championship of Sunday as though in its terms it had been mandatory. The proviso is law, in just the sense that every other act appropriating money is law, when passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President. This view of the matter is in perfect keeping both with all that the Sentinel has ever said on the subject and with the legal decisions that have been had, excepting that of Judge Woods and Jenkins, which was overruled.
