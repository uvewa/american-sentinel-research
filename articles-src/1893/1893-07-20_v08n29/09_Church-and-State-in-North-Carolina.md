THERE is no question of deeper interest to the provinces of the Canadian Dominion or to any country which at present lies outside the boundaries of the United States, than the inquiry, What would be the rights of such province or country with respect to provisions concerning religion within its territory? So far as the Federal Government is concerned, that, as we know, is debarred from touching the matter, by the First Amendment to the Constitution, which declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. That limitation on the powers of Congress is largely due to the course taken by North Carolina, which, as is well known, refused to adopt the Constitution, unless supplemented by amendments of which this was the chief. The fact shows that North Carolina was determined to reserve to itself as a State, the exclusive right of regulating religion; and, for that reason, the record of the relations of Church and State in that commonwealth is peculiarly instructive. The subject has recently been discussed at length and with singular lucidity by Prof. Stephen B. Weeks in a contribution to the series of the Johns Hopkins studies in historical and political science.

In North Carolina, as in Virginia, the Church of England was by law established up to the outbreak of the Revolution, and the abolition of it was one of the first steps taken in each State by the Convention called to frame a Constitution. That a majority of the inhabitants of North Carolina were Dissenters through the greater part of the colonial epoch is proved by the extreme difficulty, not to say impossibility, of levying tithes and providing other resources for the maintenance of the Anglican clergy. Nevertheless, although the payment of tithes could be evaded, there were other hardships and disabilities which Dissenters, including Presbyterians, as well as Baptists, Methodists, Quakers, Moravians, Mennonites, Dunkards, Unitarians and Catholics could not avoid. All these nonconformists suffered from the muster law, by which a distinction was made in favor of the clergymen of the Church of England and against dissenting ministers. Then, again, although Scotland was supposed to enjoy equal rights with England in the colonies, even Presbyterian ministers were not allowed to perform the marriage ceremony till 1766; and, when they did perform it, the fee went to the local minister of the Church of England. To other dissenters, Quakers excepted, this right was not conceded before 1776. Worst of all was the enforcement in North Carolina of the Schism act, repealed in England in 1718, which prohibited any one from keeping a school in the provinces unless he had obtained a certificate from the Anglican authorities. There is not a doubt that the enforcement of this act up to the period of the revolutionary war, through the widespread ignorance which it engendered, is directly responsible for the large percentage of illiteracy, and for the backwardness of intellectual activity characteristic of the State to-day.

If the Revolution really began in North Carolina, as the natives of that State contend, it was because the people were even more inflamed by a desire for religious freedom than by the wish for political independence. The Bill of Rights and State Constitution, adopted by the Provincial Congress at Halifax in December, 1776, asserted the natural and inalienable right of men to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences. It was further laid down that there should be no establishment of any one religious church or denomination in the State of North Carolina in preference to any other. Neither should any person, on any pretense, be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith or judgment, or be obliged to pay for the purchase of any glebe or the building of any house of worship, or the maintenance of any minister, contrary to what he believed right, or had voluntarily and personally engaged to perform. On the contrary, all persons should be at liberty to exercise their own mode of worship. These declarations involved the downfall of the Established Church. It only remained for the laws of the new State to be brought into conformity with the new Constitution. Marriage was put on a proper footing in 1778, by a law giving the privilege of performing the ceremony to all ministers alike. Next, the terms of the affirmation for Quakers, Moravians, Mennonites, and Dunkards were fixed. The restriction of school teaching to men fortified with the certificate of the Anglican authorities, of course, disappeared, and the law respecting the care of the orphan children of Quakers was repealed.

It is evident that North Carolina, from the moment that it declared itself an independent State, asserted an exclusive and unchallenged authority over religious matters. It could, had it so chosen, have retained the establishment and endowment of the Anglican or Episcopal Church. It might have established the Presbyterian Church, as it was then, and is still, established in Scotland. It might have given Calvinists of the Congregational type the same privileges which they enjoyed at the time in the Colony of Massachusetts. It might, had a majority of the colonists been Catholics, have made Catholicism the religion of the State. It did none of these things; but, in its fundamental organic law, it made, as we have seen, a close approach to universal toleration. Nevertheless, there was one provision, which, in process of time seemed to require amendment. The thirty-second section of the State Constitution of 1776 read as follows: "No person who shall deny the being of God or the truth of the Protestant religion or the divine authority either of the Old or New Testament, or shall hold religious principles incompatible with the freedom and safety of the State, shall be capable of holding any office or place of trust or profit in the civil department within the State." As time went on, there were various interpretations of this section. One theory held that it clearly excluded atheists and such deists as made a parade of their infidelity by proclaiming the Scriptures to be false. Others thought that it disqualified Jews also, on the ground that the latter must necessarily deny the divine authority of the New Testament. Still others maintained that Quakers, Mennonites, and Dunkards were disqualified, because their belief that arms cannot lawfully be used in defense of one's native country is subversive of its freedom and repugnant to its safety. Many lawyers declared, and their views seem to have been followed in practice, that the clause in question excluded nobody; that for want of a specified tribunal to expound and enforce it, the provision was a dead letter.

There is no doubt that the clause had been aimed at Roman Catholics. But it had never been interpreted against them. Thomas Burke, who publicly professed the Catholic faith, was a member of the Continental Congress from South Carolina, and, in 1781, was elected Governor of the State. There was no State office, from that of Governor down to that of constable, which had not, at one time or another, been filled by a Catholic. Perhaps the most distinguished of these was William Gaston, who had been successively a member of the State Senate, a representative in Congress, and a Justice of the State Supreme Court. No complaint was made when Judge Gaston assumed his seat upon the bench; nevertheless, it was thought best to amend the section in question when the matter came up in the Constitutional Convention of 1835. In the Constitution of North Carolina, framed and adopted then, the word "Christian" was substituted for "Protestant"; and thus, in the words uttered by Judge Gaston at the time, was the carcass of the last remnant of religious persecution interred, lest its pestilential effluvia should poison the atmosphere of freedom.—*N.
