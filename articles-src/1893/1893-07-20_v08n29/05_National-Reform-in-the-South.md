THE *Soldier,* a paper published at Columbus, Ga., in the interest of ex-Confederate soldiers, has, in the issue of June 1, 1893, about a month, half-filled of explanatory and so-called National Reform as it may set on one page.

The writer of the article, an advocate of the American Sabbath Union, has a long article entitled "The Lord's Day, Which?" in which he takes up the Sabbath question and answers the claims held by the Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists.

He says that while they "most of the time doctrines designated as evangelical, and are a wealthy class of citizens;" yet "they have placed themselves in antagonism to the movement for preserving the safeguards which new protect Sunday." And this opposition on the part of the leaders has assumed a violence that partakes of its malice; and a pride of opinion that will be satisfied with nothing short of uprooting the existing institution and creed of Christendom. "They confess they are friends and friends of the Bible great and before legislation." "They hold that while the Government has only Bible Sabbath, every one should be left perfectly free, so far as civil law is concerned, to observe any day, or no day at all, according to his own pleasure or his own sense of duty to God. On this point their influence and arguments are necessarily on the side of those who would remove the safeguards which protect the day."

Now, put this with what we find in the recent issue of the *Soldier:* Notice the "ward arts" of Sunday: "Seventh-day Sabbatharians are trying to break down our established day of rest and worship; and whether they succeed or not, we shall have no day. To destroy the one no existing world we have no Sabbath only for they could establish no other." And then in the same paper he asks the material question: "If we give up our Sabbath,—and there is no Sunday law, what about these Sabbatharians! do they never work on Sunday?" The question he would seem to form this, yet "they hold most of the doctrines designated as evangelical."

Well, if they hold "most of the doctrines designated as evangelical" by these other churches is that which they do not hold? It must be the "civil Sabbath," and as they have not this, "they do not hold." Is that the "civil Sabbath" the gospel?

Then what shall professing Christians certainly can be none other than this civil Sabbath.

And how do they intend to "carry out into the world" to the people "a purpose cut into the world as sheep among wolves" by. In the evening of the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. "The Soldier is believed by a necessary and godless band of 'local managers, who thus defy God and man;'" and then, after setting the Local Directory of the World's Fair, "International protests from all parts of the world," "not only Sabbath breakers but sinners and transgressors of the law of God and organization, the officer quotes from the Columbus *Enquirer-Sun,* discussing the following:

"The fact in the religious outlook in the Christmas country has suffered enough at the hands their past them, that of the gambling and settling tables of the land. It is a farce to the whole protest. If we believe the laws are enforced, will stand idly by, fold his arms and see the decalogue trampled upon by a law of Congress."

Most the great flood of National Reform is already, as this and certain objects of patriotic statesmanship of abysses and star gazing of the stars upon the whole. Some notes may be marshaled against this imposition just and righteous.

I need add no comment to these words or any others of the kind. This all comes not from Him who said, "If any man judge his brother or judge me, to the Father who sent me, and let us not judge him, nor, for I came not to judge the world but to save the world." And: "Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."

What is the influence of "dissenters" when such men as these got control of the civil power? Surely no one of much knowledge will not be far distant.
