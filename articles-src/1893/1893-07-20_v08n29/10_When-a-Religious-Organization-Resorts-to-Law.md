WHEN a religious organization resorts to the law to compel recognition of its tenets or customs, it proves its spiritual power to be at a low ebb. When it must have the aid of the State in the way of laws exempting its property from taxation soldiers and police to enforce its Sabbath regulations, grants of public money to support its institutions, and the like, there certainly is a screw loose in its spirituality somewhere. Some religious leaders are too eager to throw aside the sword of the Lord and of Gideon and seize upon the weapons which man hath fashioned by his own cunning.—*Independent Herald, Bertrand, Nebr.*
