RHEA COUNTY, TENNESSEE, is about to proceed against those who do not protect their lives by the established religion of the State, and keep the venerable day of rest, the legal Sabbath of the State of Tennessee. In its letter to the Grand Jury at Dayton on the 3d inst., Judge Trayer referred to the Seventh-day Adventists, reitificated their observance of Saturday, and said that the Mormons might as well contend for the privilege of practicing polygamy. The Adventists have an academy at Graysville, in Rhea County, and so everyone knows their reputation, for fair dealing, and exemplary lives is excellent. The only charge against them is essentially that law of their God. What the outcome of the judges' charge, that remains to be seen.
