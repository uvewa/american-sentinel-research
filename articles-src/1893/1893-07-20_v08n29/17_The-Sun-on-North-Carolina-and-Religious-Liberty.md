The account which the Sun gives of the evolution of religious toleration in North Carolina is interesting; but it is a mistake to suppose that by substituting the word "Christian" for "Protestant" in the constitution of that State, "was the carcass of the last remnant of religious persecution interred," even if Judge Gaston did say so. Jews and atheists are still under the same disability that Catholics were formerly, and the "pestilential effluvia" of persecution is just as likely to "poison the atmosphere of freedom" in that State to-day as it was before the constitution was amended by striking out the word "Protestant." But the Sun's is the popish view of religious liberty, which Cardinal Gibbons has defined as "freedom to worship God according to the dictates of a right conscience,"—the Catholic Church, of course, to determine what is a "right" conscience.
