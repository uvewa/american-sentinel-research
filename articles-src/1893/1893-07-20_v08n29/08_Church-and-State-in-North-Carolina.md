THE evolution of religious toleration and the provision of the Canadian Dominion has its interest. The Canadian statute contains the brotherhood of the United States Senate. What was the history of the rights of each province or religion adopted by their common country within the territory? So far as we know, is derived from touching those subjects only in the matters of the Constitution, which declares that no establishment shall be tolerated by the free exercise thereof. That limitation and the Constitutional provision by the course taken by North Carolina shows the influence of the Federal Constitution, unless supplying the needs of the colonies before; this the chief. The fact shows that North Carolina, as a State, the exclusive right of any one religious denomination has with the record of the relations of Church and State therein is well worth detailed study. But it would make this article too long, which has been abused at length and with singular ability in Judge Cook's historical contribution to the series of the Johns Hopkins University Studies.

In North Carolina, as in Virginia, the Church of England was by law established. The colony of North Carolina was under Church of England law, and the abolition of it was one of the first steps made in each State by the first legislatures called to frame constitutions. That a majority of the inhabitants of the Carolinas were well disposed to the Anglican Church, and the Wednesdays of the greater part of the colonial epoch is merely a fact. Dissenters were under an any impossibility, of leaving tithes and taxes for the support of the established stance of the Anglican clergy. Nevertheless, Calvinists of the Congregational type in the Lord and of Gideon and miss upon the time Colony of Massachusetts. It be evaded, there were other hardships and his own cunning.—*Independent Herald.* restrictions and disabilities that must be endured. Quakers, Moravians, Mennonites, Presbyterians, as well as Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans and Catholics could not avoid. All these noncorformists suffered from the master law, by which a law that was made in favor of the clergymen of the Church of England and against dissenting ministers. Thus, again, although Benwell was supposed to enjoy equal rights with England in the colony, even Presbyterian ministers were not allowed to perform the marriage ceremony unless by a special act of the assembly the few went to the lost minister of the Church of England. To Catholics and to Quakers excepted, this right was not conceded before 1763. Worst of all was the enforcement in North Carolina of the Schism act, expelled in England in 1714, which prohibited any one from keeping a school in the provision unless he had obtained a certificate from the Anglican bishop. There is no doubt that the enforcement of this act up to the several period of the revolutionary war, through a district of the colonial period in North Carolina, is directly responsible for the large proportion of illiterates and consequently weakness of intellectual activity characterized.

If the Revolution really began in North Carolina, as the natives of that State content, it was because the people were even induced by a desire for religious freedom than by the wish for political independence. The first State Constitution, adopted by the Provincial Congress at Halifax in November, 1776, guarantees to every citizen the right of men to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience. It was further laid down that there should be no establishment of any one religious church or denomination in the State of North Carolina in preference to any other. Neither should any person, on any pretence, be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith and judgment; nor be obliged to pay for the purchase of any globe of the holding of any house of worship, or the maintenance of any minister; that not the first, he believed right, or had voluntarily and without coercion joined. In this matter, certainly, all persons should be at liberty according to their own understanding. These declarations invited the downfall of the Established Church. It only remained for the laws of the new State to be brought into conformity with the Constitution. Marriage was put on a proper footing in 1778, by a law giving the privileges of performing the ceremony to all ministers alike. Next, the terms of the affirmation for Quakers, Moravians, Mennonites, and Dunkards were fixed, and the general requirement of being satisfied with the certificates of the Anglican clergy's ordinations of the same order children of God were was repealed, and the law respecting the care of the orphan children of Quakers was repealed.

It is evident that North Carolina, from the moment that it declared itself an independent State, asserted an exclusive and uncharged authority over religious matters. It could, had it so chosen, have retained the establishment and endowment of the Anglican or Episcopal Church. It might have established the Presbyterian Church, as it was then; and it still, upon established in Scotland. It might have given

Want a religious organization resorts to the law to compel recognition of its tenets or customs, it proves its spiritual power to be at a low ebb. What it must have the aid of the State in the way of law exempting of the property from taxation, soldiers and posts to reform the Sabbath, legislation, grants of public money to support its activities, and the like, it certainly is a serve loose in its spiritual affairs. Our Sunday law reformers are too eager to throw aside the sword of the spirit.

The record and just points of the evolution of religious toleration in North Carolina is interesting; but it is difficult to suppose that by establishing the word "Christian" for that of "Protestant" in the constitution of that State, is the careens of the last remainder of religious tests has really been passed. It ought to come. Jews and others who are still under the same disability that Catholics were. The "justification" of "particular" some of "persecution" is just as likely to be the atmosphere of Inequality in 1893 as it was in the colony of Massachusetts in 1659. To-day as if we hear the Adventist's mission was to eliminate. In the Constitution of North Carolina, the word "Protestant" was substituted for "Protestant" and the result, to the words uttered by Judge Gaston at the time, was the case of the last remnant of religion over persecution interest, let its prejudicial influence should poison the atmosphere of freedom.
