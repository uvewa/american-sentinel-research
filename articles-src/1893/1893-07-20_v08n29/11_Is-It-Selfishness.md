THERE are many selfish people in the world, but they can never see themselves that they are selfish. They think that everyone else is selfish and is trying to deprive them of their rights, but they cannot see that by their actions they are continually depriving others of their inalienable rights.

How is it with the Sunday-law advocate? He complains that because the World's Fair is open on Sunday the rights of the "Christian people" of the country are infringed. He virtually says: "We, the Christian people of the land, have asked that the Fair be closed on Sunday, and our request should be granted; not only so, but every person should be compelled to keep the day we regard as sacred." It matters not to him how much his fellow-man's rights are infringed so long as his are not. There are thousands who do not believe in the sacredness of Sunday, but that makes no difference to the Sunday-law advocate. In his eyes the "insignificant minority" have no rights that should be respected. Is there any selfishness in this? Is there any Christianity?

Christians should be freest of all people, for the Author of Christianity says: "Whom the Son makes free is free indeed;" but is a man free when his conscience is tied by a certain set calling themselves Christians? He is not; he is a slave, and that of the worst kind; for if he persists in being loyal to God, then he must suffer the penalty. He is called a law-breaker; he is put into prison; and if he still persists in being free in matters of religion, then stronger measures must be taken. The Sunday-law advocate has gone even so far as to threaten the use of the sword and the bullet if he does not have his way. But Christ said, "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." But to them that are persecuted for His sake He says: "Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven."
