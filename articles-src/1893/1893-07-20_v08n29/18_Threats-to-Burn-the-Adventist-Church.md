The Adventists are building a very nice little church at Ford's Store, Md., and some of the zealous Sunday keepers threaten to burn it down. One lady who makes a high profession in another church said she would furnish all the oil necessary to make sure work of it, or words to that effect. It is marvelous what some people will do in the interests of Christianity (?) and law (?).
