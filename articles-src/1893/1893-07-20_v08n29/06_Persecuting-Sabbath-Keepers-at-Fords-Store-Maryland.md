On Monday, June 26, 1893, Mr. Samuel Marvell, several warrants were issued against Mr. Geo. W. Marvell and Mr. Atwood Bryan, charging them with Sabbath-breaking, and indicted them to appear before Wakemansburg, June for, for trial. At one of the trials of Marvell, a lawyer representing Atwood Bryan, who was at the time carrying on his work at his trade, complained to Mr. Geo. W. Marvell. Seeing that Mr. Marvell had his own property drawn, we asked for them, so we could go around by the trundle to reluctantly; they were produced, and after going through them, we asked that nothing to postpone, on the ground that we had not been notified, which he was more agreeable if the case were postponed was impossible. We did by rights that we brought the case before Magistrate Ford, and that it was his duty to be present at the trial, and after some further discussion, counsel, no doubt, would come on Monday morning. On examining, offered this, and return in the morning. So the justice postponed the case to sit in this appointment. When that decision was made the of the case dragon began to run. The left so or our business had been attended to. But the people worried all, his justice as that he not yet put to do this case in, the cards, and that the people back there had said that he was going to be put to a stop. Three was witnesses on the case, and watched this matter that with interest, how much better for him not to listen to the witnesses. We felt that at the same time the result would come from. Mr. P. B. Hopper, the defense attorney. We were told that M. Hopper had been present, that without a doubt this case must have been dismissed, as we were not brought before him, with any charges whatsoever. So we decided to go to jail, wait to be notified.

We met on Monday, July 4, at 7 to 3 o'clock, before Magistrate Ford, the justice. Geo. W. Marvell and Mr. Atwood Bryan, and the defendant Mr. Marvell being present. The hall was crowded on the inside, a number of ladies being present, and some ladies who are opposed to us were on the outside. They came to us our brethren go to jail, but were advised to sit and you see what they were about. We interested. We estimate the attendance Before the witnesses were put upon that stand Mr. Ringold said that Mr. Geo. W. Marvell was not there upon stand and that they could find not charge him with any crime. The justice protested this course, and no one asked to wait it, and would not dismiss the case, it this was a matter that he was asked to take up, it thought it would take him another week to have what could be done right through the work.

Mr. Atwood Bryan's case was this Mr. Ringgold's opening was to charge Bryan with Sabbath-breaking. "Such a charge could not be had against him, according to the Maryland law who was working on the first day of the week, and that would have to be shown before him. But the justice claimed that the warrant was not a summons at all, that the charge was for Sabbath-breaking if it was for wewurthy. Of course, we had no money to test the case with, but had Junius Ford as first witness for the State.

Mr. Ringgold—What is your business?

(Mr. Ringgold objected to state the charge against the prisoner.)

Mr. Ringgold—Tell the court what you know about this case of Sabbath-breaking against Atwood Bryan.

Mr. Ford—I saw him husking corn in his field on Sunday.

Q. Ringgold—So Fred. was the Christian and made the charge—what did you do? Was there anything to show that Mr. Atwood Bryan was disturbing any one?

Mr. Ringgold—Never mind the Christian—did he do anything to disturb the neighbors? Answer my question. It does not matter what he was doing on the property.

(Here the deacon begins to argue, he says, to tell what he saw, but the lawyer would not allow him and not to answer the question.)

Mr. Ringgold—Was he disturbing anybody on that day? Answer yes, or no.

Mr. Ford—Yes.

Q.—In what way?

A.—By husking corn.

Mr. Ringgold—Never mind what he was doing, was he making any disturbance in the neighborhood of corn. Was he disturbing? Are they right shows down like beets? Did they not bother somebody?

Mr. Ford—Yes, he was breaking the Sabbath.

Mr. Ringgold—I am Mr. Taylor, and I now want to know how he was disturbing any one that day.

The State's Attorney was not there, and Mr. Ford was not able to stand cross examination of this kind, so the case was dismissed with costs. Here are some of the facts against the Sabbath-keepers in this town.

dipping potatoes for dinner, and cutting wood in this idolatry, for we read: "And he held there shall a man of God out of Bethel, and Jeroboam lived by his altar to burn incense. And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord; behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and man's bones shall be burnt upon thee." Here was a man preaching against the religious establishment, and refusing to obey the king and magistrates of the nation demanded prompt action, to it came to pass. What king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, "Lay hold of him. And Jeroboam had the law on his side, and did not propose to have a his holy day disturbed, and his religion, and still, the prophet to be arrested. Perhaps he realized that any one who opposed his religion was only enforcing the law."

Mr. Ringgold—In the matter of the career of Jeroboam, to the two claims mentioned in "Truth," and men and other "Jeroboam's followers" are found. Evidently the writer of the article mentioned, intended the sentence to apply to Seventh-day Adventists, whom in certain respects a "nefarious work." It is the case that Seventh-day Adventists have gained control of the civil power and are now able to if the arrest of those that differ with them in their observance of a day of rest. Such a thing has never been known, and never will be till the spirit of persecution dies. They are not followers of Jeroboam in any respect. How is it to reference to the holy-day commands by the Lord, they have diligently and even their observance of the eighth commandment of the rest of the ten commandments is according to the law of God. In this "Truth" "acknowledges that Adventists are their chief offender; he says—

There indeed comes of the teaching of the world shall not be tolerated by the church authority that unless we keep the seventh day of the week, which is the only Sabbath, we are sinners they are as unjustified above before God and the world as they can be.

Certainly they are not the followers of Jeroboam in any respect, and if others are compelled, therefore, to see if the principles of the civil law, the commandments, "Truth" and his fellow-men first find that, then these men came to do this. "Truth" defines the first day of the week to be "our holy sabbath day at rest on"—"derived of his own heart"—"that this day is more for rest Christians than Sabbatharians, now, the statement really looks as though Jeroboam had established a holy day "of his own heart" by his own commanding. Again it will bear noting that "Truth" says that the Adventists have secured the aid of civil laws to enforce their sabbath-day breaking, that proving their kinship with Jeroboam. Another feature of resemblance is that they are greatly disturbed because some prophet of the Lord speaks against their man-made institutions. Then "Truth" also never ceases for such destruction.

And if such teachings are not stopped native all over, this and how long our his papers are
