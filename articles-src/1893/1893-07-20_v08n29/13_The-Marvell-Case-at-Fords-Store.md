We print on page 228 of this paper under the heading, "Persecuting Sabbath Keepers at Ford's Store, Md.," an account of the trial of one Adventist before a Justice of the Peace at that place, and the postponement of another case, that of Mr. G. W. Marvell.

Mr. Marvell was arrested with only the pretense of a warrant. The paper which purported to be a warrant was not a warrant in any sense. Therefore, after taking the matter under advisement for one week, as related in the account given on page 228 by Mr. Ford, the justice issued a warrant and upon that Mr. Marvell was again taken into custody.

This case was tried on the morning of the 11th inst., and though there was no evidence to justify such a conclusion, Mr. Marvell was found guilty. The case was appealed. The fact is that it requires no evidence to convict an Adventist in Maryland of Sunday work. The charge is sufficient, and unless the accused can prove that he did not work, his conviction is a foregone conclusion.

In Mr. Marvell's case the constable who made the charge against him, and who arrested him, and who will get the fees, came to him the evening before the trial and said that he did not actually see him doing any work, and that if he would swear that he was not working that would settle it. This Mr. Marvell declined to do, and the next morning he was promptly convicted.
