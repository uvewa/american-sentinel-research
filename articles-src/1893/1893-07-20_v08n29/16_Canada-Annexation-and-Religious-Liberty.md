The Sun, in some respects the best of the New York dailies, is very anxious for the annexation of Canada, or, as some prefer to call it, for political union of the Dominion with the United States. Three considerations are in Canada urged against political union with the States: (1) Loyalty to the British Crown; (2) Loss of national identity; (3) The provision of the Federal Constitution prohibiting any union of Church and State.

It is of course the Roman Catholics who object to political union with the United States on the ground last stated, namely because Congress is by the Constitution prohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. And this objection the Sun undertakes to remove, not by showing the Romanists the iniquity of Church and State union, and the justice of religious liberty, but by assuring the papists of Quebec that their province could become a member of the American Union and still retain its ecclesiastical establishment. This is perhaps technically true, but it would not be true if the courts were to give to the First and Fourteenth Amendments the broad application of which they are capable. But whether true or not, it is a shame that a leading American newspaper should be willing to thus sell the American birthright for a mess of popish pottage.
