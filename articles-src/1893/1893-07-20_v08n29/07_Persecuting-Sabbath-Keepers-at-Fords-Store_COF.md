On Monday, June 26, 1893, Mr. Samuel Marvell served warrants of arrest upon Mr. Geo. W. Marvell and Mr. Atwood Bryan, charging them with Sabbath breaking, and notified them to appear on Wednesday, June 28, for trial. At one o'clock we were present. (The writer representing Atwood Bryan, who was not present.) The justice read the charge against Mr. Geo. W. Marvell. Seeing that the warrants were not properly drawn, we asked for them, so we could see exactly the trouble. Very reluctantly they were produced, and after going through them, we asked that the cases be postponed, on the ground that we had not counsel. The justice then asked the constable if the hour we suggested suited him. We told the justice that we thought that as Mr. Marvell was constable, and that it was his duty to be present at the time mentioned, that it suited us, as our counsel, no doubt, would come on Monday evening's steamer, defend the case, and return in the morning. So the justice postponed the case to suit our convenience. When that decision was made the spirit of the dragon began to rise. We left as our business had been attended to. But the people worried the justice so that he ran 300 or 400 yards to catch us, and said that the people back there had said he had done wrong; that they had come there as witnesses on the case, and wanted it to go on. We told him that it would be better for him not to listen to the witnesses and opposers, that his instructions should come from Mr. P. B. Hopper, the State Attorney. We also said that if Mr. Hopper had been present, that without a doubt both cases would have been discharged, as we were not brought before him with any charges whatsoever. So we declined to go back until the appointed hour on Monday, July 3, at 7.30 o'clock.

At the appointed time the prisoners Mr. Geo. W. Marvell and Mr. Atwood Bryan, with their counsel, J. T. Ringgold, were present. The hall was crowded on the inside, a number of ladies being present, and some ladies who are opposed to us were on the outside. They came to see our brethren go to jail, but were ashamed to let any one see that they were so much interested. We estimate the attendance at from 175 to 200.

Before the witnesses were put upon the stand, Mr. Ringgold argued that Mr. Geo. W. Marvell was not there upon any charge whatever, as the writ did not charge him with any crime. The justice could not see the point, or did not want to see it, and would not dismiss the case, but held it under advisement. He said he thought it would take him another week to decide whether the accused was legally before him or not.

Mr. Atwood Bryan's case was then taken up. The warrant charged Mr. Bryan with Sabbath-breaking. Such a thing or crime, Mr. Ringgold says, is unknown to the Maryland law, and that the warrant was not such as to bring the man before him. But the justice claimed that the warrant was only a summons, and that the charge was on his docket for manual labor, and that he should try the case if we were ready. Of course, we were ready, and the trial proceeded with Wm. Lloyd Ford as first witness for the State:

Justice.—Tell the court what you know about Mr. Bryan working on Sunday.

[Mr. Ringgold objected to that as the charge was made for breaking the Sabbath.]

Justice.—Tell the court what you know about Mr. Bryan's working.

Witness.—I saw Mr. Bryan between 9 and 10 o'clock on Sunday doing manual labor.

[The justice asked no more questions and the defense took the witness.]

Mr. Ringgold.—Mr. Ford, will you swear that you saw Mr. Bryan on the Sabbath day doing manual labor?

Witness.—I saw him working on the Christian Sabbath.

Mr. Ringgold.—Never mind the Christian Sabbath. Mr. Bryan is not charged with breaking the Christian Sabbath; he is charged with breaking the Sabbath.

Witness.—Sunday is my Sabbath.

Mr. Ringgold.—Mr. Witness, will you show me in this warrant where Ford's Sabbath is?

Witness.—I will not answer.

[At that time the dragon spirit began to rise, and the opposers who could not get in commenced to shout at the counsel, and another on the inside told witness not to answer the question.]

Mr. Ringgold.—Mr. Justice, if this is not stopped I want warrants for the arrest of these men for contempt of court.

[When they saw that our counsel would have no foolishness, they quieted down like lambs.]

Mr. Ringgold.—Mr. Witness, will you swear positively that Mr. Bryan did work upon the Sabbath?

Witness.—I will.

Mr. Ringgold.—Where were you standing when you saw him, and what was prisoner doing?

Witness.—I was at Mr. Taylor's, and I saw some one raising something up and down as if digging.

Mr. Ringgold.—Can you swear what he was raising up and down?

Witness.—I cannot.

Mr. Ringgold.—How far were you off?

Witness.—Three hundred yards (about).

Mr. Ringgold.—Do you know if he was doing manual labor or work of necessity?

Witness.—I do not; but I came within one hundred yards of him and saw him pick up his ax and cut some wood. Then he picked up something like a shovel and was shoveling something.

Mr. Ringgold.—Can you swear what Mr. Bryan was doing was not a work of necessity?

Witness.—I cannot.

Mr. Wm. Taylor was the next witness called. He gave the same testimony as his fellow-detective missionary or missionary detective, excepting he could swear at three hundred yards that Mr. Bryan was using a hoe. He has to wear glasses to read.

Mr. Ringgold.—Mr. Taylor, why did you have Mr. Bryan arrested?

Witness.—I love Mr. Bryan. I love everybody, and I did it so he would do right and go to heaven.

Mr. Ringgold.—Do you thought that a fine of $5.00 or thirty days in jail would send him to heaven, did you? [Witness would not answer.]

Mr. Ringgold.—Will you swear that the work Mr. Bryan was doing was not a work of necessity?

Witness.—No, sir.

Mr. Ringgold.—Will you swear that Mr. Bryan was breaking the Sabbath?

Witness.—No, sir.

Mr. Ringgold.—Do you know if Mr. Bryan was digging potatoes for dinner, and cutting wood to cook them with or not?

Witness.—I do not.

Mr. Ringgold.—Mr. Taylor, did you not swear out this warrant? (Showing the warrant.)

Witness.—I did not swear to any such warrant as that one.

This closed the testimony for the State, and as we did not want any witnesses, the case was left to the justice. As seen, there was no evidence whatever to prove that Mr. Bryan was doing other work than work of necessity or charity. But the justice's verdict was guilty. It is a common practice here to dig potatoes or such vegetables as grow in our gardens on Sunday, and never before has any one been arrested for doing such work on Sunday.

The people who are doing this have our earnest prayers, for they know not what they do. John 15, 2:3, says, that "They shall put you out of the synagogues, yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killoth you will think that he doeth God's service. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father nor me." It can be seen that they believe that they are doing God's service, when persecuting us for our faith, because they have not been to the Father or Christ. God has given us sufficient grace to bear up under it, and when worse comes (which will) we shall ask our Saviour for more grace, and he will give it according to his promise.

We ask every one to pray for these poor blind people who know not what they are doing. Ask God to open up their minds and hearts to the truth of the word of God before it is eternally too late.

CHAS. O. FORD.
