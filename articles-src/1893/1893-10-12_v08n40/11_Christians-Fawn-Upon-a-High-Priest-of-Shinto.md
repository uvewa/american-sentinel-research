"Christians" Fawn Upon a High Priest of Shinto.

An incident of the Congress of Religions is thus related by the Chicago *Inter-Ocean:*—

Four thousand people were packed into Columbus Hall to hear the address of Rt. Rev. Shibata, high priest of the Shinto religion of Japan. The reverend gentleman was introduced by Chairman Barrows, of the foreign congress, and by Bishop Keane, of the Catholic University, in the warmest language. He spoke of his great respect for the foreign country, and writing, and of his sincere hope for the welfare of its people, and then resumed his own seat after bowing in the most courteous manner, and was followed by other speakers.

A tremendous uproar was created upon his appearance. The women of the assembly rose with one accord and rushed for the platform. They seized upon the Shinto priest, Mr. Shibara, and shook his hand, while he bowed low at all the salutes. They brought their children forward and insisted upon his blessing the distinguished Oriental. He was presented with flowers and a splendid exhibition of the feelings of at least a part of the assembly for the platform. The surging to the platform was so tremendous that the crush appeared at times to be dangerous. All the stage words break loose, and there was one great rush for the Shinto high priest. The ushers were powerless and for some minutes the Shinto leader was at the mercy of the multitude. It was the most striking exhibition of friendliness throughout the assembly. It was the applause at the close of the address which precipitated the rush. It is safe to say that the ladies themselves were apparently more excited over the Shinto address than they were over that of Mr. Gladstone.

Comment is quite unnecessary. Every person who knows what Shintoism is, or who is slightly entitled to a respectful hearing, sees of what spirit this demonstration was. It may be, especially in a "Christian" land, more than words could write on the last line in the part of the record of the act just a prediction of the real nature of Christianity. It was a very fair illustration of the influence that those who take it upon themselves to represent Christianity before the world have, from an inborn element, come to represent Christianity itself.

Force has very secured true followers of the church, and has never made friends. True reform, in the true origin of the reform itself that secured conviction in the conscience and brought forth fruit. Sunday coming legislation is not reform. It is the unfailing of one element. Those who do thus should be taken that offenses are not torn down.
