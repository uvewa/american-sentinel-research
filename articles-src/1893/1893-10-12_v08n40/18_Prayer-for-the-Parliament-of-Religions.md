The committee on the religious congresses of the World's Fair Congress Auxiliary sent out an earnest request for universal prayer in behalf of the Parliament of Religions and its associated religious congresses. In reference to this appeal The Present Truth, of London, England, pointedly says:—

> We can have no faith whatever in any prayer that is offered to God with the spirit and the understanding that the Christian religion can unite with pagan systems of worship and be placed on a level with them in a common religious fraternity, or in behalf of the enterprise which seeks to bring this about. Nothing of this kind can be according to the will of God; for the will of God is revealed in his word, which makes a difference as high as the heavens between the Christian religion and all other religions whatever. We would suggest that this great congress be opened by reading these words from 2 Cor. 6:14-16, "What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?" Pending the answers to these questions, it will be in order to entertain a motion to adjourn sine die.

No such questions as these were seriously broached at the Parliament of Religions; when they threatened to make their appearance they were quietly brushed aside as out of harmony with the general sense of the parliament. That they certainly were. But this parliament was independent of any and all biblical authority, and could not be expected to adjourn because of the discovery of any discrepancy between its positions and the teaching of the Bible. It is very clear that the Apostle Paul would not have been, as a speaker at this parliament,—persona gratis,—and had his Epistle to the Corinthians been presented as a paper to have been read there, it would have needed careful editing by the committee.
