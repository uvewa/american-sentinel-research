THE GENUINE OFFSPRING OF THE UNION OF THE HOLY GHOST AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HIS SPOUSE, THE ONLY TEACHER OF PIETY, THE SOLE CUSTODIAN OF THE SABBATH, VIZ., THE CHRISTIANITY'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

The conduct of professed Christians has made such a view as this possible: "It is the 'Christianity' of the sects and not the Christianity of Christ that is intolerant."

*Man's inhumanity to man.*

"He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love."

THE GENUINE OFFSPRING OF THE UNION OF THE HOLY GHOST AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HIS SPOUSE, THE ONLY TEACHER OF PIETY, THE SOLE CUSTODIAN OF THE SABBATH, VIZ., THE CHRISTIANITY'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

The theologian is, therefore, obliged to investigate carefully a case and find the last act of the Mosaic ritual. He has studied biblical Christians that God had substituted the day of his resurrection for the Sabbath in the new law, and that the divine will is found revealed by the Holy Ghost in the apostolic writings.

We are informed that this radical change has found expression, over and over again, in a series of texts in which the expression "The day of the Lord," or, "The Lord's day" is to be found.

The class of texts in the New Testament beginning with the very first of the sixty-one on the Gospels, Acts and Epistles, and the second class, in which the claim for the existence of Sunday having been critically examined the latter class has the same, and, on the whole, found not to afford the slightest clue to a day of the week, much less changing the day of worship by name, we now proceed to examine the third and last class of texts relied on to save the biblical system from the assumption of worshiping no palm of on the world, in the name of God, a decree to which, that's it, not the slightest warrant or authority from their teacher, the Sacred Record.

The first text of this class to be found in the Acts of the Apostles, 2d chapter; verse, "the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord shall come." How many Sundays have gone over the world since that apostle! So much for that effort to prevent the meaning of the sacred term from the judgment day to Sunday? The second text of this class to be found in 1st Epistle Cor. 1st chapter, 8th verse: "Who also shall confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ." What simpleness does not see that the apostle fairly instructs the man of God of judgment? The next text of this class, as presented in the series, is in the same Epistle 5th chapter, 5th verse: "To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus." The enormous Corinthian was, of course, *saved on the floating court of destruction?* How pitiable such a makeshift as this! The fourth text, of 1st Cor. chapter, 13th and 14th verses: "And if trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end, even as ye also are ours in the day of our Lord Jesus." Sunday or the day of judgment, which? The fifth text, same Epistle, as St. Paul to the Philippians. For editorial

verses: "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ."

Phillips, in attaining perfection or the forlorn Sunday? Sunday could of course be of modern rapid transit!

We beg leave to submit our sixth of the class, eit. Philippians 1st chapter, 10th verse, "That ye may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ." That day was next Saturday, forsooth! not so long to wait after all. The seventh text is Peter 3d chapter, 10th verse, "But that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night." The application of this text to Sunday practice has, of course, no foundation in fact.

The eighth text, 1 Ep. Peter 2d chapter, verse, to enable his hearers "to obtain the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, into the coming of the day of the Lord." The ninth text in the series, for Ep. Jude, is likewise referred. "This day of the Lord" etc. is in dissected sec. This day of the Lord is then the day of judgment, and from this text, the application of both of which to Sunday and month's work of the ancient world assures the world next Saturday night? In all we have journeyed to our readings eight of the nine texts relied on to bolster up the claims of Scripture underpropping of to palm of the "Lord's day" for Sunday, and which "texts" quoted as such cannot prove, prima facie evidence of the last day; requiring its divinity, absurdity being so patent.

The ninth text wherein we meet the expression "the Lord's day," the last in fact, constitutes the apostle's writing. The last of the series of nine texts, in fact, the only one in the whole of the Scripture, found in the following words of the apostle, "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day;" but it will afford no more comfort to our Biblical friends than the predecessors of the same series. Has the Sabbath used the expression reverently in his gospel or epistle? Emphatically so, and had no occasion to refer to Sunday at all, whatever? Yet twice. How did he designate or refer, on these occasions? In the very same words as his Master when Sunday was called by him chapter twenty, "After Sabbath" (Matt. 28, 1st verse,) not in the words of "a week." Again, "twentieth Corinthians," verse, "Now when it is getting into the first day of the week of meeting," thus disposing of all claim to his use of "the first day of the week" for any Sunday or for the purpose of public worship for that week. Evidently, although the "Lord's day" is repeatedly used in the Gospel and Epistle, it was not used for Sunday "the first day of the week." On this one solitary text the whole theory is built. Why, he dropped that designation? Was he more when subjected to that the divine styrus, or did he adopt a new title for Sunday, because it was not to copy? A reply to these questions would be superfluous. It is plainly evident to every man that the same expression had been used eight times already in Sts. Luke, St. Paul, and St. Peter, in all of which it applied to the day of general judgment, and the Holy Spirit would not in its ninth reference convey a new day, whilst he inspired Sts. Luke, Paul, and Peter, at its eighth applications, to use the expression "the day of the Lord" for judgment "the Lord's day." Diabolicism rather surpasses the individual in this. Nor are the limits of denunciation yet reached. Far from it. Most valuable evidence is now submitted as to the day called by the Lord his own.

*It is perhaps only fair to say that we think the eight texts pointed out by the Mirror as not referring to Sunday are fairly presented in this series, and the point is well taken.*—Ed. Am. Sentinel.

keeping the Sabbath holy. In fact, it has only article of the Christian belief in which Protestants have failed as believers of biblical representatives. The keeping of the Sabbath constitutes the one and the palpable remnant of the biblical theory. The palpable remnant wholly well inconsistent against the fact manner of keeping the Sabbath in Catholic countries or contrasted with the proper, Christian, substantial method of keeping it in theory in Protestant countries. Who can ever forget the enormous indignities manifested by the inhabitants throughout the length and breadth of our country, from every Protestant church in which on the occasion of opening the World's Fair on Sunday was such a signal display of remorse shown for that day that one sect, to mark its holy obligation, closed the doors of all their churches during the whole time of the exposition, and he knows that contained its articles at a premium.

These superficially good and notorious Christians, by running over their Bible carefully, can find their counterpart in a certain class of merry-good people in the days of the Redeemer, who haunted him day and night, beyond measurements, and scandalizers! beyond forbearance, because the fall on keep the Sabbath in so strict-less a manor as do masters.

The hated him for using common sense in this labor in a manner they did not, and this excessive enough of his expression was only surpassed by the deadly hatred which it engendered. Without fear, it is very probable that the divine mind would not be unlike to many avoid the blatant outcry of their followers and sympathizers at the close of the nineteenth century. But when we add to all this the fact that while the Pharisees of old kept the true Sabbath, our modern Pharisees continue to the credulity and stupidity of their lives, have never once in their lives kept the Sabbath which the divine Master kept to his dying day, and which he kept, after his example, for thirty years following his death, as per the Sacred Record.

What a convincing contradiction involving a deliberate sacrificing rejection of a day kept by the Lord of life throughout his to-day in the articles of the biblical Christians. The Bible and the Sabbath constitute the watchword of Protestantism, but we have discovered that it is the Bible against their Sabbath. We have also shown that no greater contradiction ever existed than their theory and practice. We have proved that neither their biblical nor apostolic record, by which alone they stand nor fall, not one syllable authority for their Sunday. We have proved that the one Sabbath day in their lives. The fathers of the Protestant churches in their weakness of their weekly desertion of the Sabbath may be found in their adoption, while they have ignored and condemned their teacher, the Bible, they have adopted a day kept by the Catholic Church. What Protestant can, after perusing these articles, with a clear conscience, continue to teach or compel the observance of the *Saturday* to be kept, with command, his teacher, the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation and practice. The command "Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day" to the Lord commands him to stop.

The history of the world cannot present a more barefaced and continuous case of dereliction of principle than this. The Protestant churches are and have been for these pages that the law of the Sabbath be obtained in every regard, yet acknowledging as "the only infallible teacher," while the disciples of that half teacher as for over three hundred years observed the divine. That inconvenience was her acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church, and remains such by warrant, without a word of remonstrance from the Protestant world.

Let us now, however, take a glance at a second proposition, with a Bold teacher as the teacher and guide in faith and morals having under its control, not only forbids any change on the day for postmaster reason. The command "Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day," commanded to be kept by the teacher day and not changed, Protestantism would be an apostasy from an automatically fixed principle, religion and consequently as suicidal as it is within the power of human being to plan. Nor are the limits of denunciation yet reached. Far from it. Most valuable as leaving the bosom of the Catholic Church denying she could settle and determine all

of biblical Christians, the Methodists, the Baptists, and others who claim to have been abrogated, while the followers of the first Mother Church have been left a daughter, the Episcopal Church of the United States, are compelled by her with articles of religion, already quoted, to the ordination that the church guards lawfully not adding anything "contrary to God's written Word." God's written Word acquires its worship to be observed on Saturday, absolutely, repeatedly, and most emphatically, with a most positive threat of death to him who disobeys this hallowed law of that divine institution and the biblical sect to occupy the same self-stultifying position which no explanation can modify.

How truly the words of the Holy Spirit confirm this prophecy of Christ. "*Insipida mortalii of sols.*" "Inquiry of Holy Spirit of God," confirmed only the Bible only as teacher, yet, before the veil we all discern. It is legitimately a thrust aside and the teaching and practice of the Catholic Church,—and another abomination,—"when it suits their purpose to do recognize, here disingenuously, and most terrible threats pronounced by God himself, shatter those who do not 'Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day.'"

Before closing the series of articles, we beg to call our readers' attention once more to the two propositions stated hereunder: 1. The Christian Sabbath, the genuine offspring of the Catholic union of the Spirit with the Catholic Church, his only part thereof proved to be the groundwork, and necessary part of all faith and practice.

The first proposition needs little proof. The Catholic Church for forty centuries had years before the existence of a Protestant, by virtue of her divine mission, changed the day from Saturday to Sunday. We say by virtue of his divine authority, because, he who called himself the "Lord of the Sabbath," endowed her with his own power to teach, "He that heareth you, heareth me," commanded in reference, to the very act of which Protestants have stripped her.

The proposition establishes the impossibility of being placed with the "heathen and publican" to the end of the world. She holds her mandate and from her teacher, him-like as infallible as perpetual. The Protestant's action relative to the substitution Sabbath too strongly entertained to ever be practically discarded. Having been placed under the necessity of acquiring as in the arrangement, they are of course bound by that rule of faith, for over three hundred years. The Christians of the world, Catholic, and the acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church, and remains such by warrant, without a word of remonstrance from the Protestant world.
