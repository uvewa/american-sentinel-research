WE print this week the last of the four articles from the *Catholic Mirror* on the Sabbath question. We are not in sympathy with the traditions spirit manifested in the concluding articles, but give it just as it appeared in the *Mirror.* It is little wonder, however, that the inconsistencies of "Protestantism" in this very matter excites scorn and derision in Catholics. The "Protestant" claim that the Bible alone is their standard, and this they change of the Sabbath, is utterly without foundation in fact, and "Protestant" ministers know it. They learn the fine scorn with which they treat it. Again we ask, as we have asked before, what practical returns—or "reply to the taunts of Rome that they accept the authority of the Roman Catholic Church?
