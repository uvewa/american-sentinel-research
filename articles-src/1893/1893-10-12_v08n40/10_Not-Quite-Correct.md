THE *Sunday-School Times,* one of our ablest religious journals, of Sept. 9, 1893, says:

Many Christians who observe their Sabbath holy point to the fact that there is no warrant in the New Testament for the change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day. The answer lies in the fact that whereas the last book was written at least fifty years after the resurrection,—the change had been made, and the first day of the week, which the Church was steadily using for worship, was already known by a new name. So the term "Sabbath" is given to the first day rather than to the seventh,—and gives it "the Lord's day" (Rev. 1:10.) It is on uncertain the name the reform itself.

As regards the point that the term "Sabbath" is never applied to the first day of the week the above is absolutely

the written Word. They adopted the change on the strength of the fact that they had no more done than they also, admittedly proved, and by a perversity that is really incredible, refused to accept the teaching of the Catholic Church in their opposition to the natural way, and such continued teaching of their sole tradition in the moral doctrine of their standard, thereby emphatically undermining the authority of their sole rule of faith, the Bible—an act of mockery, a delusion, and a Sabbath of the individual.

But there are mistakes in this argument taken might be worthy of mention. The Sabbath is mentioned, and applies to the seventh day, eight times in the Acts, besides the use of the term in Acts 13:42. The other New Testament references to those mentioned above are Acts 13: 14, 27, 42, 44; 15:21; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4. 1 Cor. 16:2 does not refer to the weekly Sabbath, but to the first day—a collection of a taking up of things to come, of which the body was Christ. There is nothing about "a Sabbath" here. "The Sabbath" refers to the yearly sabbaths and feast days. Col. 2:16 is sometimes quoted as a reference to the Sabbath; but it really means that in the observance of these feast days the Sabbath was conserved in the service of those assemblies—how or where or what any more than it was any other week day or Sabbath kept.

They need only 1 Tim. 1:10, to know well to remark that the Lord's day, as thus constituted, never was the Sabbath day, the only day which the Lord ever claimed as his. See Ex. 20:10; Isa. 58:13; Matt. 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5; and note also the expression "the Lord of the Lord's day" *The Time of the Lord.*
