We print this week the last of the four articles from the Catholic Mirror on the Sabbath question. We are not in sympathy with the vindictive spirit manifested in the concluding article, but give it just as it appeared in the Mirror. It is little wonder, however, that the inconsistencies of "Protestants" in this very matter excite scorn and derision in Catholics. The "Protestant" claim that the Bible teaches a change of the Sabbath, is utterly without foundation in fact, and "Protestant" ministers know it; hence the fine scorn with which they treat it. Again we ask, as we have asked before, What can such "Protestants" reply to the taunts of Rome that they have no authority for Sunday-keeping except the authority of the Roman Catholic Church?
