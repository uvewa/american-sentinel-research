REV. W. A. GARDINER, of San Francisco, lately preached a discourse in favor of closing the gates of the Midwinter Fair on Sunday, in which, while favoring Sunday closing, he deprecated all resort to law and to force for the attainment of this end. As Dr. Gardiner said:—

It is so unmistakable to insist that the gates of the Fair should be closed on the first day of the week that we cannot afford in the asking, nor even "to keep to help" so it would be to demand that such attempt being it have was, his lot to be unable to for made for a force offering.

In the exercise of our governmental functions so understood to enforce divine conscience for other reason than that they are divine is present in all.

Surely this man is not far from an understanding of the fact that the first day of the week is not the Sabbath, and of an appreciation of the truth that allegiance is due to God in the things which are God's.

The committee on the religious congress of the World's Fair Congress Auxiliary sent out a recent circular request to its members and to others in behalf of the Department of Religions and its associated religious congresses. In reference to this appeal *The Present Truth,* of London, England, pointedly says:—

He can see, no one may discern in any prayer that is offered to God with the spirit and the understanding that the Christian religion can unite with pagan systems of worship and be placed on a common platform as being a good, comprehensive in or in behalf of the enterprise which seeks to bring them together. Nothing of this task was according to the will of God, for the will of God is revealed in his word, which makes a difference as huge as the space between light and darkness between true and other religions whatever. We would suggest that the words from 2 Cor. 6: 14-18, "What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?"

Posting the answers to these questions, it will be difficult to constitute a modern religion; not is the question an easy one.

No such questions as these were seriously broached at the Parliament of Religions; when they threatened to make their appearance they were quietly brushed aside as out of harmony with the general tones of the parliament. That they certainly were. But this parliament was independent of any and all biblical authority, and could not be expected to adjourn because of the discovery of any discrepancy between its positions and the

teaching of the Bible. It is very clear that the Apostle Paul would not have been, as a speaker at this parliament,—persona grata,—and had his Epistle to the Corinthians been presented as a paper to have been read there, it would have moral-caused ruling by the committee.
