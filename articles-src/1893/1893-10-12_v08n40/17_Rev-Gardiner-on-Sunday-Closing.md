REV. W. A. GARDINER, of San Francisco, lately preached a discourse in favor of closing the gates of the Midwinter Fair on Sunday, in which, while favoring Sunday closing, he deprecated all resort to law and to force for the attainment of such an end. Dr. Gardiner said:—

> It is as unreasonable to demand that the gates of the Fair should be closed on the first day of the week because God said, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy" as it would be to demand that each attendant bring a turtle dove, kid or bullock to be slain for a burnt offering.
>
> For man in the exercise of governmental functions to undertake to enforce divine enactments for no other reason than that they are divine is presumption.

Surely this man is not far from an understanding of the fact that the first day of the week is not the Sabbath, and an appreciation of the truth that allegiance is due to God in the things which are God's.
