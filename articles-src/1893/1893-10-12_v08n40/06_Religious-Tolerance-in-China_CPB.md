THERE is, it appears, quite a large number of Jews in China. The Jewish Times and Observer says: "That there are Jews living in China, not merely as strangers, but as real Chinamen to all intents and purposes, is acknowledged on all hands." A Chinese student, who returned to his celestial home from Germany, promised one of the German scholars that he would investigate the "Jewish Question in China," which he did, and in a very interesting letter he describes the Jews of Caifunyfoo as the only Chinese Jews who have formed a sort of colony in said place, whereto, nearly two thousand years back, the Jews emigrated and remained till now, true to their traditional and ancestral faith and customs. "The most remarkable features in their character," says the Observer, "is their loyalty to the Chinese Government and social manners; their garments, language, and manners of life are thoroughly Chinese. Thus, even the Chinese Jew proves the ofrepeated truth that the Jew can adapt himself to all requirements of diverse countries and civilizations and yet be faithful to his sacred belief in the unity of God."

In view of the facts, the Observer says:

> It appears that anti-Semitism has not yet crept into Chinese politics and religious views. The Jew enjoys, in China, liberty of conscience to the full extent. No prejudice against the Jews, as such, is as yet known in China. And, indeed, it cannot become naturalized there. Paganism suffered at its side, the rise of Monotheism without any malice or ill will. Religious intolerance is the legitimate off spring of the "only saving church." The moment the Christian Church proclaimed "extra sedesiam nulla salus," the monster "religious intolerance," was ushered into the sanctuary of humanity and commenced its infernal work of deserating that sacred edifice and dealing damnation among the children of one and the same heavenly Father. In China, no such monopoly of salvation by one mode of creed is yet known, and consequently all the diverse religious communities can live and cling to their inherited religious views and tradition unharmed. There, the Chinese Jew may exclaim with the prophet, "Let them all walk in the name of their different gods. I shall walk in the name of Adonai, my God, forever!"

Is it not a shame that the unchristian conduct of professed Christians has made such a view as this possible? It is the "Christianity" of the sects and not the Christianity of Christ that is intolerant.

"Man's inhumanity to man,
Makes countless millions mourn."

"He that loveth not knoweth not God;
for God is love."
