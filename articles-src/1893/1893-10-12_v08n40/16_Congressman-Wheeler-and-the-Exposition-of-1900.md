CONGRESSMAN WHEELER, of Alabama, has introduced a bill in the House of Representatives authorizing the holding of an international exposition in this city, in 1900, for the celebration of the beginning of the twentieth century of the Christian religion. As extraordinary as the proposition is it is really attracting attention in some quarters; notably from the Mail and Express, which devotes space to the opinions of a number of gentlemen on the subject. Ex-Judge Noah Davis is quoted as declaring heartily "in favor of the suggested exposition to celebrate the existence and progress of the religion of Christ for the last nineteen centuries." Where legislators and judges have so little realization of the limitations of the sphere of civil legislation is it to be wondered at that certain fanatical religionists do not understand that it has any limitations at all?
