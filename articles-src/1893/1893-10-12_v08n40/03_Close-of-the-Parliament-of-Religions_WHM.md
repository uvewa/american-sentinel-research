The Parliament of Religions closed with a grand display. It has been spectacular, dramatic, and effective in the popular presentation of its matter from beginning to end, and at last went out in a blaze of glory.

Great skill and ability has been shown in the direction and management of the parliament. No opportunity has been lost to make a striking point, and the interest has not been allowed to flag.

Long before the hour set for the beginning of the closing service, the large hall in which the sessions have been held was full, and the overflow filled another hall equally as large. The exercises, with the exception of the music, were then conducted simultaneously in the different halls,—the speakers hurrying quickly from one to the other. A large number of speakers, each occupying from three to ten minutes, were heard in rapid succession. Each glorified the Parliament of Religions and counted it as marking an epoch in the world's history,—as the beginning of a new era, the dawning of a new day. And so it is, no doubt; but it will not usher in that new day in which all are both to preach and to practice the principles of the brotherhood of mankind, according to the teaching of the great Elder Brother—"Whatsoever ye would that others should do to you, do ye even so to them."

From the closing address of Mr. Bonney, the President of the World's Congress Auxiliary, it appears that what the SENTINEL has, from time to time said, as to the plan and intent of this series of congresses held at the Art Institute throughout the entire summer, during the progress of the World's Fair, is true. Mr. Bonney said that the unification of religion had been a cherished thought with him for many years, and that this series of congresses had been conceived as a setting for the gem which the World's Parliament of Religions had proved to be.

Among other things said by Mr. Bonney was the following:

> This congress of the world's religions is the most marvelous evidence yet given of the approaching fulfillment of the apocalyptic prophecy,
>
> Behold! I make all things new.
>
> But great as this World's Parliament of Religions is in itself, its importance is immeasurably enhanced by its environment and relations. It is the center and crown of a great movement which touches all the leading interests of humanity. It has been aided by, and is, in turn, beneficial to all these interests.
>
> Religion is but one of the twenty departments of the World's Congress' work. Besides this august World's Parliament of Religions, there are forty other congresses in this department, besides a number of special conferences on important subjects. In the preceding departments 141 congresses have held 926 sessions. In the succeeding departments more than fifteen congresses will be holden. Thus the divine influences of religion are brought in contact with woman's progress, the public press, medicine and surgery, temperance, moral and social reform, commerce and finance, music, literature, education, engineering, art, government, science and philosophy, labor, social and economic science. Sunday rest, public health, agriculture, and other important subjects embraced in a general department.
>
> The importance of the denominational congresses of the various churches should be emphasized, for they conserve the forces which have made the parliament such a wonderful success.
>
> The establishment of a universal fraternity of learning and virtue was early declared to be the ultimate aim of the World's Congress Auxiliary of the World's Columbian Exposition. The congress of religions has always been in anticipation what it is now, in fact, the culmination of the World's Congress scheme. This hour, therefore, seems to me to be the most appropriate to announce that upon the conclusion of the World's Congress series as now arranged a proclamation of that fraternity will be issued to promote the continuation in all parts of the world of the great work in which the congresses of 1893 have been engaged.

The honey of the parliament was followed immediately, quite in the natural order, by the sting of the Sunday rest congress. Mr. Bonney also opened this with words of the highest commendation, personally identifying himself with the purposes of the congress and the movement it represented. There was to Mr. Bonney no sense of the inconsistency of his position in the parliament as contrasted with that in the Sunday rest congress. It is no injustice then to him to assume that what he said in opening the Sunday rest sessions was true, and that he really considered this, as he said, a continuation of, and of no less importance than, the parliament itself. His unity of religion is then a great combination for the furtherance of religious dogma, and the establishment of a brotherhood pledged to the enforcement of those dogmas by law.
