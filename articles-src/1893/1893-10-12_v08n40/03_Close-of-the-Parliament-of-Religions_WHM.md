THE Parliament of Religions closed with a dramatic conclusion, the last afternoon's dramatic, and effective in the popular enthusiasm of its member beginning to end, and at last went out in a blaze of glory.

Great skill and ability has been shown in the masterly and skillful management

of the program of the congress and the compact mass it represented. There was to Mr. Bonney no sense of the inconsistency of his position in the parliament as now contrasted with that in the Sunday rest congress which authorized him to him to insist to men that what he said in opening the Sunday rest congress was true, and that he really considered this, as he said, a continuation of, and of no less importance than, the parliament itself. His sanity of religion is then a great combination for bringing about a better feeling and the establishment of a brotherhood pledged to the moral uplifting of the people.

W. H. M.
