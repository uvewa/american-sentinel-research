THE Michigan Barber's Sunday-closing law is under discussion in the courts of Detroit. Judge Gartner of the Recorder's has great-openly expressed his belief that the law is unconstitutional. The Boss Barber's Association is determined that however unconstitutional the law may be it shall be enforced, and consequently some body who opens to catch a dollar with eyes wide open to catch a fellow workman under it, make a service and a customer on Sunday. The case is already on trial, and a number of test further arrests are expected.
