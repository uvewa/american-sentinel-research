# Uncertainties — v08n40, 1893-10-12

## Masthead

- The OCR reads "CALVIN P. BOLLMA." (truncated) for the first associate editor — transcribed as "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN." This is consistent with C. P. Bollman known from other issues. Confidence: HIGH.
- The second associate editor is listed as "WILLIAM H. BURKE." — this name does not appear in the known authors list. The initials W.H.M. signed on articles in this issue correspond to "W. H. McKee" per the project's known author list. It is possible "WILLIAM H. BURKE" is a variant or OCR error for W. H. McKee, or a different person. Confidence: LOW. Flagged for review.

## Article 07 — "The Christian Sabbath" (reprint from Catholic Mirror)

- The subtitle reads "SELF-COSTRADICTORY" — this appears to be an OCR error or original typo for "SELF-CONTRADICTORY." Preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR. Confidence: MEDIUM.
- Footnote dagger (†) references a long editorial note with garbled OCR text, including "Isis. 58:10" (likely "Isa. 58:13"), "Mark E:98" (likely "Mark 2:28"), and "faithath a delight" (corrupted text). The footnote was omitted from the article body as it is an editorial footnote appended to the reprint, not part of the Catholic Mirror text itself. The note is attributed to "Eurone Sentinel" — likely OCR for "American Sentinel."
- The word "R-deemer" on page 5 appears to be a partial OCR capture of "Redeemer" — preserved as printed (the original likely read "Redeemer").
- "pharissical" — likely "pharisaical" — preserved as printed.
- "watchward" — likely "watchword" — preserved as printed.
- Page 5 reference: "the good work in you, will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ" — the passage references Philippians 1:6 but is quoted as the fifth text. The original article's logical numbering is preserved.

## Article 06 — "Religious Tolerance in China"

- "ofrepeated" — likely "oft-repeated" with a space/hyphen lost in OCR. Preserved as printed in OCR source.
- "deserating" — likely "desecrating" — preserved as printed.
- "extra sedesiam nulla salus" — the standard Latin phrase is "extra ecclesiam nulla salus." "Sedesiam" is likely an OCR error or a variant spelling in the original. Preserved as printed.

## Article 02 — "Episodes of the Parliament of Religions"

- "bales sold" — likely "babes sold" (referring to children sold on the auction block). The OCR reads "bales" which would be unusual in this context. Preserved as printed; flagged as possible OCR error. Confidence: LOW.

## General Notes

- The page 7 content (APPLES OF GOLD LIBRARY, SOME VALUABLE BOOKS FOR YOUNG MEN, etc.) is advertisement material and was skipped entirely.
- The railroad advertisements (Grand Trunk Railway, West Shore Railroad) on page 7 were skipped.
- The subscription/terms block on page 8 was skipped.
- The footnote section at the bottom of page 4 (the dagger footnote to "The Christian Sabbath") contains heavily garbled OCR text and was not included in any article file, as it is an editorial footnote not part of the Catholic Mirror article body.
