# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, October 12, 1893 (v08n40)

## General Note
This issue presented significant OCR challenges throughout. The scan quality is relatively low resolution for the dense, small-type text of this 8-page newspaper. Many passages were difficult to read with full confidence, particularly in the longer articles. The following specific uncertainties are noted:

## Page 1 (313) — "The Parliament of Religions"
- **Multiple passages throughout**: The dense text in all three columns was challenging to read at this resolution. Several phrases may contain minor reading errors.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM throughout the article

## Page 2 (314) — "Chicago Correspondence"
- **Multiple passages**: The continuation of this article has very dense text. Several sentences may not be perfectly transcribed.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes

## Page 3 (315) — "President Cleveland's Letter to the Pope"
- **Author attribution line**: The byline appears to read "[BY POINT F. SHANNON, D.D., Washington, D. C., IN THE Rocky Mountain American.]" but "POINT" may be another name.

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
