Chicago Correspondence.

The progress of the Parliament of Religions is no less striking than its opening. It has been full of dramatic episodes,—both in scenic effects, brilliant rhetoric, and plain and unpalatable truths told gracefully and effectively.

In this parliament the representatives of popular Christianity have listened with courtesy, and sometimes even with approbation, to deserved criticisms from the Jew, the Hindoo, the Japanese, and the negro, such as would never at any time heretofore have been heard with patience, or even without violence, either threatened or actual. This means something; it is indeed significant of much. It would seem to indicate that the so-called Christian world has come to the dividing point between two ways, and here,—standing for a moment undecided,—must choose which shall be followed. From out of all this theory, and sentiment, and poetry of human religion,—deification of humanity,—there is likely to arise, sooner or later, in a more or less pronounced and palpable form, a philosophy of religion. This philosophy, although at first professing the common brotherhood of mankind and universal tolerance, would eventually espouse the gospel of force as it exists in the history, the life, and the prophetic future, of its ever present and never changing religious representative.

From out of this great assemblage, gathered at the dividing of the ways, some will emerge with an appreciation of the futility to mankind of any attempted self-regeneration, and with a realization of man's entire dependence upon divine power. But so strait and narrow is the intellectual gate through which these must walk that few will find it and fewer still pass through it. The popular religious road is broad and crowded and leads, very properly, through a "Palace of Art." But time is fleeting, and human art, the creations of men's hands and men's minds, will not be for long. What shall be said in the judgment day? The noblest philosophy will then be no better dependence than the reed swayed in the wind. Yet it will be no wonder that under the stinging rebuke of the clear-minded Oriental who so incisively and mercilessly lays bare the rotten core of false Christianity,—and the pathetic story of the wrongs of the negro which he has suffered and is still suffering at the hands of a professed Christian Church and "Christian people" and "Christian Nation,"—it will indeed be no wonder if, listening to the recital of all these and knowing the truth of it all, many, unable to see the true, so hidden is it by the false, will turn to the human philosophy in the belief that here at least, and at last, they will find a humane spirit and sense of common brotherhood.

As noticeable and remarkable a thing as any of all the remarkable incidents of this parliament have been the terrible lessons read to the assembled religious aristocracy of this western world by those whose skins bore, either by inheritance or birth, the tint of the suns of other and warmer lands. A marked example was the address of Mrs. Fannie B. Williams, who spoke for her race with a calm, clear-voiced, gentle courtesy, but with an unreserved truthfulness which was pathetic in its kindly tenderness, and that made the bitterest facts seem to be told in the spirit of the words, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do":

> The strength and weakness of the Christian religion as believed, preached and practised in the United States, is aptly illustrated in its influence as a civilizing and educational force among the colored people of this country. The negro was brought to this country by Christians, for the use of Christians, and he has ever since been treated, estimated and gauged by what are called Christian ideas of right and wrong.
>
> The negro has been in America so long and has been so completely isolated from everything that is foreign to American notions as to what is incompatible with Christianity that he may be fittingly said to be entirely the product of Christian influences. The vices and virtues of the American negro are the same in kind and degree as those of the men and women from whom he has been learning, by precept and example, all that he knows of God and humanity. The fetiches and crudities of the dark Continent have long since ceased to be a part of his life and character. He is by every mark, impulse and aspiration an American Christian, and to the American Church belongs the credit and responsibility of all that he is and is to be as a man and citizen of this Republic.
>
> Religion, like every other force in America, was first used as an instrument and servant of slavery. All attempts to Christianize the negro were limited by the important fact that he was properly of a valuable and peculiar sort, and that the property value must not be disturbed, even if his soul were lost. If Christianity could make the negro docile, domestic and less an independent and fighting savage, let it be preached to that extent and no further. Do not open the Bible too wide.
>
> Such was the false, pernicious and demoralizing gospel preached to the American slave for two hundred years. But bad as this teaching was it was scarcely so demoralizing as the Christian ideals held up for the negro's emulation. When mothers saw their bales sold by Christians on the auction block in order to raise money to send missionaries to foreign lands; when black Christians saw white Christians openly do everything forbidden in the Decalogue; when, indeed, they saw, as no one else could see, hypocrisy in all things triumphant everywhere, is it not remarkable if such people have any religious sense of the purities of Christianity?

Will not the verdict upon such an arraignment as this be an affirmative reply to the speaker's oft-repeated query, "Do we not need a different Christianity from this?"

Will it be a wonder, if, when both the foreign guest, and the alien blood domesticated within our gates, rise up and call our religion accursed, the people will say: The day of religions is past, we will create a philosophy of our own. But upon no man made philosophy can dependence be placed, either for time or eternity. What will be the outcome of the Parliament of Religions?
