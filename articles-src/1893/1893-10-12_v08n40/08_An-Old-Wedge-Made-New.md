The devices of our Roman Catholic friends to secure a part of the public school funds for the support of their sectarian schools are many and ingenious. Foiled in one attempt, they begin another without loss of time, varying the mode but never the purpose. Formerly the cry was for the destruction of the "godless schools" out of hand, and the division of the funds among Protestant and Roman Catholic parochial schools; but that scheme, presented in its naked deformity, has suffered so many and so signal defeats that it is now apparently abandoned, and another, a sort of "Trojan horse" proposition, which it is hoped may prove less offensive to the popular mind, has been substituted for it. The so-called Faribault plan is one form of the new crusade; another has just been proposed by Dr. Martin Walsh, editor of The Sunday Democrat and The Sunday Herald, of which the author enthusiastically says: "I think that at last a solution of the parochial school question has been found which cannot but receive the commendation of Protestants and Catholics alike."

The plan is this: Whenever a sectarian school applies to the State for aid the State shall appoint an inspector to visit and examine it, at least once a month. The examination is to be fully up to the public school standard, and for every scholar who passes there must be a pro rata allowance, equal in amount to the cost of similar instruction in the public schools. In support of this plan Dr. Walsh says:—

> The education for which the State is bound to provide is secular education, and if the parochial schools give the required education in the necessary and useful branches of natural knowledge, the State ought to pay for it. We have not one word to say against the public schools. We do not ask from the State any aid for Catholics toward religious education, but toward secular education which is up to the public-school standard. We do not want from the State a single cent for lessons in catechism.

But to this Dr. Walsh adds, with an apparent simplicity which looks a good deal like guile, that "if the teachers in these schools season their instruction to a certain extent with religion, the State is not asked to pay for such seasoning. [The italics are ours.] Let the State, through its school inspectors, watch the teaching, and see that as secular teaching it is worth its pay." As a specimen of Jesuitical casuistry this statement could hardly be surpassed. Aside from this, we have two things to say about the proposed plan.

In the first place, the proposition to pay for each scholar passing the required examination in the parochial schools, supposing they were fully up to the standard, the same amount as the cost of similar instruction in the public schools would be unfair, because it would involve the payment of a good deal more than the instruction in the Catholic schools would cost. We once heard a Roman Catholic city councilman protest vigorously against the regular appropriation for the public schools of his city on the ground that they cost far too much for teachers' salaries. "Why," he said, "we don't pay any such salaries in our church schools. Our priests and 'brothers' and nuns do the teaching, and, not having any families to support, do not need such high salaries." As the teaching in the Catholic parochial schools is almost exclusively done by the "religious," this statement is of general application. If, then, the cost of the secular instruction, "seasoned to a certain extent with religion," would be considerably less than the pro rata allowance provided for, where would the surplus go? To ask the question is to answer it. Thus the State would be contributing indirectly to the support of the Roman Catholic Church, to say nothing of the direct support given through the neat little plan for helping it by seasoning the secular with religious—that is, sectarian—instruction.

But there is another cogent objection. What safeguard would there be against the appointment of incompetent or pliant inspectors to examine these parochial schools? The Roman Catholic Church has not been unduly modest in the past in seeking favors from the State, or in using its immense influence to force compliance with its desires. It would not be found a task beyond its power, we fear, to procure the appointment of its own tools to do the inspecting. Nor, if experience teaches true, would there be any hesitancy in submitting false reports as the basis for a claim for compensation. Is this a harsh statement? Take an illustration: At Barnadillo, New Mexico, there was (and we presume still is) a Roman Catholic boarding school, ostensibly for Indian girls, carried on by the Sisters of Loretto, but until recently supported out of the national treasury as a "contract school"—the contract being that compensation should be allowed only for Indian girls taught in the school. It became known at the Indian Bureau that the reports of attendance were untrustworthy, and an Indian school supervisor was sent to inquire into the matter. He found that a considerable number of the pupils seemed to be Mexicans. The teachers, on being questioned, insisted that the girls were Indians, but careful investigation showed that, out of a total of seventy enrolled as Indians, forty-two were pure-blooded Mexicans, but credited to various Indian tribes in order to cover up the deception. Now we do not mean to say that similar deception would be practised in every case; but the example shows what has been done, and what may be done again, to secure Government aid for sectarian schools.

There is no just ground for the diversion of the public school funds to the support of parochial schools of any kind. All schemes to accomplish that end are equally objectionable, and should be met by a stern and unwavering refusal. Our public schools should be strenuously guarded against "entangling alliances" with sectarian schools. The plan of Dr. Walsh, so far from being one which "cannot but receive the commendation of Protestants and Catholics alike" must be regarded as only the old wedge, slightly changed in form, for reading sounder and destroying our admirable system of free schools; and this we beg to say, cannot receive the commendation of Protestants.
