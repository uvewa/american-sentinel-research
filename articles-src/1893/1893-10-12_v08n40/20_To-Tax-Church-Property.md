"To tax church property is to tax God, says The Catholic Review, and adds no comment to its solitary epigram. Let us see. Then to rent church property is—what? To sell church property is—what? To insure church property is—what? To mortgage church property is—what? To hold a raffling fair in church property is—what? The epigram has more bray than brains."
