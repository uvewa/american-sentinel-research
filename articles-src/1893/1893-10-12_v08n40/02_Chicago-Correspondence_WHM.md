THE progress of the Parliament of Religions is not less striking than its opening. It has had a feast of eloquence,—a feast both in scenic effects, brilliant coloring, rich and dignified oratory, that mounts graphically and effectively.

From out of a promiscuous gathering of popular Christianity have risen great spiritual figures which have astonished the Jew, the Hindoo, the Japanese, and the Chinaman,—men with whom Christendom heretofore have been with patience, somewhat akin to that of contempt, reasoned or actual. This means something that the very fact of recognition would seem to indicate that the so-called Christian has made more real and practical progress between two ways, and born,—standing as he does at the parting of the roads—a which shall be followed. From out of all this has arisen in glaring light what is human religion,—indication of formality, —there is likely to be evolved a principle, or, in a more understandable definition, a form, a philosophy of religion. This taking as a basis of what seems to be the common brotherhood of mankind and going forth from there to the peoples, to oppose the gospel of force as it exists in the religious forms, and to look with new eyes at its ever present and never changing motive force.

From out of this great assemblage, gathering as it does within the same walls, will emerge with an appreciation of the futility to mankind of any attempted enforcement of religion—of the failure of man's entire dependence upon divine grace—of the many difficulties and the infinitesimal gate through which these must still pass through. The popular religion could in its broadest term and results, very properly, through a "Palace of Art." But that so fleeting, and form, and the creation of men's hands and men's minds, will not be for long. What shall it be in the judgment day? The noblest philosophy will then be mightier than all that the reed swayed in the wind. Yet the probing rebuke of the clear-minded Christian who so intricately and meritoriously lays bare the inner life of the modern church —and the pathetic story of the wrongs of the American negro whose people are still suffering at the hands of a professed Christian Church and "Christian people" and "Christian Nation,"—it will indeed be no wonder, listening to the recital of all these and knowing the truth of it all, unable to see true, as the human

heart as a whole was that that Christ is the Saviour of the world and the Son of the living God,—only a human being, a great prophet,—was Balaam, and Confucian.

Mohammed, good, beautiful, soul sweet, and kindly, and humane, the utterance of this parliament may have been, still, then, they have not been the expression of true religion.

Viewed from a literary and artistic standpoint this has been the noblest assembly of the kind ever known. But from the standpoint of the Word of God, it can be but another, and the highest and last, example of the utter futility of all mere human effort in religion.

If it by the false, will turn to the human philosophy is the belief that there at least, and at last, they will find a human spirit and means of common brotherhood.

As noteworthy and remarkable a thing as any of all the remarkable incidents of this parliament have been the terrible personal truth to the eastern religions of the capacity of the western world by its own sinners alone, either by inheritance or birth, to practice what it preaches as Christian.

A marked example was the address of the Japanese lady who held her own for her race with a calm, clear-voiced, graceful serenity, but with an innervated truthfulness which was pathetic in its kindly fearlessness, and that made the historical facts seem to be told in the spirit of the words, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."

The same yearning to reach the churches as to believe, preached and practiced in the United States the right and the golden rule of the gospel to the colored and all the peoples of this country. The negro was brought to this country by force and compelled to labor against his will, and without pay, and robbed of what are called Christian times of right and liberty.

The negro has been in America so long and has been so leavened by this false and unholy contact with Christianity that he may be fittingly classified as an "American negro." Primarily, the negro race is the same in kind and degree as those of other races. The American negro is to-day practicing, by precept and example, all that he knows of Christianity that has ever been taught to him. For good or evil, for weal or woe, it has become a part of his life and character. He is by every human right entitled to all the moral support and responsibility of all that he is and is to become in the United States.

Religion, like every other force in America, was compelled to recognize the presence of the negro by the important fact that he was property of a money value and a marketable commodity. If the gospel of the Redeemer of the whole world is true, it is so to every human creature no matter of what race. If Christianity could make the negro desire, and know, and understand; and his desire for education, let it be preached to that extent and no farther,—then those who have "brought" Christian light and gospel to the American shores should have gospel preached to the American slave for two hundred years and yet have kept him in slavery and held up for the empire's conclusion. When mothers sell and traffic, block by block, their own children block in order to raise money to send missionaries to the heathen,—and when a general of the American Army places a price of a negro per head for scalps of Indians, who, indeed, they saw, as no one can see in the light of what we call nineteenth century Christian civilization, standing in the way of the white course of the partition of a great continent.

It will be a wonder, if when both the formal pious, and the afar, blood climes tincted within our gates, rise up and call us—and can they not?—blessed. In this day of religions if past, we will create a philosophy of one, or an acceptance of man made philosophy can dependence, in place, either for time or eternity. What will be the outcome of the Parliament of Religions?
