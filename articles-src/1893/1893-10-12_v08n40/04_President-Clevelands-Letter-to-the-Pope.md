[BY POINT F. SHANNON, D.D., Washington, D. C., IN THE Rocky Mountain American.]

Rocky Mountain American.

The readers of your paper are familiar with the letter of President Cleveland to the Pope of Rome, congratulating him on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of his elevation to the episcopacy of Rome. That letter did not express the sentiments of at least fifty millions of our people, and is certainly offensive to most of them. If it be true that a president is to express in his public acts what he fairly thinks the people think, or in behalf of what a large number of the people think,—for then the people, then our President has overstepped his mark to a degree to which he is to publicly act for what he believes is for the interest and future good of the country,—then to cultivate intimate relations with the papal throne is simply stupid.

The American people do not wish their President in extending to the Pope any congratulations bearing on his official elevation. We are aware to say man being congratulated for being advanced to distinguished rank in any form of organization which holds partly of the institution of States, at the time of the elevation of a bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in our own country, is nothing improper or unusual—a kind and well-beloved and remarkable man? The spirit of reciprocity of rank, as not would have found an echo in the hearts of all the American people. And yet, though the political wisdom of a president doing such a thing upon a strictly religious occasion, might well have been considered, has a fine stiletto point to it. Did Pope Leo's elevation to the episcopate call for international? Certainly not! Such a course leads necessarily to worse than personal diplomacy. Nor would he, on each presidential occasion, represent a nation of fifty million people. Was the domination of this letter, that of a political concern in the relation to the papacy, a matter of this letter, that of a political connection reason which has in it a grain of sense, illusions in taken the cream is but enough. The shame of it is deep, and the monarchical tending of it not slight. The President is certainly not ignorant of that most important historical fact, that among all western nations, vit, that any curliness, or anything more than a formal courtesy, by the head of an independent nation and the head of the papal power, is dangerous in the extreme, and is full of the certainty of the most dangerous complications

that including the attention of Mr. Cleveland to the example of a former President, Mr. Lincoln. Having evidence of the disposition of the Pope to interfere in American affairs, Mr. Lincoln directed the Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, to recall our minister, then resident at Rome, to notify the Pope that it was distinctly expected by the American President that there would be no papal interference in the affairs of the United States.

It should be widely known that the Pope has not even been able to prevent the leading Roman Catholic cardinal from publicly naming his successor, and death of Cardinal Manning, of England. And it is known that following this proclamation the letter to the Pope of Rome was written: That is a coincidence which has a significance.

This habit, which has been to the front for the last many years of our Presidents courting the favor and submitting to the dictation of Romish Church, ought to be rebuked in its results on good to a lot of every American citizen on guard duty, and not on his good terms of satisfaction.
