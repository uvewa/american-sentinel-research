(By SCOTT F. HERRSEY, Ph. D., Washington, D. C., in Rocky Mountain American, of September 8.)

Editor Rocky Mountain American:

The readers of your paper are familiar with the letter of President Cleveland to the Pope of Rome, congratulating him on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of his elevation to the episcopacy of Rome. That letter does not express the sentiments of at least fifty millions of our people, and is certainly offensive to most of us. If it be true that a president is to express in his public acts what he fairly thinks represents the views held by a majority of the people, then our President has certainly misunderstood us this time; or if he is to publicly act for what he believes is for the present and future good of the country,—then to cultivate intimate relations with the papal throne is simply stupid.

The American people do not unite with the President in extending to the Pope any congratulations bearing upon his official elevation. We are averse to any man being congratulated for being elevated to distinguished rank in any form of organized evil which means peril to free nations.

Why did not the President of the United States, at the time of the elevation of Phillips Brooks to the bishopric of the Episcopal Church in our own country, extend his congratulations to that noble and well-beloved and remarkable man? The spirit and sentiment of such an act would have found an echo in the hearts of millions of the people of this country, though the political wisdom of a president doing such a thing, upon a purely religious occasion, might well have been questioned.

There is a question to be asked which has a fine stiletto point to it. Did Grover Cleveland send this letter to the Pope solely upon the grounds of religious sentiment? Certainly not! Such a course would be without a precedent in American diplomacy. Nor would be, on such pretext, insult the religious sentiments of fully fifty million people. Was the dominant motive, which determined the sending of this letter, that of a political consideration? Certainly it was! No other reason which has in it a grain of sense, can be given. Whichever horn of the dilemma is taken the case is bad enough. The shame of it is deep; and the meaning of it may be equally deep. Mr. Cleveland is certainly not ignorant of that most terrible lesson taught by the history of modern nations, viz., that any courtesies, or friendly intercourse of any kind, between the head of an independent nation and the head of the papal power, is dangerous in the extreme, and is full of the certainty of the most dangerous complications. I feel like calling the attention of Mr. Cleveland to the example of a former President, Mr. Lincoln. Having evidence of the disposition of the Pope to interfere in American affairs, Mr. Lincoln directed the Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, to authorize our minister, then resident at Rome, to notify the Pope that it was confidently expected by the American President that there would be no papal interference in the affairs of the United States.

It should be widely known that the President sent for Cardinal Gibbons, who is the leading Roman Catholic cardinal in the English speaking world since the death of Cardinal Manning of England, to confer with him upon matters political. And be it known that following this prolonged conference this letter to the Pope was written! That is a coincidence which has a significance to it.

This habit, which has been to the front for the last eight years, of our Presidents courting the favor and submitting to the dictation of Roman Catholics, ought to be rebuked. It brooks no good to us. Let every American citizen do guard duty, and watch our cherished institutions, or we will be despoiled of them.
