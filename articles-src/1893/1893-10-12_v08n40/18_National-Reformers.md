The National Reformers are still demanding a religious amendment of the Federal Constitution. The last number of the *Political Dissenter* says:—

The imperative need of a Christian amendment to our Federal Constitution is urged with greater earnestness in view of the action of certain persons at the opening of the World's Fair on the Sabbath. In a land where it can be seen that such constitutional amendment must be made, we are atheistic Nation. And not as Christian Nation are atheistic at all, but truly are a Christian people of the fact. Shall a demand be truly made to say, and not to on a political basis or religious basis but on the basis of the in this particular question of opening the Fair on Sunday, have a strong and most powerful lever. That this is, as the above issues sound, a Christian Nation is the fact, and that a very large number of professing Christians and their friends have and care only for personal gain, or who take another standard than the New Testament and its teachings and our Christian institutions to be respected from the beginning of what is always a good standard.

This shows something of the purpose of National Reformers. Nothing short of a religious amendment to the Constitution will satisfy them.

To tax church property is to tax religion. So, says the *Catholic Review,* and adds its comment to its editorial opinions. Let us say, Then to real church property should be exempt from taxation because of its religious character? No. To insure church property is—what? To benefit property of a religious institution. Church property is to be respected, but is holding a fair right in church property to all the extent of religious use.

In the October *Arena* the Editor has a timely article on "The Blasphemy Law" in the State of Delaware, by Dr. D. D. Donelson a contributor well on the law; it is in the usual style of the *Arena*, very interesting. Dr. D. D. contributes a biography and a criticism of the same laws in the surrounding States.
