LAST week we made some comments upon the boast of the papists that they established liberty in Maryland. We showed that their action was simply political. But as a matter of fact, religious liberty does not exist to-day in Maryland; and yet the laws have been materially modified since the days of Cecil Calvert, second Lord Baltimore. As late as 1723, this law was enacted in that colony:—

AN ACT

TO PUNISH BLASPHEMERS, SWEARERS, DRUNKARDS, AND SABBATH BREAKERS, AND FOR PUNISHING AND PREVENTING OTHER IMMORAL AND PROFANE PRACTICES.

*Section 1.* Be it enacted by the right honorable the lord proprietary, by and with the advice and consent of his lordship's governor, and the upper and lower houses of assembly, and the authority of the same, That if any person shall hereafter, within this province, blaspheme or curse God, or deny our Saviour Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, or shall deny the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, or the Godhead of any of the three persons, or the unity of the Godhead, or shall utter any profane words concerning the Holy Trinity, or any of the persons thereof, and shall thereof be convict by verdict, confession, or otherwise, the offender for the first offence shall be bored through the tongue, and fined twenty pounds sterling to the lord proprietary: for the second offence, the offender shall be stigmatized by burning in the forehead with the letter B, and fined forty pounds sterling to the lord proprietary; and for the third offence, the offender shall suffer death without the benefit of the clergy.

*Sec. 2.* And be it enacted, That if any person shall hereafter profanely swear or curse, in the hearing of any magistrate, minister, constable or church warden, the offender shall be arrested, the offender to suffer at month's imprisonment, or pay ten shillings current money: and that all such profane oaths and curses, as aforesaid, shall be originated by hearing in the justices of the county courts, the magistrate, etc., the matter shall be adjudged by said court as herein before is aforesaid, and in case the same could not be certified upon oath, the offender shall suffer imprisonment without bail or mainprize; and that such person shall be put in the stocks for the space of one hour and a half.

*Sec. 3.* And be it enacted, that every person taken in a breach of the Sunday or holy day keeping, or on due complaint before any justice of the peace, having their conviction on the oath or affirmation of the witnesses, and on the testimony of competent persons, shall be convicted, that every offender shall forfeit the sum of not more than fifty shillings, and for the second offence not more than one hundred shillings, and for the third offence, prosecution, or conviction of the party, shall, for the first offence, forfeit not more than two hundred pounds of tobacco, and for each offence after the first, five shillings key money, to be

Sections 3 to 6 relate to drunkenness and the concealment of the law.

*Sec. 8.* And be it enacted, That no person or persons whatsoever within this province shall work or do any bodily labor or occupation on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, and that no person or persons having children, servants, or slaves, shall command, or wittingly or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's day (works of necessity and charity always excepted), nor shall suffer or permit any children, servants, or slaves, to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fishing, fowling, hunting, or unlawful pastimes or recreations; and that every person or persons so offending shall forfeit two hundred pounds of tobacco for each offence: any suit against the offender of the party before a single magistrate, shall forfeit and pay the sum of two hundred pounds of tobacco for each offence.

This law has of course been modified somewhat, but no longer ago than last year a Seventh-day Baptist was arrested, at Chestertown, Md., for doing some quiet work on his own premises after the close observance of practice of his Christian Sabbath of Lord's Day. And at present the same law of persecution is being carried on in the case of a Seventh-day Adventist, who is at work on his own place on Sunday in the county in Maryland. Even to-day, shall this state be in full force and fury, it can only apply to religious matters—the state simply employs religious legislation—
