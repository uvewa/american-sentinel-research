LAST week we made some comment upon the boast of the papists that they established religious liberty in Maryland. We showed that their action was simply in self-defense. But as a matter of fact religious liberty does not exist even to-day in Maryland, and yet the laws have been materially modified since the days of Cecil Calvert, second Lord Baltimore. Even as late as 1723, this law was enacted in that colony:

AN ACT,

TO PUNISH BLASPHEMERS, SWEARERS, DRUNKARDS, AND RABBATH BREAKERS, AND FOR REPEALING THE LAWS HERETOFORE MADE FOR THE PUNISHING RICH OFFENDERS.

Be it enacted by the right honorable the lord proprietor, by and with the advice and consent of his lord-hip's governor, and the upper and lower houses of assembly, and the authority of the same, That if any persons shall hereafter, within this province, wittingly, maliciously and advisedly, by writing or speaking, blaspheme or curse God, or deny our Saviour Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, or shall deny the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, or the Godhead of any of the three persons, or the unity of the Godhead, or shall utter any profane words concerning the Holy Trinity, or any of the persons thereof, and shall be thereof convict by verdict or confession, shall, for the first offense, be bored through the tongue and fined twenty pounds sterling to the lord proprietor to be applied to the use of the county where the offense shall be committed, to be levied on the offender's body, goods and chattels, lands or tenements, and in case the said fine cannot be levied, the offender to suffer six month's imprisonment without bail or mainprise; and that for the second offense, the offender being thereof convict as aforesaid, shall be stigmatized by burning in the forehead with the letter B and fined forty pounds sterling to the lord proprietor, to be applied and levied as aforesaid, and in case the same cannot be levied, the offender shall suffer twelve month's imprisonment without bail or mainprise; and that for the third offense, the offender being convict as aforesaid, shall suffer death without the benefit of the clergy.

SEC. 2. And be it enacted, that every person that shall hereafter profanely swear or curse in the presence and hearing of any magistrate, minister, the commissary general, secretary, sheriff, coroner, provincial or county clerk, vestryman, churchwarden, or constable, or be convicted thereof before any magistrate, by the oath of one lawful witness, or confession of the party, shall, for the first oath or curse, be fined two shilling and sixpence current money, and for every oath or curse after the first, five shillings like money, to be applied to the use aforesaid.

Sections 3 to 9 relate to drunkards and the enforcement of the law.

SEC. 10. And be it enacted, That no person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, and that no person having children, servants or slaves, shall command, or wittingly, or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's day (works of necessity and charity always excepted), nor shall suffer or permit any children, servants or slaves, to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fishing, fowling, hunting, or unlawful pastimes or recreations; and that every person transgressing this act, and being thereof convict by the oath of one sufficient witness, or confession of the party before a single magistrate, shall forfeit two hundred pounds of tobacco, to be levied and applied as aforesaid.

This law has of course been modified somewhat, but no longer ago than last summer, a Seventh-day Adventist was imprisoned, at Chestertown, Md., for no other offense than that of practical dissent from the papal dogma that Sunday is the Christian Sabbath or Lord's Day. And at the present time a systematic and persistent persecution is being carried on in that State against that people, by means of the Sunday law. Seven Sunday cases against Adventists are now pending in a single county in Maryland. Even to-day, that State has at best, not religious freedom, but simply religious toleration—the highest conception possible to papists.
