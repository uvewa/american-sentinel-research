IT is too early to forecast the influence of the Parliament of Religions. Indeed, there is no certainty that any immediate visible result will be apparent. But it is a good time to ask what the Parliament was,—what by its constitution it indicates it could be,—and therefore what it could only be, and achieve.

A fact of unspeakable presentation was the Word of Jehovah, and His work through his Son, it could not be. To speak of it thus in the very title as an assumed precalled that. A "parliament" presupposes the equality of its constituent parts. In an assembly organized and guided under such a presentation, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me," could not be preached.

Evidently, God, who commenced at the that no other gods should be acknowledged in his presence, could not be honored by a gathering which did acknowledge other gods, and the whole force and purpose of which has proved to be the recognition of the idea of God so that he may be identified with all gods, and they all be assimilated into one composite idea of divinity.

That Word of the living God in unconcealing its plain calls,—it admits of no mistaking,—there is in it no uncertain as to its requirement in thought and word and act. It requires the full and complete service of the one God, and him and no other. This is Christianity, and although the mere word, in a sectional sense, may be referred to the body of teachings of the Son of God, Christianity at his first advent upon earth, ye, in reality, Christianity upon earth is as old as the first teachings of the Creator to his creature in the garden of Eden. It was in this garden, indeed, Christ the active agent in creation and the manifester of heaven when in the image of the unseen,

and the Father, he made a Christian. That man has ever been anything else is because he has fallen from the high estate in which he was created.

THE Bible is not two books,—the epitome of two religions,—gathered within one binding. It is one book, and one Word, and one story, from beginning to end, of one God, and his invention of the Word and of man, and of his dealings with that world and his creatures through his Son, and of his gospel, the promise of salvation given when man fell. At that moment Christianity existed even scientifically as the term is understood now, and he who depended upon the Christ that was to be a propitiation for his sins was then a Christian as in the new world his for his salvation to the Christ that has come, and is to come a second time.

IT is not in New Testament alone which makes Christianity, the Old Testament is equally its exponent. The gospel of Christ, its message of salvation to a sinestricken world, is not found only in the New Testament. The presentation of that message to man in the purpose of a Holy Writ. From God alone, through the sacrifice of the Son, flows the possibility of acceptance and of the resumption of that life of which Adam was the progenitor. The story of this is continuous from Genesis to Revelation. The religion of the Old Testament is not Judaism, its contents alone Christianity. They are alike related, in relation to the religion of Christ, and that of the New Testament, Christianity. It is all the Word of one God, and of an equal, the expression of the religion of his Christ.

NOWHERE in all this divine exposition of the Christian religion is there to be found one word of compromise with any false religion, and if the Christian religion is the true religion all others must be false. Truth, wherever found, must necessarily be single, unique, complete. There can be, strictly, no such thing as a half truth. That is, a consistent one is half per mental makes to man for his consideration. The bane, alloy, however slight, debases the whole coin. That true religion can receive no foreign admixture, no element of foreignism in its component. The evil leaven of the service of mammon will leaven the whole life, for "Thou shalt have no other gods," will have been disobeyed.

The true effectual religion of Christ —must necessarily be free to all men, to every individual without exception, but as this must be as an evidence of its truth and sufficiency, just so surely also is its truth and sufficiency shown by its acknowledging no equal, no contesting competitor's right of coexistence. The moment such an admission should be made that moment an insufficiency for the accomplishment of its purpose would be admitted and the existence of a fissured in the heavenly harmonies confessed. The logic of religion requires that there should be one religion, and only one. The logic of the gospel of religion reacheth the conclusion, that, where there are many religions we can only use to learn,—all the others must be false.

THAT is the inescapable conclusion of this very parliament, else why the desire for unity? If it were otherwise there would be no possible ground felt for the establishment of a consensus of views and the fixing of a common basis of religion in a common basis of religious thought.

This admits of all it follows that everything has had no real place in this parliament, that, even within those admittedly necessary and natural limitations, has been inferred into it at all. If then it is, as it would be, a contradiction in terms to call this a parliament of true religion, and it has not been an expression of the one only God-given system of religious truth, —what then has it been? It is evident that it must have been a parliament of religions evil, of man made religions, substituting else it could not be nothing more, acknowledging religion's inability. Unless, that is to say, we accept as right that God may admit it to itself in conjunction with God's true gospel, or, and here is the point, God may be doing his own work not worthy of our notice at all.

WE have in this series of articles taken space for this preliminary statement because it seems to be the best approach to the main purpose we have in view, the presentation of the report of the Parliament in its more immediate phases.
