THE National Reformers are still demanding a religious amendment to the Federal Constitution. The last number of the Political Dissenter says:—

> The imperative need of a Christian amendment to our fundamental law has never been more clearly demonstrated than during the conflict as to the opening of the World's Fair on the Sabbath. In a broad sense, covering our people, their origin and history, and their social customs and institutions, we are a Christian Nation. And so our Supreme Court has said, in an obiter dictum, or in a statement made by the way, and not in a judicial decision on the point itself. The wide and strong expression of the Christian sentiment of the country on this particular question of opening the Fair on the Sabbath is one of the most overwhelming proofs that this is, in the above loose sense, a Christian Nation. But this Christian sentiment, strong as it is, can be defeated by a small number of men who care only for personal gain, or who take special pleasure in treating Christianity with contempt. Is Christian sentiment to be ignored and despised? and are Christian institutions to be trampled under foot? or shall they so express themselves as to command due respect?

This shows something of the purpose of the National Reformers. Nothing short of a revolution in our form of government will satisfy them.
