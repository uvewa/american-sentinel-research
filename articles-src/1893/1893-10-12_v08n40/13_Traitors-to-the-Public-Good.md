A RELIGIOUS paper denounces as "traitors to the public good," those who oppose Sunday, by which it means those who teach that Sunday is not the Sabbath and that the seventh day is the Sabbath. Of course "traitors to the public good" ought to be punished, or at least restrained. That is the logic of any religious institution intrenched in civil statutes.
