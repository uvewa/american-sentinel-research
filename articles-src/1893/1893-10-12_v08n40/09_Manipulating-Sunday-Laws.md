THE Episcopal Recorder for Aug. 10, 1893, says:—

In the meanages of the Chicago Fair really dealing about religion it could come or to be duly ended. What here is a noted instance of it are the Sunday closing situation, from the show on Sunday is expended with financial loss to the corporation. This is a fair illustration of the kind of maneuvering that has been going on in its past dealing with the whole question; that of the Sabbath it would make most men blush. That is it still open remains a fact which may well awaken the apprehension of many, as it already has the indignation of some.

Inadvertently, the Recorder here touches the truth which condemns all appeal to the civil law for the enforcement of Sunday. No god can come to any religious institution which relies on man's politics associated with civil law that it is made the football of politics, commercialism, and self-interest. Religion acknowledges only the interests, party ends, and personal ambition. It is the essence of the whole Sunday law agitation, that when once a religious institution is forbidden by the spirit and purpose in the law the dirty business relations are apt to play. However they may talk, all history and experience proves conclusively, that where the civil law touches religious things, manipulation, and worse, and much more attach. The politicians have shown this. Let the churches take the Sabbath question to left at the struggle alone, as between God and the conscience of the individual, or out of the Fair at the hands of the civil law to accomplish its purpose, that institution is held cheap and struck a blow at the hands of its friends.—*Evangelist.*
