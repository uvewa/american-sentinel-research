The Episcopal Recorder for Aug. 17, says:—

> Do the managers of the Chicago Fair really desire it closed on Sunday? Legal measures are generally so easily evaded, when there is a united desire to do so, that were we not assured that the opening of the show on Sunday is attended with financial loss, we should very positively question the sincerity of the Board. That body has shown itself so tricky in its past dealing with the whole question, that it has no reason to complain if its straightforwardness should now be called in question. More especially is this the case, as we know that some of its members still adhere to their desire to keep it open. That it is still open remains a fact which may yet deter some from visiting the Fair, though there is so large an increase in the attendance upon week days.

Inadvertently, the Recorder here touches the truth which condemns all appeal to the civil law in behalf of Sunday observance. No good can come to any religious question or institution when it becomes so associated with civil law that it is made the football of politics, commercial interests, party ends, and personal ambition. The interference of the civil law in such cases is forbidden by the spirit and purpose of Christianity. When Christians appeal to the law they destroy reliance on God. However they may talk, all history shows that religious conscience recedes, withers, and dies, under such appeal. The only permanent good which has come to the Sabbath question by all the struggle over the opening of the Fair is the failure of the civil law to accomplish its purpose. Sunday legislation has received its deathblow at the hands of its friends.
