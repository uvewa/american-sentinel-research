An incident of the Congress of Religions is thus related by the Chicago Inter-Ocean:—

> Four thousand people were packed into Columbus Hall yesterday afternoon when Dr. Barrows read an exposition of Shintoism by Reuchi Shibata, high priest of the Shinto religion of Japan. The distinguished stranger, clothed in light silken robes of the flowery kingdom, and wearing his high, priestly cap stood by his side. With each successive outburst of applause he made a light bow and then resumed his statue like attitude with his eyes fixed on the floor.
>
> When Dr. Barrows had finished reading the paper a remarkable scene occurred. A wave of applause for the high priest to be forth all over the house. The great audience stood up and cheered and waved their handkerchiefs. The distinguished men and women on the platform gathered round Mr. Shibata and shook his hand, while he bowed right and left. Women from the audience climbed over chairs and tables to pay their compliments to the distinguished Oriental. He was almost swept off his feet in a whirlwind of enthusiasm. Then a loud cheer sent the air and there was a mad rush for the platform. The surging mass was kept back only by the strong lungs of Secretary Piper who said the stage would break down.
>
> The excitement was caused by the high priest in a spirit of true reciprocity embracing a couple of the ladies. It was over in a moment but in that moment they had felt on their cheeks the kiss of the high priest of Shintoism. The little breach of etiquette was heartily forgiven. It was the application of the Eastern custom and those who witnessed it say that the ladies themselves were not displeased with the pleasant little incident. Mr. Shibata was the hero of the moment.

Comment is quite unnecessary. Every man who conducts himself with becoming dignity is entitled to a respectful hearing, and to courteous treatment wherever he may be, especially in a "Christian" land, but such a scene testifies more forcibly than any words could the utter lack on the part of the actors in it of any just appreciation of the real nature of Christianity and of the responsibility resting upon those who take it upon themselves to represent that religion before the world.

FORCE has never secured true followers of the church, and law never made morals. True reforms have come from a power in the reform itself that secured conviction in its justice and necessity, of which this Sunday closing movement seems entirely lacking. In the building of one good, care should be taken that others are not torn down.—Summerville News.
