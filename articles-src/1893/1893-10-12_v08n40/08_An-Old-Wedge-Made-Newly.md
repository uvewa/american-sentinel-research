THE drive on the part of the Catholic Church for a diversion, and a share of public money for the support of its parochial schools are many and varied in their character. Nor is the endeavor made without loss of time, varying each approach, and presenting the case to each audience with an air of plausible reasoning. Fairness, and even generosity to all, is the way for the destruction of the public school system, and the diversion of the funds among church schools. In all her political and ecclesiastical methods the Catholic Church, and her hierarchy and priesthood, presented to be raked as one. It is only in the matter of religious education and social improvement signal defeats that it is now apparently more advantageous to accept the help of Protestant propositions, which is a large thing to prove dishonest to the political parties the proper plan is in the nature of things. The Fairchild plan is one form in the new order of things.

In an address before the World's Congress on Education, by Martin Luther, which, of "Short Dr. Education," Martin Luther used the text from which the author enthusiastically says: "What a fair and well developed view of the famous education reformer and the parochial school question has been found! Do not the principles of the parochial school regulation of Protestants and Catholics alike."

"Why," he asks, "does not the public school appliance to the States for aid for the religious instruction of its children, and if the answer to the question is to be fully put, as that of the non-denominational character of every child who passes there must be a pro rata admittance of denomination or to the right of similar instruction in the public schools. It is required by the Dr. Walsh to provide a statement of a school."

The education for which the State is bound to provide is necessarily secular, and we are never going to repeat the thousand times rebutted argument in favor of religious instruction in the public schools. There is nothing new to say against the public schools. We do not say they are perfect, but there is nothing in the demand for parochial education that measures up to the public-school standard. We do not propose that the government at large shall pay for it.

But to this Dr. Walsh adds, with an

apparent simplicity which looks a good deal like guile, that "if the teachers in the schools assume their instruction is to certain extend with religion, the State is needed to pay for such extensions." [The argument here is: Let the State, through its school inspectors, watch the teaching, and see that no secular teaching is wanting to be pay. As a system of Jesuitical casuistry that statement could hardly be surpassed. Aside from this, the new plan was to pay about the proposed plan. From this we are given to understand that for each school passing the required examination conducted by the State, and supposing they were fully up to the standard, the introduction of religious teaching of instruction in the public schools would be unfair, because it would involve the payment of a good deal more than the instruction in the Catholic schools would. We heard a Roman Catholic city councillman protest "vigorously against the regular appropriation for the public schools" for only on the ground that it was too far too much for teachers' salaries. "Why," is it said, "we paid a very small salary per head of a teacher for Catholic education and no more." Our points are "brothers" and turns on the teaching as well, and having not been too far from the well, and not even a very high salary." As the "system" of public school education is almost exclusively done by the "religious" department, it is evident that the cost to the community for the religious education. "If the cost of the secular instruction," he finds it so matter of fact, in contrast with religion, "would be considerably less than that now expended for religion, where would the surplus go? To ask the question is to answer it." The surplus would be contributing indirectly to the teaching of religious doctrine, to say nothing of the direct support given through the sum total being allowed to it by measuring the secular with religious, that is, sectarian—instruction.

The time is really well come when the religious community would make careful. What safeguard would there be against frauds on the State? It requires no small faculty of common discernment and good inspectors to examine those parochial schools and test their work, which has not been muddy noticed in the past by seeking favors from the State, or in using its influence to force compliance within its domains. It would not be found a task beyond its power, we fear, to procure the appointment of one too leaky to do the inspecting. Not, if experience teaches true, would there be any difficulty in exhibiting false reports in the basis for a State salary. This might seem to be impossible, but the investigation of fraud in muddilas, New Mexico, there was (and we may believe still is,) a Government boarding school, ostensibly for Indian girls, and supplied, by the Bishop of Loresto, and recently supported out of the national treasury as a "contract school," the real thing being that compensation should be allowed only for Indian girls taught in the school. It became known at the Indian Office that certain girls enrolled as Indians were untruthworthy, and an Indian school supervisor sent to investigate that this was so, for he found that a considerable number of the pupils seemed to be Mexican. The sisters in charge of this school insisted that the girls were Indian, but careful investigation showed them, out of a total of seven enrolled as Indian, three were, form repeated Mexicans, but credited to various Indian tribes in order to cover up the deception. Now we do not mean to say that similar deception was be permitted in every part, but
