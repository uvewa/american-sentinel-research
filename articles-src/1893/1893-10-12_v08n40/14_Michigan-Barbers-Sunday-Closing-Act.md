THE Michigan Barber's Sunday-closing Act is under discussion in the courts of Detroit. Judge Gartner of the Recorder's Court has openly expressed his belief that the law is unconstitutional. The Boss Barber's Association is determined that however unconstitutional the law may be it shall be enforced, and consequently takes no Sunday naps, but keeps both eyes wide open to catch a fellow-workman honing his razor and serving a customer on Sunday. One case is already on trial, and a number of further arrests are expected.
