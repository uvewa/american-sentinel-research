Extra copies of this number of the SENTINEL can be had for $1 per hundred or $8 per thousand. The articles in this paper giving the history of the National Reform movement, and defining the powers of the majority and the "Christian's duty to obey civil government" are alone worth many times the price of the paper. You can get nothing better for genuine missionary work.
