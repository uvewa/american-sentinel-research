MANY preachers, religious journalists, and others, deny that there is religious persecution in Tennessee. "The law does not," say they, "interfere with the Adventists keeping Saturday; it only says that they *must keep Sunday.*" This they say to be nothing persecutive.

For Adventists to talk thus would be strange enough. But perhaps it is not so strange after all when we remember the fact that all peoples of all ages have, as a rule, been simply incapable of appreciating the wrongs of any belief beside their own, except when it favored their own religion or its interests.

No one will question that the early Christians who suffered martyrdom at the baseless superstars of Rome; yet tried by Judge Hammond of Tennessee, by those Tennessee apologists, there was no persecution about it, as they were not punished for practicing Christianity, but for refusing to observe heathen festivals.

The exact parallel between third century Rome and these modern persecutors on this point, is accurately stated in "History of the Christian Religion," by Edward Gibbon, Tutor, of Oxford University, thus:—

"Christianity was not considered an obstacle to Christianity. They thought that it was easy to enjoy the religion you preferred without disturbing that established by law. . . . They did not understand a religion whose followers refused to worship other gods as their own. . . . they would not object to the Christians having their own convictions, but the statute of Rome must be followed. Christians having their own sanctions. The Christians could not do so. The Pagans could not understand why; . . . the law was looked upon as the good one; for they looked upon the Christians not as religious, but civil offenders. Thus Trajan, Decius and Valerian were all persecutors, though they might all be justly entitled to the name of good Emperors."

Then, according to the rule which repeatedly applied to Tennessee Adventists, the early Christian martyrs died for similar reasons.

These so-called National Reformers call themselves "successors to the Prophets." Yes, but which prophets? Those were prophets of Baal we call others.
