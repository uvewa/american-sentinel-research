TO-DAY THE AMERICAN SENTINEL enters upon the eighth year of its publication. Each year of the seven, now in the past, has been one of success and of the greatest encouragement; but the year that is just past has been more so than perhaps all the others put together. And the years to come we expect to be no less full of real encouragement than those that are just gone; indeed it promises to be even more eventful.

The SENTINEL was established to expose the evil designs and mischievous workings of the National Reform movement, and to warn against the dangers to Government and people, to State and Church, which lay wrapped up therein. True, from the first the people would not believe what we said in this respect; but we never could for that; what we are here for is to set forth what we know to be the truth in this subject. Whether men will believe it or not is their affair.

We have declared from the beginning that the combined churches would take possession of the Government to use it for their own purposes; and that the chief purpose for which they would use the Government would be to compel the observance of Sunday, at the dictation of the arbitrary will of the Church, in making the living image of the Papacy. We are now already upon the field of the SENTINEL's notice and see where we must stand to-day, bearing in mind at the same time the fact that the people who publish the SENTINEL have known, and have published, more than forty years that which has come would come.

It would seem that all people in the United States would be glad of the opportunity to require everyone to submit to the supreme law the Nation is pledged to religious freedom. It would seem that everybody ought to be glad of the opportunity to herald to all the world the fame of a nation under whose protection all people might dwell wholly unmolested in the full enjoyment of religious rights, and the liberty to worship or not to worship according to the dictates of their own conscience.

SUCH, however, is not the case. As religious bigotry is known to mob such things as enlightenment or progress; as ecclesiastical ambition never can be content without the power to persecute; so, from the beginning, complaint has been made against the character of the United States Constitution as it respects religion, and constant effort has been made to weaken its features, undermine its authority, and subvert its precepts.

From the very beginning, this feature of the Constitution has been discussed as foolish, atheistical, the strictly national sin, the cause of epidemics, etc., particularly by ministers of such religion as had not sufficient power of truth to support itself, and doctors of divinity so weak and sickly that it could not protect itself, much less protect and bless its worshipers, or anybody else.

OCTOBER 27, 1789, "The First Presbytery Eastward in Massachusetts and New Hampshire," sent to President Washington an address in which they complained because what was so "eagerly desired, acknowledgment of the only true God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent, [was] inserted somewhere in the Magna Charta of our country." In 1800, Samuel B. Wylie, D. D., of the University of Pennsylvania, preached a sermon in which he inquired "what the framers of our National Constitution" "had in view" and declared that all the precepts of Christianity "had the force of God and the authority of his law," and "these remained to be enacted."

WE MAY READ THE UNITED STATES, [among the being and attributes of Almighty God, the divine authority of the holy Scriptures, the Messiah, the Saviour and Lord of all;] in order to constitute a Christian Government; provide for the government upon Christian principles, and to secure to all domestic tranquillity; provide for the common defence, and secure the blessings of civil and religious liberty; do ordain, to obtain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

The convention approved the spirit and design of the paper, and ordered its publication. The following July, "a few delegates met in Dubuque, belonging to these same religious orders, and more came to address the convention, and formed a plan for the calling of a national convention, which met in Allegheny, January 27, 1864. It is reported that at 'an earnest, animated, and most encouraging meeting' it 'adopted a series of resolutions,' including:—

A MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS,

which latter is worth quoting, as showing the rapid growth of their designs upon the national Constitution. *It runs as follows:*—

To the Honorable, the Senate of *House of Representatives,* in Congress assembled:

We, citizens of the United States, respectfully ask your honorable bodies, in amending the Constitution of the United States, so to amend it as to read, in substance, as follows:—

"We, the people of the United States, [acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all authority and power in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler among the nations, and his revealed will as the supreme law of the land, in order to constitute a Christian Government,] and in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the inalienable rights and the blessings of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to ourselves, our posterity, and all the people, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."

'And further; that such changes with respect to said Constitution may be introduced into the body of said Constitution as may be found necessary, both in the body and amendments, as, in the judgment of your honorable bodies, may be necessary to give effect to these amendments in the preamble.'

A PERMANENT ORGANIZATION was effected in November, 1864, in a national convention held in Allegheny, and was at first called "The National Association to Secure the Religious Amendment of the Constitution of the United States," with John Alexander, of Beaver Falls, Pa., as president, and T. P. Stevenson, a Scotch Covenanter, of 23 Park Row, Chambers Street, a Quaker, as vice-president. The name of the association was afterwards shortened to what it has been ever since—the National Reform Association. And such is the origin, organization, and aim of this regular war upon the Constitution and principles of our Government. From this design and these outlines throughout the land has been open to the dissemination of the nefarious doctrines of the association; which have thus really permeated society. The association worked alone, though steadily gaining influence and power, until 1885, when it secured the alliance of the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Through this alliance it readily secured two further alliances, in 1887, of the National Prohibition Party. In 1888, it secured the alliance of the American Sabbath Union, and at the same time also secured that which it had been earnestly working for ever since its organization—the Catholic Church.

HAVING thus the weight and influence of almost all the religious and religio-political elements of the country, the association, in 1888,

MADE ITS DIRECT ATTACK UPON THE CONSTITUTION.

Through Senator Harry W. Blair, it was then introduced in Congress—to secure legislation for the legal recognition of Christianity as the national religion. Besides the regular Sunday Rest bill, there was also introduced by Senator Blair a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States, to recognize Sunday as the Sabbath and the Lord's day. While this Senator Blair remained in Congress, these propositions were differently, and even dishonestly, urged upon the Government. Other bills to the same purpose as the Blair Sunday bill were also urged upon Congress in the same way.

When Senator Blair was at last defeated, his personal amendment went with him, but the National Reform combination was not weakened. It became rather the more determined to secure their purpose of "Sunday-observance by national legislation," and to have it declared "national, as the Constitution stands."

AND THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED.

They secured such an annunciation in the legislative affairs at the beginning of 1892. And before the year was two months old,

THEY HAD IT ALL.

Not only altogether in just the way they asked for. "They had asked only to be made a 'Christian Nation.'" February 29, 1892, the Supreme Court of the United States officially and triumphantly gave them "this is a Christian Nation," and justified all the evil accompaniments that that establishment carries. "From the discovery of this continent to the present hour, there is a single voice making this affirmation." "These and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian Nation," "the inspiration of the divinity of Christ," the inspiration "from the laws of God, as written, and the reference" in a single representative National Reformer, in the *Christian Statesman,* November, 1892, there as said is but one voice making the same thing still.

THUS, by their own arguments for nearly thirty years, we know the change involved in this Sunday closing decision: we know that Sunday legislation by Congress is unconstitutional. Yet, in conjunction with their own combined arguments, they alone who take the lead in petitioning and threatening Congress for Sunday legislation. Of their own number, who has stood for years the unconstitutionality of such legislation, joint the whole of the first session of the Fifty-second Congress at the Capitol as a "Christian lobby" to "push this very unconstitutional legislation." And now, having secured this legislation which they know to be unconstitutional, having thus knowingly violated the supreme law, having thus subverted the Constitution, these very men take the lead in getting up and managing mass-meetings to endorse their unconstitutional action, to prevent Congress from tending to its unconstitutional work, and now themselves the law-abiding people of the Nation!!

BUT instead of being "the law-abiding people of the land," they are the arch law-breakers of the land. Their action is as much worse than that of the average law-breaker, as the average of the land is greater and more important than the local statutes. The average law-breaker damages the individual; these supreme law-breakers damage the whole rights of the individual; these supreme law-breakers have invaded, and even swept away, the rights of all the people. The average law-breaker disturbs social order only in the locality where he is; while these supreme law-breakers strike at the very statement of social order, by breaking down the chief governmental safeguard of a nation.

THESE facts should be favorably set before the committee having in charge the "resolutions to repeal the religious legislation pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition," and Congress should be asked to undo as far as possible, the evil that has been done in yielding to the demand of these subverters of constitutional, republican, government.

BUT it may be urged that these men represent a majority of the people of the Nation, and the majority should rule even if to do so they are compelled to subvert the Constitution, that constitutions must simply the will of the majority, and that whatever the people say or have said, be it well, they should be changed or overridden. "The possibility is, and is increasingly, feasible." In the first place, the National Reformers do not represent a majority of the people of this Nation. But even if they did, that does not justify them in subverting national legislation. In this country the Constitution is overridden by the majority, but for the very purpose of protecting the minority in the natural rights which the majority is bound to respect, and which constitutions are largely for the purpose of defining and guarding.

Related to this subject is the article on another page, on "Limitations to Majority Rule." The saying that "the majority should rule" is true only of those majorities which come properly within the sphere of civil government. But religion does not come within that sphere, and constitutions are made, not by governmental guarantee, merely, but by the law of the land which makes the Constitution of the United States supreme. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." All of this, Richard M. Johnson, said in his great report to the United States Senate, Sunday, January 19, 1829:

"They are not *by any voluntary act* of the parties *surrendered* but retained by the individual, and the Government, by going beyond its legitimate authority, acquires no new right, and loses those which its excessive encroachments naturally forfeit." "That the measure proposed is a law of religious observance we have no doubt, and we are equally confident in the belief that it would be at the expense of the rights of others."

THIS Mist of National Reform for the advocates that the latest action of the House shows a majority of only the smaller Republic. It is not stated which of the two joint resolutions upon this subject was made on the caveats.
