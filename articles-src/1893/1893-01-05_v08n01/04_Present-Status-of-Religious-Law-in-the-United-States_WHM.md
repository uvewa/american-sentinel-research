THIS weight of authority is in a number of different States has given its sanction to the constitutionality of Sunday laws—their constitutionality as mere civil or police regulations. But judicial decisions in cases prosecuting Sunday labor are not in the least uniform or consistent in reasoning. States Judge Hammond, of the United States Court, in his decision given in and of his decision in the appended case of M. E. King, who was convicted in the Tennessee courts for Sunday work on his farm, virtually upheld this erroneous theory. It was understood at the time his decision was rendered also that Judge Hammond had been in consultation upon the matter with the Supreme Bench. And that his decision was in harmony with the views of at least a portion—the intellectual ship of that highest judicial authority.

This was also shown to have been so by the Supreme Court, in the case of the rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the City; *vs.* the United States, delivered, on a point which had no relation whatever to no intent. The opinion of Justice Brewer in this decision was conceded in broad and general terms that it may be quoted as authority for the upholding of any measures whatever which may be held to be for the promotion and maintenance of the Christian religion. Thus the advance of religious legislation and the enforcement of religious law now claim boldly, without fear of being successfully contradicted, that government of the United States and the United States are powers—a power behind the Constitution, controlling it. That Congress has recognized this has been shown, by its passage of the provision to close the World's Fair on Sunday. Nothing can undo this which has been done except the unconstitutional repeal by Congress of the Sunday closing provision, embodied in the express statement that it is a matter entirely outside the sphere of civil legislation, and the repudiation, by the Supreme Bench of the religious garb in which it has given the weight of the acquiescence to the opinion of Justice Brewer.

If Sunday laws infringe upon property rights, or upon religious rights, or give a preference to one religion over another, they are unconstitutional. It is unconstitutionally followed, therefore, that to hold them constitutional it must be decided that they do not deprive of property rights, or infringe religious liberty, or impair religious preference. These decisions have been at first. That Sunday law is not infringe religious liberty and give preference to certain forms of religion above another, it would require some argument. This has been argued, and the validity of the argument sustained by the courts in every case where the question has been brought to an issue. It is true the constitutional question itself, but that has made no difference with the holdings of the courts, and does not detract in the least from the authoritative value of precedent in these cases.
