THE rejoicing of the American Sabbath Union, so-called, and in the allow over their great Sunday victory in securing the passage of the Sunday closing provision in the World's Fair, is now more in its authority waged a persistent and relentless warfare against the Constitution—the fundamental law of the land. They should now be stripped from the past joint resolutions introduced by Mr. Durborow, purposes of which are printed on page 7 of this paper.

A RULING upon resolutions has been arranged for January 10, 11, 17, and 18—four days—this time to be equally divided between friends of the Constitution as it is, and those who would subvert it by Sunday closing of the Exposition. Thus the three measures not only continue upon the whole question of Sunday closing of the great Fair, but the joint resolutions introduced by Mr. Durborow on the 12th ulti., bring prominently before the American people the direct and large general question of the right of Congress to legislate upon religion *versus* the Constitution.

This resolution, which is referred, in its preamble, that provides of the Constitution which provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," should have the hearty support of every patriotic citizen of the Republic. The leaders and managers of the Sunday law cause in general, and of the Sunday closing element in particular, have arrayed themselves to the times. "The best people of the land" the "law-abiding people of the country" but the truth is, as shown in the history of the National Reform movement given in the first article in this number of the SENTINEL, that for years they have in authority waged a persistent and relentless warfare against the Constitution—the fundamental law of the land. They should now be stripped of their garmented dispensing, with which they have clothed themselves, and be made to stand forth in all their hideous deformity, as subverters of the Constitution, and the enemies of both civil and religious liberty.

THE supreme law of the Government of the United States—the Constitution,—positively prohibits any legislation on the subject of religion. Yet, in spite of this, in utter disregard of the supreme law of the land, these men by threats of interference, threats of the loss of votes, the only choice at their command—obliged Congress to legislate upon a religious subject, to declare a religious question, and to take their side in a great religious controversy. And in this they have plainly overridden the Constitution, and violated the supreme law of the land. And they know it.

THE National Reform Association, the ringleader in this whole religious combination for political purposes, has been working for nearly thirty years for national Sunday legislation. But knowing that Sunday is religious, and religious only, its managers argued from the first that such legislation would be unconstitutional, as the Constitution stands; and, therefore, for nearly thirty years the whole of this have advocated and demanded an amendment to the Constitution which would declare this to be "a Christian Nation," and so create a basis for national legislation recognizing Sunday as "the Christian Sabbath." And they are demanding the same thing still.

THUS, by their own arguments for nearly thirty years, we know the change involved in this Sunday closing decision: we know that Sunday legislation by Congress is unconstitutional. Yet, in conjunction with their own combined arguments, they alone who take the lead in petitioning and threatening Congress for Sunday legislation. Of their own number, who has stood for years the unconstitutionality of such legislation, joint the whole of the first session of the Fifty-second Congress at the Capitol as a "Christian lobby" to "push this very unconstitutional legislation." And now, having secured this legislation which they know to be unconstitutional, having thus knowingly violated the supreme law, having thus subverted the Constitution, these very men take the lead in getting up and managing mass-meetings to endorse their unconstitutional action, to prevent Congress from tending to its unconstitutional work, and now themselves the law-abiding people of the Nation!!

BUT instead of being "the law-abiding people of the land," they are the arch law-breakers of the land. Their action is as much worse than that of the average law-breaker, as the average of the land is greater and more important than the local statutes. The average law-breaker damages the individual; these supreme law-breakers damage the whole rights of the individual; these supreme law-breakers have invaded, and even swept away, the rights of all the people. The average law-breaker disturbs social order only in the locality where he is; while these supreme law-breakers strike at the very statement of social order, by breaking down the chief governmental safeguard of a nation.

THESE facts should be favorably set before the committee having in charge the "resolutions to repeal the religious legislation pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition," and Congress should be asked to undo as far as possible, the evil that has been done in yielding to the demand of these subverters of constitutional, republican, government.

BUT it may be urged that these men represent a majority of the people of the Nation, and the majority should rule even if to do so they are compelled to subvert the Constitution, that constitutions must simply the will of the majority, and that whatever the people say or have said, be it well, they should be changed or overridden. "The possibility is, and is increasingly, feasible." In the first place, the National Reformers do not represent a majority of the people of this Nation. But even if they did, that does not justify them in subverting national legislation. In this country the Constitution is overridden by the majority, but for the very purpose of protecting the minority in the natural rights which the majority is bound to respect, and which constitutions are largely for the purpose of defining and guarding.

Related to this subject is the article on another page, on "Limitations to Majority Rule." The saying that "the majority should rule" is true only of those majorities which come properly within the sphere of civil government. But religion does not come within that sphere, and constitutions are made, not by governmental guarantee, merely, but by the law of the land which makes the Constitution of the United States supreme. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." All of this, Richard M. Johnson, said in his great report to the United States Senate, Sunday, January 19, 1829. "They are not *by any voluntary* act of surrendered but retained by the individual, and these supreme law-breakers who believe constitutions and trample upon them; and never was there anything more pure or many more thousands that vote on the and what their profession may be.

THIS Mist of National Reform and for the advocates that the latest action of the House shows a majority of only the smaller Republic. It is not stated which of the two joint resolutions upon this subject was made on the text of the caveats.
