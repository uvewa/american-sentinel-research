MR. DURBOROW introduced the following joint resolution:

JOINT RESOLUTION

To repeal the religious legislation pertaining to the World's

Columbian Exposition:

Whereas the United States Constitution specifically states that "Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof": Therefore, to it

Reached by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Act of Congress approved August fifth, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, appropriating five millions of Columbian half dollars to provide for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus by holding an international exposition of arts, industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mine, and sea in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois, on the condition that the said exposition shall not be opened to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and also that section four of "an act to aid in carrying out the act of Congress approved April twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and ninety, entitled 'An act to provide for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, by holding an international exposition of the arts, industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mine, and sea, in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois,'" be, and the same is hereby, amended so as to leave the matter of Sunday observance entirely within the power of the regularly constituted authorities of the World's Columbian Exposition.
