THE SUPREME COURT DECISION

THE OTHER ORGANIC FOR TEACHING THAT THIS IS A "CHRISTIAN NATION."

MANY know that Christianity is a religion. But Christianity is more than a mere religion. Christianity is a system of moral and spiritual truths, as held by the Christian church. Now what is it that distinguishes government from all other organizations in society? It is that the organization of government is a political organization. Government, Christian laws, Christian institutions are the legitimate subjects of Christian politics. Christ did not lay his guiding hand upon anything that would interfere with the political tribunal of our government. It is the tribunal of the moral law—the voice and will of that sovereign tribunal. And that utterance is as clearly divine as any word he ever spoke. And nothing can be Christian that does not belong to the Master; nothing is Christian that is not of the Master's but to be in its master or in Christ's servants. Then it ought go, must, and cannot, love, and obey Christ; all that follows from the acceptance must follow. And if then of Christian politics works for Christ, and seeks the extension of his kingdom, then to his own great departments of Government, it must be the true department of Christian politics works for Christ, let it not seek on those great departments of the common ground,—but on His own field—even Christianity. Then should we be quite right.

Even a Thanksgiving day before, that called us to bless our God for such mercies.

"O sing unto the Lord a new song for he hath done marvellous things. Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth; make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise; sing unto the Lord with the harp, with the harp, and the voice of a psalm."

But that this movement was an effort to change that feature of our fundamental law which declares that "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the people," and, naturally, which this divine will be the authority in government with the approval and sanction of man until this Sunday legislation by Congress the National Reform combination secures, namely "recognition of Christianity," etc.

*Resolved,* that we do hereby pledge ourselves and do recommend all members of the order to refuse to vote for, or support for any office or place of trust, any member of Congress who voted for and the World's Fair, except on condition that the gates shall be closed on Sunday.

To those Senators and Congress who held faithful to the dictation and demanded that the World's Fair be opened on Sunday, it is an inalienable truth, and no power on earth can make it anything else. It did it not do so because of the abstract and direct command of any civil law; not a church,—not a church,—any church to church—, or anything, . . . but what Israel or should or should not be, passed; would be to deprive the gates of the authority they have in their retained in their own hands, and to make the claim the governing power belonged to all the people of the land, and not a part of the people. "This is precisely what the combined church of the United States of Rome, as manipulated by the National Reformers, did, under pretence of submission, and after they had all along been devoted to the dictation. It follows, therefore, from the National Reformers, therefore we have thus deprived the people of all the authority which . . . the authority retained in their own hands, and have made themselves the governing power instead of the people. Their effort has been accomplished by a steady overriding of that feature of our fundamental law, which declares that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed."

They have declared themselves to be all the authority in government, with the approval and sanction of man, their will, and the governmental power as the authority of God. For these men have not long demanded that "the Government of this country must recognize God's law and recognize God's authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it." Is the matter of

on Sunday, in Congressional Record, Reformers and Congress made the following:

MR. QUAY.—On page 177, line 23, after the word

"And that provision has been violated by the action of the Congress this Exposition on the ground."

The reasons for the amendment I will send to the clerk's desk and ask to have read.
