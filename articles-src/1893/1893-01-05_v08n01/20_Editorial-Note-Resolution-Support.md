THIS resolution, which recites in its preamble, that provision of the Constitution which provides that "Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," should have the hearty support of every patriotic citizen of this Republic. The leaders and managers of the Sunday law cause in general, and of this Sunday closing crusade in particular, have arrogated to themselves the titles, "The best people of the land," and "The law abiding people of the country;" but the truth is, as shown in the history of the so-called National Reform movement given in the first article in this number of the SENTINEL, that for years they have waged a persistent and relentless warfare against the Constitution—the fundamental law of the land. They should now be stripped of the garments of hypocrisy with which they have clothed themselves, and be made to stand forth in all their hideous deformity, as subverters of the Constitution, and the enemies of both civil and religious liberty.
