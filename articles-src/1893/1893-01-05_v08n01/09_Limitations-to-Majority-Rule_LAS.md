It is a commonly heard expression that in this country the majority must rule. While this is true in some things, the principle is not one that has a universal application. There is danger that it may be extended altogether too far. At the present time there seems to be an urgent need of a better understanding by the public upon the subject of the boundaries of the domain of popular government; for there are indications of an ignorance upon this point which can not fail to be attended with grave wrongs to individuals and evils to the State.

It ought not to be disputed by anyone that there are limitations to the principle of majority rule. The majority can not prescribe rules for the minority in everything, no matter how small that minority may be. If it can, there is no such thing as individual rights, for that which is subject to the will of a majority is not a right. A right is something which, in its very nature, is inherent in the one possessing it, independent of the will of all other persons. Otherwise it would become but a mere privilege, such as a superior might grant to an inferior, and take away again at his pleasure; and the saying would be true that "might makes right." But it is one of the fundamental principles upon which our Government stands, that "all men are created equal." It is not the prerogative of any one to be lord over any other, to prescribe rules by which he must live. They are equal in that all have an equal right to think and act as suits their inclinations; and this right is also limited, for the very fact that all are equal forbids each to do anything which would encroach upon the rights of his neighbor. For that which would interfere with the rights of others is not a right. Rights can not conflict. Rights run in parallel lines, never crossing, never clashing.

All individuals have rights. The Declaration of Independence declares that "all men are created equal," "and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness;" and the same great truths are embodied in the fundamental principles of English and American law. (See Cooley's Edition of Blackstone's Commentaries, book 1, and introduction.)

"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," are general terms, but it is not left for governments arbitrarily to define the limits to which these rights extend. There is a natural limit already fixed for each and every individual, and that limit, as has been said, is the line which bounds the rights of his neighbor. The rights of one must not be made to conflict with those of another. It may be generally stated by saying that every man has a right to do whatever he will, provided that in so doing he does not interfere with the like right of any and every other person.

These rights are a necessary consequence of the fact that all men are created equal. This fact gives to each one equal authority and leaves no one with any natural authority over and above another. The impression prevails quite generally that a collection of individuals—a community or a State—possesses authority of a higher kind than that which would be possessed by the individuals separately. But let us ask, where did the community or State get such authority? Where can it get any more authority than is granted it by the individuals composing it? and how can they grant it authority which they do not themselves possess? A can say to B, or to C, or to D, You must not do anything to interfere with my rights,—my life, my liberty, my property, etc.; and B or C or D can say the same to him and to all others; but A has no right to say what B or C or D shall do outside of that which concerns his own rights, nor has B or C or any other, such a right; and having no such right individually, they do not have it collectively, no matter how many of them there may be. No one of them got his rights and liberties from the others, but from his Creator, who, as the Declaration of Independence says, endowed him with them; and, therefore, only his Creator can rightfully take them away. Otherwise than this, he can be deprived of them only by forfeiture for misconduct.

The purpose of governments, as the Declaration of Independence asserts, is to protect these rights,—the rights of the individual. Governments are not instituted merely to run themselves, to become rich and great and powerful at the expense of the individuals composing them, and to perpetuate themselves regardless of the wishes of the governed; but to protect each individual in the enjoyment of his rights. The individual could not well protect himself against all others, so each delegates his right in this respect to certain ones chosen to make laws and preserve peace and order, and who are backed up by the power of the people who choose them. This is what constitutes government in its republican form,—the delegation of the power and authority of the people, the individuals, to their representatives. And this is done, directly or indirectly, by means of an election, in which each individual has an equal voice. The people do the governing, and those chosen to office are but the servants of the people, to carry out their will, and not in any sense rulers over them.

Governments should, therefore, exercise themselves in doing what they are instituted to do; viz., protect the people in the enjoyment of their rights; and outside of this they have no authority whatever; and governments, in their popular form, are but the expression of the will of the majority. The majority can and must rule in the sphere which governments are instituted to fill, in prescribing the manner in which the purpose of government,—the protection and preservation of individual rights—shall be carried out, whether that government be municipal, State, or national. Beyond this the majority have no right, and should have no reason to go. And let it be remembered that while popular governments represent the will of the majority, they are instituted to protect the rights of the minority,—the individual. The moment, therefore, that the government undertakes to regulate an individual's conduct in matters which do not concern the rights of others, it begins to do just the opposite of that which it was instituted to do, since it begins to invade, not protect, the rights of that one.

When, therefore, we hear it said that Mr. A or Mr. B must stop doing as he does, because in this country the majority must rule, it is proper to stop and enquire whether his conduct pertains to that upon which the majority have the right to speak. If his conduct is an infringement upon the rights of his neighbors, if it is an infringement of the will of the majority in that which concerns the equal rights of all citizens, it must be regulated by their will. But if not, the individual is within the sphere of his own rights and liberties, so far at least as his fellow men are concerned, and no one has the right to molest him, however foolish or unwise his conduct may appear to others. He is outside the lines which mark the limitations of majority rule.

L. A. SMITH.
