The weight of authority in a number of different States has given its sanction to the constitutionality of Sunday laws—more than that, it has been held that laws prohibiting Sunday labor are not in violation of the Constitution of the United States. Judge Hammond, of the United States Court, in his dictum given as a part of the decision in the appealed case of H. M. King, who was convicted in the Tennessee courts for Sunday work on his farm, virtually upheld this erroneous theory. It was understood at the time this decision was rendered that Judge Hammond had been in consultation upon the matter with the Supreme Bench, and that his decision was in harmony with the views of at least a portion of the membership of that highest judicial authority. This was shown to have been so by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of the rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity, of New York City, vs. the United States, delivered by Justice Brewer, and from which there was no dissent. The opinion of Justice Brewer in this decision was couched in such broad and general terms that it may be quoted as authority for the upholding of any measure whatever which may be held to be for the promotion and maintenance of the Christian religion. Thus the advocates of religious legislation and the enforcement of religious laws now claim boldly, without fear of being successfully contradicted, that the Constitutions of the States and of the United States are powerless to prevent the progress of their purposes. That Congress has recognized this has been shown by its passage of the proviso to close the World's Fair on Sunday. Nothing can undo this which has been done except the unconditional repeal by Congress of the Sunday closing proviso, embodied in the express statement that it is a matter entirely outside the sphere of civil legislation, and the repudiation by the Supreme Bench of the religious dictum to which it has given the weight of its acquiescence in the opinion of Justice Brewer.

If Sunday laws infringe upon property rights, or upon religious liberty, or give preference to one religion over another, they are unconstitutional. It necessarily followed, therefore, that to hold them constitutional it must be decided that they do not deprive of property rights, or infringe religious liberty, or impair values. These decisions have been had. That Sunday laws do not infringe religious liberty and give preference to one form of religion above another, it would seem impossible to argue, but it has been argued, and the validity of the argument judicially accepted in the majority of cases where the question has been brought to an issue. It is true the argument refutes itself, but that has made no difference with the holdings of the courts, and does not detract in the least from the authoritative value of precedents in these cases.

For instance, it was said in the famous case of Lindenmuller vs. the People, which has long been quoted as a precedent, that—

it would be strange that a people, Christian in doctrine and worship, many of whom or whose forefathers had sought these shores for the privilege of worshiping God in simplicity and purity of faith, and who regarded religion as the basis of their civil liberty and the foundation of their rights, should in their zeal to secure to all the freedom of conscience which they valued so highly, solemnly repudiate and put beyond the pale of the law the religion which was dear to them as life, and dethrone the God who they openly and avowedly professed to believe had been their protector and guide as a people. . . . Different denominations of Christians are recognized, but this does not detract from the force of the recognition of God as the proper object of religious worship, and the Christian religion as the religion of the people, which it was not intended to destroy but to maintain. . . . The framers of it [the Constitution] did not suppose they had abolished the Sabbath as a day of rest for all, and of Christian worship for those who were disposed to engage in it, or had deprived themselves of the power to protect their God from blasphemy and reciting.

It would scarcely have been possible to put in words a better argument than this Judge unwittingly made for his opponent, but it is not on record that the opponent has yet appeared. On the contrary this reductio ad absurdum has been referred to as good precedent and of binding authority time and again.

In several States, and in the District of Columbia, blasphemy and profanity are punishable, and in those States where the question has been brought to an issue the courts have taken the position that such statutes and the common law doctrine of blasphemy are neither of them repugnant to the constitutions of the States.

It has been generally held that in those States where there are statutes against Sunday labor they would apply to the invalidation of contracts made on Sunday, though not without frequent dissent far more vigorous and able in character than the prevailing opinion.

The late decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, excluding the Bible from use in the public schools, is correctly declared by those who desire its compulsory reading to be made part of the school exercises, to be contrary to the judicial decisions in several other States where the matter has been brought up for adjudication.

In many of the States, incompetency to testify as witness in court for lack of religious belief has been done away with, but this can not be implicitly relied upon, as, for example, the code of Tennessee reads, "Every person of sufficient capacity to understand the obligation of an oath is competent to be a witness," yet every adjudicated case on this point in the Tennessee reports, after the adoption of this code as well as before, holds that a witness who disbelieves in God and in a future state of rewards and punishments is incompetent to testify.

In those States where office holding is subject to a religious test no protest is heard.

It is a most interesting fact that all of these religious laws are upheld, in the great majority of instances, avowedly because they are religious, and for the purpose of maintaining and enforcing religious precepts.

The present status of religious law in the United States is that of almost universal judicial acceptance. W. H. M.
