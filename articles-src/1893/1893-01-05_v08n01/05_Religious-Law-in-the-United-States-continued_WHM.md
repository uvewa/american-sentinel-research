liament representing in legislation the sentiment of the British nation, as precedents, and as a testimony in favor of a legislative regulation of the Sabbath."

In reference to Sunday amusements the New York court again said: "The legislature had the right to assume that the law was reasonably well settled, and sufficiently declared by competent judicial and legislative authority, that such representations on the first day of the week were a breach of the public peace and good order. The legislature was therefore right in conceiving that the title which expressed the purpose of legislating to preserve that peace and good order gave notice that such representations might be affected by it. It is not to be forgotten that the title does not point to legislation on the subject of the public peace and good order in general, that is on any and every day, but only on the first day of the week. So that the title is fitted to call particular attention to whatever is likely to disturb that peace and order on that day." The act to which the court referred was entitled, "To preserve the public peace and order on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

In Tennessee, the court has held that the right of the State to prescribe penalties for the violation of Sunday is "too well settled to admit of question or require discussion."

The Pennsylvania court declared: "We do not feel called upon to give any opinion as to the policy, the propriety, or the justice of the law itself; that stands settled by authority, so far as authority can settle it, and that authority is not to be overlooked by individual sentiments, or by private opinion, whatever that may be."

Both the Ohio and the Missouri courts, and those of Tennessee as well, have decided that the legislatures of those States have authority from the Constitutions of their States to pass laws prohibiting labor and amusement on Sunday, and compelling its observance as a day of rest.

In several States, where the question has been before the courts, New York, Virginia, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Missouri, etc., it has been held that the Sunday laws of the States were not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States.

All other religious laws, such as pertain to "Offences against God and Religion," and such as continue the precedent set in the cabin of the Mayflower, and are for the furtherance of religion by law, "for the glory of God and the maintenance of the Christian faith," are in a similar state of advancement proportionately to the amount of attention which has been turned upon them.

This great body of religious law now stands in the statute books and law reports of the different States. In some instances certain phases of religious law have found their way directly into State constitutions, where they stand as a strange anomaly in immediate contradiction of constitutional bills of rights. The great mass, however, of this branch of the law comes through judicial decrees, which owe their existence in the first place to a slavish adherence to foreign precedents which have been followed and multiplied until they have finally subverted constitutional principle. The lawyers and judges in this country, and the legislators as well, both State and national, who refer to constitutional principles rather than to precedent, to guide their legal and legislative action, are few. To this fact, more than to any other, this great body of religious law owes its existence; and through this fatal intellectual weakness and lack of moral stamina and independence it will continue to grow.
