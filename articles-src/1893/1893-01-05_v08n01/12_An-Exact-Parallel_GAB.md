Many preachers, religious journalists, and others, deny that there is religious persecution in Tennessee. "The law does not," say they, "interfere with the Adventists keeping Saturday; it only says that they must keep Sunday." This they deny to be religious persecution.

For Americans to talk thus would be strange beyond expression, were it not for the fact that all peoples of all ages have, as a rule, been utterly incapable of either detecting or appreciating moral heroism, except when it favored their own selfish interests to do so.

No one will question that the early Christians were actually persecuted by the heathen emperors of Rome; yet tried by Judge Hammond's decision, or by these Tennessee apologists, there was no persecution about it, as they were not punished for practicing Christianity, but for refusing to observe heathen festivals, etc.

The exact parallel between third century Rome and these modern persecutors on this point, is concisely stated in "History of Rome," by Rev. Creighton, Fellow and Tutor, of Oxford University, thus:

From time to time the emperors tried to put a stop to Christianity. They thought that it was teaching the people to disobey the laws, and that Christians were not faithful subjects. They could not understand a religion whose followers refused to take part in the religion of the State. They did not object to the Christians having their own worship, but they insisted that all members of the State should take part in the State festivals and sacrifices. This the Christians could not do, so the emperors from time to time persecuted them. It was not so much the wicked emperors who persecuted as the good ones; for they looked upon the Christians as rebels who ought to be put down. Thus Trajan, Decina, and Valerian were all persecutors; but Diocletian was most of all. The Christians alone held out for freedom.

Then, according to the rule which preachers apply to Tennessee Adventists, the early Christian martyrs were but fanatics.

These so-called National Reformers call themselves "successors to the Prophets." Yes, but which prophets? There were prophets of Baal as well as others.
