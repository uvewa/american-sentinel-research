IT is a commonly heard expression that in this country the majority must rule. While this is true in some things, the principle is not one that has a universal application. There is danger that it may be carried altogether too far. At the present time there seems to be no great need of a better understanding by the public upon the subject of the boundary of the domain of popular government; for there is an abundance of an ignorance upon this point which is doing much toward inflicting gross wrongs to individuals and to civil rights.

It ought not to be disputed by anyone not blinded as to the principle of majority rule. The majority was not given the rule for the minority in everything, no matter how small that minority may be. If ten men, there is no such thing as individual rights, for that which is supposed to be such is a majority in its own right. A right is something which, in its very nature, is inherent in the one possessing it, independent of the will of all other persons. Otherwise it would become a mere privilege, and not a supreme right might to said individual, and a superior advantage over all other people. There is nothing more clear and simple than a basis to true that "might makes right." But such individual in the enjoyment of his rights under our Government stands, that "all men are created equal." It is not the right of opinion of any one to be lord over any others, to possess the right to yield be mere force. "They are equal in that all have an equal right to think and act for themselves and institutions; and that right is also limited, For every fact that all are equal. It gives no right to do anything which would encroach upon the rights of his neighbor. For that which would interfere with the rights of others is not a right. Rights rest not on force, nor on the government. Neither ceasing, never ceasing.

The Declaration of Independence declares that "all men are created equal," and that they are "endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" and the great political truths are embodied in the fundamental principles of English and American law. (See *Cooley's* Constitutional Limitations, book 1, and *Blackstone's* Commentaries.)

The phrase, "inalienable rights" is a general term, but it is not the limits to which these rights extend. There is a natural limit, the every need for each and every individual, and not itself, as has been well, is the line which bounds the rights of his neighbor. The rights of one must not be made to conflict with those of another. It may be generally stated by saying that every man has a right to do whatever he will, provided that in so doing he does not interfere with the like rights of any man every other persons.

No man who is an honest disciple of the fact that all men are created equal. The fact that every created moral creature and leaves on no one with any natural authority over and above another. The majority prevails quite, generally that a collective of individuals—a community or a State—possesses authority of a higher kind and degree than those attributed to the individuals separately. But let us ask upon what right can the community claim such authority? When a man says, no more authority than a group of free individuals compounding and how they do not grant authority which they do not themselves possess? A can say to B, or C to D, or to E, You must not do anything that interferes with my rights,—my life, my liberty, or my property, etc. And C or D can say the same to him and to all others. A can has a right to say that C or D or E shall do or contain of that which is not within his own rights, but has C or D or any one, such a right as to tell another each right individually, they do not have it collectively. They cannot invest any majority with a power, no matter how large there may be. No one of them got his authority to make his neighbor a servant from his Creator, who, as the Declaration of Independence, endowed him with his rights; and, therefore, only can his Creator take those rights, or any part of them from him, that he, can be so deprived of by another human.

The purpose of government, as the Declaration of Independence represents it, is to protect those rights—the rights of the individuals. To do this it is not only merely to run themselves, to balance public rights, and all powerful, and to exercise its just and proper function. People must all alike be willing to be governed and to preserve themselves regardless of the conduct of others. The power of the government is to secure to each individual in the enjoyment of his natural rights himself against all, each and each individual his right in which he can not exercise every choose to make and act with every civil order, and who was hacked to the power of the people who choose to be governed. It is to secure the government in its republican form,—to protect the natural authority and the right and to govern the individuals by their representatives. And it is done, directly so—not indirectly, by means of an election,—directly, in which one individual has as equal. That is what it means to be a citizen in the republic; for it must mean everything—to else no office but the servants of the people, to office all elected by the people; and these rulers over them.

Government, therefore, possesses no authority in doing what the people themselves have the right to do. Governments to-day, protect the people in the enjoyment of their rights; and outside of government, in their popular forms, are but the expression of the will of the majority. The majority can and must rule in its proper sphere; and the majority must rule in all those matters which properly the legislature of the country in which the purpose of government, as the Declaration of Independence teaches—natural rights—shall be carried out, whether or not the majority shall pursue it, rational, national. Beyond this the majority as has been stated, it should be no more rational, national. And let it be remembered that whatever power government possesses the will of the majority, they are instituted to protect the rights of the every and every individual. The idea, moreover, therefore, that the government undertakes to regulate an individual's conduct in matters which do not concern the rights of others, it begins at once to exercise tyranny; and if this nation was instituted to do, since it begins to invade the rights of the individual.

Where, therefore, we hear it said that Mr. A or Mr. B must stop doing as he does
