What is to be the future of religious law in the United States? is a question which may well be asked with serious misgiving. So far its progress has been continuous, and, of late, rapid. The judiciary is in servile subjection to the religious idea in legal precedents. The judiciary rules. The jurisdiction of the judiciary is increasing and extending year by year. That class and clique which controls the courts will govern the Nation. Constitutional principles are no longer of authority. No one refers to them, no one asks what they are. The question is, What does the court say? And the court asks, What has the court said? That answers the question in part. Its progress will continue.

The greatest system of organization that the world has ever seen is now on foot, and well begun, to make religious law supreme throughout the nations of the earth; that is, to secure civil jurisdiction for that which shall be accepted as the Christian religion. The idea of organizing for this purpose, and the organization itself, had its origin in this country. The organization is remarkably adapted to secure the attainment of its purpose. Its character is two-fold,—religious and legal. It is consistent that it should be so, historical, logical, necessary. History shows this same alliance to have always been made heretofore when similar results were sought. It is logical that when man attempts to reverse the righteous order of things, and, instead of making God's cause his own, attempts to make his cause God's, he should strive to attain his end by human means. It is necessary, for God is party to no such reversal of right; he is not deceived.

This organization claims to have forty millions of adherents in the United States; it claims to have sent petitions representing over twenty-six millions of these to the authorities demanding that the gates of the World's Fair be closed on Sunday. It makes no difference that this is the most gigantic falsehood of the day.¹ This is the age in which truth is crushed to earth. So great is the prestige of this organization that under the magic influence of its religious "presto change," fraud becomes fair dealing, falsehood truth. Proceeding according to its motto—"All is fair in religion, law and legislation," it terrorizes judges and legislators until they openly plead that it is "bad politics" and "unwise statesmanship" to oppose its nefarious designs. Although this is one organization in effect, it is not in name. Its name is legion. Under these different names it numbers within its membership all grades of society, all ranks and conditions of life, all ages and both sexes. Never before was there such a massing of forces for any purpose, much less such a purpose.

Upon the measure and character of success which Providence shall permit to this great and militant apostasy depends the future of religious law in the United States. To the intelligent and God fearing student of prophecy is given a general understanding of what this is to be; but the details are with God alone.
