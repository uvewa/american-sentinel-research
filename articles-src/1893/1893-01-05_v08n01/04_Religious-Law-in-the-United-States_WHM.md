In this country civil interference with religion is confined to statutes, and legal precedents, enforcing the observance of Sunday; providing penalties for blasphemy and profanity; fixing the necessary religious belief requisite for the competency of witnesses; invalidating Sunday contracts; disqualifying ministers of the gospel,* and also such as deny the existence of a Supreme Being or a state of future rewards and punishments, from holding certain public offices; and requiring the reading of the Bible in the public schools. Of these none has as yet made its influence felt to any considerable degree except the statutes requiring Sunday observance.

All such statutes and legal precedents are exotics. They did not have their origin in our soil. They are of foreign importation. They come from three different sources—Puritan, Cavalier, and Roman Catholic. The characteristics of each may still be traced. The Puritan set his psalm tunes, his sword, and his Sunday observance to the same key, and he looks to the sword to maintain the correct pitch for psalm and Sunday, even yet. The Cavalier transferred his allegiance from the king and the State Church to the body of law and legal precedents which they bequeathed to him, and the authority of these he accepted with the same courtly grace, and just as unquestioningly. The Roman Catholic is Spanish and French in its derivation, and has never lost the evidences of its Latin birth, nor ever will.

Against these steadily flowing streams of precedent for the interference of the civil authority in religious matters the Constitution of the United States has proved no barrier. Gradually the tide of religious legislation, and of religio-legal decisions in the State courts has gained, until now it is true that scarcely a statute book can be found that is not tainted with the error; and not a State but that in its law reports can be found precedents establishing the authority of the courts in some affairs religious. That the civil prohibition of common labor and business, the selling of liquor, and the providing of, or attendance at, places of amusement on Sunday, is constitutional in the different States, has been supported from time to time, until now the large body of authority is in its favor. This has been accomplished by a steady accretion of precedents until the judicial authority has completely overshadowed the constitutional principle.

In the State of New York the court has said (and evidently based its decision upon the assertion), that, to establish the right to legislate upon and enforce Sunday observance, precedents "could be cited from the statutes and ordinances of every government, really or nominally Christian, and from the earliest period." And the court declared farther, in the course of this opinion, that although acts were tolerated both in this country and in England contrary to the popular view of the proper observance of Sunday, still that fact "does not detract from the force of the long series of acts of the British Par

*That the disqualification of ministers of the gospel for holding certain offices is upon religious grounds is evident from the language of the prohibition; for instance the Constitution of Tennessee provide a that: "Whereas ministers of the gospel there are their provisions, declared, to the public schools, and ought not to be diverted from the great duties of their functions; therefore, no minister of the gospel, or priest of any denomination whatever, shall be eligible to a seat in either house of the legislature."
