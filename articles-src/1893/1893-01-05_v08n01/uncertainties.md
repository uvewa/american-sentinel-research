# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, January 5, 1893 (Vol. 8, No. 1)

## General Notes

This is the first issue of the 1893 volume (Volume 8). The image resolution makes many passages difficult to read with full confidence. This issue is notable for being entirely editorial content — a large lead article spanning pages 1-3 and page 8, plus several supporting articles on religious law, majority rule, civil obedience, and Tennessee persecution.

The B&W scans are reasonably clear but the small type across 3 columns per page creates significant reading challenges at 300 DPI.

### Article: "The Situation as It Is To-day"

- **Location:** Left column, paragraph about Samuel B. Wylie
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** '"had the force of God and the authority of his law," and "these remained to be enacted."'

## Overall Assessment

This issue presented significant OCR challenges due to:
1. Very small type size across 3 columns per page
2. Dense editorial content with long, complex sentences
3. Many proper nouns, dates, and legal references requiring exact accuracy
4. B&W scan quality adequate but not optimal for the smallest text

Many passages in this transcription should be verified against a higher-resolution scan or physical copy. The YAML frontmatter categorizations are based on clear understanding of the article topics even where specific text is uncertain.
