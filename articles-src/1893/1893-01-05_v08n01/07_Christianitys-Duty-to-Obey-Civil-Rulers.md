Every man's first and highest allegiance in this world is due to his Creator. The first and great commandment in the divine law is supreme love to God. The test of love is obedience. "If ye love me, keep my commandments," says the Saviour; "keep my commandments." And again we are told in the divine word that they are to know that "we are the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments." Now if a man is commanded to love God is in effect a command to obey whatever law God has given; and that law is alike to every man. There ought to be no appeal, that what things soever the law saith, it is said to those who are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

While this God demands man's first and best affections, to observe the subjection of his law around his creatures, and to each one's needs being as says, "Ye also shall love thy neighbor as thyself." At an early period in the history of the race, when man began to grow upon the earth in greater numbers, the divine injunction of equal rights afforded the protection necessary, and so God ordained civil men upon grounds more clearly for the protection and securing of their own natural rights. This we call civil government. But this in no way supersedes the divine government; it does not in any manner release the individual from obligation to obey the divine law. It simply provides a way whereby the rights of others may be forced to yield to them under civil command.

Notwithstanding the ordinance of civil government, the individual remains God's; to him every soul is responsible. To him every individual must give account. To permit any power whatever to come between the individual and God, would destroy individual responsibility toward God. It is not the province of the State to enforce the law of God, the individual's natural authority is to know the will of God but the will of the State. The effect would be to put the State in the place of God, just as the Old Testament Adventists are persecuted for breaking the law of man in order to keep the law of God. It would also to man, the conservation of his own right of individual conscience; the evil will have happened; either vengeance is given upon God is, that God is unable; and having man free to choose or to refuse His service, or else punishment would have been so long delayed as to afford no protection to those in need. Civil government as it exists is an advocate necessity for a race of social free moral agents, in a state of alienation from their Creator.

It is evident from the facts stated that man can set no any moral law to ascertain legitimate civil authority and the claims of the divine law. And yet the fact is as a matter that there have been many and serious conflicts. Civil governments have frequently required of their subjects that which the divine law forbids, and have forbidden that which the divine commands. Why is that? The answer is that those governments who have made such laws have majorly exceeded their legitimate authority. Were this not done it would have been the duty of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to have fallen down and worshiped the great image set up by Nebuchadnezzar in the plain of Dura and God would not have delivered them out of the furnace into which they were cast. It would likewise have been Daniel's duty to have refrained from making any petition of any god or man for thirty days, as of the divine will, when so commanded by the king's decree; and his faithful obedience would have sent an angel and closed the mouths of the lions, in the den where he was cast for his disregard of civil authority. But God did deliver Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and he did vindicate Daniel's cause, declaring a divine law, in divine manner; and in thunder tones, that to him alone is Sovereign of the association; and to him alone is in unequalled allegiance due, and all else is but in the earthly estate of the universe.

Nor are the instances cited indicated cases in which the devoted servants of God have, in the face of death, chosen to obey the commandments of God. In each and the history of the Christian Church from the time of the apostles down, it was well understood and was fearlessly asserted by the confessors of the faith, even if it issued from the Lord himself, conceded in these immortal words: "Pledge to Christ the things which are Caesar's, and to Christ also the things that are God's." And when commanded by the civil rulers to refrain from doing certain work of his God and commanded; "Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard," and, again, in like circumstances, "We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 4:19, 20; 5:29.

"We ought to obey God rather than men." And to obey the first commandment and to obey the Christian answer to-day to say and every demand that contravenes the unchangeable civil authority. The Christian can go to prison or to death, but he can not disobey God even at the behest of the greatest of civil powers. His commission is to obey God. "We ought to obey God rather than men."

Nor is this the expression of religious fanaticism. The principle thus stated is universally admitted by the wisest and most enlightened thinkers everywhere. The eminent English jurist, Blackstone, declares:—

"This law of nature, that dictation, that law of God, the great principle of benevolence, is superior in obligation to every other. It is binding over all the globe in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority, mediately, or immediately, from this original."

The reader has doubtless noticed the references to the correctness of the positions taken in this article, and to its principles so explicit as to establish them. These principles remain, therefore, only to illustrate this article by a few practical illustrations strikingly near in point of time to enable readers to see the bearings of the principles in its practical application.

In Massachusetts, 1644, it was a law enacted requiring all parents to have their children religiously catechised. A Baptist by the name of Painter, refused to obey the law respecting baptism of infants, which punished be ones without whipping. This is a case of two deeply similar illustrations that are related to that colony. The first Baptist in that colony, a gentleman who was alone was able to receive that first illustration alone was held in high regard of the colonists. His only fault for his criminal faith for Toleration was the only crime that stood against him in the colony they regarded sprinkling as a counterfeit baptism, and they refused to have part in what it would be to so commit an. Hence they refused to submit to it; hence it was, the institutes now honor them for their fidelity to their convictions.

Other illustrations must suffice. Near Springfield, in the State of Massachusetts, reside some forty odd, Seventh-day Adventists. An elder there stated only a few days ago to the writer, that eleven of that fold had stated the fact that they still observe the divinely ordained Sabbath, and they observe it religiously. On the part of their own, Baptist regarded, an understanding, not explicit, Baptist regarded Sunday as a common working day. And the keeper on the Sabbath they hold to be the Sabbath, and it came to be, the writer explicitly inquires of the elder, whether it even outwardly would not be better for them to arrange the way of compliance, for they follow their usual daily occupations on Sunday, having a care not only to do right but to say otherwise never upon suspicion of doing wrong. No did the Sabbath keepers now doing. But as the law of Massachusetts prohibits Sunday labor on the first day of the week, the principle, so the law of Tennessee is alike contrary to it, to whereby Sunday work or its on that day from all secular avocations and business, "works of necessity and mercy excepted." The elder, however, states, that the Massachusetts Baptists, to obey their convictions and their understanding of the law, have made themselves liable to violation, conscience, and as they view it, their convictions, compel them, and the said Baptists before them, violate Massachusetts law. What is their duty, fully justified in so doing? And it is the duty of the Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee for disregard of the Sunday law as a merely religious or ecclesiastical persecution is the whipping of Baptists in Massachusetts was a hundred years or so past disregarding the law which interfered with their convictions in religious matters, why not?
