In view of the fact that several Seventh-day Adventists, living on farms near Paris, Henry County, during the January of 1892, the writer was requested by the National Religious Liberty Association to go to Tennessee to the assistance of these persecuted people.

things, that not one of the parlors now under arrest lived on the public road, nor was the work for which they have been indicted, performed in sight of the public road. Again, none of their neighbors have complained against them, and declare positively that they are not disturbed; and the only way by which they have been indicted and by which they can be convicted, is by requiring members of the church, and in some cases, members of the same family, to testify against themselves and each other. This is to turn openly to testify against his own, and loose upon the country elements that would come to this criminates each other, the case must fail for want of witnesses.

If any thing need be added to show that this proceeding is undeniable religious persecution, it is in the fact that one of the young men now under arrest, was indicted for work done on the Sunday following the day he became a member of the church. Previous to this time he had worked regularly at his trade and worked all days. This, however, was no disturbance, so long as he did not observe the Sabbath.

Their writer attended their meetings and heard their preaching; and at no time did he hear them speak spitefully or disparagingly of any one. While on the other hand they often expressed themselves as hoping that their enemies might learn the truth, the love of which made them willing to suffer if necessary, both imprisonment and the chain-gang, or even death itself. It was touching to hear their plead in prayer for their enemies, that God would forgive them for their blind zeal in persecuting a harmless people.

The people of Tennessee are not noted for their strict observance of Sunday laws. There are very many shops, stores, stock, stores vital estate, and iniquitable trade marts in the State that are open for business on Sunday. And it is clear that those who do not approve of the prosecution visited on their seventh-day neighbors, urge them to cease all observable work on Sunday, and devote the day to such business as will not require manual labor, or in their own words, "Keep Sunday just as we do." But this, the Seventh-day Adventist cannot do, for reasons that are the very cruelties at stake. They regard that, they part of the commandment which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath" as binding as that part which reads, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work." They declare that they could no more refrain from manual labor on the first day, the Bible and for following commandment, for a power antagonistic to the God whom they worship. They therefore cannot bow down and pretend to "worship the golden image which the king of Babylon had set up."

And although these cruel persecutions are no surprise to the Adventists. From certain prophecies in the books of Daniel chapter 12, 13, and of Revelation, the Adventists have for forty years, anticipated from the whole of this trouble that was realized. Furthermore, it is expected that they will not long be confined to Tennessee, but through recent federal measures such as the Supreme Court decision that "this is a Christian Nation," the unprecedented action of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday, each persecution will become soon a habit instead of driving out these people as to the relish substitution of their last

error, their church has grown rapidly under the persecution, and is now the largest congregation in that section of the country. These events which be regarded as evident fulfillment of promises long looked forward to, have stirred the entire church to greater activity. The congregation will be divided into three classes; the first will go out as missionaries to teach others to the gospel as precepts to them; another class will look after the families of those who first in their immediate neighbors; and still another class will stand boldly in the front ably witness for their faith in the principle involved. At a meeting at which an almost certain imprisonment was manifested. They asserted their freedom in Christ, and that "whom the Son makes free, is free indeed," whether in prison or out of prison. The wives and mothers are encouraging their husbands, and are the most aggressive in the maintenance of the congregation. They prefer to suffer persecution, from their consistent course, and the dignities which impressment will bring rather than that their husbands should prove unfaithful to that which they hold.
