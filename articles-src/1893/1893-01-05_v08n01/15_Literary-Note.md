The value and utility of that unique literary publication, The Weekly Bulletin of Newspaper and Periodical Literature, published at 5 Somerset Street, Boston, has been greatly enhanced by the recent addition of some important new features. Beside serving as a guide and index to the press of the country by affording a weekly classified and descriptive catalogue of the contents of over twelve hundred different papers and magazines, the Bulletin will hereafter supply the growing public demand for a review of the periodical press by devoting several pages every week to comprehensive summaries of the best and most interesting articles appearing in the monthly magazines and the daily and weekly papers.

As the Bulletin is a weekly publication, its readers will have the summaries of the best features of the press almost as soon as the original articles appear. The department of "Literary Notes" will also be enlarged and enriched, and other attractive features, such as an illustrated cover, portraits of authors, etc., will be introduced.
