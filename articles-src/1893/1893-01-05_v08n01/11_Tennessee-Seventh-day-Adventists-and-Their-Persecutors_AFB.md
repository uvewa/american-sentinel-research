In view of the fact that several Seventh-day Adventists near Springville, Tenn., are under arrest for doing farm work on Sunday, and are to be tried at Paris, Henry County, during the January term of court, the writer was requested by the National Religious Liberty Association to go to Tennessee in the interests of these persecuted people.

It was learned, among other interesting things, that not one of the parties now under arrest lives on the public road, nor was the work for which they have been indicted, performed in sight of the public road. Again, none of their neighbors have complained against them, and declare positively that they are not disturbed; and the only way by which they have been indicted and by which they can be convicted, is by requiring members of the church, and in some cases, members of the same family, to testify against each other. The father will be called upon to testify against his sons, and sons against their father. Should they refuse to thus criminate each other, the cases would assume a new phase.

If any thing need be added to show that this procedure is unalloyed religious persecution, it is in the fact that one of the young men now under arrest, was indicted for work done on the Sunday following the day he became a member of the church. Previous to this time he had not regarded any day and had worked on all days. This, however, was no disturbance, so long as he did not observe the seventh day.

The writer attended their meetings and visited them at their homes, and at no time did he hear them speak spitefully or disrespectfully of their persecutors. On the other hand they often expressed themselves as hoping that their enemies might know the truth, the love of which made them willing to suffer if necessary, both imprisonment and the chain-gang, or even death itself. It was touching to hear them plead in prayer for their enemies, that God would forgive them for their blind zeal in persecuting a harmless people.

The church people of Tennessee are not noted for their strict observance of Sunday. Although they usually refrain from manual labor on that day, they do not scruple to visit their neighbors, examine stock, view real estate, and negotiate trades and sales. Some observers of Sunday, who do not approve of the persecutions visited on their seventh-day neighbors, urge them to cease all observable work on Sunday, and devote the day to such business as will not require manual labor, or in their own words, "Keep Sunday about as we do." But this, the Seventh-day Adventists declare, would be to compromise the very principle at stake. They regard that part of the commandment which says, "Six days shalt thou labor," as binding as that part which reads, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." They declare that they could no more pretend to observe Sunday, which stands for a power antagonistic to the God whom they serve, than could the three Hebrew-bow down and pretend to "worship the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar, the king, had set up."

However, these cruel persecutions are no surprise to the Adventists. From certain prophetic scriptures, notably chapters 12, 13, and 14, of Revelation, the denomination has for forty years, announced from press and pulpit that such persecutions would be realized. Furthermore, it is expected that they will not long be confined to Tennessee, but through recent federal measures such as the Supreme Court decision that "this is a Christian Nation," and the unprecedented action of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday, such persecutions will become general.

Instead of driving out these people as is the evident intention of their persecutors, their church has grown rapidly under the persecution, and is now the largest congregation in that section of the country. These events which are regarded as evident fulfillment of prophecies long looked forward to, have stirred the entire church to greater activity. The congregation will be divided into three classes; the first will go out as missionaries to teach others the gospel so precious to them; another class will look after the families of those who labor in more distant fields, and will also work for their immediate neighbors; and still another class, those under arrest, will probably witness for their faith in the prison and chain-gang. No fear regarding their almost certain imprisonment was manifested. They asserted their freedom in Christ, and that "whose the Son makes free, is free indeed," whether in prison or out of prison. The wives and mothers are as courageous as are the male portion of the congregation. They prefer to suffer separation from their husbands and sons, and the disgrace which imprisonment will bring, rather than that their loved ones should compromise the faith they hold. A. F.
