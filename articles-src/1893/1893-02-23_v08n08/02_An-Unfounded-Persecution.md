THERE have as yet been no new developments in the cases of the Adventists in this county since the late term of the Circuit Court. Public opinion has been a good deal divided as to the propriety of the course of the Adventists, but since proceedings were disposed of as they were, the trend of sentiment is against further prosecution, the Attorney-General, in using the course of negative proceedings for constatement.

Ex-Governor Porter, who voluntarily appeared as of counsel for the persecution none, is the most prominent and successful, and he wished here a deal of influence in the right direction. Ex-Governor Porter was a law partner of Wm. Dortch, who was the first to prosecute one of the Adventists. That Governor Porter was a lawyer (Mr. Ringgold), but that is what is to be found more heavily than before, and is that they do. As soon as it was known that Governor Porter was interested in the defense, the same ones who used to say that the Adventists would not submit only called on him and he ought not to be before them.

Under the ruling of the court in the case of Wm. Dortch, it will be very difficult for the Attorney-General to make prosecution stick against the Adventists. The Judge ruled that two or even three witnesses to one act did not merely constitute a nuisance, but that a series of such acts must be proven. And that this must not be done in such a public manner as to amount to a nuisance in the community. It is very evident that work done quietly on a man's own premises, and proved only by members of the family of said man, does not constitute any such a nuisance as to constitute a public nuisance.

The Attorney-General has expressed great regret that the law compelled him to prosecute these people. He believed the Adventists to be, but that the duty of his oath of office otherwise required him to enforce the law, he said, anything this way. Now the law to enforce the law against Sunday work upon any score; the Adventists, save as they were, gave, and the indictments against the people were as defective too, so that the Attorney-General did not know if would be to attempt to knowledge of law.

The two train-robbers running their trains on their trains and repair their worn out rolling stock upon Sunday. Is not that contrary to the law; but the Attorney-General or some other officer to proceed either the corporations or their employees, either their disregard of the law, or himself traveling on Sunday on their trains; and then prosecute, out of respect to his oath of office, a few conscientious Adventists whose religious convictions to devote Sunday to secular pursuits?

The hotels in Paris carry on their business on Sunday as on other days, the livery man ply the livery, the livery business to the train, as usual, the livery stables do the bulk of their business together in, farmers for visitors make their rounds as usual, the newsboys sell their papers, and equally with others, sometimes, the writer is informed, the office of the rules of the rifle, the sport the shot. Again, and the laying of dogs is loved in the humanity's vicinity; but none of these things disturbs the community or call for prosecution.

On part of the Attorney-General six days law matters the ground occupied have on three in one of the most notorious of the the prosecutions of the whole community and; "is it public nuisance," what is it that characterizes dignity of the State."

Another consideration that has weight with the more thoughtful citizens is that persecution of the Adventists involves the religious question; and the effect of inducing the Adventists in a hearty loose and cause, the county to increase in the number of their denominational membership, as about ninety-five dollars of county money has been expended in the prosecution of about sixty out of seventy Adventists in this State at a time when their year of their lives there was a good thing of them in the county. This fact caused the extensive and persistent citizen of our country: the trial was expected of these well known and excellent men, to say, a few days ago that the whole thing was a considerable injustice; it only puts the county to a big expense and no good can come of it. The old man's ideas of justice are a little old they but. As soon as it was it unmistakably patent to the world. The financial aspect of the question. It is a fact that will print any more of them: they do not so good citizens of the county, and them to accord to their fellows their right to be governed by their own consciences.
