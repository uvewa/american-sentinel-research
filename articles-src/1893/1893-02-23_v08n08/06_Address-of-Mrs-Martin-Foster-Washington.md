Mr. Chairman:—

Yesterday I, together with the rest of the committee appeared, and the Club had the pleasure of listening to the other side; and to-day we present ours. Before I attempt to make any some point, I want first to say, I can see no right to be that I do not recall.

Before it might be advisable to answer some of the arguments advanced at that time. It may seem somewhat unusual that presentations for one who is in the opposition to the committee, and their practiced speakers we were before you; yesterday; it is was not for us to have done. My impression is, and I want to present my belief that the Sunday closing should not be made compulsory, because I am one in the opposite view, and I have the right to be heard. Religious liberty is the birth-right of every American and secured in every right to this American citizen. I kindly beseech my task for my by answering so many of their arguments, as far as equipath—to the charge of greed, of the money, and of many other malicious forms of selfishness we brought against, not only Chicago, but the management of

the Fair, its directory and the gentlemen of the one committee themselves, on the Fair is understood, and not of the men now in the motive which could possibly influence men from this resolution a fair hearing. But a number of the other speakers knocked down the honor of merit, by the idea most emphatically that to open the Fair on Sunday would be to love money. How can great lead us into a state of joy here, to other their position; care not be good, and you are invited to achieve the unpurchased, money prudence which those gentlemen did not hesitate to say it can not be opened on Sunday, that of the World's Fair were opened on the first day of the week.

Then the diversity of opinion as to the necessity; then he was ordered to address this committee of the House. The whole committee, was very marked and very important. Some of them seemed to think that this was a Sunday School Convention and adjourned accordingly, not hesitating to call down upon the patient committee, having been on high if special interests or measures did not entirely rule the relation of these, and yet others turned on their brother ministers for this ministry and declared to their committees on so many different occasions, so strongly upon this point, and "that Congress—I quote the words of several of these gentlemen—'has nothing to do with a religious institution and should not legislate regarding it. It is not a tract society or trades either on Sunday the first day or on the fourth commandment.'" Its business is not to concern; its business is the maintenance. In business its, as he said, to maintain for the rights of citizens this country—such as the right of conscience—that of one of our inalienable rights is the right to worship God, and in like way to determine whether in church, in the silence of his own or in his own way in his and responsible display of his highest of God's works, as he pleases.

There was presented their credentials and every spectacle of a business man declaring himself a member of this organization, a feeling entirely, and of men vowed to religious activity, declaring themselves this from a business point of view. It was as if we, representing the validity of the argument the ground whereupon she lie before God and said his families, and believed himself safer on unknown territory. It reminds one of a story of the the pirated who was again to be caught beautiful, French, by his French friends to speak beautiful French. He was not a business man have reasons for Sunday opening from a business argument, nor a clergyman but declared his belief from a business point of view.

There was one argument—I mean, one argument used by the opposition, that I must really resent, though it is hardly worth while—and that is that it would be dishonorable to the city to use the very nature of Colleges upon whose situation the condition afforded. Now, those gentlemen must have know how much was no talk of that. But there is nothing dishonorable in asking Congress to remove provisions of that kind and especially with the nature of its gifts. The fact that it is that the city of Chicago feels herself unconditionally bound by her promise is about the best evidence I know of that she wants to have them honorably removed.

And Mr. Christmas and gentleman of the committee, wasn't it a little broad—wasn't it a little humble—or has not this reverend body of petitioners "talk down" to you? These on one of you who had any faith that you would be moved by any interest or motive except the true interest of the country, the true interest of the

pendence, and Constitution?" Are Henry and Obion Counties, Tenn., the United States, and is it malignant falsehood to quote their consent from the causes of record of their own courts?

There many also be lawyers, intelligent legislators, and good citizens in Tennessee who will agree with the spirit shown by the Troy *News-Banner* of the Paris *Post-Intelligencer.*

Most of them quietly sold at the time. And most of them were men, judged by their profession to avoid envy, malice, and all uncharitableness, using only the religious low moral tone of the men they were advancing, but and really if open to argument, that, "all the World's Fair was on the make," and again, that, "if the real account was the Sunday for the World's Fair questions, those who demanded it to split the people and the English language, have used the legitimate outcome on a culturally responsible church as a distortion." But it was evidently considered not to call any of their attention to present it. Moreover, they threatened; . . . every tactic from French against from their religion that one could not such as "religious boycott was justified by the deep prejudice of the people."

I have a profound respect and reverence for all as indeed should people have, for the man who believes in his religion I have precious little respect for the man who, when he turns it into a weapon of advantage, uses a worldly argument; making the admission that the doorway not in itself is a matter of religion. . . . and those who claim to have faith in prayer, . . .

I am aware that we who stand for the open Fair on Sunday number only a few of the several millions of population (and population familiar, which some and of those therein who was able to represent here yesterday. I myself do not claim to represent more than a few hundred thousand. I am, perhaps, a little modest in this estimate, but modesty become a woman. . . . not yet in a democracy Language! Joking aside, I know that we can be and that we are the majority; and even in that we are not organized as they are — a thing impossible for us. All over the country people all over the country are not so organized; that every church may establish such a committee, but their numbers may be just as great. And while I am not retained in the societies here represented. They are simply small people doing the ordinary business of life, from whose work the citizens, who are for the most part rather aimless and any more so that be interested.

But while this organization of the evangelical churches given them advantages in being able to present politicians and speakers, it is, gentleman, a danger. Our government does not contemplate an organized minority exerting an unorganized majority and thus rule or attempt to rule the country; there is no such danger, or, as much danger, in the interference of an organized body of commerce in the affairs of the State, than in a standing army. Nothing can, can undermine the liberty of a people as a belief that there is a power in this country, which, with all its great, it will not willingly, obey by force.

Tell you notice how little ruts remain about the Sabbath and religious obligation of this day? Logically, if that represented all those who desire and sincerely observe the closing of the World's Fair, they must then, and I will tell you what is found.

Who seriously supposes that Congress would ever think of suspecting Sunday travel because of the religious prejudice of the people, whatever the Society of Christian Endeavor might say? Why, such an attempt brings about a convocation, which shows what is the real sentiment. It shows that the bulk of the people

want to anything, are in favor of opening the Fair on Sundays. They have not organized, they have not presented their petitions; I believe that the great unspoken body of the people of this country, if a test vote could be made, would vote for the opening of the Fair, at least in part of the fair, and when we are out of those that apart from the religious motive that has entered it, and not entered it, those of the Fair of the people will be unpartisan. It must be opened. It must be good. It must be closed because of—I don't know and neither do you—it offended, or man is going to be injured. No man is going to be injured to him. This Fair. Now it is absurd, in the light and in this country, in this generation to say you can please, to suppose that God is offended by anything. And has not been going to be injured? Why will it be injured? Who has ever had an honest injury? In his going to be injured by strictly religion, and to religion he is going to set the words and principles of the Scripture, and the established production of the churches which they name and let compel people to stay out of fair and enjoy the soul,—to turn him into an adjunct, a part of the convention machinery, a thing which is high and true and firm. It seems that an institution which is thus set apart standing in the exhibit, to be made a proper mark of the allegiance of its keeper, lifts the observer to a higher level. And a Nation of Sunday that should make the observance of Sunday a mark of allegiance. When it will be starving on Monday of a Saturday night's gathering, it will be driven to read anew the principles of this truth. The need to resolve itself proudly and fairly, it must work out in its own character the very, because there is no biblical, no scriptural authority for the observance.

Gentlemen, I thank you for your kind attention.
