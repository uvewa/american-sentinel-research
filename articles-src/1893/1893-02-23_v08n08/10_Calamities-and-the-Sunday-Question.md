AT ONE OF THE FOUR MASS-MEETINGS HELD UNDER THE SUSPENS OF THE AMERICAN SABBATH UNION IN CHICAGO ON THE EVENING OF DECEMBER 13, 1892, REV. DR. THOMPSON, OF COLUMBUS, OHIO, SAID:

If the cholera does not come next year sixty-nine nations will visit Chicago. They will come, expecting to see the American Sabbath observed as an American institution. If the gates are open they will not see the American Sabbath, and if the cholera comes they will not visit us. Of two evils, Sunday opening and cholera, I am in favor of choosing the lesser, the cholera—Christian Statesman, December 31, 1892.

In proposing a choice upon such matters as these, who can not see that these Sunday-law advocates are getting ready to pronounce every epidemic, flood, fire and calamity as a scourge from the Almighty for Sunday "deserration"? Thus it was predicted they would, in a work published in 1884, in the following words:

Satan works through the elements also to garner his harvest of unprepared souls. He has studied the secrets of the laboratories of nature, and he uses all his power to control the elements as far as God allows. While appearing to the children of men as a great physician who can heal all their maladies, he will bring disease and disaster until populous cities are reduced to ruin and desolation. Even now he is at work. In accidents and calamities by sea and by land, in great conflagrations, in fierce tornadoes and terrific hail storms, in tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal waves, and earthquakes, in every place and in a thousand forms, is Satan exercising his power. He sweeps away the ripening harvest, and famine and distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and thousands perish by the pestilence. These violations are to become more and more frequent and disastrous. Destruction will be upon the inhabitants of the world. The beasts of the field will groan, and the earth will benguish.

And then the great deceiver will persuade men that those who serve God are causing these evils. The class that have provoked the displeasure of Heaven will charge all their troubles upon the faithful few whom the Lord has sent to them with messages of warning and reproof. It will be declared that the Nation is offending God by the violation of the Sunday-Sabbath, that this sin has brought calamities which will not cease until Sunday observance shall be strictly enforced, and that those who present the claims of the fourth commandment, thus destroying reverence for Sunday, are troubles of the Nation, preventing its restoration to divine favor and temporal prosperity. Thus the accusation urged of old against the servant of God will be repeated, and upon grounds equally well established. "And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Act thou he that troubleth Israel? And he answered, I have not troubled Israel, but thou and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim." 1 Kings 18: 17, 18. As the wrath of the people shall be excited by false charges, they will pursue a course towards God's ambassadors very similar to that which apostate Israel pursued toward Elijah.

The miracle-working power manifested through Spiritualism will exert its influence against those who choose to obey God rather than men. Messages will come from the spirits declaring that God has sent them to inform the rejecters of Sunday that they are in error, and that the laws of the land should be obeyed as the law of God. They will lament the great wickedness in the world, and second the testimony of religious teachers, that the degraded state of morals is caused by the deserration of Sunday. Great will be the indignation excited against all who refuse to accept their testimony.—Great Controversy, pp. 407-409 / small edition. J
