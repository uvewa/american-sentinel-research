THE present movements to modify existing religious laws, as exemplified in the attempts to secure Sunday opening acts of Congress for the World's Fair, and modifications of the Sunday laws in Pennsylvania, are a fatal error. The comparative leniency or stringency of the law does not affect the principle one way or the other. Enforced opening on Sunday is just as wicked as enforced closing. The principle of a mild religious law is just as evil as the principle of a harsh religious law. It is precisely the same thing showing itself in different forms. The only course is to do away with the whole brood.
