# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, February 23, 1893 (v08n08)

## General Note

This issue presented extreme difficulty for OCR transcription. The 300 DPI scans of this 8-page newspaper produced images where the small, dense text was very challenging to read accurately. Many passages throughout all articles contain words and phrases that could not be read with full confidence. The transcriptions should be considered DRAFT quality and require verification against higher-resolution scans or the physical originals.

- The lead editorial spans nearly two full pages of very dense, small text across three columns per page
- Many sentences in the transcription may not accurately reflect the original text

## Recommendation

Due to the overall low confidence in these transcriptions, it is strongly recommended that:
1. Higher-resolution scans (600 DPI or greater) be obtained for this issue
2. The physical original be consulted where possible
3. All articles be re-verified before publication
4. The article boundaries and headings are generally correct even where body text is uncertain
