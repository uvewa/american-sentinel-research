[In the following reprint from the Bradford *Era,* a reference is made to Mr. Crafts' visit to Bradford.]

The present proposal for discussion of the question, "Ought the Sunday law of the State to be repealed or modified? is a shock to the sensibilities of many good people. It is established so that in one this custom is a thing so much difference differently from any other law, as to be the tradition to it in their education to relate to their religion. What men overlook that to repeal it "is an attack upon a sacred institution." To transgress they think not half so bad, but "to repeal it" to so much greater extent than transgression. . . . how much better it will be for men we hardly say, "I'm shocked."

The traditions and friends of this Sunday law, persisting at once in its relation to their religion, verifies my own thoughts, that it is a religious matter. If that is so, the truth is that this is not that transpires it is correct, the truth is this matter should have a bearing upon this question, and that of repeal.

It is worthy of note concerning the law, that only such to enforce it also sometime. . . . if it is the only law this state of repugnance towards it that, with violations it professes to notice under the conditions of the State, prosecutions are not made one in a million. If one occurs, it is mentioned throughout the State and in other States, and is referred upon as a piece of law that must to be charged. Those who wish to cling to it is by capital. It is proposed. Those

who want to change its by abolish it are rejected from Christianity in the one and only purpose of this thing law, this desire to be moral, and save men and not by coercion in the moral consciousness they show the error of their religious reform.
