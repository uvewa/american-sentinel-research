[The Chicago Herald of January 22 has this report of a sermon which touches the real point of the Sunday closing discussion.]

REV. L. C. RANDOLPH, pastor of the Seventh-day Baptist Church, delivered an interesting sermon on "Congress and Sunday-closing of the World's Fair," in the lecture-room of the First M. E. Church, at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Rev. Mr. Randolph said in substance:—

"The practical question before us to-day is not whether Sunday is the Sabbath: or whether, providing it is, the Fair is a good place for a Christian to spend the day, or even whether it would be better for the Fair to be open or closed on that day. The question is: 'What ought our national Government to do about it?'

"Religious legislation is opposed to the constitution of our natural rights, to the Constitution of these United States, to the progress of mankind, and to the precepts of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Sunday-closing amendment passed by Congress is religious legislation. Brethren, I am opposed to Sunday laws; not because they are Sunday laws. I would be just as much opposed to Saturday laws.

"What is a government for, anyway? Is it to make people good? No. It spurpose is to secure its citizens in the enjoyment of their rights. It is to protect the weak from oppression and wrong. The State has the right to say to the saloon-keeper: 'You must not sell whisky to that man.' Why? Not because the State proposes to compel the man to be temperate and virtuous, but because the whisky makes him a menace to society. It makes him a murderer, a libertine and a brute. We have a lurking idea that it is the business of a government to preserve a fraternal guardianship over a man's conscience. The only government that ever had a right to do that, or ever will, is God's government. Civil law was not ordained for the purpose of making men moral. You can not make men religious by law. No government ever tried it without defeating the very ends it was trying to gain. However much a man may wrong God, civil government has no right to interfere. God will attend to that. It is only when a man wrongs his fellow-man that civil government must come in to protect its citizens.

"This is in effect what Congress says: 'We want you to close the Fair on Sunday. If you don't do it you will forfeit this appropriation.' In an orthodox Sunday law the State says: 'We want you to stop work on Sunday. If you don't do it we will bring you to trial in a court of justice.' In other words, Congress as a penalty for not closing on Sunday proposed to fine the Exposition instead of putting it in jail. But some one says: 'It could not be called a fine because the Fair had no claim on the money appropriated. It was a gift.' Then we have the spectacle of the United States Congress taking some millions of the people's money to hire the Exposition to keep Sunday. The Exposition either had a just claim to the appropriation or it had not. If it had not, then Congress had no right to give the money. If it had a just claim to the money, then Congress had no right to make its forfeiture a penalty for Sunday opening. In whatever way you consider it Congress was using its resources of legislation to prevent the desecration of what was called the 'Christian Sabbath.'"
