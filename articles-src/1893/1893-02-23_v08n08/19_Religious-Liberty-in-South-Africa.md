A CORRESPONDENT of the Signs of the Times writing from South Africa, says that questions involving Sunday laws and their enforcement have already been up in Parliament there, and will probably be introduced again at the next session. This correspondent says that at the general meeting of the South African Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, in December:—

The Religious Liberty question was discussed with much enthusiasm and called forth a resolution to the effect that the Executive Committee should provide literature on this subject, suitable for general circulation throughout South Africa, and that it be done without delay. There is an increasing sentiment in this country in favor of religious legislation, and especially in favor of laws enforcing a more sacred regard for the Sunday.

The field of influence of the SENTINEL, the Religious Liberty Association, and those who comprehend the true relations between civil government and religion and intend to stand for their maintenance, is not circumscribed.
