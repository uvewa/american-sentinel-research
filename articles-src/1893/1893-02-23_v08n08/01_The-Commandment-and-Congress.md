THE commandment of God has said, and does say, and will say, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." That will not be denied.

The Congress of the United States has decided that the first day of the week shall be observed as the Sabbath at the World's Fair. That can not be denied.

BY taking this action has Congress decided that a certain day is the Sabbath, or has it not? Has the World's Fair been required to close its gates on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, for the reason that many claim that the first day of the week is not the seventh, and that Sunday is not the Sabbath? Or are the gates to be closed by legislative enactment because many more claim that the first day of the week is the true sacred day of religious rest? Congress has decided that a certain day shall be observed; has it not? It did not so decide for the reason that it was not a sacred day, did it? It did so decide because of the claim that it was a sacred day, did it not?

CONGRESS, then, has given its legislative sanction to a particular day. For what purpose? For a public holiday? No! For a day of religious rest and devotion. Congress has consecrated a day. By solemn legislative act Congress has consecrated the first day of the week as the "American Sabbath." In so doing did Congress assume civil or ecclesiastical prerogatives? Is the sanctioning of a holy day and the consecration of it to religious rest a civil or an ecclesiastical act? It is clearly ecclesiastical.

BY what authority does Congress act? Does it act by delegated authority? If so, did the atheists, and infidels, and Freethinkers of the United States delegate this authority to Congress? Did the great body of the careless and worldly, who make no pretense or take no thought of religion one way or another,—did they delegate this power to Congress? Did the Jews, and the Seventh-day Baptists, and the Seventh-day Adventists, delegate this power to Congress? Did the great majority of the Baptists, and the individuals among other denominations who are personally opposed on principle to all religious legislation by any civil power, delegate this authority? Did they? Did any of them? Then who did?

GREAT pressure was brought to bear on Congress, by some one, to bring this about. Who was it? It was the organized religionists, calling themselves orthodox, who desire Congress to assume that function of ecclesiasticism necessary to consecrate Sunday as the American Sabbath,—the religious rest day of this Nation—by decree of Supreme Court and of Congress, "a Christian Nation." These are they, and they are the only ones, who have desired to give this authority to Congress. But they are not the people,—not even the majority of the people. Then they did not suffice for this in any case. But did they have the authority to delegate at all? What is it that is assumed here? It is the power to coerce the citizen in the matter of a religious observance,—to compel him, whether he will or no, to observe a fixed religious rest. A minority of the citizens calling themselves religiously orthodox, claims the right to delegate to Congress power to compel obedience to the religious belief of that minority. Will it be granted that they ever had the authority to so dictate to any other citizen, much less give Congress power to compel him in any such regard? If this is not granted, by what right does Congress do this?

BUT if Congress does not close the World's Fair on Sunday by virtue of authority legitimately delegated to it by the people, by what claim of right does it do this? Is it by divine right? Then Congress rules by divine right and not by the will of the people. Is the observance of a religious rest day a divine or a human ordinance? If it is a divine ordinance, it is only consecrated and set apart by divine authority and the power which assumes to do that can not act by human but only by divine right. There is then established in this country a form of absolutism,—Congress rules by divine right. What then, in this case, is the position assumed by this religious minority? They are the priesthood by whom Divinity speaks and the legislative and judicial arms of the Government are the instruments through which divine decrees, voiced by them, are executed. What is this? It may well be asked, What is this? Of what power, and what power only, is this the picture? Under what governmental form is this assumption made? Has there ever been but one governmental form which would answer to this picture, and under which these assumptions have been made and their legitimate results realized? There has been but one, what is it?
