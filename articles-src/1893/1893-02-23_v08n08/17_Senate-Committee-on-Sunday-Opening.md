THE Mail and Express Washington correspondence reports that on February 15, the Senate Committee on the World's Fair met and determined that no bill touching the Sunday opening of the Fair would be reported to the Senate. The committee takes the position that legislation has been had upon that matter and it is now a closed question. However, it seems the committee did not look with the same eyes upon measures touching Sunday closing, for Senator Quay, having introduced a bill "imposing a penalty on the World's Columbian Exposition if the Fair is opened on Sunday," that measure promptly passed the committee. The enactment of such law would certainly be the capabusaf to the religious proceedings of this Congress. The Congress of the United States impose a penalty upon a Chicago corporation for doing business in its own city on Sunday! What would have been thought of such an unwarrantable assumption of authority ten years ago? It would be scarcely possible to overturn more completely the relations which should exist between local, State and national governments, than do these measures for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. If Congress can close this Fair on a given day, and impose a penalty, are there any effective limitations, whatever, on the powers of the general Government?
