In marked contrast with the views of the *Paris Post-Intelligencer,* as expressed above, Ringgold, of Baltimore, expressed his views substantially as follows in the last number of the *Sentinel,* in this the report of the speech he made at the trial at Troy, Obion County, Tennessee.

"By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them."

He was engaged in presenting the work of an extensive and of Seventh-day Adventists to the people of the country, and of the Congress of the United States at the capital following their ordinary companion on this work. He was also engaged with an effective and well organized band of Northern lawyers, with the express intention and desire to break up and destroy the peace of his own State and county. This organized band of Northern lawyers has thus made a concerted attack upon a small community of their own State and county. They had and obtained one hundred and eighty indictments against the people, at a cost of several hundred dollars to the county, and summoned and printed in that there ought to be a strict enforcement of the same. His speech is a cruel, barbarous, outrageous violation of an inoffensive people who are quietly pursuing the course of life their consciences prescribe for them, and Sunday hooted on, who while they continue to work upon the day commonly and colloquially known as Sunday, hurt nobody, offend nobody, and interfere with nobody's pursuits. Not only are they guilty of this wrong doing themselves, but they have also been the instigated means of this trouble . . . those misled hundreds who believe in them, and they have not the right to break the Sunday laws, for they are now on trial for these very offenses but for the sole purpose of creating sympathy and enabling them to make martyrs, in order that they may not must not work on Sunday. Yet these full grown men make that claim.

If the law is wrong, and the Attorney-General has expressed that the law-abiding and fair-minded citizens of Henry County are determined that the and "no disposition to persecute," appeared right to work. . . . and "no disposition to persecute" . . . the direct attempt to enforce obedience to the unrepealed Sunday law of the State is persecution, and they have the power, why . . . They should "repeal" their "disposition to repeal." Why not?

The *Post-Intelligencer* makes a second note.

No Persecution.

The *Monitor,* on the other hand, Mr. Ellis Brewer, is commenting on the fact then a number of periodicals from abroad or distant States and some papers nearer home have attempted to make the merits of the case, says: "If it is unlawful to enforce the Sunday laws, we believe that the Tennessee Legislature will repeal . . . Now Brother Wade knows very well that if the law is to remain, it must be enforced in some matters of this general and there of the application to any one class of offenders or that it does not apply to sinker our offenses or our neighbors' offenses, is to this case we must see the fair but legal application of the law."
