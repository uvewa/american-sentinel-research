OUR Lord was charged three times in all things else with doing what men said it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath day, and it was in reference to the Sabbath, and men might disturb the Sabbath He would have not only vindicated but gloried in it. Instead of this, he repudiated them and declared Himself to be the Lord of the Sabbath. He commanded one to go to seek work enforcement of civil law; for He said, "Render unto Cesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are Cæsar's and unto God the things that are God's." The Sabbath is our tribute to the Lord, and Cæsar must not require it. To Paul: "Let no man judge you of the Sabbath." Paul had no authority to say to any one, "You need not keep the Sabbath," but the doctrine of religious liberty is proclaimed that man is not to be ever judged by these. The right is not to determine this: God is our judge and to him alone must he answer.

If by the act of Congress the Sunday law is annulled, it is not removing safeguards from the Sabbath. It is removing only what has been a hindrance to its discovery and observance. Of the day we have been commanded of God to keep holy. It is remaining it to be the one which God designed for it saying: "It shall be a sign between me and you." It is cause since the Sabbath, we know it is because it is unto the Lord. If by observance it becomes

the requirement of the civil law, its significance is lost.

COMPULSORY WORKS EVIL.

I ask for the repeal of this law for another reason. Try compulsory observance for the real consideration of the keeping. When the Sabbath is observed into the Lord it is voluntarily rendered. By the instruction in the home and in public worship men gain a knowledge of God and are made better. Of those who have been restrained from their, not from respect for God, but by the external requirement of this law, the old adage holds true: "Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do."
