The Paris Post-Intelligencer, published at the county seat of Henry County, Tenn., where the late "Adventist cases" have been tried, has not heretofore given any space to the consideration of the question involved or to the cases themselves. But in its issue of February 10, immediately following the last trial of these cases it notices the matter in four different articles. It first describes the cases and their trial thus:—

The Adventist Trials.

The indictments of eleven citizens of Henry County for nuisance, in working on Sunday, and whose trials were set for Friday, February 3, has attracted attention, and when the first case was called, that of Wm. Dortch, of Springville, there was a good number present, many of them being Adventists.

The indictments against nine of the parties being defective by reason of the order of the court ordering them they were quashed and the accused discharged.

In the case of Wm. Dortch the State failed to establish the guilt of the accused. He was indicted for committing a nuisance by working on his farm on Sunday. The statute law provides that for single offenses the violator may be carried before a Justice of the Peace and fined three dollars. But the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the State of Tennessee to Parker, says, that where a man pursues his usual occupation on Sunday and there is a repetition of the offense he may be indicted by the Grand Jury, tried by the Circuit Court and found guilty of a nuisance.

It will be observed that to make it a case of nuisance subject to the jurisdiction of Circuit Court there must be a succession of violations in following the usual occupation of the accused. Mr. Dortch was indicted for committing a nuisance by working on his farm. While it was proven that he had planted potatoes on one Sunday and was seen piling chunks on another, the State failed to prove that it was his usual custom to work on Sunday, and Mr. Dortch proved that farming was not his usual occupation.

The State failed to make out its case and of course the accused was found "not guilty." The decision does not affect the merits of the Sunday question. The other case was continued.

The editor of the Post-Intelligencer is anxious that it should appear that there is no persecution in the prosecution of Adventists in Henry County, and to that he devotes two articles of which this is the first:—

The Prosecution of Adventists is no Persecution.

Having seen but recently called to the press, and there having been no unusual ado or excitement over the former trials and conviction of Adventists in our county, more than any other violators of the law among our people, our attention had not been specially called to the matter until just before the convening of our court, when quite a stir was created among our justice-loving people caused by the wide distribution (by the Adventists) over our county of pamphlets attacking our Judge and Attorney General.

Learning of this, and the further fact that quite a number of violators of the Sunday laws were to be tried at this term of the court, and seeing that there were so many distinguished attorneys here as counsel for them led us to enquire into the matter.

To say that we were shocked by the many unjust and misleading statements in the literature circulated by them would be putting it mildly. For those who do not know our officers and people to read their versions of the trial and treatment of these people by the court, it would seem that we were a set of heathess, filled with religious fanaticism, intolerance and bigotry, to that extent that if we dared we would dispose of our Adventist brethren in a way that would lay the horrors of the French Revolution in the shade and make the Inquisition ashamed of itself. Now, against all these slanders and misrepresentations we enter our solemn and emphatic protest.

The criticisms of our dispensers of justice are as false and unjust as the father of lies could have made them. Judge Swiggart, one of the ablest, purest, most feeling and conscientious judges any State ever had, and one who this judicial district has always been proud of, and delighted to love and honor, is held up by these deceivers as an unfeeling tyrant, words are put in his mouth that he never uttered, and threats he never made or thought of.

Attorney General Lewis, who has been reared in our midst and honored and trusted in divers ways by our people, and whose ability and fairness is not confined to the limits of the States, is equally misrepresented by being pictured as a sleuthbound traveling over the State in pursuit of Adventists, to devour. To those who know General Lewis and Judge Swiggart, any defense of them would be a work of supererogation. To those who do not, we want to say that they have no prejudices in this matter, and from the first have been actuated by what they conscientiously believed to be their duty under the law. We are glad to be able to state that this is now the belief of the visiting brethren and attorneys who are here in the interest of the Adventists.

There is certainly no disposition on the part of any of our citizens to persecute the Adventists. All that is wanted is obedience to law. So if anybody feels like pitching into anything connected with this business, let them deal justly with our officials and the citizens of Henry County, and direct their guns on the law. If the law is wrong direct your efforts to its repeal. Until this is done it is the duty of every good citizen to obey. He who acts or counsels otherwise is an enemy of the State and to the best interest of her citizens.

If the law is wrong, and the Attorney-General, and the Judge, and all these fair-minded citizens of Henry County who "have no prejudices in this matter" and "no disposition to persecute," appreciate now so keenly what odium their attempt to enforce obedience to this unjust law has brought upon them, why do not they, who are in the great majority, and have the power, "direct" their "efforts to its repeal"? Why not?

The Post-Intelligencer makes a second disclaimer thus:—

No Persecution.

Our esteemed contemporary, the Milan Exchange, in commenting on the fact that a number of Adventists have been prosecuted for working on Sunday, after admitting that he knew nothing of the merits of the case, says: "If it is unlawful for anybody to work on Sunday in this State, why are these people prosecuted and other offenders allowed to go free?" Now Brother Wade knows very well that it is unlawful for anybody to work on Sunday in this State. He has known this all his life. Why then does he precede his question by such language? As to the question itself we state that it does not apply to either our officers or our citizens. If Brother Wade aims to convey the idea that any one is persecuting these people through prejudice we emphatically assert that such is not the case. As evidence that these people are not discriminated against and singled out for prosecution, six of the indictments before the present session of the court were against employees of the P. T. & A. R. R. Co. Our grand juries will indict one class of men as soon as another for violations of law, or if inclined to be partial at all it would be towards those who think that their religious tenets bring them in conflict with State laws. We realize that it is hard on these people to be compelled to obey laws which conflict with their peculiar religious views, but this is their misfortune. We deny the right of any citizen to set at defiance the laws of his State. If they come in conflict with his conscientious scruples let him work for their repeal. Failing in this, the world is wide, and he can seek a more congenial clime.

Emphatic assertion that no discrimination has been made in the bringing of these cases, and no special class singled out for persecution, does not go far in the face of facts. In 1885, in the same Henry County Circuit Court, the Tennessee precedent was established in the case of W. H. Parker, since dead, which precedent was followed in the conviction of Robert M. King, in Obion County, and the conviction and imprisonment last year of four of these same Adventists in Henry County. In the meantime there is no record of any others being indicted for Sunday labor, although it is well known that there is no Sunday in the year in which many do not lay themselves liable to indictment.

In this last instance who were indicted in company with the eleven Adventists? Six poor and irresponsible colored men. Any one who appreciates the status of the negro in Tennessee will understand the added ignominy it was expected to put upon the Adventists by condemning them to the chain-gang in the company of those negroes.

Although the News-Banner's article was written before the trial, and the Post-Intelligencer's several articles were written after,—and they both bear evidence of this fact,—still they have much in common in thought and spirit. The alternative which the News-Banner gives is submission, or the penitentiary and the gallows; the Post-Intelligencer graciously grants a supposititious choice between submission, securing the repeal of the law, or exile. It then breaks out again quite in the News-Banner style:—

**Datamars.**

For the honest Adventist whose misfortune it is to live where the laws conflict with what he considers a part of his rights, we can have sympathy and respect, and for the decent newspapers which have criticised our Sunday laws in a spirit of candor and fairness we have no unkind words; but for the blue-bellied descendants of New England witch-burners, and recently imported blatherakites from the God-defying and Sabbath-breaking slums of Europe who have been defaming our people, and setting themselves up to teach us lessons in religious liberty we have supreme contempt.

While our people have always been disposed to treat the Adventists as leniently as possible, we advise them that if they become the tools of these anarchists, in maligning the good name of our county and its citizens by circulating their falsehoods they will forfeit the respect shown them hitherto.

This last paragraph one reads over and over again, each time with increasing bewilderment, until one is inclined to ask with the learned lawyer in the immortal case of Pickwick vs. Bardell, "What could he have meant by that?" How leniently have these Adventists of Tennessee been treated hitherto? What respect has been shown them in Henry and Obion Counties? In what regard have they who plead for the maintenance of our Constitution as it is, and of our laws as they should be established under it,—in what regard have they become the tools of anarchists?—They who plead with the Government, national, State, and local, to avoid anarchy by clinging to the just principles of civil non-interference in religion which our fathers established. How do they malign the name of our country who are its only true lovers and patriots, begging that the good name of our country be preserved, and that it remain true to the eternal principles of justice proclaimed in its Declaration of Independence and Constitution? Are Henry and Obion Counties, Tenn., the United States, and is it malignant falsehood to quote against them the cases of record in their own courts?

There are many able lawyers, intelligent legislators, and good citizens in Tennessee who will not agree with the spirit shown by the Troy News-Banner or the Paris Post-Intelligencer. W. H. M.
