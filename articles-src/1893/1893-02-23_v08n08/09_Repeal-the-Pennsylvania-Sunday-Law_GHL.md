[In the following reprint from the Bradford Era, a Pennsylvania gives cogent reasons why the Pennsylvania Sunday law, of 1794, should be repealed.]

The proposal for discussion of the question, "Ought the Sunday law of 1794 to be repealed or modified," is a shock to the sensibilities of many good people. It is enshrined in their conceptions differently from any other law, because it is related to their religion. Whatever touches that to repeal it, is an attack upon a sacred institution. To transgress the law is called a desecration. To offend to so much greater extent than transgression of it, as to propose its repeal, gives an impression so instantly of an inadequacy of words to characterize it, that they merely say, "I'm shocked."

The intuition of these friends of the Sunday law, perceiving at once its relation to their religion, verifies my own thought, that it is a religious matter. If that thought is correct, the truth in the matter should have a bearing upon this question of repeal.

It is worthy of note concerning this law, that any effort to enforce it also shocks the sensibilities. So great is the repugnance towards it that, with violations continually in all sections of the State, prosecutions are not made one in a million. If one occurs, it is mentioned throughout the State and in other States, and is reflected upon as a piece of law which ought to be repealed. Those who want to cling to it, if required themselves to execute it, will seek to deputize that to another. As much as they feel the need of a better Sabbath observance; as much as they suppose the civil law to be the proper tribunal to punish its violation when they come to test it, their sense of right protests. The exaction of a religious requirement upon a fellow-man by civil penalties is a thing which their intuitions abhor.

A PAST INCIDENT IN THE MOVEMENT.

An incident in the history of this city verifies this. About two years ago some of our good people thought best to apply the Sunday law. The statute which we are discussing now was at hand for them to use. No one, however, found himself equal to the task. A plan was then devised to provide a city law by which instead of themselves, our mayor and the city police might be called upon to execute it. A large petition was secured asking the city council to enact such a law. Sermons were preached in its behalf. Personal solicitations were made to the councilmen for it, and then a request was made that two of the able pastors of churches in our city be permitted to address the council in its behalf. This request was granted, but with the provision that those opposed should be accorded an equal privilege. After the hearing and at a subsequent meeting, the committee having the matter in hand, reported adversely to the petition, saying among the reasons given, "The ordinance is framed in accordance with the act of 1794, and we believe that such a law belongs to the Dark Ages, and ought never to have been enacted. The only effect city legislation can have is to transfer the burden of enforcing this statute from the petitioners to the city, thereby relieving themselves of the responsibility and odium of prosecuting the offenders against this law." One member moved to report favorably instead, but there was no one to second it, and the report as read was adopted.

MR. CRAFTS' REPORT.

About three months later, Rev. Wilbur Crafts came to Bradford, and worked four days to stir up the Christian people to activity on this line. Meetings were held in three of the churches. He organized a Sunday Rest-day League, the same as he is regularly occupied in doing throughout the country. This league, with a good membership, chose a president, secretary and treasurer, and provided for appointment of a secret committee. The members of this committee were not to be known to the general membership of the league, but only to certain designated ones. Their duties were to note who were violators of this Sunday law of 1794, and who were witnesses thereto, and to report to the other committee each week. This other committee was to proceed with the prosecution of offenders or provide therefor as might be deemed best. It is now about a year and a half since this organization was effected. Mr. Crafts' paper has been coming weekly to many of the members to supply inspiration; but to the present time, I have not learned that, with all the paraphernalia, sufficient nerve has been mustered to make one prosecution under the law. The intuitions of a Christian spirit that is lighting the world has kept them against their wills that they should not do this thing.

IT SHOULD BE REPEALED.

Do we want to retain the law any longer among our statutes? It seems to me that its presence is a delusion to a great number of good people. That the sooner it is repealed the sooner they will turn to plead from the divine law, the only law that is potent to sway men to keep holy the Sabbath day. That the sooner this is done the sooner those who have been beguiled by it will cease beating the air, to take hold instead upon the arm of the Lord of the Sabbath, who is strong and mighty to help.

The agitation in behalf of Sunday laws and petitions for them come almost altogether from the churches. The work of the churches in general is so good that the fact of their doing a thing creates presumption in favor of it. When, however, I scrutinize this matter it seems to me a mistake on their part and a manifestation of work undeserving of them. Their efforts on this line are to require of the world a standard higher than they maintain for themselves. Within their own domain they may require of their members to observe the day they have set apart. Notwithstanding this, instances of discipline of a member by a church for breaking that law are very few. I have not heard of one for many years. It is not because their members do not violate it, for they do.

CHURCHMEN VIOLATE THE SUNDAY.

They buy and read the Sunday papers on that day; they pump oil wells; they work in telegraph offices, in rail-road ticket offices, on the freight trains and in stores. The man whose name stood first on the list two years ago, petitioning for Sunday ordinance in Bradford, a few weeks later took the train one Sunday afternoon to go on a business trip to Philadelphia. The churches are not saying, "You can not remain with us if you do these things;" that "you must choose between your place in the church and the continuance of so doing." Instead of this they extenuate the act, pleading that they would have to sacrifice their positions and that the exigencies of the case excuse them in it. If the church justifies the thing because of exigencies, should we expect the world will consider less the exigencies that interest them? If a more lucrative place for the Christian justifies him in laying down his obligation to keep a day, will not he who is not a Christian maintain that the opportunities to him of greater financial gain justify him in disregarding the day? Such a result is inevitable. The unconverted world will not maintain a standard of Sabbath observance higher than the Church requires of itself. While the Church is so lax to observe the day of its own accord and requirement, the world will continue to be as lax to observe the external requirement of the same thing.

A BETTER SABBATH OBSERVANCE.

That external requirement with us is this law of 1794. I will express my belief, which, I think, will accord with the conclusions of others generally, that the better observance of the Sabbath does not depend upon the retaining of this civil Sunday law, but rather that it is dependent upon the way Christians themselves observe it; that in the ratio as Christians for themselves shall maintain a better standard, the world will approach towards it; that in ratio as they lower the standard, the world will recede from it.

The thing then to be done to secure a better Sabbath observance is not by the impossible scheme under this law to compel the world to take the higher position so as to make it easy for the Church to come up to it, but for Christians themselves to occupy the higher ground. It is legitimate for them to require of themselves the obligation to obey God. It is not legitimate for them to pass over their own derelictions to force the religious conformity upon others. The persistent tendency among them to be diverted from what they should do in this matter is augmented by the presence of this law. The law stands as an accomplice to the mischievous infatuation that possesses men to seek to promote Sabbath observance by it.

ANOTHER REASON ADVANCED.

I ask for the repeal of this law for another reason. It is an infringement of an inalienable right. God, who gave the Sabbath, appointed it upon the seventh day. He set it to be a memorial. From that monument of time the weeks were to be counted. The words "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work," were not spoken until the command first indicated the Sabbath; but they were spoken and they have a meaning to us as significant as those which preceded them. These days were given us by the Creator in which to labor and do all our work. Notwithstanding this, the law of this State as well as in many other States, has presumed to say concerning the first of these days that we shall not labor. God says, "Thou shalt." This act says you shall not. In behalf of every man, I protest against this infringement of his right. If any man says, "We do not know which is the seventh day or which is the first day," then by what claim may he assume to dictate? If he has lost his reckoning so that he cannot identify his place, he is not the one to come and usurp a place. But whether he doubts the continuity of the weeks with which all the world agree or does not doubt it, in either case the State is not the arbiter of the Sabbath.

THE LORD OF THE SABBATH.

Our Lord was charged more than in all things else with doing what men said it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath. If men might dictate the Sabbath He would have conformed to their laws concerning it. Instead of this, he repudiated them and declared himself to be the Lord of the Sabbath. He commissioned no one to go and seek enactment of civil laws for its observance. He did command, "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's." The Sabbath is our tribute to the Lord, and Caesar may not require it of us. Paul said: "I am no man judge you of the Sabbath." Paul had no authority to say to any one, "You need not keep the Sabbath," but the doctrine of religious liberty is proclaimed that man is not to be our judge of it. The civil law is not to determine this. God is our judge and to him alone must we answer.

When the civil law concerning Sunday is annulled, it is not removing safeguards of the Sabbath. It is a clearing away of what has been a hindrance to the discernment and observance of the day we have been commanded of God to keep holy. It is remanding it to the use which God designed for it saying, "It shall be a sign between me and you." If a man observes the Sabbath, we know it is because it is unto the Lord. If he observes it because of the requirement of the civil law, the significance is lost.

COMPULSION WORKS EVIL.

I ask for the repeal of this law for another reason. The compulsory observance of the day works evil instead of good. When the Sabbath is observed unto the Lord it is voluntarily rendered. By the instruction in the home and in public worship men gain a knowledge of God and are made better. Of those who have been restrained from their work, not from regard for God, but by the external requirement of this law, the old adage holds true, "Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do."
