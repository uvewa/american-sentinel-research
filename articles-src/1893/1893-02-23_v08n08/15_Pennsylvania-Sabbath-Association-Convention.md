ON February 14, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Houk introduced a bill amending the Sunday-closing proviso so as to make it lawful for the Exposition management to open the World's Fair gates Sunday afternoons. The same evening, from its vantage ground in the State House at Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, in convention there under the chairmanship of Governor Pattison, passed resolutions disapproving of this bill. It would seem as if it were difficult for the religious power behind the throne to remain contented behind the throne. So great and so rapid has been its success that it must perforce disport itself in State Houses already, and call legislators and governors to do it service.
