About a month and a half since, Rev. Wilbur Crafts came to Bradford, and worked four or five days in the endeavors to bring up an activity on this line. Meetings were held in all of the churches. He organized a Sunday Rest-day League, the same as he has in regular occupation doing throughout the country. This league, with a good membership, included a president, a secretary and treasurer, and provided for appreciation of a secret committee. Yet the business and financial men, who are known to the general membership of the associations of their Christian churches and mission. Their duties were to note who were in the establishment on Saturday and who were witnesses thereto, and to report to the establishment; and then another other committee was to proceed with the prosecution of offenders or gratification for a might be deemed best. It is now about a year and a half since this registration was effected. Mr. Crafts' paper has been coming week by week to many of the ministers to supply inspiration; but to the present time, I have not learned that, with all of his expenditure of effort not a soul has been punished to make one prosecution in our cities. It is to me an evidence of a Christian spirit that is lighting the world to have things upon others that we think others should not do this thing.

IT SHOULD BE REPEALED.

Do we want to ruin the law any longer

a menace to society. It makes him a criminal, a libertine and a brute. We have a lurking think that it is the business of a government to preserve a fraternal guardianship over a man's conscience. The only commandment that ever had a right to do that, or ever will, is God's government. Civil war could not be made for the purpose of making men moral. Law can not, and must not make men religious by law. No government ever that it was in defending the very side it was in trying to improve upon the divine law. . . . God, civil government has no right to assume that God (what is the truth) that only when a man wrongs his fellow does that civil government must come in to protect the citizens.

"That is in effect what Congress says; 'We want you to close the Fair on Sunday with this appropriation.' In an orthodox Sunday the law says: 'We want you to— stop work on Sunday.' If you don't do it they will proceed, one to trial a cost of something to the . . . for a most penalty for not closing on Sunday provision for the great fair of this country, putting it in jail. But some one says: 'If I do not close on Sunday I lose the money that I would get from Congress.' Well, he had no claim on the money appropriated. But he has a just claim that the officials of the United States Congress taking million millions of dollars of the people hire the Exposition to keep Sunday. The Exposition rides has a just claim to the appropriation or it had not. If it had not, then Congress had not the right to give the money. It had a just claim to the money that could not be made his to make no forfeiture a penalty for Sunday opening. The truth is that the real constitution never designed it for this with a legislation to prevent the desecration of what was called the "Christian Sabbath."

An incident in the history of this city verifies this. About two years ago some of our good people thought it best to apply the Sunday law. The statute which we are denouncing now as a basis for them to sue. No one, however, found himself equal to the . . . but who took it has been decided to provide a city law by which instead of themselves and everybody the city police might be called upon to see to this. A large body of citizens waited on the city council to resist such a law. Formers were presented in its behalf, calling for the passage . . . law . . . the commission for it, and then a request against its was made. It appeared that no citizen in our city is permitted to address . . . the commission, and the open was granted, but, with the provision that those opposed should themselves be . . . equal privileges. After the hearing of a a citizens' meeting was called it, leaving the matter in hand, reported afterward to the legislature, saying that to the previous given, "The ordinance is framed in accordance with the act of 1794, and passed as a Sabbath ordinance in the Dark Ages, and ought never to have been law." It was therefore decided that the city pass a law . . . the . . . to the law . . . to the city, thereby relieving themselves of this responsibility and if anyone be compelling the enforcement and of procedure cutting the offenders against this law," it was expected then to expect favorably. Instead, but there was no one to accord it, and the project is was dead.
