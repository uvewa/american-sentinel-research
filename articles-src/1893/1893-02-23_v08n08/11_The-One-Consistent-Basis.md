ON the subject of Church union, the Patriot, of Lamoni, Iowa, presents these pertinent views:

"The announced object of this movement for Church union, is the salvation of souls. It is evidently taken for granted that this salvation can only be obtained by means of the Christian religion. It is hence evident that any union of churches which either destroys or mutilates the Christian religion, will defeat the object sought. But how are the churches which now receive and hold exactly opposite views, each claiming to be at least a branch of the Church of Christ, to unite without entirely destroying the theories of some or greatly mutilating those of nearly all? If salvation is secured by compliance with each of the requirements now made by the several churches, can it be secured by a failure to comply with these conditions? Suppose a union of all the churches results in an organization quite different from any that now exist, will it be the Church of Christ? If so, are the present dissimilar organizations churches of Christ also? Is Christ divided up in that sort of fashion at the bidding and caprice of men?

"Evidently there is but one reasonable and consistent basis on which all men can unite in the service of God, and that is the will of God. If Christ is to have all men united in his service, it will only be by all men rendering obedience to Him. If a Church union is to be effected, He must name the conditions, appoint the bonds of union, declare what shall be given up as nonessential and what shall be retained as essential."
