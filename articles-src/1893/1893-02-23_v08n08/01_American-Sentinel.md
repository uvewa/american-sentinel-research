THE commandment of God has said, and does say, and will say, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." That will not be denied.

The Congress of the United States has enacted that the first day of the week shall be observed as the Sabbath at the World's Fair. That can not be denied.

By taking this action Congress has decreed that a certain day is the Sabbath, and has fixed it. Has the World's Fair been ordered to close its gates on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, for the reason that many claim that the first day of the week is not the seventh, and that Sunday is not the Sabbath? Have the gates to be closed by legislative enactment because many more have said that the first day of the week is the true sacred and holy day? Or has it been enacted that a certain day shall be observed? It has not. It did not so decide for the reason that it was not a sacred day, and if it did so decide because of the claim that it was a sacred day, did it not?

Congress, then, has given its legislative sanction to a particular day. For what purpose? For a public holiday? No! for a day of religious rest and devotion. Congress has decreed it a Sabbath. By solemn legislative act Congress has consecrated the first day of the week as the "American Sabbath." In so doing did Congress assume civil or ecclesiastical prerogatives? Is the sanctifying of a holy day and the consecration of it to religious uses not a civil or ecclesiastical matter? It is clearly ecclesiastical.

By what authority does Congress act? Does it do it by delegated authority? If so, did the atheists, and infidels, and free thinkers of the United States delegate this authority to Congress? Did the great body of the careless and worldly, who make no pretense or take no thought of religion one way or another,—did they delegate this power to Congress? Did the Jews, and the Seventh-day Baptists, and the Seventh-Day Adventists, delegate this power to Congress? Did the great majority of the Baptists, and the individuals among other denominations who are personally opposed on principle to all religious legislation by any civil government, delegate this authority? Did these delegate this authority? Did they? Did any of them? Then who did?

GREAT pressure was brought to bear on Congress, by some one, to bring this about. Who was it? It was the organized religionists, calling themselves orthodox, who desire Congress to assume this function of ecclesiasticism necessary to consecrate Sunday as the American Sabbath,—the religious rest day of the Nation,—by decree of Supreme Court and of Congress. "American Christians," they are, that say, and they are the only ones, who have desired to get at this authority to Congress. But they are not the people; they are not even the majority of the people. They did not and they could not refile for this in any case. But did they have the authority to Congress to give? Not at all. What is it that is somewhat observed? It is the power to coerce the citizen to the will of another citizen, whether or not, to obey the claim of another, whether he will or no, to observe a fixed religious rest. A minority of the citizens calling themselves religiously orthodox, claims the right to delegate to Congress power to compel obedience to the religious belief of that minority. Will it be granted that they ever had the authority to so dictate to any other citizen, and much less the Congress power to compel him in any such regard? If this is not granted, by what right does Congress do this?

BUT if Congress does not close the World's Fair on Sunday by virtue of authority legitimately delegated to it by the people, by what claim of right does it do this? Is it by divine right? Then Congress rules by divine right and not by the will of the people. Is the observance of a religious rest day a divine or a human ordinance? If it is a divine ordinance, it is divine authority and the power which assumes to do that can not act by human authority to do it by divine right. This is established in this country a form of absolutism,—Congress rules by divine right. What then, in this case, is the position assumed by this religious minority? They are the priesthood by whom Divinity speaks and the legislators and political arms of the Government are the instruments through which divine decrees, voiced by them, are executed. What is this? It may well be asked, What at this point? Of what, and whose story, is all this the picture? Under what governmental form is this assumption made? Has there ever been any other governmental form which would answer to this picture, and under which these assumptions have been made and their legitimate results realized? There has been but one, what is it?

THERE is one outward sign which is the test of allegiance. To all men of a mark is called belief. That is the observance of the Sabbath. He has continued and recast thereupon emphasizes the allegiance of the true Christian to his faith and makes it unmistakably patent to the world. The remembering of it to keep it holy serves to consecrate it to all humanity perpetually.

The follower of Christ will observe this truth, which was established for him in the beginning, when "All things were made by him,"—the day which he reconstituted in his own character when upon earth, and over which he himself was the master and lord. The original intent for the observance of this day in the beginning is the same in the end; the purpose of its consecration is a whole one; the keeping of it puts the man on high and true and firm. It seems that an institution which is thus set apart standing in the exhibit, to be made a proper mark of the allegiance of its keeper, lifts the observer to a higher level. And a Nation which should adopt the institution of Sunday that should make the observance of Sunday a mark of its allegiance.

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

Dr. Gray's "Book of the Law," was the Old Testament, and, of course, the "law" or "the amendment" were drawn solely from that section of the law of God which in six days labor and says, "But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." In this law God gave his reason for it: "For in six days . . . . that day he had rested from the day on which, according to that account had himself and hallowed that day and called it, . . . . his observance as an everlasting sign between him . . . . and for himself and his work in the first week of the creation, and indeed from the beginning; that those who kept the remembrance of this day to their heart and lives would not forget God.

In this form, then, assumed the same reason for his Sabbath-closing provision which God gave in his law in the beginning. In the position which he had thus taken Dr. Gray seemed to see no discrepancy, or at all admitted none, until Mr. Manderson, of Nebraska pointed it out to him.

The language of this amendment is that the Fair shall be closed on "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." Senator Manderson submit that if the Senator from Pennsylvania is going to base this on Scripture, the language of the Scripture must be changed, because the language will not necessarily meet that interpretation; for the Scripture says that not the first day of the week but the seventh day is the Sabbath. . . . And that there shall be no common labor upon the first day of the week and the word "Sabbath" shall not be used. . . . The words "Sabbath day" simply mean that it is the seventh day of the week and not the first day. And if the Senate of the United States will manage this Exposition whether they should not manage it in terms that are more in conformity with that observance which is made of Sunday by those who keep it: namely, it is commonly known as the Christian Sabbath. It certainly is not the Sabbath of the Old Testament.—*Congressional Record, p. 904.*

It will be seen by the considerations or by the planning designate the first day of the week as a Sabbath day that the consequence of it will be that its advocates will be put upon the defensive in modification so far as it refers to the first day of the week.

Previous to this the form of the amendment had been consistent with the reason given for its presentation and desired adoption. It asked "for the closing of the Exposition on the Sabbath day;" but now, without having changed the basis upon which the demand is made, referring to the same statute in the same "Book of the Law" as before, the form of it was changed. In the Senate the action was first upon the Sundry Civil Appropriation bill and in the Senate. In the House the distinction was drawn. Then a substitute by Mr. Bowers, of California. Both Houses passed the proviso in the later form on the strength of the "reasons" derived from the "Book of the Law."

What is sought by this legislation? Is it that men and women, by virtue of the principles of civil non-interference in religion which our fathers established. How do they make the name of our country who are its only true lovers and patriots, begging that the good name of our country be preserved; that it be not be true to the eternal principles of justice that the President in the Declaration—

had the prophet spoken, are sought to be changed. "What power does this so changed "Word of God" say will seek to do that? Where is there a parallel to this happen? It is example and parallel to be found in the third and fourth centuries, when that Religious Absolutism arose which turned the breaking dawn of the ages into the night of the Middle Ages. Is this a correct parallel, or is it not? If it has not the future is store to.
