THE Paris *Post-Intelligencer,* published at the county seat of Henry County, Tennessee, where a number of Adventists have been tried, has not heretofore given any space to the consideration of the questions involved or to the cause themselves. But for four issues published consecutively following the last trial of these cases it devotes its leading in its four separate articles. It first describes the cases and says:—

THE ADVENTISTS.

A number of sixteen citizens of Henry County of the Adventist persuasion, whose trials were set for Friday February 3, has been disposed of for the present time. There was a good number present, many of them being from a distance.

The indictments against nine of the parties were quashed, against three *nolle prosequied,* and the balance acquitted or discharged.

In the case of Wm. Dortch the State failed to make its case. Dortch was indicted for committing a nuisance by working on his farm on Sunday. The law does not say that a single offense the violator may be carried before a magistrate and fined, but it makes the commission of a nuisance. Mr. Dortch, attorney for the State of Tennessee in Parker, says, that where the work is done in the defense, the same ones who used to say that the Adventists would not submit called on him and he ought not to before them.

It will be observed that to make it a case of nuisance the work must be done in public, making the usual occupation of the accused. Mr. Dortch was a farmer; his farm was his work. He had planted potatoes on one Sunday and was proved that it was his usual custom to work on Sunday proved that the nuisance existed.

The State failed to make out its case and the defendant was acquitted as was the proper result. Under these rulings made by the court the question. The other case was continued.

This is from the *Paris Post-Intelligencer,* and is anxious that it should appear that there is no disposition on the part of the law-abiding and fair-minded citizens to persecute the Seventh-day Adventists in Henry County, and emphasizes the fact that the action of the courts was just, which this is the first.—

The Prosecution of Adventists is not a Persecution.

Having been thus compelled called to the press, and the facts forced to its notice and consideration of Adventists since the cases against these people have been brought among our people; our attention had not been called to this matter before, and there are some things that we wish to state. There is great rejoicing among our justice loving people caused by the very apparent determination of our honorable Governor, and our Attorney-General to our Judge and Attorney-General.

Leaving all this, and the further fact that quite a number of violators of the Sunday laws or some of them at all events for were led in to . . . there were so many distinguished lawyers in the defense, the fact that there appeared in court our ex-Governor to defend the people, and making statements in the literature they have circulated, that the trials and their friends were conducted with dignity and fairness, and that their version of the trial and treatment of the Adventist citizens of Henry County be . . . were a set of hoodlums, filled with religious fanaticism. When we saw those grand men and women of the Adventist Church and conducted themselves in a way that would lay the bores of modern society to shame, a class of people who have shown such moral superiority to those whose slanders and misrepresentations so unjustly characterized.

The criticisms of our department of justice are in his view entirely groundless and uncalled for. The action of the courts through these trials was in the most, just feeling and conscientious judges are the same who serve the people upon the bench, and hence, is held up by them deserves as an entirely proper and law abiding consideration of those claims of our . . .

Messrs. and Grand Levi, who has been reared in our midst and honored and trained in drives school for the Ministry and of the highest respectability, has been more than once most unjustly misrepresented by being pictured as a condemnation of the lawless . . . by the Adventist publications. Whatever aspersions and defense of words be a . . . from . . . without foundation and entirely fair, we want to say that they have no prejudice in the Adventist people other than is demanded by a strict interpretation and a proper enforcement of the law. We are glad to be able to make these statements as a matter of simple justice to our home people and government.
