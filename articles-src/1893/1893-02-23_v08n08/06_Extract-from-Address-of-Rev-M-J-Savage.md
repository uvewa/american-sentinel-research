It is simply a question as to what we shall do with this one day, the first day of the week. I do not believe, gentlemen, that it is proper to say that as many people will be at liberty to see the Fair, if for twenty-six days they are denied entrance to it, as would be if the whole time is open and free to them. It seems to me simply absurd on the face of it. There are thousands of people who would not be able to see it. I do not believe that the churches of Chicago have a right to compel people to stay out of this Fair, and wander the streets and the fields; for it is simply absurd to suppose that they all can get into the churches. They would need ten times as many churches in Chicago as now exist there, in order to accommodate the throng of people. It is not a choice of going to church or to the Fair; and, anyway, if it were a choice, I say it is a matter of impertinency for any man, in the face of the facts and the origin and history of Sunday, to tell the people that they must come to their churches, or else be left to wander the streets or go into the saloons.

The former speaker [Rev. H. W. Cross] has made reference to the statistics. I think, myself, that too much has been made of the statistics that have been presented. While the statistics were being read, I felt running through my mind a quotation from the Hon. Carroll D. Wright. I do not mean it as an insult to the gentlemen here; but it struck me as being so witty and so apropos that I present it. Carroll D. Wright said that figures will not lie, but liars will figure. I do not mean, gentlemen, that these people are, consciously, liars; but when a man votes for a thing as a church member, and then votes for it as a member of the Christian Endeavor Society, and in the Sunday-school, and as a member of some temperance society, he does not make four men of himself in the process, and that ought to be remembered.

And then Mrs. Washburne touched a point which I have felt very strongly, and which I know represents a grand truth. I believe, gentlemen, that the views of the majority of the people of this country,—if a candid and fair vote should be made,—that a two-thirds majority would be in favor of opening this Fair. For example, I represent a constituency of a good many thousand in the city of Boston. I have not asked a single one of them to sign a petition in favor of opening this Fair, and yet I know that I could get five thousand signatures in a week, if I were to ask them. I believe this is true of every section of this country, that the people in the country who are tolerant, who are ready to believe in the common sense and good faith of the people, and who have not this lash of their religious leaders to compel them to sign their names to anything, are in favor of opening the Fair on Sunday. They have not organised, they have not presented petitions; but I believe that the great majority of the people of this country, if a test vote could be made, would be in favor of opening the Fair, at least a part of the first day of the week. I do not believe that apart from the religious motive that has been presented here, any fair-minded gentleman can pretend that the influence of this Fair on the people will be anything but good. Now, why should not it be open? It must be closed because—of what?—Either because God is going to be offended, or man is going to be injured. There can be no other reasons for closing the Fair. Now it is absurd, in the light of the facts of the Bible, taken in any way you please, to suppose that God is going to be offended. And how is man going to be injured? Why will he be injured? What could possibly injure him? Is he going to be injured by studying the grandest specimens of the world's art and the world's industries and the natural productions of the world? those things that in their very nature tend to lift men up out of the lower and the animal into heart, into brain, into conscience, into soul,—to turn him into an admirer; to turn him into a worshiper of that which is high and true and fine. It seems to me, gentlemen, that there is not one single thing in the exhibit, to be made at the World's Fair, that is not intended to lift the observer to a higher level. And if this be true, is there anything in the nature of Sunday that should make the exhibit immoral or spiritually depressing, when it will be elevating on Monday or Saturday night? I believe, gentlemen, if this matter is carefully studied, it will be found to resolve itself purely and simply into a religious prejudice—prejudice, I say, because there is no biblical, no ecclesiastical, no historical basis for it, whatever. I believe that the interests of humanity, the interests of morals, the interests of education, the interests of religion, demand that as many days as possible, this school for the poor, as well as for the rich, shall be open and free. Gentlemen, I thank you for your kind attention.
