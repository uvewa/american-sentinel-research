THE Cincinnati Post, of February 10, contains an account of the rapid rise and growth of the American Protective Association, a secret order organized, like a number of others, for the purpose of antagonizing Roman Catholicism. The existence of these secret oath-bound bodies, among both Roman Catholics and their antagonists,—in some instances armed and drilled,—and sure eventually to be pitted against one another by religious fanaticism, is an open menace to peace, social order, and even the existence of the State. And it is marvelous this has not begun to attract general attention, and excite fear, long ere this. They have a future before them—these organizations. When their day has come, they will fulfill their purpose, and serve their master.
