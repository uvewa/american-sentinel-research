IN Pennsylvania several bills are before the legislature which have been introduced with a view to reducing the scope of the State Sunday laws by legalizing certain occupations on Sunday which are strictly included within the prohibitions of the law of 1794. This seems to have roused the Sunday law advocates of that State to a condition of intense excitement. They have made almost frantic efforts to obtain a large representation of the religious politicians of the State at a Sabbath Association convention called at Harrisburg, for the purpose of influencing and overswing the State legislature. The first session of this convention was held on the evening of February 14, in the Hall of Representatives at the State House, the Governor of the State presiding, and delivering an address. A paragraph from the report given by the Mail and Express says:—

The Governor said that the act of 1794 was as broad and liberal as though written in the present hour, and that not a line in it was expressive of narrowness or bigotry. There could be no question of the right of the people to protect themselves as set forth in the title of the act. After reading the act the Governor said that had not the farmers of our Constitution written in our laws the principles of this act, we should have been overwhelmed with vice. The glorious condition of Pennsylvania to-day was to be attributed wholly and solely to the act of 1794. "Have any blessings escaped us," asked the speaker in conclusion, "since the passage of the act of 1794? Not one."

So far as words are concerned extravagance could go no farther than this. What would be the severity of the enforcement of religious laws which a governor would countenance who is capable of the expression of such views as these?
