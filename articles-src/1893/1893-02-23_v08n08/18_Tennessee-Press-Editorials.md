THE extracts from the Tennessee country press, quoted in this issue, must be taken as representative and expressive of the sentiment of the people in the places where these persecuting trials have been had. The excerpts are from papers published at the county seats of the two counties which have made themselves prominent in the prosecution of seventh-day observers. They are all editorial utterances. These outbursts of feeling are very interesting. They will be read with interest. The rhetoric is a little warm. The threats are somewhat violent. Some of the suggestions rather lurid; the logic sometimes not quite clear, as for instance, not every mind will probably grasp the argumentative force in the reference to marriage licenses, and the abdominal color of certain New Englanders of unfortunate descent. Although reminding one somewhat of the conclusive Darwinian argument "Ask him was his mother a monkey?" still it is worthy of due consideration as indicative of the mental processes of these fin de siecle persecutors.
