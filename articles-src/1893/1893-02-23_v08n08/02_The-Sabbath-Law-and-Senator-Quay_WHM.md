THERE is one outward sign which is the visible evidence to all men of a man's inward belief. That is the observance of the Sabbath. Its continued and regular recurrence emphasizes the adherence of the true Christian to his faith and makes it unavoidably patent to the world. The remembering of it to keep it holy serves necessarily to maintain its perpetuity. The follower of Christ will observe the day which was established by him in the beginning, when "All things were made by him,"—the day which he reconsecrated by his own observance when upon earth, and over which he himself said he was Lord. The original decree for the observance of this day is in the language of Him who is unchangeable, and from it not one jot or tittle will ever fail. This law was read out of "the Book of Law," from the desk of the Secretary of the Senate, when Mr. Quay moved to insert in the clause of the sundry civil bill appropriating money for the World's Fair:—

And that provision has been made by the proper authority for the closing of the Exposition on the Sabbath day.

When sending the amendment to the desk Mr. Quay said:—

The reasons for the amendment I will send to the desk to be read. The Secretary will have the kindness to read from the Book of Law I send to the desk, the part enclosed in brackets.

The part indicated was read, and it was this:—

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

Mr. Quay's "Book of the Law" was, then, the Word of God, and his "reasons for the amendment" were drawn solely from that section of the law of God which enjoins six days labor and says, "But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." In this law God gave his reasons for the decree; it was because upon that day he had rested from the six days' labor of creation, and on that account had blessed and hallowed that day and established its observance as an everlasting memorial, in eternal remembrance of himself and his work in the first week of the world's existence. That was an assurance that those who kept the remembrance of this day in their hearts and lives would not forget God.

Mr. Quay, then, assumed the same reasons for his Sabbath-closing proviso which God gave in the law in the beginning.

In the position which he had thus taken Mr. Quay seemed to see no discrepancy, or at least admitted none, until Mr. Manderson, of Nebraska pointed it out to him thus:—

The language of this amendment is that the Exposition shall be closed "on the Sabbath day." I submit that if the Senator from Pennsylvania desires that the Exposition shall be closed upon Sunday this language will not necessarily meet that idea. The Sabbath day is not Sunday. Decisions are abundant upon the proposition that that language does not mean the first day of the week, even in this Christian nation. If one examines the numerous laws upon the statute books of States providing that there shall be no common labor upon the first day of the week, it will be found that invariably the language is that no common labor shall be performed "upon the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

The words "Sabbath day" simply mean that it is a rest day, and it may be Saturday or Sunday, and it would be subject to the discretion of those who will manage this Exposition whether they should close the Exposition on the last day of the week in conformity with that observance which is made by the Israelites and the Seventh-day Baptists, or should close it on the first day of the week, generally known as the Christian Sabbath. It certainly seems to me that this amendment should be adopted by the Senator from Pennsylvania, and if he proposes to close this Exposition that it should be closed on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, if he desires that the provision should be operative in that way.

Mr. Quay then said:—

I will accept the modifications so far as its phraseology designates the first day of the week. I think it is not likely that the amendment will be disregarded in its present form. I accept the modification so far as it refers to the first day of the week, or Sunday.

Previous to this the form of the amendment had been consistent with the reasons given for its presentation and desired adoption. It asked "for the closing of the Exposition on the Sabbath day;" but now, without having changed the basis upon which the demand is made, referring to the same statute in the same "Book of Law," it asks, "for the closing of the Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." This was in the Senate. In the House the distinction was drawn just as strikingly by Mr. Bowers, of California. Both Houses passed the proviso in the latter form on the strength of the "reasons" derived from the "Book of Law."

What is sought by this legislation? Is it that "times and laws," of which Daniel the prophet speaks, are sought to be changed? What power does this same "Word of God" say will seek to do that? Where is there a parallel to this legislation? Is its example and parallel to be found in the third and fourth century, when that Religious Absolutism arose which turned the breaking dawn of the gospel into the night of the Middle Ages? Is this a correct parallel, or is it not? If it is what has the future in store?
