"By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them."

IN marked contrast with the views of Ex-Governor Porter, of Tennessee, and Professor Ringgold, of Baltimore, expressed in interviews which were reprinted in the last number of the SENTINEL, is this editorial from the News-Banner, published at Troy, Union County, Tennessee:—

Henry County, in Judge Swiggart's jurisdiction has an enormous nest of Seventh-day Adventists in it. The grand jury has indicted eleven men for plowing, hoeing and hauling on Sunday, in other words following their ordinary occupation on Sunday. In nearly every case, these Adventists are as bull-headed as they are ignorant. A large, rich and well-organized band of Northern Sunday lawbreakers are at the heels of these ignorant Henry County people egging and hissing them on—also furnishing them with money. All this is done under the guise that religious liberty is assailed in Tennessee. This organized band of Northern agitators claim to be far ahead of the rest of the world in understanding what constitutes civil and religious liberty. They send out thousands of pamphlets each week and sow them broadcast all over the United States. The substance of all their statements and printing is that there ought to be no national or State observance of Sunday and that it is a cruel, barbarous, outrageous violation of national religion and civil rights to prevent a man from working on Sunday. If they had their way, and Sunday blotted out, we think Christianity would be subverted. Many newspapers, North and South, have been tricked into defending these Advent rascals. Not only are they guilty of blasphemy worse than devilish but they are worse than the foul-mouthed anarchists who believe in the total disruption and annihilation of all law. The law of Tennessee specifically and definitely says you must not work on Sunday. Yet these infamous anarchistic law-breakers advise people to over ride the law, ignore their State statutes, defy their courts, and set up their own private and individual preferences as against the system of society under which they live. Judge Swiggart will forfeit his right to the respect and esteem of this judicial district if he does not visit the extreme penalty of the law on these grand rascals who thus with sustained boldness flaunt defiance in the teeth of our judicial system. A severe and terrible lesson ought to be given them so that those who have in mind to break the law might be deterred. Here is a parallel case. Suppose a lot of idiots should come to the conclusion that it was all nonsense this thing of having to get out a license to get married. Suppose they declared that it was an outrageous imposition and forthwith in opposition to all law, commenced marrying without leave or license. Would it not be the plain duty of the courts to penitentiary these fools if they persisted? Shall a half dozen men become a law unto themselves against all the rest of their fellow-men? But these ignorant Henry County people are more deluded than bad. The real criminals, the propagandists or sowers of bad seed that need hanging are the pamphleteers known as the National Religious Liberty Association. The truth is the works and the fruits of this anarchistic association show that it is a cunning and deep laid scheme to do away with all religions, all the law and all society. Judge Swiggart must either penitentiary or hang these Henry County men or make them obey the law, and if he ever catches any of the members of the National Religious Liberty Association in Tennessee he should either hang or penitentiary said Religious Liberty Association man.

A parallel expression to this was published in the SENTINEL, of February 9, in a letter from the editor of the Carriage World to the Secretary of the Religious Liberty Association, in which it was said:—

You are either crazy or desperately wicked; and there ought to be some legal way whereby such seditious persons as you are could be restrained, as dangerous to the welfare of the community and the public at large.

The first of the principles subscribed to by every member of the National Religious Liberty Association is this:—

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

Upon this hangs all that is said or written by the members of this association. Why then are they attacked so bitterly? A quotation from Vol. IV. p. 593, "Great Controversy"—a paragraph familiar to many who belong to the organization—will answer this question:—

Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as enemies of law and order, as breaking down the moral restraints of society, causing anarchy and corruption, and calling down the judgments of God upon the earth. Their conscientious scruples will be pronounced obstinacy, stubbornness, and contempt of authority. They will be accused of disaffection towards the Government. Ministers who deny the obligation of the divine law will present from the pulpit the duty of yielding obedience to the civil authorities as ordained of God. In legislative halls and courts of justice, commandment keepers will be misrepresented and condemned. A false coloring will be given to their words, and the worst construction will be put upon their motives.

The editorial expression from the Troy News-Banner is something ahead of its time. But like the instructions of Judge Winn, of Georgia, to the Grand Jury, some time ago, that women seen knitting in their own homes on Sunday were indictable, and those who saw them and made no complaint were liable as particeps criminals; together with the unrelenting persecution of Robert M. King, in the News-Banner's own county; and these cases in Henry County, to which the editorial refers, where brethren in the church were called up to testify against each other reciprocally, and even an attempt made to put a boy ten years old on the stand to prove that his father habitually worked on Sunday, and thus make a case against him—like all these the editorial utterances of the Tennessee newspaper are expressive of the ill-will of many, and the vengeance which they desire to see executed against those who stand for the religion of Jesus Christ, pure and undefiled, as he preached it and lived it.

The wishes here expressed, and the threats here made are the legitimate outcome of Justice Brewer's decision of Feb. 29, 1893; of the act of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday; of the fierce campaign for religious law which the ministers, the churches, the Sunday-schools, the Christian Endeavor Societies are waging throughout the land. The realization of these threats, which will come in the future, they are making themselves responsible for. Are they willing to accept the responsibility? Did they ever read, "By their fruits ye shall know them"?
