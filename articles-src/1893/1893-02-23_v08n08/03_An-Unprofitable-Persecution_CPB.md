THERE have as yet been no new developments in the persecution of Adventists in this county since the late term of the Circuit Court. Public opinion is a good deal divided as to the propriety of prosecuting the Adventists, but since the recent cases were disposed of as they were, the trend of sentiment is against the action of the Attorney-General, in using the courts as an engine of persecution for conscience' sake.

Ex-Governor Porter, who voluntarily appeared as of counsel for the persecuted men, is the most popular man in the county, and his action has had a great influence in the right direction. One gentleman, a physician, was heard to remark, prior to the trial of Wm. Dortch, that the Adventists had employed a great lawyer (Mr. Ringgold), but that it would do them no good; he thought they would be fined more heavily than before, and that they ought to be. As soon as it was known that Governor Porter was interested in the defense, the same man was heard to say that the Adventists would get off and that he thought the authorities ought not to bother them.

Under the ruling of the court in the case of Wm. Dortch it will be very difficult for the Attorney-General to secure a conviction in any such case in the future. The Judge ruled that two or even three acts of work were not sufficient to constitute a nuisance, but that a series of such acts must be shown, and that the work must be done in such a public manner as to amount to a nuisance in the community. It is very evident that work done so quietly and so privately that it can be proved only by members of the family of the one doing the work, is not done in such a manner as to constitute a public nuisance.

The Attorney-General has all along expressed great regret that the law compelled him to prosecute such good men as he believed the Adventists to be, but that he had no choice in the matter. His oath required him to enforce the law, he said. But his oath has not required him to enforce the law against Sunday work upon any except the Adventists, and a few negroes, and the indictments against the latter were so defective that to say that the Attorney-General did not know it would be to impugn his knowledge of law.

The two railroads running through Paris run their trains and repair their tracks on Sunday as on other days, and that contrary to the law; but the Attorney-General instead of proceeding against either the corporations or their employees, encourages their disregard of the law by himself traveling on Sunday on their trains, and then prosecutes, out of respect to his oath of office, a few conscientious Adventists whose religion requires them to devote Sunday to secular pursuits!

The hotels in Paris carry on their business on Sunday as on other days, the 'buses run to the trains as usual, the livery stables do the bulk of their business on Sunday, in summer the ice wagons make their rounds as usual, the newsboys sell their papers as on other days, and sometimes, the writer is informed, the crack of the rifle, the report of the shotgun, and the baying of dogs is heard in the immediate vicinity; but none of these things disturbs the community or calls for action on the part of the Attorney-General, but a few Adventists quietly working on their farms in one of the most secluded sections of the county disturbs the whole community! and "is a public nuisance"!! and "against the peace and dignity of the State"!!! Could anything be more absurd?

Another consideration that has weight with some people, is the fact that the persecution of the Adventists involves the county in quite an expense. Instead of mulcting the Adventists in heavy fines and costs, the county succeeded in the recent cases in transferring to their pockets about ninety-five dollars of county funds in the shape of witness fees, and this at a time of year when their time was of very little value to them otherwise.

This fact caused the postmaster at Springville, a virulent enemy of the persecuted men, to say, a few days since: "We might just as well quit this court business; it only puts the county to a big expense, and we can't get justice no way." The old man's ideas of justice are a little "mixed," but he is about right as to the financial aspect of the question. It is a great pity that men are so blind to justice that only selfish considerations will lead them to accord to their fellows their God-given rights; but such is too often the case.
