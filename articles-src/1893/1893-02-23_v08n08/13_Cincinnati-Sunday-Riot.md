ANOTHER riot, similar to the Dean Hart episode, in Denver, is reported from Cincinnati. It seems that a Saturday night ball continued into Sunday morning, whereupon the police interfered to preserve the statutory Sunday from violation; this resulted in a fracas in which there was considerable violence done. Among the ruder classes who know no other way of asserting what they realize to be their rights, than by fist and club, these demonstrations of violent opposition to the enforcement of unjust and improper laws, are to be expected.
