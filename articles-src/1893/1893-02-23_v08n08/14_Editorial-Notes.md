THE present movements to modify or enforce existing religious laws, as exemplified in the attempts to secure Sunday opening acts of Congress for the World's Fair, and steadily enlisting the Sunday laws in Pennsylvania, are a fair sample. The compulsory tendency or stringency of the law does not make them more or less religious. Enforced opening on Sunday is just as dangerous and evil as enforced closing. The principle of a mild religious law is just as evil as the principle of a harsh religious law. It is precisely the same thing showing itself in a hundred forms. They only come to the form it starts with the whole issue.

ANOTHER riot, similar to the Dean Hart episode, in Denver, is reported from Illinois. It seems that a Salvatory band had continuous its call its Sunday morning, and the missionary Sunday from violations, this resulted in a frenzy in which there violent in several violations. Among the ruling classes who know no other way of asserting, and they rule by rights to their rights, than by fist and club, these demonstrations be taken as an indication of the enforcement of unjust and improper laws, are to be expected.

THE Cincinnati *Commercial,* of February 10, has an account of the rapid rise and growth of the American Protective Association, a secret organization, like a number of others, for the purpose of safeguarding Roman Catholic encroachments. The inheritors of these secret oath-bound bodies, among both Roman Catholics and their antagonists—it is has some been actually drilled,—and men eventually to be pitted against one another by religious fanaticism, is in an open menace to peace, social order, and even the existence of the State. And it is marvellous this has not begun to attract general attention, and be put down long ere this. They have a future before them—these organizations. When their day has come, they will fulfil their purpose, and serve their master.

ON February 14, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Hook introduced a bill amending the Sunday-closing proviso so as to make it lawful for the Exposition management to open the World's Fair gates during the Exposition. The consequences, from its vantage point in the State House at Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association in convention there

under the chairmanship of Governor Pattison, passed resolutions disapproving of this bill. It would seem as if it were difficult for the religious power behind the throne to remain contented behind the throne. So great and so rapid has been the success that it must perform dispose it self in State Houses already, and call legislators and government to do it likewise.

IN Pennsylvania several bills are before the legislature which have been introduced with a view to reducing the scope of the State Sunday laws by legalizing certain occupations on Sunday which are not strictly included within the prohibitions of the law of 1794. This serves to the reveal the Sunday law advocates of the State to a condition of intense excitement. They have made almost frantic efforts to obtain a large representation of the religious politicians of the State at a Sabbath Association convention called at Harrisburg, for the purpose of influencing of the oversight the State legislature. The first session of this convention was held in the Representatives Hall of the Hall of Representatives at the State House. The legislators were thus brought into the Hall, the Governor of the State presiding, and delivering an address. A paragraph from the report given by the Mail and Express was given to say:

The Governor said that the act of 1794 was as valid today as when it was first placed upon the statute here, and that not a line in it was expressive of spirit and letter. We should strengthen our hold upon its principles rather than seek to weaken a single item by the act. After reading the original wording of the act and reviewing the results of this act, we should have been determined of our observance of this day. Indeed, and everybody made to obey was to be . . . whenever actually and everywhere equally enforced.

"Since the passage of the act of 1794 No State law that concerns are concerned, statutory could go no farther than said State." What would be the outcome of the foremost of religious laws which a governor would countenance who is capable of the expression of such views at these times?

The *Mail and Express* Washington correspondence report states that on Friday the President and Commissioners of the Fair met and determined that no bill touching the Sunday opening of the Fair would be reported to the Senate. The committee take the position that legislation has been had upon that matter and it is now a closed question. However, it means the committee do look with the same eyes upon measures touching Sunday at upon other legislation. A bill was introduced a bill "imposing a penalty on the World's Columbia Exposition if the Fair is opened on Sunday," that measure promptly passed the committee. The enactment of such law would certainly be the capital to the religious proceedings of this Congress. The Congress of the United States impose a penalty upon a Chicago corporation for doing business in its own city on Sunday? What would

have been thought of such an unwarrantable assumption of authority two years ago? It would be scarcely possible to overrate more completely the relations which should exist between local, State and national governments, than do these measures for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. If Congress can close the Fair on a given day, and in given hours, they have the same authority over this that are the powers of the Government, even over its the matter.

THE first attacks from the Tennessee Adventist cases, in this the issue, must of be taken as representative, and as expressing the sentiment of the people in the places where these persecuting trials have been and are held. The excerpts are from papers published in the towns where the cases have been tried. They are not all editorial utterances. Those cultures of feeling are very instructive. They will be paid with interest. The rhetoric is a little dry . . . The Librarian as we should wrote. Some of the suggestions rather furbid; the logic sometimes not quite clear, and for instance, not every mind will probably grasp the argumentative force in the reference to slavery through. Discussions . . . and of color or certain. New Englanders of unfortunately Aberdeen. Nothing makes an amendment of the conclusive Darwinian argument. But a production right of Monday the ? still it is worthy of the consideration an indicative of the real practical of those of those of divine presumptions.

A CORRESPONDENT of the *Signs of the Times* writing from Africa, says; that a speech involving having Sunday laws in their enforcement have already been up in Parliament there, will hardly be introduced again at the next session, at the meeting of the South African Congress of the friends of the Church. In this that . . .

The Religious Liberty question was discussed at the hearing of Herald of January 25 this year for general circulation throughout South Africa, and is quite the most effective thing of interesting sentiment in this country to the same as the effective power of Sabbath question.

The field of influence of the *Sentinel,* who who comprend the true interests of this thing and and who will procure it, and intend to stand for their maintenance forever.
