I ask for the repeal of this law for another reason. It is an infringement of an inalienable right. God, who gave the Sabbath, waged it upon the second command day. He set it to be a memorial. From that monument of time the weeks were to be counted. The words "Six days" were spoken and thus command from time and the holiest; but they were spoken and given to him with the same sacredness as those which preceded them. Those days were given to man as days in which to labor and do all our work. Notice as a comparison, no other State, has prescribed the first of those commanded days that we shall not labor. God says, "Six days." That set any you of them aside? In behalf of every man, I protest against this infringement of the law of God. A man says, "We do not know which is the seventh, and to which he is free to labor." No sir! He has that free reckoning against this law. That law has commanded not the one to come and turns a place. . . . the weeks with which all the world agrees the weeks and that is the great and the State is not the arbiter of the Sabbath.
