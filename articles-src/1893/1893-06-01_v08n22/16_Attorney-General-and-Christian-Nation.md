The opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States that the general Government has the right to enforce Sunday closing, in other words to usurp and use police power in the sovereign State of Illinois, in the interests of bigotry, is the legitimate and logical result of the decision of the Supreme Court that this is a Christian Nation. We need be surprised at nothing in these days of moral degeneracy when men have so little sense of the value of liberty that they calmly barter it for political influence, and call the base transaction "wise statesmanship."
