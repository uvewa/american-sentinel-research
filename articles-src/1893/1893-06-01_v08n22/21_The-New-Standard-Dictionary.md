WHEN the "Century Dictionary" was issued, and immediately thereafter "Webster's International," we thought that little or nothing more was to be expected, or even desired; but the new "Standard Dictionary," soon to be published by Funk and Wagnalls Company, promises to be superior in several respects to all other dictionaries of the English language. Under the letter "A" the "Standard" has 19,736 words and phrases, or 4,115 more than the "Century" and 5,378 more than Webster's "International;" this notwithstanding the fact that many obsolete words found in other dictionaries have been excluded.

An especially valuable feature of the work is a department of "Faulty Pronunciation and Faulty Diction." It gives needful instruction briefly but clearly, giving the proper form of expression, and indicating, many times, the reason therefor. The "Standard" can not fail to take the lead.
