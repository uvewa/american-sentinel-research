About the only question for the courts to decide in the matter of the Sunday opening of the World's Fair is, Has Congress a right to use public funds to bribe people to observe Sunday? If the Federal Government has such power why might it not secure the observance of any religious rite or institution in the same manner? But to the SENTINEL the proposition seems as clear as the noonday sun that Congress has no power to do by indirection that which it is by the Constitution forbidden to do directly.
