The Press of this city says that it "is glad to see it announced by President Marquand of the Metropolitan Museum trustees that there is no intention of closing the great gallery in Central Park on Sunday. It would be a civic calamity to cut off the principal opportunity that a great number of our citizens have to visit the museum at leisure. The custom of Sunday opening must be kept up, if for no other reason, because those who come to see the pictures on Sunday are the very people who are most likely to come again, and so to be benefitted by looking repeatedly at the good and the beautiful in art. During the week the visitors are largely people from out of town. On Sunday the great majority are our own citizens, and their interest means their education by repeated visits. On no other day does the museum so fully serve the purpose for which it was established as on Sunday."
