"Nothing was closed up [on Sunday in Chicago] except what had closed voluntarily, what would have closed if there had been no law. Let no Seventh-day Adventist hasten to say that law is useless because unused. The sword is there ready whenever Chicago's citizens reach out the hand to wield it."—Christian Statesman, May 13, 1893.

"Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."—Jesus Christ.
