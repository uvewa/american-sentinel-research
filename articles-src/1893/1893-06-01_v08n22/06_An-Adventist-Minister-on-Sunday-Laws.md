SUNDAY law advocates, and their sympathizers on the judicial bench seem to be either incapable, or unwilling, to perceive that Sunday laws are religious laws and as such, are oppressive and subversive of religious liberty, a principle which, as we have boldly said, a settled Sunday laws are religious laws is evident on their face. The law of Maryland, which I have to deal in this article reads as follows: "No person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday." The use of the expression "Lord's day" is a sufficient acknowledgment of the religious character of the law. Notice, too, it is directed only against those who religiously observe another day, while Sunday (first day of the week) observers, so-called, are permitted, with full liberty, to work that day, prove it to be oppressive and subversive of religious liberty.

Religious bigotry on the part of a Methodist minister and a presiding elder, and prejudice on the part of the magistrate and judge, has resulted in the conviction and imprisonment of an honest, respected, peaceable and law-abiding citizen of Kent County, Md. So much for the evidence of the truth of the above. The jailer that the door of his room in left open so that Judefind may go in and sit quietly, humbly and in the fear of God in his room, quietly reading his Bible and directing his prayers and songs of praise to him who is mighty to save, rejoicing that he is permitted to suffer with him who was "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief" and who was "despised and rejected of men." Paul, "None of these things move me." *The Centretown Courierists* remarked all this.

He religiously observed one day in the week as his Sabbath, while they charge that he is not a first-day Christian on that day. His day for worship is Saturday and he observes it religiously and as a conscientious, religious conviction. For living up to his religion, observing the Sabbath as the Lord's day of rest and not as the world day, the first day of the week, he has been arrested and sent to jail, he rest down, and is not prices. He was supporting the obligations of the Sunday law on himself. But the judge of to be is observing the violations of the land. In that regard convincing every observing the statute, however, is observing. The judge must have known that he was amenable to the state—must be acquitted; but as a church measure the "laws" of the land. That he has a perfect right to work and serve one day of rest whatever day he chooses, as his worship day, and whether he thinks Sunday similar to his Sunday keeping, it does not prove that he is breaking the law. He has a full right to rest one day as his Sabbath and that while the law established law as down but, but while the law compels a rest on a particular day whatever his religion might be or not, the law is wrong in trying by compelling him to work on Sunday.

There may be those who think that to prevent the keeping of another day if they do not thus regard it, and this may sound very nice to some, but as a matter of fact, the Sabbath-keepers are not only prohibited from working on Sunday, but are indirectly and in effect compelled to violate their convictions and their observance of the Bible Sabbath.

Judge Wickes, who sent Mr. Judefind to prison for working on Sunday, and who at the insane time claimed his due to the United States, visited him for keeping Saturday, as reported by the press a year ago as saying to this gentleman, who religiously observes one day as his Sabbath and that is the seventh day, or Saturday, and not the first statements by the same judge refuses to set of the Father who said he do not like the white man because he blows not to be a Christian and if a man puts his hand if, a thing it hit is blown it to cool it off it cool by blowing on it may cool it, so as with the judge, he blows hot and cold in one breath, he takes the bread away from the other.

The Kent News gives Judge Wickes credit of the following language and sentiment, in the Judefind case.

The court, he observes, that the point is well taken, and that it should be made criminal or practice of any religious devotion, practice or mode of worship.

The Kent News does not say that they do, it does not say that they can not abstain from their mode of worship; but we ask, what becomes of what may be the creed or religion?

The court replied in, not her particularly the judges says, "The law does not say that they can not abstain from work on Saturday," and yet only one year ago a Seventh-day Adventist, a member of the Church to which Mr. Judefind belongs, was sent to jail in this same judge, for wishing to rest on his Sabbath (Saturday) and demanding that right, when called upon to serve on a jury on that day. The following dispatch published

by the leading dailies, of our country, tell the story:—

Chestertown, Md., April 20.—William E. Hobbs, a Seventh-day Adventist, was to-day sent to jail here for contempt of court in refusing to testify because Saturday is his Sabbath, before Judge Wickes.

"Now it is, as I see to reward you, I will so reward you. I will." His language, how do I know the Bible says, "obey them in authority over you." When he was asked which, the "walk" and the Judge, "I have been on the bench for over," and stated that "Mr. and Peter may be the law says as that if it has anything the to be that is to compel a law is to be it to be him.
