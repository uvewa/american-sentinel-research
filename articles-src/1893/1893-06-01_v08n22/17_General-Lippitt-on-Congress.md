GENERAL FRANCIS J. LIPPITT, of Washington, D. C., makes the following good point against the right of Congress to require the closing of the Chicago Fair:—

> It is hardly necessary to state that the Federal Government is one having only certain specified powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, which, in Article X, reserves all other powers "to the States and to the people;" and that consequently the vast and undefined residue of governmental powers belongs to the States exclusively, and that these operate upon all persons and corporations and upon every square rod of ground within the limits of the State. Thus, if Congress should enact that no liquor should be sold within the limits of the city of Chicago, the law would be clearly unconstitutional on its face, and so would a law of Congress undertaking to prescribe what acts shall be permitted and what acts shall be prohibited on Sundays in the same city of Chicago.

The General very properly insists that there is no difference in principle between a positive statutory command and a condition having the same end in view, annexed to a grant; between a law which assumes to accomplish an unconstitutional object by force and a condition which seeks the same end by bribery—in other words, that the Federal Government had no more right to grant $2,500,000 to the Chicago Fair on condition that it should be closed Sundays than it would have to pass a law closing it on Sundays.

"It is impossible," remarks the Post of this city, "to forecast the decision of the courts upon this position, but to the lay mind it seems impregnable."
