"SABBATARIAN" properly means "one who regards and has the seventh day of the week as holy; agreeably to the letter of the fourth commandment in the Decalogue." In proof of this we submit this unofficial note from the *Chicago Herald.* The *Herald* states:—"What happened on the first day:" "Fifty professional Sabbatarians and organized Teetotalers told in a Chicago hotel and passed a series of resolutions in favor of keeping the World's Fair closed Sundays. Open of the Fair on that day, they declared would be "in the nature of rebellion against the national Government little short of those who fired on the flag in 1861." The rebellion against the Queen's English in the above sentence is the only rebellion likely to occur in connection with this Sunday crusade; but the tone is declared in their petition that they represent everybody in their petition. Among a few of a petition who have taken one in a sweeping, better that they represented thousands or millions, at the ones might have been a feature of all this Sunday agitation. Petitions have been swelled to an enormous size by similar methods. The Sunday crusade should not fear rebellions. With their methods of raising vagrants and countless bolts at a moment's warning they should be able to put down a rebellion at any time.

Two Questions.

"Normals was closed (or on Sunday in Chicago) except what had closed voluntarily; what would have closed if there had been no law on the subject at all. Adventist hasten to say that law is unnecessary whenever Chicago's citizens reach the point of making Sunday quiet, they really will."—*Christian Statesman, May 25, 1893.*

"Put up, rather, my sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."—*Jesus Christ.*
