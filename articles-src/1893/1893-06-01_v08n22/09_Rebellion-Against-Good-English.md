"SABBATAIRIAN" properly means "one who regards and keeps the seventh day of the week as holy, agreeably to the letter of the fourth commandment in the Decalogue;" as used, however, in the following editorial note from the Chicago Herald, of the 13th ult., it refers to observers of the first day: "Fifty professional Sabbatarians got together Thursday night in a parlor of a Chicago hotel and passed a series of resolutions in favor of keeping the World's Fair closed Sundays. Opening of the Fair on that day, they declared would be 'in the nature of rebellion against the national Government little short of those who fired on the flag in 1861.' The rebellion against the Queen's English in the above sentence is the only rebellion likely to occur in connection with the World's Fair. These fifty fanatics declared in their petition that they represented 100,000 people. Assemblages of a few persons who have stated in sweeping terms that they represented thousands or millions, as the case might be, have been a feature of all this Sunday agitation. Petitions have been swelled to an enormous size by similar methods. The Sunday cranks should not fear rebellion. With their methods of raising vague and countless hosts at a moment's warning they should be able to put down a rebellion at any time."
