# Uncertainties — v08n22 (1893-06-01)

## Article 01 — "The Christian Boycott"

- **Signed "B."** at end of article. The article immediately preceding the longer signed "C. P. B." piece suggests this is also C. P. Bollman. Attributed as CPB with explicit attribution. Confidence: MEDIUM — the abbreviated signature is unusual; it may be Bollman or possibly another editorial contributor.

## Article 02 — "Is the United States in Prophecy?"

- **OCR word "Verso 7"** (page 2, Daniel reference): likely "Verse 7" — transcribed as "Verso 7" preserving the OCR reading; may be a scan artifact or unusual abbreviation. Confidence: LOW — flagged for review.
- **"Esas, 4:6"**: OCR may have misread a scripture reference. Likely "Ezek. 4:6" (Ezekiel 4:6). Transcribed as OCR reads ("Esas, 4:6") per accuracy principle; the correct reference may be Ezekiel 4:6 or possibly Ezra. Confidence: LOW — original scan unclear.
- **"2 These 2:1"**: likely "2 Thess. 2:1" (2 Thessalonians). Transcribed as OCR presents. Confidence: MEDIUM — OCR abbreviation of "Thessalonians."
- **"Luke 5:1"**: may be Luke 2:1 (Caesar Augustus decree). Transcribed as printed ("Luke 5:1") per accuracy principle. Confidence: LOW — the historical reference fits Luke 2:1 better, but the original is transcribed faithfully.

## Article 03 — "Sunday Closing at the World's Fair"

- **"sectire"** (page 4): OCR reads "sectire" — likely "section" of the Civil Sundry bill. Transcribed as printed. Confidence: LOW — likely OCR error for "section."
- **Vote count "20 to 27"** in editorial footnote: OCR reads this way; may be a rendering issue (e.g., 20 to 17 or another count), but transcribed as printed. Confidence: LOW.

## Article 06 — "An Adventist Minister on Sunday Laws"

- **"Tidebeeter"**: OCR reads "Tidebeeter" as location for John E. Hubbard. May be "Tidewater" or a specific locality. Transcribed as printed. Confidence: LOW — possible OCR error for a place name.
- **"T. EHRIGHT, CSS. R."**: OCR may have misread "T. ENRIGHT" (Father Enright's surname). The article earlier refers to "Father Enright of Redemptorist College." Transcribed as printed ("T. EHRIGHT"). Confidence: LOW — likely OCR rendering of Enright.
- **"W. A. READDON"**: Cardinal Gibbons' secretary's name. May be "W. A. Reardon" or similar. Transcribed as printed. Confidence: LOW.
- **"Roman 6:16"**: The text cites "Rom. 6:16" which is correctly Romans 6:16. OCR renders it correctly.
