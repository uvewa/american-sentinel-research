THE United States, though the youngest of the great nations of the world, occupies a conspicuous place in history; has it also a place in prophecy, which has been defined as, "history in advance"? Many men have thought so. Even in the early part of the eighteenth century, Bishop Berkeley wrote the words so often quoted by Americans, proud of their country:

Westward the course of empire takes its way.

But this is only a portion of that which the Bishop wrote, though the remainder of the stanza is seldom quoted. The entire verse reads thus:—

Westward the course of empire takes its way;

The first four acts already past,

A fifth shall end the drama with the day;

Time's noblest offspring is the last.

The first "act" was the kingdom of Babylon, symbolized in the second chapter of Daniel by the golden head of the great image. Said the prophet to the monarch of that proud empire, "Thou art this head of gold"—not the king as an individual, but as representing the Babylonian Empire; for the prophet adds, "And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee." The expression, "another kingdom," shows that the kingdom and not the king was represented by the head of gold. The same power is again introduced in the seventh chapter of Daniel under the figure of a lion having eagle's wings.

The second "act" was the Medo-Persian Empire—the breast and arms of silver—which overthrew Babylon and became the second of "the four universal empires." In the seventh chapter of Daniel this power is represented by a bear which raised itself up on one side, showing the ascendancy of the Persian element.

The third "act," or the third of the so-called universal empires—the thighs of brass—was Greece, which, under Alexander, ruled the then known world. The symbol used in the seventh chapter of Daniel to describe the same power is a leopard, "which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl," signifying great celerity of movement.

The fourth and last of the universal empires,—the Bishop's fourth "act,"—was Rome, whose ruler issued a decree just prior to the birth of Christ, "that all the world should be taxed." Luke 5:1. In the second chapter of Daniel, Rome, in its undivided state, is represented by the "legs of iron," and in its divided state, by the "feet part of iron and part of clay."

In the seventh chapter the same power is symbolized by "a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; . . . and it had ten horns." Verso 7.

The ten horns of the seventh verse are, in the twenty-fourth verse, said to represent ten kings (or kingdoms) that were to arise, and which did subsequently occupy the territory once ruled by Rome. We are also told in verse twenty-four that there should arise another horn that should be diverse from the others and should subdue, or overthrow, three of them. This power is thus described in the twenty-fifth verse: "And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time."

## THE PAPACY.—ITS ORIGIN.

The power thus described, Protestants believe to be the Papacy. The wearing out of "the saints of the Most High" refers to the wasting persecution carried on by the Papal Church against all dissenters, which continued for centuries, and in which, as papists themselves admit, over fifty millions of so-called heretics perished.

The time mentioned in the prophecy, "a time and times and the dividing of time," is generally understood to be twelve hundred and sixty years. A time with the Jews was a year. "A time and times and the dividing of time" would be three years and a half. A Jewish year was twelve months of thirty days each—hence three and one half years would be just twelve hundred and sixty days. But as kingdoms are represented by symbols, so also is the time of their continuance. The key is given in Numbers 14:34, and Esas, 4:6. In the latter text we read: "And thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year." The correctness of this rule might be demonstrated by prophecies concerning Christ's first advent, and their fulfillment, but space forbids; we shall, therefore, for the purpose of this examination, take it as granted.

As stated in an article in these columns last week, the Papacy was the result of growth. The term "papacy" is from the Latin, papa, meaning father. A father exercises authority over the members of his family, but the Church was to recognize no authority in spiritual things but the Lord Jesus Christ. Said the Saviour: "One is your master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your Father which is in heaven." But notwithstanding this explicit prohibition, the elders, or bishops (simply two names for the same office), of the church, early began to assume authority which did not belong to them, to claim in the church the same authority that belongs to a father in his family, and even greater authority than this. The result was finally the fully developed Papacy, with the Bishop of Rome in the papal chair, clothed by royal decree with power to correct heretics.

It was in A. D. 533 that Justinian issued this decree declaring the Bishop of Rome head of the church and "correcter of heretics;" but it was not until five years later that the last of the three Arian powers that opposed the pretensions of the Pope was destroyed and driven from before Rome. From this date, A. D. 538, for twelve hundred and sixty years, or until 1798, when the Papacy was temporarily abolished by the French, the Pope held sway over the people of God, fulfilling to the letter Dan. 7:25.

It is with the last event, this temporary overthrow of the Papacy, that we have more particularly to do in this connection. In the thirteenth chapter of Revelation John says:—

> And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

That this is a description of papal Rome is clear from verses five to seven: "And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations."

The time mentioned here—forty-two months—is three and one-half years, the same as the "time and times and the dividing of time," of Daniel 7:25. Here are brought to view also the same characteristics described in Daniel, namely, blasphemy and persecution. But this power was not to enjoy uninterrupted prosperity. In verse ten we read: "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killoth with the sword must be killed with the sword." This was fulfilled in 1798 when the Papacy was abolished by the French under General Berthier, and the Pope was carried a prisoner to France, where he died. But immediately following this, the prophet was shown another power; he says: "And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth: and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon." What government not already a part of the papal beast, was attracting attention at that particular time? What nation was then coming up, growing up as a plant—which is the literal meaning of the expression? There can be but one answer:

## THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

We find that in 1798 Europe, Asia and Africa were occupied by peoples, and multitudes, and organized nations, and that they had been so occupied from time immemorial, therefore as the symbols which are directly connected with the beast representing the Roman power embraced the principal parts of all these countries, and as all the rest of the known parts of the Eastern Hemisphere were occupied by established nations, we must of necessity look for the other beast in the Western Hemisphere. But not only was the Eastern Hemisphere occupied by the power symbolized by the beast having the ten horns, but France, Spain, Portugal, and Great Britain, parts of what was once the Roman Empire, held by far the greater part of the Western Continent, so that at this time the United States was the only independent government occupying territory not previously occupied by other and older governments, therefore we are shut up to the conclusion that the United States is the power indicated in Revelation 13:11-17.

But of course such a conclusion will not be readily accepted unless we can point to events showing that the work indicated in the prophecy, namely the making of the image to the Papacy, is being done in this country. This makes it necessary that we understand the characteristics of the Papacy, for an image to that power must resemble it. The Papacy is, as all Protestants agree, referred to in 2 These 2:1 and onward. Dowling refers this scripture to the Papacy, and says:—

> There is a remarkable passage in Tertullian's Apology, that may serve to justify the sense which Protestants put upon these verses: and since it was written long before the accomplishment of the predictions it deserves the more attention. "Christians," says he, "are under a particular necessity of praying for the emperors, and for the continued state of the empire; because we know that dreadful power which hangs over the world, and the conclusion of the age, which threatens the most horrible evils, is restrained by the continuance of the time appointed for the Roman Empire. This is what we would not experience; and while we pray that it may be deferred, we hereby show our good will to the perpetuity of the Roman State."—History of Romanism, chap. 1, sec. 5.

It is manifest from this extract that the Christians even one hundred and twenty years before the pagan government of Rome came to its end, looked forward to that period as pregnant with calamity to the cause of Christ. "For while," says Dowling, "the long and harassing persecutions, which were carried on by the pagan Roman emperors, continued, and all secular advantages were on the side of paganism, there was little encouragement for any one to embrace Christianity, who did not discern somewhat of its truth and excellence." Continuing, the same historian says:—

> Many of the errors, indeed, of several centuries, the fruit of vain philosophy, paved the way for the events which followed, but the hindrance was not effectually removed, until Constantine the emperor, on professing himself a Christian, undertook to convert the kingdom of Christ into a kingdom of this world, by exalting the teachers of Christianity to the same state of affluence, and grandeur, and influence in the empire, as had been enjoyed by pagan priests and secular officers in the State. The professed ministers of Jesus having now a wide field opened to them for gratifying their lust of power, wealth, and dignity, the connection between the Christian faith and the cross was at an end. What followed was the kingdom of the clergy, supplanting the kingdom of Jesus Christ.

> Every feature in the inspired description corresponds to that of a religious power, in the assumption of divine authority, divine honors, and divine worship; a power which should arrogate the prerogatives of the Most High, having its seat in the temple or house of God, and which should be carried on by Satan's influence, with all deceit, hypocrisy, and tyranny; and with this corresponds the figurative representation given of the same power, in the thirteenth chapter of Revelation.—Id., sec. 6.

> In all these transactions, the substitution of human for divine authority, contentions about words instead of the faith once delivered to the saints, pomp and splender of worship for the primitive simplicity, and worldly power and dignity instead of self-denial, labors of love and bearing the cross. This baneful change operated in darkening the human mind as to the real nature of true Christianity, until, in process of time, it was lost sight of.—Id., sec. 6.

As appears from this testimony, the distinguishing feature of the Papacy is a union of civil and ecclesiastical power. Writing directly upon this point, Dowling says:—

> It was owing to forgetfulness or disregard of the important principle that Christ's kingdom is not of this world, that the Emperor Constantine, soon after his remarkable, and as some suppose, miraculous conversion to Christianity in the year 313, took the religion of Christ to the unhallowed embraces of the State, assumed to unite in his own person the civil and ecclesiastical dominion, and claimed the power of convening councils and presiding in them, and of regulating the external affairs of the Church.—Bl., sec. 1.

The emperor's first mistake was in taking the religion of Christ into "the unhallowed embraces of the State;" and the second, that of assuming to rule the Church naturally followed; indeed, this assumption on the part of the emperor was inevitable; having united Church and State, he, as emperor, must of necessity either rule the Church, or allow the Church to rule both him and his empire. Where both Church and State keep within their proper spheres, each may be supreme within its sphere, but when the two form a partnership the one must rule and the other be ruled.

## INFLUENCE OF THE BISHOPS.

Prior to the time of Constantine the bishops of the Christian Church had gained such influence in the Roman Empire that the emperor desired to use them to advance his own interests. In fact, he found it necessary to do so, for if their influence were not exerted in his behalf it would be against him, and as he could not destroy it, he had to turn it to his own advantage. In regard to this, Killen gives the following testimony:—

> As early as the middle of the second century the bishop, at least in some places, was entrusted with the chief management of the funds of the church; and, probably about fifty years after wards, a large share of its revenues was appropriated to his personal maintenance. His superior wealth soon added immensely to his influence. He was thus enabled to maintain a higher position in society than any of his brethren; and he was at length regarded as the great fountain of patronage and proferment. In the third century the chief pastor of the western metropolis must have been known to the great officers of government, and perhaps to the emperor himself. Decins must have regarded the Roman bishop as a somewhat formidable personage when he declared that he would sooner tolerate a rival candidate for the throne, and when he proclaimed his determination to annihilate the very office.—The Annals Church, pp. 590, 591.

It is even so in our own country at the present time. The churches have become numerically and financially strong, and those who stand high in them exercise a powerful influence in political affairs. This would, perhaps, not be dangerous were this influence exerted by each church separately, for the influence of one would neutralize that of another; nor is it so hurtful when exercised in the proper direction; but when the influence of several is united and used for the accomplishment of political objects it becomes dangerous. This fact was recognized in 1829, by the Committee of the United States Senate on Post-offices and Post-roads, to which was referred a petition asking that the carrying of mails on Sunday be suspended. On that occasion Hon. Richard M. Johnson, chairman of that committee, submitted a report in which the following language occurs:—

> Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. This first effort of this kind calls for the establishment of a principle which, in the opinion of the committee, would lay the foundation for dangerous innovations upon the spirit of the Constitution, and upon the religious rights of the citizens. If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the government will be strongly marked, if not eventually controlled, by the same influence. All religious despotisms commence by combination, and, when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences.

How such extensive religious combinations have been formed in this country, and how they have worked and are still working to subvert our free institutions making the Government, and, through it, the entire people, subservient to a religious hierarchy, must be told in another article. C. P. B.
