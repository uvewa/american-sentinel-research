THAT the boycott is not only unchristian but antichristian will scarcely be disputed. This is so patent that the religious papers of the country are saying, "There will be no boycott of the Fair;" but they add, "Christian people will unitedly refuse to patronize it if it is open on Sunday."

BUT "what's in a name?" To boycott means "to combine in refusing to give assistance to, or have any kind of dealings with." Then if the "Christian people" of the country unitedly refuse to patronize the Fair, in what respect will their action differ from a boycott? And if the boycott is antichristian, how can such united action on the part of the "Christian people" be otherwise than antichristian?

Or is the boycott antichristian only when used for ordinary worldly purposes? Does evil become good when done in the service of religion? Does the Jesuitical motto, "The end justifies the means," after all express a great moral truth not hitherto discerned by the Protestant world?

GRANT, for the sake of the argument, that it is morally wrong to open the Fair on Sunday, and suppose that by the threatened boycott such opening could be prevented, would anything be gained for the cause of religion? The effect of a boycott is a fine levied and collected without the intervention of the civil law. But that is only mob law. As well might a mob destroy the property of the Fair by actual violence as to destroy it indirectly by combining to make it unremunerative, and so, practically worthless. Which would be the greater wrong to my neighbor, for me to burn his factory, or to simply exert such an influence against him as to make it impossible for him to either operate or sell it? The civil law might, in fact would, make a difference between the two kinds of injury, but from a Christian standpoint, from the standpoint of the Golden Rule—who can say that one would be any less wicked than the other? Indeed the more covert method of revenge would show the greater malice, for the building might be fired in a moment of intense anger, but the ruinous influence could be effective only if of long continuence—the result of a settled purpose to do an injury.

But there is yet another count in the indictment against the "Christian" boycott on the Fair. Its purpose is declared to be to compel obedience to the law of Congress requiring the closing of the Fair; and yet the boycott is itself illegal. There can be no boycott without conspiracy; and conspiracy to injure any person or corporation either in person, property, or reputation, has been repeatedly held by the courts to be illegal, and is punishable by severe penalties. So that in resorting to a boycott against the Fair, the "Christian people of the country," and "the law abiding people of the country," the "best people of the country," as they are wont to style themselves, become law-breakers themselves in order to compel obedience to law!

This is bad enough, but it is not the worst feature of this antichristian boycott; the law that they demand shall be obeyed was itself secured by a threatened boycott of the politicians. The "law abiding people of the land" said to the lawmakers of the land: "Refuse to pass an act closing the Fair on Sunday and we will combine against you and knife you at the polls. We will see to it that you do not come back here again," etc., etc. Having secured the law unlawfully, by threats and intimidation, is it any wonder that they resort to unlawful means to secure its enforcement?

AND what is this institution which is thus supported by boycott? It is the same that the Papacy sets forth as the badge of its authority to change the law of God, and to command men under sin to observe the ordinances of the Papal Church; it is the mark of the first beast of the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, which the so-called Protestants of America propose to force upon all by means of the boycott, described in Rev. 13:16, 17, in these words: "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or on their foreheads. And that no man might buy or sell, save he that hath the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name." B.
