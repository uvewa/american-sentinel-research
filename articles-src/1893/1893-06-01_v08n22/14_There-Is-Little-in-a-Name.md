There is little in a name, except that some reveal a wonderful deal of affectation; hence the impossibility of changing the nature of anything by changing its name. Sunday is the sun's day, dedicated by the heathen to the worship of that luminary—"the wild solar holiday of all pagan times." Calling it "the Sabbath," "the Lord's day," or even substituting "o" for "u" and making it "Sunday" does not change the fact; it is still the rival of the Sabbath, the Lord's day of the sacred Scriptures.
