HUMAN law is designed to prevent me of others and destroying our law of liberty and maintaining our common rights, together with my rights, and doing that which tends to impair the usefulness of the whole, taking the pursuit of happiness," he has a perfect right to do what he will, according to any individual or community undertakes to make any one do that which he does not want to do, or to leave undone that which he wants to do, when the doing or not doing the thing proposed would not work any injury whatever to any other persons or persons, that individual or community is transgressing the law of personal liberty.

I here affirm that all attempts to enforce the observance of Sunday, or any other enactments, is a step toward the union of Church and State, in direct opposition of personal liberty; I also affirm, that the effort of the National Reformers is to compel men everywhere, rich and poor, bond and free, male and female, to rest on the first day of the week or Sunday; which if, it obligates or compels men to this obligation the same as to pray, to go to church, or to commune, or to be baptized, therefore any attempt to compel one to observe the day as a Sabbath is wholly in the province of the State, clear and unmistakable, and is as clear a union of Church and State in the United States, and personal liberty as it must be baptized and become a member of the Christian Church. A man is in no way infringing on my rights by working on Sunday for no one has attempted to make me do so, and if I am worshiping God, as I ought to be on Sunday and at work would I do my duty any more than a man is infringing upon another man's right to work. By working he does not deny another man's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," while if I to the ordinary Christian to compel him to refrain from labor on Sunday, we are depriving him of his liberty and the right to the pursuit of happiness, and have laid the foundation for the "next step" rightly to in the United States "of *Geary Smith,* as the *People's Work.*
