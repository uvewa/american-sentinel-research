SUNDAY law advocates and their sympathizers on the judicial bench seem to be ignorant (many wilfully so) of the fact that Sunday laws are religious laws and as such are oppressive and subversive of religious liberty, a principle which we, as a people, hold so sacred. That Sunday laws are religious is evident on their face. The law of Maryland, with which I have to deal in this article reads as follows: "No person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday." The use of the term "Lord's day," in this law is an acknowledgment of the religious character of the law. And the fact that it is used only against those who religiously observe another day, while Sunday (first day of the week) observers, so-called, are permitted, with full liberty, to work that day, proves it to be oppressive and subversive of religious liberty.

Religious bigotry on the part of a Methodist minister and a presiding elder, and prejudice on the part of the magistrate and judge, has resulted in the confinement in jail of one of the most respected, peaceable and law-abiding citizens of Kent County, Md. So much confidence is placed in this man by the jailer that the door of his room is left unlocked. He is serving out his time in jail quietly, humbly and in the fear of God, behind an unlocked door, reading his Bible and directing his prayers and songs of praise to him who is mighty to save, rejoicing that he is permitted to suffer with him who was "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief" and repeating by his actions the language of Paul, "None of these things move me."

The Centreville Observer remarks editorially:—

> He religiously observed one day in the week as rest day, and attended to all the duties of an upright Christian on that day. His day for worship was Saturday, and he worshiped on that day. It was not the mere dodge of a Sabbath-breaker, but a conscientious, religious conviction. For living up in his convictions he is seized, as the law of the land directs, and is cast into prison. He was worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience, a right guaranteed him by the Constitution of the land. In that regard (worshiping God on Saturday) he was availing himself of a guaranteed right under the Constitution. That he was violating the statute, however, in working on Sunday goes without saying, and in doing so he must have known that he was amenable to its provisions, provisions which all good citizens must obey, for as a conscientious man he is called upon to obey the "laws" of the land. That he has a full right to rest on Saturday nobody denies, but that he has a right to work on Sunday the law does deny, and whether he thinks Sunday entitled to be observed or not he can not escape the demand upon him to obey the laws and institutions under which he lives. He has a full right to rest two days in seven, if his religious convictions and the established law so direct him, but whilst the law stands he should as a good citizen obey it; certainly so long as the law does not do violence to his conscience by compelling him to work on Saturday.

The old plea that Sunday laws do not prevent the keeping of another day is fully stated in the foregoing. All this may sound very nice to some, but as a matter of fact seventh-day keepers are not only prohibited from working on Sunday, but are also interfered with in their observance of the Bible Sabbath. Judge Wickes, who sent Mr. Judefind to prison for working on Sunday, and who, at the same time claimed the law did not molest him for keeping Saturday, is reported by the press a year ago as saying, "The law says that we shall observe but one day as the Sabbath and that is the day commonly called Sunday." These two statements by the same judge reminds us of the Indian who said he did not like the white man because he blows hot and cold out of the same mouth, that is, if a thing is hot he blows it to cool it, and if cool he blows it to warm it. And so with the judge—he blows hot and cold. In other words, he takes two opposite positions on the same law.

The Kent News gives Judge Wickes' decision in the Judefind case, as follows:—

> The court held, in substance, that the point at issue, namely, working on Sunday, was not a matter of creed or practice of any religious denomination. There could certainly not be a rule or practice making it obligatory to work on Sunday. The law does not say that they can not abstain from work on Saturday, but does say that they shall not work on Sunday, and applies to every one, it matters not what may be his creed or religion.

The reader will notice particularly that the judge says, "The law does not say that they can not abstain from work on Saturday," and yet only one year ago a member of the same Seventh-day Adventist Church to which Mr. Judefind belongs, was sent to jail by this same judge for wishing to rest on the Sabbath (Saturday) and demanding that right, when called before the court to give testimony on that day. The following dispatch published by the leading dailies of our county, in April 1892, will explain the case:—

> Chestertown, Md., April 26.—William E. Hubbard, son of John E. Hubbard, of Tidebeeter, is in jail here for contempt of court in refusing to testify on Saturday in a case brought by his father against another man. When called to the stand he said:—
>
> "Judge, it is no use to swear me; I will not testify. To-day is my Sabbath day, and although I know the Bible says, 'obey those in authority over you,' Peter says, 'obey God rather than man,' and as this is my Sabbath I refuse to be sworn."
>
> "Well," said the Judge, "I have been on the bench twenty-four years and I have never had a case of this kind, and, however true your quotation of Peter may be, the law says that we shall observe but one day as the Sabbath, and that is the day commonly called Sunday, and sir, you must either testify or go to jail."
>
> The young man still refused, and went to jail. He is a Seventh-day Adventist.

Let the impartial reader look at these two decisions of Judge Wickes and then answer if Sunday laws as interpreted by Judge Wickes are, or are not, subversive of religious liberty. Religious intolerance and bigotry are ruling even our courts, and seventh-day observers not only are denied their rights, but fail even to get protection on account of unjust and unconstitutional laws.

The Maryland Bill of Rights, ratified Sept. 18, 1867, which in Art. 36, declares: "No person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession or for his religious practice" is a dead letter as far as seventh-day keepers are concerned. In the face of the foregoing statement of facts how long can we expect even toleration to say nothing at all of rights?

The position of the judge that "working on Sunday is not a matter of creed or practice of any religious denomination; there certainly can not be a rule or practice making it obligatory to work on Sunday," is faulty. Seventh-day observers claim that Sunday, as a religious day is of heathen origin introduced into Christendom by the Roman Catholic Church as a mark of its authority. In a Catholic work entitled "Plain Talk about Protestantism of To-day," on page 213, that church says:—

> The observance of Sunday by Protestants is an homage they pay to spite of themselves to the authority of the [Catholic] Church.

In a letter to the writer, Cardinal Gibbons, through his secretary, said:—

> The Catholic Church changed the day of rest from the last to the first day of the week, because the most memorable of Christ's works were accomplished on Sunday. It is needless for me to enter into any elaborate proof of the matter. They can not prove their point from Scripture; therefore, if sincere, they must acknowledge that they draw their observance of the Sunday from tradition, and are therefore weekly contradicting themselves.

Father Enright, of Redemptorist College, Kansas City, Mo., in a letter to the writer, says:—

> Jan. 11, 1892.
>
> DEAR FRIEND:—I have repeatedly offered $1,000 to any one who can prove to me from the Bible alone that I am bound to keep Sunday holy. There is no such law in the Bible. It is a law of the holy Catholic Church alone. The Bible says, "Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day." The Catholic Church says: "No! By my divine power I abolish the Sabbath day, and command you to keep holy the first day of the week." And, to the entire civilized world bows down in reverent obedience to the command of the holy Catholic Church.

> Yours respectfully,

Resting is an act of worship; in 2. Chron. 36:21, we read, "As long as she [the land] lay desolate [or idle] she kept Sabbath."

By refraining from work on Sunday we virtually acknowledge its sanctity and conform to the laws of an opposing religion. Paul says in Rom. 6:16: "Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?" Now if we obey the laws of Sunday are we not obeying the power that instituted or introduced the observance of the day? And if that power be the Catholic Church, as both Bible and history show, are we not yielding ourselves servants to the Catholic Church? I ask then how can we rest on that day holding the position we do?

More than this, the Sabbath commandment says, "Six days shalt thou labor;" and Eze. 46:1, shows there are "six working days" recognized by the Lord in his Word. Now if we rest one day we are bound to, and have a God-given right to, work six days. And if we observe the Bible Sabbath, how can we be in harmony with the Bible unless we do work six days which must include Sunday the first day of the week?

It is evident that Sunday laws are religious laws, and as such oppressive. Persecution is what we can expect. It is useless to fight technicalities in points of law, as prejudice and bigotry are stronger than the law. We have a higher court of appeals.

Every lover of liberty should become a student of prophecy, and read in the blazing headlight of God's Word the events as they occur before us, especially should we study Revelations 13th and 14th chapters, and become so well acquainted with the Lord and his Word, that we shall be able to stand the trials and persecutions just before us.
