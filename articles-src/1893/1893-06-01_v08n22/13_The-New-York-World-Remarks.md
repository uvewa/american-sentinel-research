The *New York World* remarks that "the religious bodies which threaten to withdraw their exhibits from the World's Fair if the people who wish to are not permitted to so on Sundays, have a very superficial apprehension of the real value of their display, in its net lawful to be good on the Sabbath day by which their every exhibit is seen.

There is one exhibit which these men would do well to withdraw—it is in fact the exhibition of their seventeenth century methods."
