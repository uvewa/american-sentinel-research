THE New York World remarks that "the religious bodies which threaten to 'withdraw their exhibit' from the World's Fair if the people who wish to see it are permitted to do so on Sunday, can not have a very high appreciation of the moral value of their display. Is it not lawful to do good on the Sabbath day? There is one exhibit which those men would do well to withdraw, and that is the exhibition of their seventeenth century bigotry and intolerance."
