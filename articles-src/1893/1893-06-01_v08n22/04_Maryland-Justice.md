READERS of the SENTINEL know that W. J. Judefind, a conscientious observer of the day the seventh-day Sabbath and an upright citizen, is now serving out a thirty days' sentence in the Chestertown, Kent County, Maryland, jail. He went about his usual work on Sunday, after his rest near his home on Sunday. They arrested him. He is a member of the Seventh-day Adventist, living on Kent Island, Queen Anne's County, Md.

He was arrested for plowing on Sunday, and fined $5 and costs by the justice. He appealed his case to the Circuit Court for Kent County, where it was tried, with Judge Robinson presiding. The report of the case is as follows:—

The State *vs.* Mr. Baker's case was continued till the November term in the Court at Centreville, where a judgment since the Judefind case could be appealed only to the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland.

They say last week he saw a man, and one that was on the train between Centreville and Millington, Md. I asked some one, and one bearing the same name, and asked that I had been hit at Centreville, if he were the Judefind that had been arrested. He immediately asked if Judefind was working on Sunday. But replied, and I said, such was the case to be excitedly exclaimed:

"That's right! I'm so glad to be, the ruin of the insignificant sect who believe such silly nonsense shouldn't be allow to exist." Thus from the he went on in a rapid manner to say that first there was no law, to then appeal to these cases, that the Sunday law did not relate to any religious question, and that the commissioners of it was doing it because it was enforced.—"If Sabbatarians and others had not been there to say nothing of common courtesy, that Judge Wickes is a man who aims to holding a high judicial office. I learned the Judge that I did not wish to make with him in reference to which day is the Sabbath, or on any religious question, but that I thought he should consider the law involved before he rendered such a sweeping decision. I stated that Seventh-Day Adventist could not refrain from common labor on Sunday without doing violence to conscience. The law was in the interest of a church dogma and could not be enforced against us without destroying the very distinction between the civil and religious department between the Sabbath and other days.

"I told him that we did not endeavor on our part, but that they expected the position of the command to which: 'Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work,' was an imperative, that they could not regularly refrain from work on some day which was not the Sabbath, the penalty of the civil law for disobedience was death itself. This only pressed the Judge more than this. I told the Judge, for their foolishness, and he answered that this was his view of the matter at all. I required him to apply the Constitution of Maryland to all other men, and reminded him that their rights were just as much as men of any other denomination. It has never been my understanding of religious liberty than the one holding. And that when the case could go to the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the State, it would test the whole matter. And therefore we would be here again waiting for those that will not obey any provision the law imposes.

By the daily mail occurring it is to see whether our sightless or injustice of the persecution of this man. Some recent papers have laws closing the liquor saloons on Sunday in full force. The Supreme Court has already said, "Let the church be the church," and State courts stand ready to interpret the weapons of the Church: to every one that they are not afraid to be told what the Sabbath-keeping believers of the law prove. "It shall be unlawful for any person, etc." The motive that is unfulfilled, and the spirit itself is absent in itself; not of the message of the Lord, and a warning of Rev. 14: 9-13 against the very heart of objects of persecution.

The principles that in case of every true citizen, and of every patriot the strength of his nation is an object that he loves truth and honor more than personal ease or safety. If, then, the character of government determines the strength the hands of those who wield the power of the nation?

The Bill of Rights, included in the United States Constitution says:—

No person caught, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practice, and shall be directed as far as answerable for any lawful behavior; and what are not to the interference of facts how long can these provisions of the of the rights of Marylanders be ignored?

The people of the judge that "works out," or uses, or practice of any religion or religious denomination.

Yet a statute making it obligatory to refrain from working on Sunday, and every positive making it obligatory to work on "any other day of the week" claimed claim that Sunday, as a religious institution, is not embodied in that "Plain Talk with our Protestant Friends," published by the Roman Catholic Church, to in a small entitled "Plain Talk with our Protestant Friends."

The closing of Pentarchy to Protestants on the score of conscience to be to then to carry to work in spite of themselves the of a church or political association.

In a letter to the writer, under date of April 20, from Chestertown, Md., Mr. Judefind says:—

The Catholic Church changed the day of rest from the seventh to the first day. The Protestant churches keep the first day, and this through tradition of the Catholic Church, from a three point from Scripture; therefore, of them—in the observance of Sunday and the Church, do we accept the authority of the Catholic Church?

How long shall Marylanders keep their eyes closed to what is going on in their midst?
