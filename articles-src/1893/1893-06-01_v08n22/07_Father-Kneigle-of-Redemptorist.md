FATHER KNEIGLE, of Redemptorist, Kansas City, Mo., in a letter to the *Star,* says:—

DEAR FRIEND—I have repeatedly said, and I wish to say once more that my position is this: I am not bound to keep Sunday holy. The obligation to keep it rests entirely upon tradition, and not upon the Bible. I have repeatedly said that those who keep holy the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, are the only consistent Christians. But in doing so I am also most consistent, for I hold that tradition is equally with the Bible the word of God. And, let the friends of Sunday law take notice, the commandment, as contained in the Decalogue, reads: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy." "Six days shalt thou labor," etc. And this, as we all know, means in the connection, Sabbath day, i.e., Saturday. And, let the friends of Sunday take notice, the reason why we observe Sunday instead of Saturday is to be found in the action of the Catholic Church which changed the day of rest from the seventh to the first day. The Protestant churches keep the first day, and this through tradition of the Catholic Church, not from a three point from Scripture; therefore, of them—in the observance of Sunday, do we accept the authority of the Catholic Church?

FATHER KNEIGLE,
Kansas City, Mo.
