A book entitled, "Woman of the World;" sub-title, "With a Search Light of Epigram," by Mrs. Alethe L. Craig, has recently come to our table. It is a collection of the names of many of the prominent women of the ages, and the date of their birth. Their historical characters are indicated either by epigrams from their own writings or from some other author. This work is valuable as a book of reference. It is neatly bound in white and gold, contains 191 pages, uncut edges. Price $1.00. Published by the press of H. W. Dick and Co., Baltimore, Md.
