REFERRING to the proceedings of the World's Fair on the first Sunday after its formal opening, the New York Mail and Express of May 10, comes out with the blazing heading on the first page, "The Sabbath Was Observed;" and after stating that the closing rule was rigidly enforced against all visitors, goes on to say that the Duke of Veragua, his family and suite, after attending mass in the morning, went to Buffalo Bill's performance on the outside of the gates, and sat through the whole performance. If the Mail and Express thinks this was observing the Sabbath, and persists in compelling such observance, in order to be consistent, it would better employ Buffalo Bill to entertain the visitors who are shut out of the Fair, lest they patronize the saloons and other harmful places. Let us see what is implied in its statement that the Sabbath was observed. It means that if those visitors had been permitted to attend the Fair and had done so, the Sabbath would have been broken and not observed. Hence that idea of the proper observance of the Sabbath is simply non-attendance at the Fair, and this a compulsory non-attendance. In the first place, the simple staying away from the Fair is not observing the Sabbath, much less a compulsory staying away. In the second place, if simple absence from the Fair is considered as observance of the Sabbath, it must prescribe also what the visitors who are shut out shall or shall not do on the outside of the Fair. In the third place, Sunday is not the Sabbath at all; there is no sacredness or holiness connected with it, and there could not be such a thing as the Sabbath being properly observed on that day.

The facts are that even if Sunday were the Sabbath, and the Duke of Veragua and his suite had stayed at mass all day, or sat in their church pews all day, or attended any religious services or performed any religious duty, and had done so because they could not get into the Fair, they would not have come any nearer the proper observance of the Sabbath than they did by attending Buffalo Bill's performance, or than they would had they spent the day at the Fair.

Further, even if it were possible and right to compel the observance of the Sabbath by law, the advocates of such legislation would still fall short of their object because of their mistaken idea of the nature of the Sabbath. In another article, in the same paper, speaking of this closing of the gates, it is said, "It was a great moral victory, and demonstrated the love of the American people for the Sabbath as a day of rest." While it is proper to speak of the Sabbath as a "day of rest," it is not such in the sense that is evidently meant by this expression. The rest of the Sabbath is a spiritual rest, not physical; and while it may not exclude the latter, its design is for spiritual refreshment. How is the law going to give any one spiritual refreshment by shutting them out of the World's Fair? How can the State do it by any other act or series of acts? But this the State must do if it can compel the observance of the Sabbath. The absurdity of attempting such a thing is at once evident. It is a recognized rule in civil government that the sovereignty may not attempt action beyond its own capacity for governing. This precludes the possibility of compulsory Sabbath observance, even if it were right.

The same principle applies in the idea of the State gaining a "moral victory." The State can not enter the field of morality as such. It may legislate on some matters which, from the Christian's point of view are moral questions, not because they are moral, but because civil rights are involved, which must be protected in order that the State may fulfill the object for which it exists—to serve and not to rule.

Again, the sovereign authority must cover the whole of its jurisdiction, and every part of the whole; otherwise it immediately degrades itself into class legislation, the injustice of which every one will acknowledge. But in allowing the guards at the gates to act in their official capacity on Sunday, and the employés to carry on their work inside the gates, this very principle is involved. The enforcement of the law was confined to a certain class called "visitors."

Further, it has been decided by the supreme authority of the land that this is a Christian Nation. If deciding or declaring it so makes it so, what need is there of further legislation in the matter, and what is the use of telling Christians they shall or shall not do this or that? It not only gives the lie to the declaration, but brings in a sort of cumulative legislation.

In the same issue of the Mail and Express there is a more passing notice of the imprisonment of a seventh-day observer in Chestertown, Md., in which it calls said person "A violator of the Sabbath law." Saying nothing about this law not being a Sabbath, but a Sunday, law, the State again had to distinguish between what constituted Sabbath-observance and what Sabbath-breaking; namely, issuing and serving a warrant (which was done on Sunday in this case) is Sabbath-observance, and husking corn for an honest living (the prisoner's offense (?)), Sabbath-breaking. Where is the equality in freedom?
