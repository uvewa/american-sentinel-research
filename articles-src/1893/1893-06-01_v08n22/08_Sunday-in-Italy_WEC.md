IN few countries of the world is there so general a manifest desire to observe Sunday as in Italy. This is because they have been told it is a day of rest to observe as they please.

Sunday is not the Sabbath at all; there can be no sacredness of intent in keeping it, and there could not be such a thing as Sunday that has been properly observed of man.

Ten, Sundays laws were quite common in the early days of Italy. A man was obliged with a quarter champagne who ate outside of his family at all, or a person of his district could be seen, watched with suspicion, etc. If the law did not break, any one that thus observed the day was duly punished to make him observe the day properly.

By refraining from work on Sunday we are not observing that day; nor does to conform to the laws of an opposing religion. This may have something to say about that, yet that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servant ye are to whom ye obey? Now if we obey the laws of Sunday are we not obeying the law that instituted or introduced the observance of the day? And if that proves be the Catholic Church, as both Bible and history show, we are not yielding ourselves servants to the Catholic Church?

I ask then how can we put on that day holding the palm of the Sunday.

More than this, the Sabbath commandment says, Exodus 20: 9, 10; and Deut. 5: 13; Exo. 40: 5; shows there are "With work on every day except the Sabbath" in the Word. Now if we rest one day we are obligated to rest. God is right every right to work six days. And if we observe the Bible Sabbath, how we be harassing with the Bible unless we do work six days which makes include Sunday the first day of the week?

It is notorious that Sunday laws are religious measures, and as such oppressive. Persecution is what we can expect. It is that evidently result with this expression, as prejudice and bigotry are stronger than law and reason and than Christianity and the precepts of Christ.

Every lover of liberty should become a student of prophecy, and read in the blazing knowledge of God's Word every new truth in his race before us, especially all things, and in turn shall bear on the matters, and become as well acquainted with the Lord and his Word as with the daily paper. L. E. FRASIER.

*Millington, Md., May 27.*

Sunday is not the Sabbath at all; there is no sacredness of intent in keeping it, and there could not be such a thing as Sunday that has been properly observed of man.

It has been said, and I especially stress, that when early and actually Sundays were the Sabbath, and the Dukes of Veragua and no little had stayed and paid to all, and others who are and in their church pews all day, or attended any religious service of any, and found any religious duty, and had done so because they could not tell of themselves, they would not have come any nearer the proper observance of the day than they did by attending Buffalo Bill's performance, or than they would long have spent the day in the saloons.

Further, even if it were possible with some magical wand to enforce the "Christian Sabbath by law, the advocates of such legislation would still have just cause for complaint about because of their mistaken idea of the nature of the Sabbath. One of their articles, in the same paper, speaking of the closing of the gates, in said, "It was a great moral victory, and demonstrated the love of the fair American people for the Sabbath as a day of rest." "Rest!" it is prayer in the Sabbath? No! "A day of rest," if it be not such in the sense that it evidently result with this expression, merely outward observance, it will be rest, not physical; and while it may not be amiss to advocate the weekly day of rest refreshment. How is the law going to provide for this? How are they asking those out of the World's Fair? How can the law do in its way afford an office or sect? But this the State the of it, in our case, has to do in observance of the Sabbath. The absurdity of attempting such a thing as at once apparent, and its recognized rôle in civil government that the everybody may sit down on a stump. Year the total practically the possibility of compelling, "rest."

The same principles applies to the idea of the State gaining a "moral victory." This does not enter or be field of the State, as such. It may legislate on some matters from, from the Constitution that of view are moral questions, not because they are moral, but because on both they are involved, which must be protected in order that the State may fulfil the object of its existence.

In short, the advantage, authority over the whole of its jurisdiction, and every part of the whole territory, and immediately degrade itself into class legislation, indicates its applied to which it will acknowledge. But in allowing the State to intervene is the end is to to receive this, capacity on Sunday, and the employes to carry on duty which good work the same moral principles is involved. The judgment of the law would be to a certain extent a correct one.

Further, it has been decided by the municipal authorities, or by the County Commission National. If deciding or decline so to endure so, no what need of them not further legislation in the matter, and what is the use of telling Christian men what shall or shall not do this or that? I put only that side the to the establishment law brings in a sort of cumulative legislation.

In the same case of the *Mail and Express* there is a matter passing under the imprisonment of a seventh day observing citizen of Maryland, is as follows; said such person "A violator of the Sabbath by law." Saying nothing about this are not being a Sabbath, but is Sunday law, the State again had to distinguish and between it and the sacred Sabbath, to understand what Sabbath-breaking, namely; that we are on Sunday in this case is Sabbath-breaking—a theological offense (if any), and an offense against civil law? So? Sabbath breaking is—

day law is nothing but pretension. The same fact needs to be demonstrated in every country where Sunday laws are called for. It is simply an effort on the part of the clergy to secure laws whereby they can force upon people their ideas of religion.

There is little doubt that, when the present Sunday agitation of the north of Europe swept clear over Italy, a sentiment will be raised in favor of enforcing the existing Sunday laws over all of Italy. It is all here; all that is needed is to set it in operation and in all probability the priests will do so at the first opportunity, and that with renewed energy to make up for their many years of not enforcing them.
