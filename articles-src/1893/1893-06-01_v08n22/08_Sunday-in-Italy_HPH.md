In few countries of Europe the people in general manifest so little interest for Sunday as in Italy. This is because they are left comparatively free to use the day as they please.

During the papal government it was not so. Then, Sunday laws were quite strictly enforced. Each district was supplied with a *guarde champêtre* who, stationed on a tower from which every part of his district could be seen, watched with spy-glass the movements of the people. Any one thus observed laboring on Sunday was reported to the authorities and duly punished to make him more religious.

In cases of real or supposed necessity permission to work on Sunday could be obtained from the priest. This fact expresses much concerning the Papacy and the nature of Sunday. The granting of permission to work on Sunday is on the same basis as the giving of indulgences. By this course the Papacy takes the place of God and even exalts itself above God, for it declares that working on Sunday is sin, and at the same time gives permission to work on this day, and then it is not sin. Thus one and the same thing is sin or not sin, according to the will of the priest. With God sin is always sin. He can not absolve a man at one time from the same sin for which he would punish him at another. Thus it is plain that the Papacy exalts itself above God by assuming to do what he can not do and be righteous. Furthermore, in the case of giving permission to work on Sunday, it is not the *action* of the individual, but the *will of the priest* that makes the accused guilty of sin. This reveals the true nature of Sunday,—it is but an institution for exercising tyranny by one set of men over their fellows. Herein, the Sunday institution expresses the essence of the Papacy,—denying to men the liberty of the gospel, and subjecting them to the spiritual tyranny of man,—and hence it is fitly called its *mark*.

Did the strict enforcing of the Sunday laws make the people better, begetting within them love and reverence for the day? Not in the least; but we see in Italy just what must always result from forced observance of any religious institution. As soon as the papal rule was overthrown, and the legal restrictions removed leaving the people free to act out what was in their hearts they manifest even less regard for Sunday than if they had not been forced to keep it.

Another point worthy of note in the experience of Italy is the fact that the same Sunday laws are still on the statute books, but they are practically a dead letter. Why so? Because the priests have not power to enforce them; left to themselves the people care nothing about these laws, but leave every one to do as he pleases on Sunday. This shows that the life of Sunday laws is nothing but priestcraft. The same fact seems to be demonstrated in every country where Sunday laws are called for, it is simply an effort on the part of the clergy to secure laws whereby they can force upon people their ideas of religion.

There is little doubt that when the present Sunday agitations of the north of Europe sweep down over Italy, a sentiment will be raised in favor of enforcing the existing Sunday laws. The machinery is all here; all that is needed is to set it in operation and in all probability the priests will do so at the first opportunity, and that with renewed energy to make up for lost time.
