*A Correspondent Who Believes in Their Absolute Divorcement.*

HUMAN law is designed to prevent one human being from injuring another. Hence, so far as the State is concerned, a man has a right to do any thing he sees fit to do, so long as he does not interfere with the rights of any one else. I can not even on my own premises deprive any citizen of pure air to breathe, who lives joining me, by erecting a slaughter house, a huge hog pen, or anything calculated to create a stench that will be detrimental to my neighbor or to the community. I have no right to fence up a traveled road leaving no way to get round, neither can I buy land all round my neighbor and thus keep him in or out of place. I can not keep a railroad from crossing my land, because it is a public highway. If I am keeping a public place, as a store, hotel, or post-office, I have no right to prevent (by violence or otherwise) any one from coming in and transacting any business in my line. If I do I am violating the rights of others and destroying our law of liberty. So long as a man is not interfering with my rights, and doing that which deprives me of the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," he has a perfect right to do as he pleases. And when any individual or community undertakes to make any one do that which he does not want to do, or to leave undone that which he wants to do, when the doing or not doing the thing proposed would not interfere with the privileges of any other person or persons, that individual or community is transgressing the law of personal freedom.

I here affirm that all attempts to enforce divine law, in any way, by civil enactments, is a step toward the union of Church and State, and is destructive of personal liberty; I also affirm, that the effort of the National Reformers is to compel men everywhere, rich and poor, bond and free, male and female, to rest on the first day of the week or Sunday, which is, if an obligation at all, a Christian obligation the same as to pray, to repent, to partake of the Lord's Supper, or to be baptized, therefore any attempt to compel men to observe that day as a day of rest is a union of Church and State, clear and unmistakable, and is as much against the Constitution of the United States, and personal liberty as it would be to pass a law that every one must be baptized and become a member of the Christian Church. A man is in no way infringing on my rights by working on Sunday, for he does not attempt to make me do so, and if I am worshiping God, as I ought to be, the fact of his being at work would in no way interfere with my right to worship God any more than my worshiping God would interfere with his right to work. By working he does not interfere with my right to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," while if I or the community, attempt to compel him to refrain from labor on Sunday, we are depriving him of both liberty and the right to the pursuit of happiness, and have laid the foundation for the "rack" and "gibbet" in the United States.—Carey Smith, in the People's Call, Wash.
