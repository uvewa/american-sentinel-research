The Signs of the Times, an Adventist paper published in California, has this to say about intolerance in Michigan: "The editor of the Christian Sabbath Watchman, published at Detroit, Mich., wants the State to pass a law prohibiting Seventh-day Adventist canvassers from pursuing their occupation. Many people will look upon such a purpose as an absurd expectation, but they will see more radical measures than that find place in the statute books of some of the States before many years. The air is full of that spirit now, and it will soon settle down."
