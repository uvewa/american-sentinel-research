When the "Century Dictionary" was published, and immediately those words were to be noted, as "Sabbatarian," and on nothing more was to be expected, the "Standard," soon to be published by Frank & Wagnalls, New York, will probably be in the same moral in respect to all other definitions under the letter "A" the "Stantest;" also, in Will M. Glenn's "The Century" and it to more uses than "Wisk" the Century and to more uses "International," now also being published by Frank & Wagnalls, New York, found in other dictionaries have as especially valuable features of the "Century" and "Standard Dictionaries," and Fanny Bixby."
