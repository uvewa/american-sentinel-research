## Chicago Correspondence.

THE SENTINEL has several times said that the agitation of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair would not cease at the opening of the Fair. The third Sunday of the Fair has now passed and the matter is farther than ever from an amicable or peaceable settlement.

The courts have been appealed to; the opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States has been asked and obtained. The clergy have given expression to their opinions even more generally than before. The subject has received the notice of the press almost universally throughout the country, and the people are becoming roused, especially in the city of Chicago. Violent and incendiary talk is beginning to be heard. This is not surprising. The clergymen, the National Commissioners, and the Attorney-General of the United States have set them the example in that particular; certainly the people can scarcely be blamed for following the lead of such distinguished authority.

The farther the legal aspects of the case are investigated the deeper in the mire of unconstitutionality and improper governmental interference does the whole matter sink.

The Board of Directors and the National Commission are in hopeless antagonism.* The directors, representing the stockholders of the World's Fair, the money interest involved, the people, the municipality of Chicago, and the State of Illinois, have determined to open the Fair on the remaining Sundays of its continuance. The National Commission, an advisory organization created by act of Congress, is determined that the congressional Sunday-closing proviso shall take effect at all hazards. The National Commission virtually denies entirely the authority of the Board of Directors, and at a meeting of the commission one of its members used the following language:—

> "I know—and I do not fear contradiction in any court in the country—that that corporation [the Local Directory] has no more power in this park, absolutely no more authority within the limits of the territory that was tendered and dedicated by this commission as a site for this Fair, than an Indian in the Rocky Mountains. And for these gentlemen, or anybody, I do not care whether he be a Sabbatarian or an open Sunday man, to assume that a member of this body, whatever his convictions may be, can be so unmanly or recreant to the sworn duty imposed upon him as to stand by and permit a stranger to take possession of the Government's tenements, I hold it in outrage upon the judgment, the good sense, and the integrity of every commissioner here. (Applause.)
>
> I believe as sincerely as I know that I now live, that there can be no exception in this case to the general rule that obtains in this country, and has always obtained since the Constitution of the United States was adopted and legislation on the part of Congress followed and flowed from it, that the army of the Government always stands ready, and is ready, under the direction of the chief executive, to maintain the dignity and integrity of the country. (Applause.)

*After this was written a mere quorum of the National Commission virtually agreed by a vote of 20 to 27 to leave the question of Sunday opening to the Local Directory. If this action stands and the courts do not interfere it means an open Fair. —Ed.

The National Commission is upheld in its assumption of superior authority as is shown by a generally published interview of the secretary of the United Society of Christian Endeavor with Attorney-General Olney, at Washington, in which he is reported as saying that the Government would see that the law was enforced in case the National Commission should, at any time, decide to open the gates on Sunday. This, if it properly represents the Attorney-General, shows that he considers the Sunday-closing proviso attached to the souvenir appropriation not as a special condition attached to an appropriation but as a mandatory statute. That this should be so is in complete keeping with the entire history of the growth of religious law in this country. There is no law on the statute books enforcing the observance of Sunday or any other religious tenet, and no religious precedent in the law reports, which has not been put there through some indirection, more or less apparent.

Another legal phase of the question is embodied in a bill, filed by ex-Congressman Wm. E. Mason as attorney for Arthur Clingman, a citizen of Chicago, representing stock in the Columbian Exposition to the amount of $100,000, praying for an injunction restraining the Board of Directors of the Exposition and the park commissioners from excluding the people from the public park, in which the Exposition is, on Sundays. The plea is made that the act of Congress under which this is done is unconstitutional, conflicting with the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and in interference with Art. 8, Sec. 3 of the constitution of the State of Illinois. This clause of the State constitution recites, "that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship." The contention is made that this Sunday-closing proviso does give a preference to an accepted mode of worship, and is therefore an abridgment of constitutional right, and consequently the act of Congress, so far as the Sunday-closing proviso is concerned, is null and void. So far, the hearing of this case has been postponed from time to time awaiting the action of the directors and of the National Commission upon the subject, the judge expressing the hope that the question would soon be authoritatively decided by these bodies. Counsel for third parties, representing the American Sabbath Union, has asked to be permitted to intervene in this case but the petition has not yet been granted. A special plea to be made by the counsel for the American Sabbath Union, if he should obtain a hearing, will be that as Congress specifically appropriated 5,000,000 of souvenir half dollars, therefore, the return of the appropriation would necessitate a specific performance and the refunding of the identical souvenir coins received. The language of the section appropriating the souvenir coins and the accompanying debate would seem to make it doubtful whether such a special plea would hold, for in the Congressional Record of July 10, on the presentation of this sectire of the Civil Sundry bill, in the Senate Mr. Allison said, in reply to a question from Mr. Palmer, that:—

> The language intended to cover the character of the coins is found, beginning in line 11, after the word "treasury":
>
> "Which coins shall be of the same weight and fineness and have in all other respects the same quality as the silver half dollar now authorized by law."
>
> If there is any other language that can be added to that which will give to these half dollars the qualities that other half dollars possess, I should like to have it suggested to me.

MR. PALMER.—I am not expressing my own doubts.

MR. ALLISON.—I understand; but it seems to me this question is absolutely clear. These half dollars by this law become a legal tender as all other half dollars are now and they are to have on them substantially the same superscription, to wit, that it is a half dollar, and I suppose the usual surroundings, etc., of a half dollar.

If it is true that these souvenir half dollars became a legal tender as all other half dollars and with the usual surroundings of an ordinary half dollar, Congress can not refuse to receive any other legal tender half dollar in lieu of them and this special plea of specific performance in the return of the individual souvenir half dollars, would fail. Another claim that is likely to be made is, that the Sunday-closing proviso is attached not only to the appropriation of 5,000,000 souvenir half dollars but also to all other appropriations or donations made by the United States towards the Exposition. It is not easy to see how such a plea as this can hold in the face of the fact that appropriations had been made by Congress previous to the 5,000,000 half dollar appropriation and the adoption of the Sunday-closing proviso. Congress can not, legally, any more than a private individual, attach or post facto conditions to gifts or appropriations. If appropriations were made by Congress and accepted by the World's Fair authorities previous to the passage of this Sunday-closing proviso, Congress could not give the Sunday-closing provision a retroactive effect, and condition previously made appropriations upon the Sunday closing of the Fair.

Two conflicting reports have been made to the National Commission by its Judiciary Committee, to whom the resolution for Sunday opening was referred. Of the five members of the committee, three reported against Sunday opening and two in favor. The majority report considers the question at length, but the point of the whole matter rests in the fact that it is the mandate of Congress that the Fair shall be closed on Sundays, and the commissioners being a national body created by Congress, have no authority outside of Congress, and are compelled to carry out its behests. It is interesting to see what the outgrowth of this pretendedly harmless proviso for Sunday closing has been. It is now openly declared to be a statute of the supreme Government and a mandate of Congress. Although not so stated in this report, the commissioners have even gone so far as to say that the World's Fair Directory, having received the appropriation and accepted the proviso, have now no right to recede from that position even by the return of the amount appropriated, but must now necessarily proceed with the Fair under a Sunday-closing regime. The minority report, to which the names of Commissioners J. W. St. Clair, of West Virginia, and J. R. Burton, of Kansas, are attached, is in favor of the opening of the gates of the Exposition on Sunday because it is believed "to be for the best interests of the Exposition and the public." The opinion is given that the withholding by Congress of $575,880 of the appropriation was a breach of faith on the part of Congress sufficient to release the World's Fair authorities from their obligations as regards the Sunday-closing proviso. It is further said that "it is a very much mooted question whether or not Congress had the power, under the Constitution of the United States, to prohibit the opening of the gates of the Exposition on Sunday, as provided in the souvenir coin act." What conclusion the discussion of these two reports may bring forth it is impossible to foretell.

That which can be seen in this matter is that the central Government has assumed to itself unwarrantable powers such as have never before been attempted to be exercised in the history of the United States, and it can be foreseen that the outcome of it is to be extremely serious.
