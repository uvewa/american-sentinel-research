"SEPTEMBER 2," says the Catholic Review, "has been fixed by the World's Fair committee on ceremonies as the date for the Catholic Education Day. Festival Hall, so we are told, has been engaged for a celebration from 9 A. M. until noon. The ceremonies will be carried on under the direction of Bishop Spalding. Archbishop Feehan will preside. Among the addresses will be one by Archbishop Ryan, of Philadelphia." It will be a great day for Catholics, and for a certain class of "Protestants" as it will afford them a conspicuous opportunity for displaying their flunkyism.
