The United States, though the youngest of the great nations of the world, occupies a conspicuous place in history; but has it a place in prophecy, which has been defined as, "history in advance"? Many men have thought so. There is in the early part of the eighteenth century, Bishop Berkeley wrote the words so often quoted:—

Westward the course of empire takes its way.

But this is only a portion of that which the Bishop wrote, though the remainder of the stanza is seldom quoted. The entire reads thus:—

Westward the course of empire takes its way;
The first four acts already past,
A fifth shall end the drama with the day,
Time's noblest offspring is the last.

The first "act" was the kingdom of Babylon, as shown in the second and in the seventh chapters of Daniel, represented in Dan. 2 by the golden head of the image, and in Dan. 7 by the lion. It was prophesied of that great empire, "Thou art this head of gold," that the lion had the eagle's wings, and "they lifted it up from the earth as an individual," representing the Babylonian empire over the first four peoples. "And after thee shall rise another kingdom inferior to thee." To the expression, "another kingdom," there that the kingdom and not the king was represented by the head of gold. The same power is again introduced in the seventh chapter of Daniel under the figure of a lion having eagle's wings.

The second "act" was the Medo-Persian empire. In the vision of the 8th chapter, which overthrew Babylon and became the second of "the four universal empires." In the seventh chapter of Daniel this power is represented by a bear which raised itself up on one side, allowing the ascendency of the Persian element.

The third "act" or the third of the so-called universal empires—the third in brass, or arms stormy, visible, under Alexander—

stamped it in the seventh chapter of Daniel, and the fourth beast, terrible as a "leopard," which had upon the back of it four wings and four heads, denoting the celerity of its movement.

The fourth and last of the universal empires,—the Bishop's fourth "act,"— was Rome, whose origin under a decree just prior to the birth of Christ, "that all the world should be taxed." Like it, in the second chapter of Daniel, Rome, in its undivided state, is represented by the "legs of iron," and in its divided state, by "the part of iron and part of clay." In the seventh chapter, it appears first symbolized by "a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly."

And it had ten horns." Verse 7.

The ten horns of the seventh verse, were in the fourth, twenty-fourth verse, and to represent ten kings (or kingdoms) that were to arise out the of the fourth kingdom. And which did subsequently occupy the territory once ruled by Rome. We are also told in verse twenty-four that there should arise another horn, which should be diverse from the others and should subdue or uproot three of them. This power is thus described in verse 25: "And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time."

THE PAPACY—ITS POWER.

The power thus described, Protestants believe to be the Papacy. The claim comes out of "the saints of the Most High." Is it not "a big warning protesting" spread out by the Papal Church against all dissenters, which outlasted for centuries and is going on as papist themselves admit, over fifty millions of so-called heretics presided.

"A time and times in the prophecy," of the prophecy will be; the prophetic "a time and times and the dividing of time" and the same as the "twelve hundred and sixty years. A time with half of the third century over; and the dividing of time" would be three years and a half. A Jewish year was twelve months of thirty days each—hence three one and half years would be just twelve hundred and sixty days. But as kingdoms are represented in the prophecy, it is a time of their extinction. The key is given in Numbers 14:34, and Ezek. 4:6, "I have appointed thee each day for a year:" "each day for a year." The correctness of this rule might be demonstrated by prophecies concerning Christ's first advent, and their fulfillment; but, being already acknowledged on all hands by all students of the prophecy: we shall, therefore, for the purpose of this examination, take it as accepted.

As stated in an article in these columns last week, the Papacy was far from a growth. The text "papacy" is from the latin, papa, meaning father. A father claims the right of discipline and control over his family, but the Church was to recognize no such authority, for Christ said, the Lord Jesus Christ, "Said the Saviour: In my name come, there Christ, and all ye are brethren. And call no man father upon the earth: for one is your Father which is in heaven." But notwithstanding this explicit prohibition, the elders, or bishops (simply two names for the same office), of the church, early assumed a title which does not properly belong to them, to claim in the church the same authority as is exercised by a father in his family, and every family authority than this. The result was finally that the Bishop, or elder, of the church of Rome—the Bishop of Rome in the papal chair, claimed all this authority.

It was in A. D. 533 that Justinian issued this decree declaring the Bishop of Rome head of the church and "corrector of heretics;" but it was not until five years later that the last of the three remaining powers that opposed the pretensions of the Pope was destroyed and driven from before Rome. From date, A. D. 538, for twelve hundred and sixty years, would bring to A. D. 1798. Then the power of the Papacy was practically and actually abolished by the French, the Pope himself being taken prisoner, according to the letter Dan. 7: 25.

It will be the last event, this temporary overthrow of the Papacy, that we have most particularly to do in this connection; in the thirteenth chapter of Revelation John says:—

And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

That is a description of papal Rome in the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, for there are given unto it the description and qualities of all the preceding empires, and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months; and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and power was given him over all kindred, and tongues, and nations.

That time mentioned here—forty-two months—of course is the same period of time as the "time and times and the dividing of time," and the same characteristics are brought to view also the same characteristics of the beast—blasphemy, war on the saints, philosophy and persecution. But this power was not to enjoy perpetual prosperity. In verse 10 we read: "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword."

Then when the Papacy was abolished by the French under General Berthier, and the Pope was taken prisoner, that was when he died. But immediately following the account of the death of the first power; he says: "And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon." This other beast, which is really a part of the papal beast, was attracting attention at that period of time? What nation was then coming up, growing up as a plant—which is the literal meaning of the expression? There can be but one answer.

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

The Old World at that time—when the East was occupied by peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues, and that they had been so occupied from time immemorial; therefore as the symbols which are directly connected with the beast representing the Roman power come from the principal parts of those countries; and as all the rest of the known parts of the world were also, at that time, occupied by established nations, we must of necessity look for the power to the Western Hemisphere. But not only was the Eastern Hemisphere occupied by the power represented by the first beast, so also were portions, just France, Spain, Portugal, and Holland had extensive possessions in the Eastern Empire, had by reason of the great time this United States was the only "independent government therefore not any nation not previously occupied by either of those governments therefore all this points up to the conclusion that the United States is the power in Revelation 13: 11.

But of course such a conclusion will not be drawn from this one consideration alone. There are other and more specific points to events showing that the nation here intended is the United States. The rising of the image to the Papacy, to being nearly that we understand the characteristics of the Papacy, for in order to make an image most resemble it. This Papacy is described in Revelation 13: 1-10, and 1 Tim. 1: 1 and onward. Dowling refers the reader to those two descriptions.

There is a remarkable passage in Tertullian's "Apology," written toward the close of the second century, not very long before the accomplishments of the purpose of the Papacy to put itself above the civil power, on "the universal acknowledgment of prayer," he says under a particular necessity of praying for the emperors. He thus states the relation of the civil power to the spiritual power which hangs over the world, and the connection of the great event which is apprehended for the Roman Empire. This is what he says, and particularly it may be noticed how completely it is a parallel of this:—

It is manifest from the extract from the writings of this Father that in the early centuries before the papal government was complete in any of these things the Christians had prayed with calamity in what is here alluded to by the writer. "The long and harrassing war of the Roman empire," which meant under the Roman emperors, continued, and notwithstanding the sufferings and persecutions, there was there uninterrupted toil and observance, throughout it the universal Maker was adored.

As it was the factor of civilization, of empire, and a power, was of more practical importance with respect to other purposes. The power of a nation is a matter of every true citizen, and to every patriot the strength of his nation is an object that he loves truth and honor more than personal ease or safety. If, then, the character of government determines the strength the hands of those who wield the power of the nation?

As appears from this testimony, the distinguishing feature of the Papacy is a union of the Church with civil power— of the Constitution and upon the religious rights of the citizens. In a word, it may be confidently predicted that the future enemies of this government against its religious character will promote conscience by combination, and, when it can be done, by legislation; just as we see going on under it, and the catastrophe of other nations before our eyes to-day.

Writing directly upon this point, Dowling says:—

It was owing to forgetfulness or disregard of this, most important principle, we may be sure, and not of the world, that the Emperor Constantine early in the fourth century, through a political or state expediency, it is true, from mixed motives at best, if not from sinister ones entirely in the beginning, it took the rights of Christ in the unchristian business of regulating religious opinions, and matters purely the civil and ecclesiastical interests of his empire, a course of so attempting souls and affairs of the Church.—P. 42.

The two principal faults or mistakes in taking the religion of Christ into "the established religion of the State" and the second, that of assuming to rule the Church nationally followed, indeed, this assumption on the part of the emperor was inevitable; having united Church and State, he, as emperor, must of necessity either control the Church, or allow the Church to control the State. And until and except both Church and State keep within their own respective spheres, each to fulfill its mission within its sphere, but when the two form a union, one or the other must rule and the other must be ruled.

POWER OF THE BISHOPS.

For the time of Constantine the bishops of the Church had gradually acquired such influence in the Roman Empire that civil power used them constantly to advance his own interest. In fact, it was largely because of this that if the Church's features were not exerted in his behalf it either to supplant, and, to a certain extent destroy it, he had to turn to it to know as—it required, to recall to him, Killen says, the following testimony:—

As early as the middle of the second century the bishopric, at least in some places, was entrusted to an individual who, in cases of emergencies, was expected to take the oversight of the churches, a large share of its revenues was appropriated to his personal use, and he was permitted, in both civil and ecclesiastical cases, to exercise functions of a judge. He was thus enabled to maintain a higher position than the other church officers, for he was at length regarded as the great fountain of church patronage. The more influential of these provincial bishops had, from a very early period, been known to the great officers of government, and to have occasional acquaintance with whatsoever personages when he declared that it would prove that the Church had power to make, and to unmake the civil authorities; that is to say they very officer of the Church denounced.

It is even so in our own country at the present time. There are religious combinations commercially and financially strong, and those who stand high in these to exercise a powerful influence in political affairs. What would, perhaps, not be dangerous were this influence exerted by each, acting separately, for the influence of one would neutralize that of another; nor is it so hurtful when exerted in the several distinct and and for this reason at least become dangerous. This fact was recognized; as early as last summer when the United States Senate on Post-offices and Post-roads, on considering a communication asking that the carrying of mails on Sundays be stopped. In that committee, Hon. Richard M. Johnson, chairman of the committee, submitted a report in which the following language occurred:—

Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of this committee, always dangerous. This first effort of this kind calls for the establishment of a principle, which, on the direction of the committee, would lay the foundation of that dangerous innovation into the spirit

I believe as sincerely as I know that I now live, that the religion of Christ has been, and in the opinion that obtains in this country, and has always been, its best and strongest shield and protection. The United States Government has always followed and flowed from it, that the army of the true friends of liberty and of the Christian religion will sustain the dignity and integrity of the country.

The National Commission is emphatic in its position. The majority report which was shown by a generally published interview between National Commissioner and Christian Endeavor with Attorney-General Olney, at Washington, in which it is reported as saying that the Government, as in any forum, the commission as to open the case the National Commission itself.

This, if it proceeds, will be of great interest. Attorney-General, shows a picture. The Sunday-closing advocates are looking to the account the appropriate act together in but a mandatory statute, and this to the constitution Congress, but the keeping with the entire history of the challenge of any of the rights of religious liberty, however the most exacting.

There is no law on the statute books enforcing the observance of Sunday of any other religious feast days; and religious testing has been put there through some influence that is not self-evidently right.

It has been embodied in a bill, filed by ex-Congressman Morse of Massachusetts, and introduced by Allen Clingman, a citizen of Chicago, calling upon the National Commission Exposition to the amount of $100,000, being a suit to recover damages, based upon a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Exposition and the National Commission excluding the people from the public park, in which the Fair buildings have been erected. It also claims that the act of Congress under which the Fair was held, when fairly construed, is conflicting with the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and in interference with the Constitution of the State of Illinois. Article 2, Section 3, is as follows:—

That no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.

With this it is not very difficult to see what the Sunday-closing proviso does give a preference, and is therefore, as a state, a Sunday and a church; an areligionist and a general railroad right, and acknowledged to be opposed to the Constitution, and of the congressional proviso, is null and void.

The press of the city is also discussing the matter, and it may be anticipated that what has been expressed from time to time the seeming disposition of the press. But the longer it has the stronger the discussion becomes upon the subject, the less likely does it appear that Sunday closing would soon be authoritatively decided by the courts to be constitutional. One way of representing the American Sabbath Union, has the permission to be heard in rebuttal before the courts, has not yet been granted. A special plea to the court was from the American Sabbath Union, if he should obtain a hearing, he would require a week or ten days approximately 3,000 of so-called authorities, there will likely be heard from all sides, thereto would necessarily a recapitulation of evidence in answer, it may be anticipated that several months will pass before an authoritative adjudicat result occurs received. The language of the section appropriating the souvenir coins and the accompanying debate would seem to make it doubtful

How such extensive religious combinations have been formed in this country and how they have worked and are still working to deliver over from disturbance or troubles, have been working on against trusting the Government, and, through the entire people, endeavored to get religious toleration, must be told in another article.
