READERS of the SENTINEL know that J. W. Judefind, a conscientious observer of the seventh-day Sabbath and an upright citizen, is now serving out a thirty days' sentence in the Chestertown, Kent County, Md., jail, for husking corn last fall near his house on Sunday. They also know that Isaac Baker, another Seventh-day Adventist, living on Kent Island, Queen Anne's County, Md., was recently arrested for plowing on Sunday, and fined $5 and costs by the magistrate. He appealed his case to the Circuit Court that convened at Centreville last month, with Judge Robinson presiding. On request of his counsel, James T. Ringgold, of the Baltimore Bar, Mr. Baker's case was continued till the November term in order that a decision of the Court of Appeals upon the Judefind case could be rendered. Since that time Governor Brown has appointed Judge Robinson chief judge of the Court of Appeals, for the State of Maryland.

One day last week as Judge Robinson was on the train between Centreville and Millington, Md., I introduced myself as one bearing the same name, and stated that I had seen him at Centreville when the Baker case was brought before him. He immediately asked if Judefind was still in jail; and when he learned that such was the case he excitedly exclaimed, "He ought to be there, and all the rest of the insignificant sect who believe such silly nonsense should be there with him!" From this he went on in a rapid manner to say that there was no use to take an appeal in these cases, that the Sunday law did not relate to any religious question, and that the conscience of no one suffered because it was enforced. I was astonished at the lack of candor and gravity, to say nothing of common courtesy, manifested in voice and manner by one holding a high judicial office. I assured the Judge that I did not wish to argue with him in reference to which day is the Sabbath, or on any theological question, but that I thought he should consider the principles involved before he rendered such a sweeping decision. I stated that Seventh-day Adventists could not refrain from common labor on Sunday without doing violence to conscience. The law was in the interest of a church dogma they did not believe and could not obey without destroying the very distinction God has made in the fourth commandment between the Sabbath and other days. I stated that it was not stubbornness on their part, but that they regarded the portion of the command which says, "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work," as imperative, and that they could not regularly refrain from work on another day than the seventh, even though the penalty of the civil law for disobedience was death itself. This only provoked a contemptuous sneer from the Judge, for their foolishness, and he asserted that conscience was not in the matter at all. I requested him to explain how he knew the conscience of other men, and reminded him that their rights were just as sacred to them as his were to himself. It has never been my misfortune to meet a man more devoid of the true idea of religious liberty than the one who now occupies the place of Chief Justice in the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the State. It seemed as though the stake and the faggot could again be seen waiting for those who will not obey the dictates of the Church when supported by the civil law.

In view of facts daily occurring it is plain to see whither our legislative and judicial branches of Government are drifting. Congress passes laws closing the World's Fair on Sunday to please the churches. The Supreme Court has already declared this to be a "Christian Nation," and State courts stand ready to inflict the dire vengeance of the law upon every one who does not submit to dishonor God and his own manhood. Surely the prophecy of Rev. 13: 11-17 is being fulfilled, and the papal spirit is abroad in the land. For daring to proclaim the warning of Rev. 14: 9-12 against this wicked work, Seventh-day Adventists are now the special objects of persecution. But their cause is the cause of every man who loves truth and honor more than hypocrisy or slavery. Thousands are rousing to meet the danger, and soon this Sabbath question will be a familiar one in all the homes of this land. O God, strengthen the hands of those who fight the battle for truth and liberty!

H. E. ROBINSON.
