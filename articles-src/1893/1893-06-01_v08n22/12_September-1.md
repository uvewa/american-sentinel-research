"SEPTEMBER 1," says the Catholic *Review*, "has been fixed by the World's Fair committee on ceremonies as the date for the Catholic Education Day. Pontiac Hall, we are told, has been engaged for a celebration from 2 to 4 p.m. until noon. The ceremonies will be carried on under the direction of Bishop Spalding. Archbishop Feehan will preside. Among the addresses will be one by Archbishop Ryan, of Philadelphia . . . . It will be a great day for Catholics, and for a certain class of 'Protestants,' and it will afford them a conspicuous opportunity for glorifying the Catholic Church."
