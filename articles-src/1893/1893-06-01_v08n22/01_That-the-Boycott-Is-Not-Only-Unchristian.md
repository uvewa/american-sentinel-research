THAT the boycott is not only unchristian but antichristian will scarcely be disputed. This is so patent that the religious press of the country are saying, "There will be no boycott of the Fair;" they also add, "Christians will unkindly refuse to patronize it if it is open on Sunday."

But what's in a name? To boycott means "to combine in refusing to give assistance to or have any kind of dealings with." Then if "the Christian people" of the country combine against the Fair, in what respect will this action differ from a boycott? And if the definition is of antichristian, how can each united action on the part of the "Christian people" be otherwise than antichristian?

Is not the boycott antichristian only when used for ordinary worldly purposes? Does not the boycott become a legitimate form of religion? Does not the Inquisitorial motto, "The end justifies the means," and all Professor Briggs' higher criticism afford ample and larger ground to the Protestant bitter-enders discovered by the Protestant heresy trial?

GRANT the sake of the argument, that it is morally wrong to open the Fair on Sunday, and suppose that by the churches boycott each opening could be prevented, would anything be gained for the cause of religion? The rôle of a boycott is one levied and collected without the intervention of the civil law. But that is only a half truth. If a boycott can much destroy the property of the Fair by actual violence so to destroy it indirectly by combining to make it unremunerative, and so, practically worthless. Which would be the greater wrong to the newsboy, for one to burn his factory, or for one of God, to command men of record, to employ such as influence against him as to make it impossible for him to either operate or sell it? The civil law, itself, at best neutral, make a difference between the two kinds of injury, but from a Christian standpoint, from the standpoint of the Golden Rule, who can say that one would be any less wicked than the other? Indeed the more covert method of revenge would show the greater malice, for the building might be fired in a moment of intense anger, but the ruinous influence could be effective only if of long continuance—the result of a settled purpose to do an injury.

But there is yet another count in the indictment against the "Christian" boycott on the Fair. Its purpose is declared to be to compel the recognition of the Christian religion by the closing of the Fair; and yet the boycott is itself illegal. There can be no boycott without conspiracy; and conspiracy to injure any person, or corporation either in person, property, or reputation, has been repeatedly held by the courts to be illegal, and is punishable by severe penalties. So that in essaying to lead a boycott against the Fair, the "Christian people of the country," and "the law abiding people of the country," "the best people of the country," as they are wont to style themselves, become law-breakers themselves in order to compel obedience from others!

It is bad enough, but is not the worst feature of this antichristian boycott, the law that they demand shall be obeyed by compulsion is their own law, the dictum of the politicians. The "law abiding people of the land" said to the law-makers of the land: "Before us we set nothing closing the Fair on Sunday and we will come expediency and you'll get the profits. We'll see to it that you get some bad ones, have mercy on it." Having secured the law unlawfully, by threats and intimidation, is it any wonder that they resort to unlawful means to enforce it?

Are not what is this institution and is their support by boycott? It is the same that the Papacy sets forth as the badge of its authority to change the law of God, and to command men under sin to observe the ordinance of the Pope. Church; it is the mark of the first beast of the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, the so-called Protestant or of America proposes to force upon all by means of the boycott, described in Rev. 13: 16, 17, in these words: "And he caused all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads. And that no man might buy or sell, save he that hath the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
