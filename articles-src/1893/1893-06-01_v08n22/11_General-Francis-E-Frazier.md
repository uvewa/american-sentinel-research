GENERAL FRANCIS E. FRAZIER, of Washington, D. C., makes the following good point against the right of Congress to require the closing of the Chicago Fair:—

It is hardly necessary to come that the Federal Government itself has been, of course, the power conferred upon it by the Constitution, in truth. A country is out there, over the States and to the people;" and that completely the vast and colossal combined of power from powers belong to its these states exclusively, and that these grounds upon of persons and of property, is the exclusive duty of the States within the limits of the State. Thus, if Congress has power, under any provision of the law, within the limits of the city of Chicago, the law would be a new form of usurpation on its basis one must be a case of Congress undertaking to prescribe what should be practiced, and this is something new and to Congress in Sunday in the same city of Chicago.

The General very properly insists that there is no difference in principle between a positive ministerial command and a condition having the same end in view, added to a grant; between a law which assumes to accomplish an unconstitutional object by force and a condition which brings the same end by indirect; or, in other words, that the Federal Government has no more right to grant $1,500,000 to the Chicago Fair on condition that it should be closed Sunday than it would have to pass a law closing it on Sunday.

It is it impossible," remarks the *Post* of this city," to forward the decision of the papers upon this petition, but to the lay mind it contains great force."

The *Press* of this city says that it is glad to see it announced by President Marquard of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and by several of its prominent trustees that there is no intention of closing the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Sundays. It would be a civic calamity to cut off the principal opportunity that a great number of our citizens have to visit the museum at leisure. The custom of Sunday opening must be kept up, if for no other reason, because those who come to see the pictures on Sunday are the very people who are most likely to come again, and so to be benefited; by holding out society at the good and the beautiful in art. During the week the visitors are largely people from out of-town, to Chicago the great majority are our own citizens, and their interest means their education by repeated visits. On no other day does the museum as fully serve the purpose for which it was established as on Sunday."
