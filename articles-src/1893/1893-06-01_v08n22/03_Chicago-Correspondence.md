THE SENTINEL has several times said that the agitation of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair would not cease at the closing of the Fair. That Sunday of the Fair has now passed and the matter is farther than ever from an amicable settlement.

The courts have been appealed to; the Supreme Court of the State and of the United States has been asked and obtained to their opinion even more generally upon it, to their opinion even more generally upon it; and the one great exciting topic of discussion, outside of the press almost universally and the Fair and the Sunday question, are becoming roused, especially in the city of Chicago, to a degree unprecedented, legislating, to be heard. This is not surprising. The Board of Directors, the Commissioners, and the Attorney General of the United States have not yet been the examples in that particular; certainly the public may be excused for following the lead of their distinguished examples.

That the legal bearings of the case are investigated in deeper in the mire of ecclesiastical interference, and the ecclesiastical interference does the whole matter get.

The Board of Directors and the National Commission are in hopeless disagreement. The directors, representing the stockholders of the World's Fair, and the local interest involved, the people, the material condition, and the balance of financial loss, are for opening. The Commissioners, remaining Sundays of its conference, stand for closing. To settle the conflict, a compromise created by act of Congress is to determine that the congressional Sunday-closing proviso shall take effect at all times. The directors, on the other hand, totally decline neither the authority of the Board of Directors in according to a member the commission one of its members used the following language:—

I know—and I do not fear contradiction in saying it, because it is necessarily the case—that Congress no more authority within the limits of the Exposition in regard to Sunday than it has in regard to the government of any school district in the Rocky Mountains. And for these gentlemen of the Commission, representing, as they say, Congress, to try to force Sunday closing upon us, or upon any duty imposed upon him as to stand by and permit the destruction of property which he represents, the good sense, and the integrity of every commissioner.

*After this was written a number of the National Commission voted to open the Fair on Sundays. See telegraphic correspondence page 176.*

The National Commission is emphatic in its position. The majority report which was shown by a generally published interview between National Commissioner and Christian Endeavor with Attorney-General Olney, at Washington, in which it is reported as saying that the Government, as in any forum, the commission as to open the case the National Commission itself.

This, if it proceeds, will be of great interest. The Sunday-closing advocates are looking to the account the appropriate act together in but a mandatory statute, and this to the constitution Congress, but the keeping with the entire history of the challenge of any of the rights of religious liberty, however the most exacting.

There is no law on the statute books enforcing the observance of Sunday of any other religious feast days; and religious testing has been put there through some influence that is not self-evidently right.

It has been embodied in a bill, filed by ex-Congressman Morse of Massachusetts, and introduced by Allen Clingman, a citizen of Chicago, calling upon the National Commission Exposition to the amount of $100,000, being a suit to recover damages, based upon a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Exposition and the National Commission excluding the people from the public park, in which the Fair buildings have been erected. It also claims that the act of Congress under which the Fair was held, when fairly construed, is conflicting with the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and in interference with the Constitution of the State of Illinois. Article 2, Section 3, is as follows:—

That no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.

With this it is not very difficult to see what the Sunday-closing proviso does give a preference, and is therefore, as a state, a Sunday and a church; an areligionist and a general railroad right, and acknowledged to be opposed to the Constitution, and of the congressional proviso, is null and void.

The press of the city is also discussing the matter, and it may be anticipated that what has been expressed from time to time the seeming disposition of the press. But the longer it has the stronger the discussion becomes upon the subject, the less likely does it appear that Sunday closing would soon be authoritatively decided by the courts to be constitutional. One way of representing the American Sabbath Union, has the permission to be heard in rebuttal before the courts, has not yet been granted. A special plea to the court was from the American Sabbath Union, if he should obtain a hearing, he would require a week or ten days approximately 3,000 of so-called authorities, there will likely be heard from all sides, thereto would necessarily a recapitulation of evidence in answer, it may be anticipated that several months will pass before an authoritative result occurs. The language of the section appropriating the souvenir coins and the accompanying debate would seem to make it doubtful
