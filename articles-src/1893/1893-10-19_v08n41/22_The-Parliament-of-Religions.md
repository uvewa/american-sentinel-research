IN view of the Parliament of Religion, the *New York Sun* deals now with a good deal clearer vision than many religious papers. It asks:—

How can Christianity consistently join in any such meeting and what is its purpose?

This question of the *Sun* then follows with these observations:

If Christianity is not the sole-true and perfect religion, and if all other ideas are not competing false religions, then it needs to withdraw. But if Christianity is the best, but also the only religion whereby man can be saved, then all other religions are not also only a part of the truth, stating that principle which it is peculiarly the Christianity of the duty for man it is to to say that it is so reformed.

On another page is published a short article from the *Observer*, on "Church and State," which is worthy serious attention. One point there especially stated, namely, that efforts are now being made in this country to bring Church and State into essential union by sectarian appropriations. There is an admission, and there must have been a virtual union of Church and State, without a legal establishment, and formal recognition of some denomination at the State Church. But the *Sun* asks the *Observer* use the word "ominous." "Who does not see," said James Madison in 1785, "that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish, with the same son, any particular sect of Christianity, in exclusion of all other sects? With equally propriety might the question be asked: Who does not see that the same authority which can give pecuniary or show special favors to Christianity to the exclusion of all other religions, can with the same ease confer pecuniary or other benefits, upon any particular sect of Christianity to the exclusion of all other sects? Many professed Protestants do not see and appreciate the evils of Church and State union, but the point is from first contact, only when Roman Catholics are the beneficiaries.
