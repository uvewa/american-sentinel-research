**Protestants Still Protest.**

REFERRING to Dr. O'Gorman, of the Roman Catholic University of Washington, D. C., at the Parliament of Religions, Rev. Dr. David James Burrell, pastor of the Marble Collegiate Presbyterian Church of this city, said:—

> We could not have trouble, for the church which he represents, and the church which commands my allegiance hold the whole matter of Christianity in common, in that we believe in our one Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and with him and his people, as with me and mine, Christ is first, last, and all in all.

Does not the fawning doctor know that "Rome never changes"? and that tens of thousands of martyrs have laid down their lives as a protest against Rome's denial of Christ in that she denies justification by faith and teneles justification by penance and "good works"? Did Huss and Jerome die and Luther and Wyckliffe labor in vain, that men who now call themselves Protestants thus fawn upon the "man of sin," and flatter the "mystery of iniquity"? Has the blood of fifty millions of martyrs been shed in vain? God forbid! The Lord still has in Israel those who have not bowed the knee to Rome, nor kissed the Pope's toe, nor ceased to protest against Rome's wicked denial of Christ by substituting for his merits penance and "good works." Protestants still protest.
