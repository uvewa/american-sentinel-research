## Dangerous Antagonisms.

A LATE incident in St. Paul, Minn., where a public speaker was denied an opportunity of delivering addresses, previously contracted for, because the purpose, —as stated by the city clerk in the document refusing the use of the hall, which was city property, was,—"to wantonly attack the character of institutions sacredly cherished by a large number of the taxpayers of this community." The addresses were anti-Catholic in character and were claimed to be under the patronage of the American Protective Association. The city clerk of St. Paul is reported to have told the advance agent of the lecturer that "The Irish Nationalists and the Ancient Order of Hibernians had met on Friday and Saturday and had decided that they would not allow such a meeting to be held, if they were obliged to use force." There does not exist at the present time a greater menace to civil rights and public peace in this country than these organizations here named,—and their kindred,—organized, and in some cases drilled and armed, with the avowed purpose of antagonizing each other on lines of religious prejudice, bigotry, and fanaticism. When some shocking outbreak, or a concerted series of them, shall occur,—or a condition of religious terrorism be instituted,—then the citizens of the United States at large will awake to a realization of the dangerous and destructive character of the forces which have been gathering and organizing unperceived for years. There is no reason why they should have been unknown to the people and to the public. Their methods and their purposes, though confessedly secret, have not been so closely concealed as not to have been patent to any interested observer. The only reason why these organizations have grown to their present proportions,—the only reason that can be given why public opinion has not, by the fiat of its powerful displeasure, long ago done away with them, is because they answer to an innate intolerance and furious fanatical desire which still reigns in the hearts of such a majority of American citizens, and which makes these desperate and revolutionary methods,—sure to be the result of the friction of such antagonistic organizations,—seem to them even desirable.

There is no distinction to be made in these associations, they are all equally a menace to civil order,—they are all equally unchristian. It matters not that one calls itself Protestant and the other Catholic, they are all impelled and directed by the same evil spirit of violence. They both appeal to the sword and they both will perish by the sword,—while innocent fellow-citizens, non-combatants though they may be, will suffer with them.
