TURNT is trouble in the little village of some near Springfield, Ill., between Protestants and Roman Catholics, over the reading of the Bible in the public schools. Some Protestant teachers have insisted upon Bible reading and prayer in their schools irrespective of the protests of Roman Catholic parents of their pupils, and the advice of their directors. The question of the Bible in the public schools is one that will not be silent.
