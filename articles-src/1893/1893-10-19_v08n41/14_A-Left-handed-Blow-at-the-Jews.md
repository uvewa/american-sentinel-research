IN the Republic of Switzerland "popular sovereignty" has recently won a remarkable triumph, in the recent developments in the constitutional device known as the Referendum, which gives the people power to veto laws passed by the Federal Parliament, or to demand laws rejected by that body. A singular illustration of the Federal Government's action occurred recently. The Swiss Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recently endeavored to put a stop to the methods of Jewish slaughterers prescribing that in slaughtering animals, the brain of the animal shall first be rendered insensible to pain before being bled, but the bill was rejected. Whether it was meant to be not, the result was a blow at the Jews, who are required by the Mosaic law to kill only such animals intended for food. The bill was afterwards referred to the Referendum, and has been accepted by the people; and the law is a virtual notice to the Jews of Switzerland, either to give up eating meat, or to buy only of Gentile butchers, that they are prepared to turn vegetarians. The ignorance or indifference of the people, who voted for it without understanding or caring for its effect upon the Jews, stands the law as a serious blot upon the fair fame of the nation which justly proudly has been for so many centuries the home of liberty and justice. It is to be hoped that its true meaning and practical working of the law will become apparent, and that it will be promptly repealed.—*Far from Zion.*
