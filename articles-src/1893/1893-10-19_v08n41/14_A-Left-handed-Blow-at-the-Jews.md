**A Left-handed Blow at the Jews.**

In the Republic of Switzerland "popular sovereignty" has reached its most extreme development in the constitutional device known as the Referendum, which gives the people power to veto laws passed by the Federal legislature, and to pass laws rejected by that body. A singular instance of the latter kind has just occurred. The Swiss Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recently endeavored to secure the enactment of a law by the legislature prescribing that in slaughtering animals they must be made insensible before being bled, but the bill was rejected. Whether it was meant to be so or not, the act was a blow at the Jews, who are required by the Talmud to bleed to death animals intended for food. The bill was thereupon referred to the popular vote, and has been approved. The adoption of this law is a virtual notice to the Jews of expulsion from Switzerland, unless they are prepared to turn vegetarians. The success of the measure is attributed to the ignorance or indifference of the people, who voted for it without understanding or caring for its effect upon the Jews. We trust that this is the case, for as it stands the law is a serious blot upon the fair fame of the ancient republic, which has been for so many centuries the home of liberty and justice. It is to be hoped that on sober second thought the hardship of the law will become apparent, and that it will be promptly repealed.—The Examiner.
