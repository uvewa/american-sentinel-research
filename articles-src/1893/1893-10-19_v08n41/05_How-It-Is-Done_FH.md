## How It Is Done.

In England we have two societies for the purpose of enforcing Sunday observance. One is "The Lord's Day Observance Society," and the other, "The Workingmen's Lord's Day Rest Association." Both circulate a large amount of literature to show that Sunday is the Sabbath. Most of the writers follow the same line of thought. They first start out on the solid foundation of the institution of the Sabbath at creation, and then come down through the Bible, bringing forth an impregnable array of texts which refer to the seventh day; and all goes well until they reach the resurrection of Christ, when here they attempt to slide all this edifice onto the first day of the week, and make all they have said apply to Sunday. This Herculean task is impossible as a feat of logic; for it can only be performed in the way a conjurer performs a "pass," by sleight of hand (Eph. 4:14); and the various ways which these gentlemen attempt it is of great interest.

First, here is a pamphlet, "The Lord's Day is the Sabbath," by Rev. J. Gretton, D.D., secretary of the first-named society. In it occurs this:

> There remains but one other question. Can the Lord's day be the Sabbath day, when the one is the seventh, and the other the first day of the week? I reply, the Sabbath law is the separation of one day in seven unto the Lord,—one day after six and not the seventh day absolutely. There came a time when one day in history fall out, as not being; for therein the Lord of life lay dead in the tomb, and the next day—when he rose again, the Prince of life—became at once the seventh and first; and this day, thus unique and glorious, was actually the Sabbath.

Could any argument be more fanciful and unreal? How could a day fall out? Where did it fall to? A marvelous performance, surely, but it is surpassed by the Rev. Dr. Pope, in "The Christian Sabbath" (for same society). He says of Christ:

> He kept the old day always and to the last. He went from its most sacred observance in Jericho straight to his cross. He left the old Sabbath in his sepulchre, but it rose again with him on the third day, now to be the first day of the week.

Such talk is sheer nonsense. How could a day perform in this manner? And yet this is presented by grave doctors of divinity as the best they have.

The other society publishes a pamphlet by Bishop Ryle. The bishop starts with the institution of the Sabbath, and comes steadily along the beaten track, through the giving of the manna and the law, down to Christ, and does beautifully till he comes to the "gap," and this is how he gets over it:

> Undoubtedly the day was changed. It was made the first day of the week in memory of our Lord's resurrection, instead of the seventh. But I believe the apostle were divinely inspired to make that change, and at the same time wisely directed to make no public decree about it.

As an example of legerdemain, this last is a master-stroke. With one hand the bishop presents an unwarrantable assumption, and with the other he fliches away all possibility of any one testing that assumption.

In another pamphlet put out by the same society, the Rev. Eynon Davis tries his hand. Mr. Davis is a wise man. He simply says:

> We find that with the change of dispensations, a change was also made in the world's day of rest.
>
> The deliverance from sin through Christ was greater than the deliverance from Egypt through Moses, so the memorial day was shifted from the seventh day to the first day of the week—to our present Sabbath. The day is not at all important, so we need not stay to discuss the alteration.

So he hurries off to a less dangerous ground, carrying his reader with him. Yes, Mr. Davis is certainly a wise man. (See Prov. 17:28.)

Now these are circulated as the best reasons that the best men in England can produce for "shifting" the commandment of God. If this is the wisdom, what must the foolishness be like? Well might Paul say, "Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?" 1 Cor. 1:18-27.
