A WONDERFUL scheme of the Sunday Rest Congress, the *Examiner* [Baptist] says:—

> There are widely divergent views even among those who plead most earnestly for a better observance of Sunday characterize the proceedings at the recent Sunday Rest Congress. Any measure short of an appeal to civil legislation we would cordially support. Moral suasion, social pressure, religious instruction and persuasion—these are properly and the civil power in their enforcement of a day of worship is as certainly wrong, and the best Christians of all ages have felt it to be wrong. To say that we wish to be their "divine right" to worship on their day of rest we must say that we have no right to interfere with the duties that are not natural offenses, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, all, those, despisers of those that are good, natural and spiritual forces in this field against Sabbath breaking. But civil legislation or physical enforcement of a religious observance is destructive of all its hearings. What may be a generation when large numbers of our industrial population groups large masses of men must be taught to venerate everything connected with the Christian Church—to worship and to worship God.

The teaching of these principles can be applied to all groups, and especially in the great centers of population. But the enforcement of the law to make the day sacred—or even to be used—to "protect" it as a "holiday for workingmen" ought not to be used. Yet a thorough system of education, one that reaches the children, one that touches the great masses that are expected, in the programmes of the fact of its religious nature, and so educating people—instead of forcing them—to understand the need of a weekly Sabbath, indeed, is more desperately needed than a statute book full of Sunday laws.

The reality of the German colonists in the Stundists may be found who have a great object lesson in the enforcement of German religious books. The vast majority of them are engaged in agriculture, in the towns a good many Stundist artisans may be found—millers, smiths, carpenters, etc. I will close this with a sample of the letters from the Russian press, from the writings of men altogether hostile to Stundists, but men, whose testimony, on the other hand, is entitled to their worth and superiority to their orthodox neighbors, as is even confessed in the *Kief Diocesan Register*, an ultra-orthodox Church organ. "The character of the Stundists as opposed to the use of the force is due to discipline." "All the Stundists really know them," says another well-known writer, "recognize that they are honorable, temperate, wise, industrious, devoted to work and to the neighborhood."

More marks of reading their Bitterness to memory, and the name and the manner of M. Radegonsky one of their bitterest opponents. "The moral qualities of the Stundists are most hard-working, frugal; they build their houses themselves, teach their children and are very religious, in their language, and healing Christians lives. Such a thing as a crime is hardly known among them. Their hospitality, which they consider to be God, the hungry to drink the naked, to shelter the sick and the pilgrims. But perhaps their most striking testimony to their moral earnestness is concluded in a report written by M. Shingarvov, who was, said the paper, "no man of justice, of goodness who lived for the truth, a deep, simple and humble nature. No matter what they may be, those who do not rightly understand their origin and the reasons of their movement." "They are remarkable for their pure morality." In their family life, with exception of the crimes dating as fortes; the family life of the Christians in their conduct, in their relations to one another are those of the first Christians quite notable. Among them are their special position stands infinitely higher than among the orthodox. They are known far as their intellectual superiority they are now fully for, and they will attend and are read and are deeply versed in the precepts of the Holy Scripture.—*Correspondence of the New York Observer.*
