THE *Independent*, in an editorial comment, characterizes these words of Mr. Moody as "a somewhat remarkable" essay. Why? "It is startling to know that in the providence of God all this sin, wickedness, crime, disease, crime, dimness, suffering, sorrow, disaster and terror by land and sea, are to continue until the end of this era and never be heard of more, so that a new order of things may be ushered into existence, come into mind,—it is unpleasantly startling to know it so!" Will not the *Independent*, we look, with Mr. Moody, into the future with "wholesome dread" of things ahead? Indeed, may those come be startled at the state of the case, as it now is known? Let their frightened eyes with its progressiveness of cruelty terror and new convictions of crime prevail upon society. But they are not startled. Why not? It is because they would not believe the truth even if it were told to them, now, that the Son of God came to be born, and lived, and died; and whether they have the coming of their Lord, and are watching the evidences which he said should so inform them, they do, have of them, watched and waited, that his coming should not be to them as a thief; or opposed it all that he might at the last, they, classing, are impotent. The *Independent* continues:—

Prophesying is certainly risky business for him who is not a prophet, but it is not an occupation which attracts the vast number of people who make guesses of the future. Who was it that prophesied the destruction of the world? is there any risk in depending upon that religion? and if all becomes a failure we now will have on for a new heaven and a new earth. We only that Christ will come on the throne that said this, and did he not know? He bids us to watch for the end of the world, for they were "true and faithful." Is Mr. Moody prophesying when he says the above? It is the Word of the Lord by his prophet John by the spirit of inspiration that said it, not Moody. And it was the word of God that know that God said to John that he would make all things new, and that John saw in his vision "a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away." But who said this? Is it true that Christ said that neither he nor the angels, only the Father, knew the day and the hour—"that day"? Yes. But did he who spoke in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew, verse thirty-six, what he could not know, and he had no approximation knowledge of the period or the approach of the event, and to convey none, why should he have singled out a special generation which would follow certain phenomena in the heavens immediately when a special generation of the people of God, and told them specifically that that generation should not pass away before the Son of man should come again in the glory of the Father with all his holy angels? These words not only with that beautiful parable of the fig tree, are not the words of ignorance, but with those words of earnest exhortation to the faithful "watch," what is their significance and what is the future? Does Mr. Moody belong to the generation of his counsel, coming after these conditions and the darkening of the sun and moon and the falling of the stars, which meets the description which Christ Jesus gave? He says that he does. Then the nation of his blessings to heaven at the doorward their fullest insistence? Did he make these broad statements without careful thought, or did the *Independent* speak? And if the *Independent* speaks, will the *Independent* why Mr. Moody should make a similar statement? And if Mr. Moody speaks, should he not speak, profiting by the millennium of common sense, as he has these past years?

GOD is great in what generation has to record, come, and he told his apostles, and he told them as now, and to come. "Of that day and hour," he comes to tell them. Offenses must needs come, but that does not destroy the prophet. The single question is put—"Where is the promise of his coming?" and the answer is that it shall not be through him, and so he comes, "for the testimony of Jesus, according to his promise," and looks forward out of the things that shall come upon the earth, and looks and watches with unbounded delight.
