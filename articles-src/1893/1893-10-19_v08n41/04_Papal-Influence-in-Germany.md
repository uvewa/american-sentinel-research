SOMETHING of the rapid increase of papal influence in the affairs of Germany during the last five years, will appear from the following facts recently published in a Catholic journal:—

The visit to Germany of Cardinal Ledochowski, one of the most influential of Leo XIII's advisers, inevitably directs attention to the increase of papal influence in recent years. After his last visit, Prince Bismarck, now retired from office, recalled the fact that less than twenty-five years ago the very same was a synonym for anti-German ideas and that this same cardinal had been at the height of his power, was using it to curtail the liberty of the pulpit, was persecuting Priests and Pastors who refused to obey orders, and Faulke and Groitey, deplored every look or gesture or word which indicated the supremacy of the Church in educational matters and seemed to claim a superiority in German internal affairs. When, however, during the spring of 1878, it became evident that the Kulturkampf was a costly blunder, and that the limits of toleration had been reached, Bismarck prepared the way for a reconciliation with the Vatican. In February, 1879, when Ledochowski went to the Vatican, there to manage the affairs of the diocese and inspire further opposition. Germany and Italy, in their national affairs, condemned him, in condemnation. When Bismarck therefore sent his emissary to the Vatican, but without success, for he wanted Cardinal Bismarck as chief of the Pope against the civil, he found that the Roman authorities refused, or that they were unable to concede to him his claims against Italy, only sought to conciliate him, for he resisted the expressed orders of the Pope and Cardinals.

Of course, in both the matters of controversy between Bismarck and Cardinal Ledochowski, the latter was clearly right. It was an unwarranted usurpation of power for Bismarck to assume to dictate the appointment of bishops, and it was far better for him to command the use of the German tongue in the Pulpit when for it is to be found that the obstacle in the policy of Germany is simply a matter of principle. Papists hold the balance of power, and Germany is always ready to conciliate them. And to conciliate Papists in politics means always the same, to give them the lion's share, and to give them power. It is a pernicious, but understood, alliance. The aid of the Papal party in Germany, is due to Ledochowski's influence.
