## Papal Influence in Germany.

SOMETHING of the rapid increase of papal influence in the German empire, during the last five years, will appear from the following facts recently published in the Outlook:

> The visit to Germany of Cardinal Ledochowski, Prefect of the Propaganda Fide and one of the most influential of Leo XIII.'s advisers, inevitably suggests a comparison between his present status, as concerns temporal power, and that of his ancient foe, Prince Bismarck. Miecislaus John Ledochowski is by birth a German Pole, and until very recent years his very name was a synonym for anti-German sentiment. During the years immediately succeeding the War of 1870, when Bismarck, then at the height of his power, was using it to curtail any privileges and counteract the influence of the Catholic Church, Ledochowski, then Bishop of Pozen and Gnesen, fearlessly disputed every inch of ground with the Iron Chancellor. Upon two great issues the Cardinal was immovable—the authority of the Church in educational matters, and its right to elect its own bishops without State interference. When, therefore, during the spring of 1874 he refused to permit the German language to be taught in the schools of his diocese, it seemed that the limits of tolerance had been reached. He was fined and imprisoned, but while yet in prison he was made a Cardinal by Pius IX. Upon his release Ledochowski went to the Vatican, there to be received with honor and rapidly preferred. Though absent from Pozen he continued to direct the affairs of the diocese and inspire further opposition to Bismarck, so that the German Government twice condemned him, in conjunction. While Bismarck remained in power at Berlin no effort was spared to weaken Ledochowski's influence at the Vatican, but without success, for he finally succeeded Cardinal Simsoni as chief of the Propaganda. Since the fall of Bismarck Cardinal Ledochowski seems to have forgotten his old enmity toward Germany. Emperor William has undoubtedly sought to conciliate him, for he remitted the sentences passed against the Cardinal, and will personally entertain him during his coming visit to Berlin. It is pretty well understood that the support recently given to Chancellor Caprivi's policy, especially in the case of the Army Bill, by the Polish party in Germany, is due to Ledochowski's influence.

Of course, in both the matters of contention between Bismarck and Cardinal Ledochowski, the latter was clearly right. It was an unwarranted usurpation of power for Bismarck to assume to dictate the appointment of bishops, and it was no better for him to command the use of the German tongue in the Polish schools; but it is to be feared that the change in the policy of Germany is simply a change of policy, and not a change from policy to principle. Papists held the balance of power in Germany, and it was necessary to conciliate them. And to conciliate papists in political matters means always to give them the lion's share, and to give it to them as papists.
