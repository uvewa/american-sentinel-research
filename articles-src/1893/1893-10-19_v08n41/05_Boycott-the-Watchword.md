THE term "boycott" is of comparatively recent origin. It is not yet fifteen years old, and is derived from a man's name. Captain Boycott was a land agent in Ireland, where, because of a dislike to him and his methods, the people agreed that none of them would have any dealings with him. If he held the castle of lands, they all combined against him. It was his hand against all, his hand, and it was impossible for him to hold his own. So powerful was this ostracism that a word is coined and the definition given, in the withholding of all social or business relations from a certain person or thing, and the meaning an individual or corporation or body, and an effort is made to prevent all others from doing so also.

This is very spirit that the sort of "Christianity" that is endeavoring to bring the aged and saw the edgy go forth that the word "boycott" has long been used to mark the brand of the beast. This is nothing less than what certain parties are trying to do in this country to people who observe Saturday Sabbath. It is a well known and acknowledged fact in the operations of these Sunday-law advocates and in their work in part of the "Christian lobby" before Congress that their representatives in their districts that did more than anything else to secure the closing of the World's Fair. It was the Sunday Rest Congress, held years ago at Pearl's headquarters, with the attendance at the district meeting of the American Sabbath Union. On the stage that the way to stop the Sunday newspaper was to boycott it, and that if a certain firm would not stop advertising on Sunday, "I, I would rather, even for half an advertising line, advertise in the Monday paper."
