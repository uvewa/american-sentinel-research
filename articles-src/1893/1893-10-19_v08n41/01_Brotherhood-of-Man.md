"BROTHERHOOD of man"—a phrase full of promise! "Fatherhood of God"—a benediction upon humanity! What do these phrases mean? Read this: "Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man!" The phrase has become an established sentiment.

THESE words, like far echoes heard from a distance, have heretofore sounded from place to place and from heart to heart in the world; but now the wandering refrain has become a chorus which is full sound, gathering harmony, even, from the platform of the Parliament of Religions, to fill the whole earth with the glory of its song.

BUT is this a new thought? It is not. It is as old as the world. Its written and spoken expression is as old as the Word of God to man. And its disregard is as old as the scoffer. "Where is Abel thy brother?" and the answer, "I know not; am I my brother's keeper?" The very question was falsely implying the acknowledgment of one relationship and implicitly the expressed obligation of the other. The reply denied both, neither to express who acknowledged the brotherhood, while repudiating its obligations.

SO it is that man has always, through all those thousands of years, accepted the relationship of brotherhood with the lips,—when the stronger, reserving to himself the right and authority of primogeniture; when the weaker, using the right as an evidence of rightful claim to the charity and protection of the other. But the obligations of the relationship, whatever acknowledgment they may have received from mankind in general, have led mankind to each owe the other as he would have the other do to him.

WHAT must follow the practical acceptance—the practical acceptance—by mankind of the fact of the fatherhood of God? It must necessarily be the acknowledgment and acceptance of, and obedience to, all divine truth. Brotherhood with all the children of God would thus necessarily and inevitably follow. But if the second clause be first admitted, brotherhood presumed proves a father; and his, being All-father, is consequently Creator and God. The two clauses of the expression answer to each other logically, as they do historically. The scriptural requires the humanitarian, and the consequent is the antecedent. Thus the action of the human mind by this remarkable expression of its necessary processes bring man inevitably to the blessedness of these two facts which require him in their turn to meet and fill the sphere of their truth and love his Creator-father with all his heart, soul and mind, and his brother as himself, and the first and second great commandments, on which hang all the law and the prophets, have been received and acted upon. This being so what more remains? Nothing: all the conditions have in this been met, for in this divine comprehensiveness is comprehended also all the requirements of true religion. Of these two expressions the first is "fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man."

THESE two propositions depend, then, upon each other. One cannot be fully received without the other. Their entire significance is comprehended in the one word "Christianity." For that is the doctrine of the Father, for man to accept man's Elder Brother. Therefore he who accepts the practical form of the true doctrine of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man must give up all false religion, put away all false doctrine both within and without; all idolatry must cease, there must be no more service of mammon or self; to no false god, or idol, or defiling must he bow. He must remember the name of God to keep it holy upon his lips; he must remember the day of God to keep it holy in his life; he must care for, yes, and honor his father and his mother; he must not covet in his heart; he must not enter the sin of Cain, or even cherish anger in his heart against his brother; he must not do so to iniquity, covet, harbor an unclean thought in his mind; he must respect his neighbor's property rights; even as much so desiring that which is his brother's, and bear no false witness against him; he must in all things give care and credence to the Word of the Father, and love the coming of his Elder Brother.

AT the Parliament of Religions there were men and women who actually preached to the full, and in warning sign be given, and that was the gospel of "the brotherhood of man." To that all gave assent, at least in theory. Pagan, Christian, infidel, all struck hands in allegiance to that doctrine. Did they realize what they were doing? Did they think to what they were committing themselves? The pagan set forward this declaration, accepted and advocated it, with even more force, fervor, and ability than the companion; the infidel accepted it with hesitations and gladness, as a sufficient gospel; the Christian received it triumphantly and joyfully, as if he thought it the returning echo which he himself had set ringing.

TO what necessary course would this engage the pagan? It would require him, in sincerity, to give up all his idolatry and worship the one true God in sincerity and truth. To what would it necessarily bring the infidel? To an earnest acknowledgment of the existence of God, and all must alike equally follow "the brotherhood of man." For if that is indeed the one necessary thing in human life; what must it bring the Christian? Either to a denial of his faith, or to self-examination as to whether he be in the faith or not.

FOR, if the pagan, the infidel, and the Christian, are to meet on a common platform, and coming together, all accept as articles of their creed, they cannot deny a common Father, and that is an acknowledgment of the one true God and his divine fatherhood, which will not tolerate false allegiance. And the Christian, in the very forms of his belief, is committed to this from the beginning. His practical application of the doctrine to him is abolished by which his brethren pay the penalty or the hypocrisy of his profession.

AT the Parliament of Religions, this last was applied especially to the Buddhist, Japanese and Chinese, and by the Christian negro; and by the last popular Christian sects, as represented by the popular church, and the idea of the "Christian Nation" was found, though in the fullest logical measure, wanting.

IF this is to be viewed from the standpoint of the negro race, which, rebelliously constituting the wrongs at the hands of a heartless people everywhere, employs violence, as if in fact at the instantly or if, "Is this world a different Christianity than other nations by which to measure the question? Would colored ladies in the southern part of this country need to fear that the professed religion of the foreign policy of the Nation was unworthy a place within the pale of common humanity?" Who could listen to the fearsome stirring addresses of this Convention, from the people and its Christianity, by the manly spirit of Japanese, and not feel that the vaunted theology of the theory of the "brotherhood of man" by the "Christian" United States at large was a wretched failure, as a comparison by pagan Japan, in the broad daylight of a Japanese, as to its appreciation of the broadest relations of all; and of extent that there is a fatal inconsistency somewhere. Where is it? It lies in the last in its origin involuntary. "The fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man," in hot words, empty soothing words,—and in the mouths and minds of those who speak them there is nothing of the practical acknowledgment, or of the personal responsibility of brotherhood; nothing of practical demonstration of their spirit. In the mouths of men who deny the negro his rights in their church member they are a mockery. In the mouths of those who make Sunday-law soldiers, professing Christians they are a mockery; in the mouths of those who would or permit, "Jim Crow" cars, or discriminate in hotels, these words in the mouths of those who plead with Congress for the enforcement of certain sectarian dogma they are a mockery. In the mouths of those who would enact sectarian laws, or those who would manufacture any of these religious enactments from the Word of God, these sentiments are a mockery. But—"be not deceived; God is not mocked."
