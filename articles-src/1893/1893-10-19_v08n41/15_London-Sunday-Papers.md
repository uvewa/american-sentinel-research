**London Sunday Papers.**

The question of Sunday newspapers is just now being earnestly discussed in the United States, and the general verdict of Christians is that the Sunday paper is a perennial evil. While making a very earnest protest against a Sunday paper, the St. Louis Christian Advocate makes the following astounding statement: "London, with her five million inhabitants, has no Sunday newspaper." This will be news to the people of the Metropolis who have become quite accustomed to hearing the Sunday newspapers cried by the newsboys. We are profoundly sorry that our contemporary's observation is wholly untrue. London has a surfeit of Sunday newspapers, and some of these have a phenomenal circulation, reaching as many as 500,000. Surely this does not look much like superior respect for the Lord's day on this side the Atlantic! Our contemporary will have to try again.—Christian Commonwealth (London), March 30.
