THE question of Sunday newspapers in London has attracted wide interest. The latest fact of note as stated by the *Sabbath Outlook* and the greatest menace to the Sunday rest force in England, is that the Sunday paper, so long abolished in London, is about to be revived. The *Sabbath Outlook*, on protest against a Sunday paper, the *Sunday Sun*, sends out the following rather astonishing statements: "London, with her five million inhabitants, has no Sunday newspaper." This will be news to the people of the United States who have become quite accustomed to hearing the Sunday newspapers printed by the same houses. We are profusely sorry that this contemporary's observation is vastly untrue. There are at least eight Sunday newspapers, and some of these have a circulation exceeding, weekly, not less than a 100,000. Surely this does not look like earnest support for the Lord's Day on this side the Atlantic! Our contemporary will have to try again.—*Papal Communion (London), March 30.*
