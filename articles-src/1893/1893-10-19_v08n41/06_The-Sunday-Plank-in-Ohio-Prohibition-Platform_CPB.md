## The Sunday Plank in Ohio Prohibition Platform.

THE following is the Sunday plank adopted by the Prohibitionists of Ohio at their convention in 1893:

> The business of government is to protect men in their rights. It is not the business of government to legislate on matters of religion. Liberty of conscience is guaranteed by the Constitution. The Christian has the right to regard the first day of the week as one sacred to religious worship. The Jew, under our form of government, has the same right to believe that the seventh day of the week is the day which he was commanded to keep holy. The Mohammedan has, under our form of government, an equal right to regard the sixth day as a day of special religious observance. The majority has no right nor power, under our Constitution, to enforce its religious opinions upon the minority, no matter how small that minority may be, nor is it the business of civil government to interfere with such matters. But it is the business of civil government to protect men in their rights, whether those rights be civil or religious, and a right to rest one day in seven is a right which can only be secured under existing social conditions by the protecting arm of the law. Without the protecting arm of the law the right to enjoy one day in seven as a day of rest could not be exercised. Without the protecting arm of the law workingmen would be driven to seven day's work for six day's pay, as was illustrated at the World's Fair where the weekly wages of the employes were not increased when the gates were opened on Sunday. Without the protecting arm of the law restraining the general public from reckless deseration of the day the Christian would be prevented by his neighbors from enjoying his one day of rest in seven. The right to one day of rest in seven can only be secured by the protecting arm of the law, and all classes of men have a right to this protection.
>
> This question has raised considerable discussion in regard to how such legislation can be enacted and enforced so as not to interfere with the rights of persons who conscientiously regard some other day of the week as their day of rest. There have been, unquestionably, under our present laws, which are usually scandalously lax, cases of shameful persecution for principle's sake; men who without interfering with the rights of others choose to observe some other day than the first day of the week as their day of rest have been persecuted by unreasonable men who availed themselves of imperfect laws.
>
> The principle laid down in the Prohibition platform fully covers all such cases. While it provides that he who regards the first day of the week as the sacred day of rest shall be protected in observing it the same principle would protect from persecution any person who conscientiously observed some other day. The fact that imperfect laws, under corrupt officials, have been used as a means of oppression is not an argument against just laws, enforced by honest officials, for the protection of all men in their religious rights.

The trouble with this utterance is that the conclusion that a legal rest-day is a necessity is based on a false premise. Thousands of Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists, not only in the United States but also in Europe, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and other countries, are so many living witnesses that a rest-day can be regularly and religiously observed without the aid of civil law. Of course in some cases it involves more or less self-denial, but it is not the province of civil government to legislate the cross out of our Christianity. The Christian should be willing to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
