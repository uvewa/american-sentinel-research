HELD a year ago, the 25th of last month, told the assembly that the "vulnerable point of the merchant to-day who keeps his store on Sunday is not his head nor his heart, but is his pocket book," and then expressed the "wish that it could be agreed upon to patronize only those who agree that Sunday closing was a good thing, if this, resolutions were passed, one of which said:

> *Resolved*, That it be the sense of this meeting that the Christian people of this City of New York do agree not to purchase any goods and by the patronage of the stores that are open on Sunday and that we use our influence in doing all in every way practicable for the closing of stores on Sunday.

This is only a sample of what we see going on almost everywhere, and it constitutes a close or compulsive observance of the day, to come to Sunday observance by means of force and boycott.

On Sunday the 1st instant, there was a large meeting, held for the avowed purpose of asking civic legislation to close all establishments on Sunday, at which Mr. C. P. Bollman, and others of the leading lights in this movement, one of the general discussions being in this respect the bearings upon the merits of the present law for Sunday closing. According to the report of the meeting in the *Tribune* of the next day, the speaker on the subject was Rev. Dr. C. P. Bickford, who said the argument was that Sunday be closed, that he declared that a lot of the Sunday dealers ought to be made wait and nobody should buy from them on Monday. "I tell him, said," "I would rather pay 10 cents more for any article and buy it on Monday from a man who kept his shop closed on Sunday, than to take the advantage of compulsory Sunday rest, and do so without the man who has within himself ideas of an cultured increased regard for the day by appealing to the basest of all motives, rather than to 'the best and the purest.'" Sunday the lines are drawing closer and closer, and he is alone blind who cannot see that these things that are taking place are of a very worst kind. Is it not time that a warning voice were raised?

W. E. CORNELL.
