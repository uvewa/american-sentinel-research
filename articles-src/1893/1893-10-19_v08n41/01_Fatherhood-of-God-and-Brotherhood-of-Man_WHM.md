"BROTHERHOOD of man!"—a phrase full of promise! "Fatherhood of God!"—a benediction upon humanity! What do these phrases mean? Join them: "Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man!" They become an exultant pæan to the world.

THESE words, like far echoes heard from a distance, have heretofore sounded from place to place here and there around the world; but now the wandering refrain has become a chorus which in full sounding harmony essays, from the platform of the Parliament of Religions, to fill the whole earth with the glory of its song.

But is this a new thought? It is not. It is as old as the world. Its written and spoken expression is as old as the Word of God to man. And its disregard is as old as the question, "Where is Abel thy brother?" and the answer, "I know not: am I my brother's keeper?" The very question was fatherly; implying the assumption of one relationship and asserting the other. The reply denied neither, but in express terms acknowledged the brotherly tie, while repudiating its obligations.

So it is that man has always, throughout these thousands of years, accepted the relationship of brotherhood with his fellows,—when the stronger, reserving to himself the right and authority of primogeniture; when the weaker, using the tie as an evidence of rightful claim to the charity and protection of the other. But the obligations of the relationship, whatever acknowledgment they may have received, have never yet been sufficient to lead mankind to do each unto the other as he would have the other do to him.

WHAT must follow the practical acceptance by mankind of the fact of the fatherhood of God? It must necessarily be the acknowledgment and acceptance of, and obedience to, all divine truth. Brotherhood with all the children of God would then necessarily and inevitably follow. But if the second clause be first admitted, brotherhood presupposes a common father, and he, being All-father, is consequently Creator and God. The two clauses of the expression answer to each other logically, as they do rhetorically. The antecedent requires its consequent, and the consequent its antecedent. Thus the action of the human mind by the unavoidable sequences of its necessary processes bring man inevitably to the statement of the two facts which require him in their turn to meet and fill the sphere of their demands and love his Creator-father with all his heart, soul, and mind, and his brother as himself, and the first and second great commandments, on which hang all the law and the prophets, have been received and acted upon. This being so what more remains? Nothing; all the conditions have in this been met, for in this the divine comprehensiveness of omniscience has condensed all the requirements of true religion. Of these two commandments the necessary antecedents are "the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man."

THESE two propositions, then, depend upon each other. One cannot be fully received without the other. Their entire significance is comprehended in the one word "Christianity." For that is the message of the Father to man through man's Elder Brother. Therefore he who accepts, professes, and practices the doctrine of "the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man" must give up all false religion, put away all false gods both within and without; all idolatry must end, there must be no more service of mammon or self; to no false god, or idol, or selfish desire, must he bow; he must remember the name of God to keep it holy upon his lips; he must remember the day of God to keep it holy in his life; he must care for, love, and honor his father and his mother; he must not commit the sin of Cain, or even cherish anger in his heart toward his brother; he must do no impurity, or even harbor an unclean thought in his mind; he must respect his brother's property rights, never even so much as desiring that which is his brother's, and bear no false witness against him; he must in all things give ear and credence to the Word of the Father, and love the coming of his Elder Brother.

At the Parliament of Religions there was one gospel that was possible to be preached to the full, and no warning sign be given, and that was the gospel of "the brotherhood of man." To that all gave assent, at least in theory. Pagan, Christian, infidel, all struck hands in allegiance to that doctrine. Did they realize what they were doing? Did they know to what they were committing themselves? The pagan put forward this doctrine, supported and advocated it, with even more force, fervor, and ability than his companions; the infidel accepted it with heartiness and gladness, as a sufficient gospel; the Christian received it tranquilly and joyfully, as if he thought it the returning dove which he himself had sent out.

To what necessary course would this commit the pagan? It would require him, were he consistent, to give up all his gods and worship the one true God in simplicity and truth. To what would it necessarily bring the infidel and the atheist? To an acknowledgment of the existence of God, and all which must logically follow. To what must it bring the Christian? Either to a denial of his faith, or to self-examination as to whether he be in the faith or not.

For, if the pagan, the infidel, and the atheist, make "the brotherhood of man" an article of their creed, they cannot deny a common Father, and that is an acknowledgment of God, and their unavoidable filial allegiance. And the Christian, by the very terms of his belief, is committed to this from the beginning. His practical application of the doctrine is then a shibboleth by which his brothers may test the reality or the hypocrisy of his profession.

At the Parliament of Religions, this test was applied fearlessly by the pagan Japanese and Chinese, and by the Christian negro; and by the test popular Christianity, as represented by the popular Church, and the idea of the "Christian Nation," was found utterly, utterly wanting. Who could listen to that voice from the negro race, which, reluctantly recounting its wrongs at the hands of a professed Christian people, suddenly cried, as if in pain at the necessity for it, "Do we not need a different Christianity from this?" and not ask themselves the same question? Who could listen to the courteous and gentlemanly plea of the Chinese Minister and not feel that the professed Christianity of this people as expressed in the foreign policy of the Nation was unworthy a place within the pale of common humanity? Who could listen to the fearless arraignment of this Government, its people and its Christianity, by the manly young Japanese, and not feel that the application of the theory of the "brotherhood of man" by the "Christian" United States was so far short of its principles, as comprehended by pagan Japan, as to merit the pity and the derision of angels and of men?

It is evident that there is a fatal inconsistency somewhere. Where is it? It lies in the fact that the ringing, rallying cry, "The fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man," is but words, empty, sounding words,—and in the mouths and minds of those who speak them there is no realization of the depth of their meaning, or of the personal responsibility of every Christian life to be the personification of their spirit. In the mouths of the wealthy, fashionable, mammon-loving church member they are a mockery. In the mouths of careless, idle, ease-loving, selfish, professing Christians they are a mockery. In the mouths of those who uphold, or permit, "Jim Crow" care, or "Jim Crow" church corners, they are a mockery. In the mouths of those who think, or say, or vote, that "the Chinese must go," they are a mockery. In the mouths of those who plead with Congress and the law-making powers to enact religious dogma they are a mockery. In the mouths of those who plead for the enforcement of these religious enactments from the judge's bench and the jury box, they are a mockery. But—"Be not deceived: God is not mocked." W. H. M.
