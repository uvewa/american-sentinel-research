THE Nashville Christian Advocate publishes an editorial article on the Parliament of Religions, in which it criticizes with much acerbity the effusiveness of the Shinto priest who returned in kind the enthusiastic salutations of some of the over-wrought women of the parliament, and classifies the foreigners all together in a lump, as "the heathen delegates." The parliament itself, the Advocate says, was "something more of a humbug than even its severest critics supposed it would be," and "shows a vast disintegration of faith." This last expression is truthful and just, and goes, in a general way, quite to the root of the whole matter. This parliament is a religious weather vane which the whole world may see, and from which it ought to be able to judge of the course which modern theology is taking.
