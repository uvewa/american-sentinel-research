IF Christianity is not the sole-true and perfect religion, and if all other faiths are not competing false religions, it needs no defense and no parliament.

The last remark is doubtless true: it was indifference, not true Christian character, that made the Parliament of Religions possible.

WE could not have trouble, for the church which is called the body of Christ, admits of one common measure, in that we believe in our one Lord and one savior, that love is the foundation of the gospel. "Some never change!" and that turn of mind is its condition—and as a protest against Rome's denial of Bible Christianity, it is that also direct prophecy that the Lord God sent and teaches justification by penitence alone and that Luther and Wycliffe later centuries did the same. They repudiate the state and latter the "tyranny of iniquity," and insist on the freedom of the conscience of man. Why, then, should those and the martyrs been shed in vain? God forbid! Their work is the truest testimony. We have not bowed the knee to Beron, and to-day the People's cry for, we combat it to resist against the world's wicked denial of Christ by nationalism for his merciless persecution and "good works." Protestants still protest.
