IN its view of the Parliament of Religions, the New York Sun sees with a good deal clearer vision than many religious papers. It asks:—

> How can Christians consistently join in any such polytheistic symposium as that now proceeding at Chicago?

This question the Sun then follows with these observations:—

> If Christianity is not the sole true and perfect religion, and if all others are not consequently false and pernicious, it is based on delusion. If it is not merely the best, but also the only religion whereby men can be saved, it is an imposture. If it contains only a part of the truth, sharing that priceless possession with many other religions, its source is not as it proclaims it to be. Christianity is either the sole and complete revelation of divine truth from God himself, and hence the only and absolute truth, or it is a fabrication of men, the more worthless because it seeks to bolster itself up by false pretenses. That being so, Christianity cannot argue with other religions and compromise with them, accepting something and giving something. It can only say: "This is the truth of God uttered by God himself, and there is no other religious truth possible. Accept it or reject it at the peril of your soul." How, then, can Christians come together with Buddhists, Brahmins, Mohammedans, Jews and Zoroastrians to discuss their religion with them on equal terms? How can they treat them otherwise than as infidels who are the surer of damnation because they have seen the light of heaven and turned away from it? In Chicago, hospitality to all religious indicates agnostic indifference to them all.

The last remark is doubtless true: it was indifference, not true Christian charity, that made the Parliament of Religions possible.
