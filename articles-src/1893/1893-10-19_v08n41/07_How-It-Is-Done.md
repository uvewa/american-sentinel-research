IN England we have two societies for the purpose of enforcing Sunday observance: one "The Lord's Day Rest Association Society," and the other "The Working Men's Lord's Day Rest Association, Limited." The chief aim of these societies is to show that Sunday is the Sabbath. They proceed upon two distinct lines of thought. They first start on the foundation of the institution of the Sabbath at creation, and then come down through the Bible, bringing forward as an irresistible array of texts which refer to the seventh day, and are all meant to apply; they reach that restitution of Christ, and hence they attempt to shift all the evidence they have been piling up, and make all they have said apply to Sunday. The transfer is not accomplished by means of logic; for it can only be performed in one of two ways, namely, either by "the sleight of hand (Eph. 4:11); and the lying wonders" (2 Thess. 2:9); and from it we are tempt it of of great interest.

"Is the Sabbath," by Rev. J. Gretten, D.D., secretary of the first society.

There remains but one other question. Can the first day of the week, with its hallowed associations, be called the seventh day? We answer, it can; and he calls the other the first day of the week because it is now first in order. The seventh day is, therefore, not the seventh day absolutely. There came a time in the world's history when, in order to crown the Lord of life by day, dead in the tomb, and raised on the first day of the week, the original relation of the days was reversed, and from that day time, divine and glorious, was actually the seventh day of the week.

Could any argument be more fanciful and absurd than the above? Where did it fall? At a Parliament a representative of Germany, surely, but it is surpassed by Dr. Gretten's "explanation" of "the Christian Sabbath" (for made society). He says of "our Lord":—

He kept the old day always and to the last. He was sent to the Jews alone, and the old Sabbath was brought to his case. He left the old Sabbath in his death, but gave back to all its light and truth in the most glorious one—the Lord's Day.

Such talk is sheer nonsense. How could any thinking people be imposed upon as this is promoted by grave doctors of divinity as at the best the truth?

The other society publishes a pamphlet called *Cardinal Bismarck* as chief of the Pope against the civil which some have been circulated. But we cannot refrain from these efforts. The author says: "The institution of the Sabbath, and comes down the historic track through successive centuries. He has sincerely tried to serve his cause. He reaches the life and work of Jesus Christ, and again presents a force of the Apostle's teaching, and the custom of the early church."

On the first day of the week, in memory of our Lord's resurrection, the early Christians kept the Lord's Day. The apostles were divers insistent to make that the Sabbath of their followers.

As an example of hopelessness, let this last quotation serve as a sample of the rest. From the holy prophets an unwarrantable assumption that the first day was kept is made; not without all possibility of any one testing that or discovering anything.

In another pamphlet put out by the same society, *Twelve Plain Reasons Why You Should Keep the Lord's Day Better,* Mr. Davis is a wise man. He says:—

> But the fact that with the charge of dispensation, a change in the day of the weekly Sabbath seemed good to the Church, which was guided by the Holy Spirit, just as our modern Sabbath. The day is not at all important—obedience is all.

So he hurries off to a less dangerous ground, marrying his reader into the safety of the first day of worship.

Now are circulated all the endeavors of the Sunday advocates, the first are the provisions for "shifting" the commandment from the seventh to the first day,—and the confusion he likes it. Well might Paul have said, "I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."

The gospel he preached is in all the New Testament "the gospel of the kingdom," nowhere are we taught that it will convert the whole world, but it shall be "preached to all the nations" as "a people for his name;" and "then shall the end come." Matt. 24:14. Through these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, their righteousness would deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God.
