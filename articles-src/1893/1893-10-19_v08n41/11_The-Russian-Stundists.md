## The Russian Stundists.

THERE enemies themselves admit that a Stundist family is a model of peace and unity. The children display the greatest love to their parents, and such a thing as a parent punishing a child is almost unknown. The virtue of extreme cleanliness is energetically inculcated among them, and the prevailing filth and disorder of the Russian hut is nowhere seen among the Stundists. It has been often remarked by Russian writers on the subject that a Stundist's first desire is to learn to read and write, his second to teach his children—their great object being to study the New Testament. A Stundist never willingly sends his children to the village school; they would there hear their parents scoffed at and maligned, they would be taught to venerate everything connected with the corrupt Russian Church, and to worship trans.

In the vicinity of the German colonies many Stundists may be found who have a fair knowledge of German, and who read German religious books. The vast majority of them are engaged in agriculture, out in the towns a good many Stundist artisans may be found—millers, smiths, carpenters, tailors, etc. I will close this article with a few extracts from the Russian press, from the writings of men altogether hostile to Stundists, but men, nevertheless who have been obliged to testify to their worth and superiority to the ordinary Russian moujik. A writer in the Kief Diocesan Reporter, an ultra-Orthodox paper, says: "The character of the Stundists is as opposed to the use of force as to using deception." "All who really know them," says another well known writer, "recognize that they are honorable, temperate, wise, industrious, devoted to work and to the enlightenment of their minds by reading."

M. Emilyanoff, one of their bitterest enemies, is obliged to confess that "the Stundists are a most hard-working folk, peaceful, abstemious, truthful, sober in their language, and leading Christian lives. Such a thing as a crime is hardly known among them. Their highest-duty, they consider, is to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the sick and the pilgrim." But perhaps the most striking testimony to their moral elevation is contained in a report written by M. Shugaevsky, an Orthodox official of the ministry of justice, a gentleman who lived for many years in their midst, and who thoroughly understood their origin and the trend of their movement. "They are remarkable for their pure morality," he writes. "In villages inhabited by Stundists crime finds no footing; the family life is a model of chastity and peace, and their relations to one another are those of sincere Christians. Thanks to their total abstinence from strong drink, their economical position stands infinitely higher than that of the Orthodox population, and as to their intellectual superiority there can be no doubt, for they can almost all read and are deeply versed in the precepts of the Holy Scriptures."—Foreign Correspondence of the New York Observer.
