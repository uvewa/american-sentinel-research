## A Wonderful Scheme.

### SPEAKING of the Sunday Rest Congress, the Examiner (Baptist) says:—

> There are widely divergent views even among devout Christians with regard to the "metes and bounds" of Sunday observance, and especially respecting the admissible and desirable degree of governmental restriction of freedom of action. One of our own most devout and conservative religious teachers has suggested that perhaps all that Christians can properly ask of the civil power is protection in their Lord's day worship. Others, and we think wisely, insist that all men should be protected in what we believe to be their "divine right" to a weekly rest day, on the broad ground of the general welfare. There is much diversity of view, also, among individual Christians as to how best to observe Sunday in order to derive the largest physical, mental, and spiritual benefit from the rest day.
>
> No one man or body of men can be presumed to have attained to the whole truth concerning this great question in all its hearings. What may be a very simple matter, so far as one's own personal conduct is concerned, becomes a difficult and complex question when large masses of men must be considered. The problem grows more serious as population increases, and especially in the great cities. No one can say dogmatically what is the best thing to be done. Perhaps a satisfactory solution will never be reached. Yet a thorough discussion, from different points of view, of this great, broad, perplexing Sunday question, in all its varied aspects, as proposed in the programme of the Chicago Congress, may be expected to throw new light on the subject.
>
> Light, indeed, is sorely needed. The present outlook is not encouraging. Our Sunday laws are crude, conflicting, often designedly favorable to those who most need restraint for the good of their fellow men, and, such as they are, are rarely enforced. Public opinion is too generally acquiescent in the open violation of the laws and the flagrant refusal of the authorities to punish the law-breakers. If the congress does no more than awaken fresh interest in the subject by the light shed upon it, the object of its assembling will not be wholly lost. But we hope it will do more than that.

This is indeed a most peculiar question. Nobody knows how the day ought to be observed, and yet the majority are of the opinion that the State ought to make and enforce laws to secure its proper observance! "Light, indeed, is sorely needed." But notwithstanding the general fog that exists on this subject, the Examiner hopes that the congress will do more than simply awaken fresh interest in the subject; that is, our contemporary hopes that such an impetus will be given to Sunday legislation that the State will step in and settle the vexed question of how Sunday ought to be kept by compelling all to observe it alike. Wonderful scheme, truly!
