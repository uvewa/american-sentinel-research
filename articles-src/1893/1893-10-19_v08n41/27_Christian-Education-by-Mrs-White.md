A VERY neat and acceptable volume on "Christian Education," by Mrs. E. G. White, has reached the SENTINEL desk. It bears the comprehensive and ringing motto, "True knowledge is divine," and the matter which fills its pages is in keeping with its motto. The prefatory note to the reader summarizes most completely and concisely the purpose of this book in these words: "The whole subject of Christian education is treated from the broadest standpoint, with valuable principles and suggestions applicable to every stage of child development; and it is confidently believed that this little work will prove a blessing, both in a richer personal experience and in an increased ability for service, to every one who will read it thoughtfully."

The spirit of this book from beginning to end is, that all, both old and young, should, in all things, be taught of the Lord.
