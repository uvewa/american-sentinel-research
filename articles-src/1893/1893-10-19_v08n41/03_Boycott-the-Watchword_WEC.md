## "Boycott" the Watchword.

The term "boycott" is of comparatively recent origin, having been in use less than a dozen years. The word originated in Ireland, and is derived from a man's name, Captain Boycott, a land agent of Mayo, Ireland, where, because of a dislike to him by the tenants of the community in which he held the control of lands, they all combined and refused to have anything to do with his land, and it was impossible to secure renters therefor. From this circumstance the word is coined and the definition given is the withholding of social or business relations from a certain individual or corporation and an endeavor to deter others from holding such relations.

This is the very spirit that the seer of Patmos beheld as he looked down through the ages and saw the edict go forth that no man should buy or sell save he who had the mark of the beast. This is nothing more than the papal badge—the Sunday Sabbath. It is a well known and acknowledged fact that it was the threats of a withdrawal of political support on the part of the "Christian lobbyists" in Washington at the last session of the Legislature that did more than anything else to secure the Sunday-closing proviso of the World's Fair appropriation. Three years ago President Blanchard, while in attendance at the district meeting of the American Sabbath Union at Des Moines said that the way to stop the Sunday newspaper was to boycott it, and emphasized his opinion with this utterance, "Why, I would rather swear for half an hour than to buy a Sunday newspaper for a minute."

Rev. Alfred H. Henry, a Methodist minister of Chicago, at a mass meeting held a year ago the 25th of last month, told the assembly that the "vulnerable point of the merchant of to-day who opens his store on Sunday is not his head nor his heart, but is his pocket book," and then expressed the "wish that it could be agreed upon to patronize only those who close on the Sabbath." As the outgrowth of this, resolutions were passed, one of which was—

> Resolved, That it be the sense of this meeting that we, the purchasing public of this, the West Side, do agree not to purchase any goods sold by any store that may keep open its doors on the Sabbath, and do further agree to exert our influence in every way practicable for the closing of stores on the Sabbath.

This is only a sample of what we see cropping out everywhere,—seeking coercion as to Sunday observance by means of the boycott.

On Sunday the 1st instant, there was a mass meeting held under the auspices of the Sunday Rest Association in Chicago, called to order by Pres. C. C. Bonney, and addresses were made by quite a number of the leading lights in this movement, the general discussion being in the trend of securing laws for Sunday closing. According to the report of the meeting in the Inter Ocean of the next day, the speaker who elicited the most applause was Rev. O. P. Gifford, when he declared that a list of the Sunday dealers ought to be made out and nobody should buy from them on Monday, then said, "I would rather preach without a shirt on Sunday than buy it on Monday from a man who kept open on Sunday."

Thus are the advocates of compulsory Sunday rest seeking to wheel the masses into line with their ideas of an outward increased regard for the day by appealing to the basest of all motives, rather than to "the law and the prophets." Surely the lines are drawing closer and closer, and he is stone blind who cannot see that it will end in religious intolerance of the very worst kind. Is it not time that a warning voice should be heard?
