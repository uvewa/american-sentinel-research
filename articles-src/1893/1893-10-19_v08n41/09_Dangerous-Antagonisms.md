A LATE incident in St. Paul, Minn., where a public speaker was denied the opportunity of delivering addresses, previously contracted for, because the proprietors of the halls feared that his speeches would attack the institutions of the day, was refused the use of the hall, which showed a condition of things secretly cherished by a large number of the taxpayers of this community. "The adherents were Catholics in character and were claimed to be under the patronage of the American Protective Association. The city clerk of St. Paul is reported to have held the advance against the society, and both the Knights of St. Paul and the Ancient Order of Hibernians had protested against his appearance and declared that they would not allow such a meeting to be held if they were obliged to use force." There does not exist at the present time a greater menace to civil rights and public peace in this country than these organizations have become in their defined,—organized, and in some cases military and armed, with the avowed purpose of making effective their pretensions of religious prejudices, bigotry, and hatred. If by any unforeseen occasion they break, or a conceited merits of them, shall start a coalition of religious terrorism to be instituted,—then the citizens of the United States at large will awake to a realization of the dangerous and destructive character of the forces which have been gathering and organizing supervised for years. There is no reason why they should not exist in their open relationship, and to the public. Their methods and their purposes, though, confessedly secret, have not been so closely concealed as not to have been patent to any interested observer. The only reason why these organizations have grown to their present proportions,—the only reason that can be given why public opinion has not, by the fat of its powerful displeasure, long ago done away with them, is because they answer to an innate intolerance and fanatical tendency which still stirred within the hearts of such a majority of Americans in secret, and which makes disreputable and revolutionary methods—easy to be the result of the friction of mob usage against mob organization.

IT is desirable to distinction to be made in these associations, they are all equally a menace to civilization, alike dangerous in their intentions. It matters not that one calls itself Protestant and the other Catholic, they are all impelled and directed by the same evil spirit of hate. They equally appeal to the sword and they both will eventually accomplish an equal destruction, though they are, each, conclusions through they may be, will suffer with them.
