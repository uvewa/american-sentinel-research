THE *Independent*, of October 5, contains a paper on "Is This World Growing Better or Worse?" Upon this the AMERICAN SENTINEL ventures to answer to the request of the evangelist. One paragraph from Mr. Moody reads:—

> Men who reject the truth grow worse and worse and are deceiving and being deceived; but for the children of light, a better day is coming. The facts which every one who is not willfully blind can see, the increase of crime, as the teaching of Scripture, clearly show that the trend of evil is to worse. The depression will end in a great crash to end; but for a short time there is a good work of grace to be done, and the gospel must be preached to the nations ere Jesus comes.

This is reasonable and noble optimism. There are vasts based on scriptural facts and the true source of prophecy. Yet, as a test, Mr. Moody does more with this than he. Mr. Moody alone more with the prophets than the world and the fame of this world. It would seem most reasonable, in view of the inspired word that perilous times shall come in the last days, that all evil and cruelty shall abound in the heart of the wicked, that "evil and seducers shall wax worse and worse."
