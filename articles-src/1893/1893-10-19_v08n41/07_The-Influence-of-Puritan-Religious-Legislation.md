## The Influence of Puritan Religious Legislation Upon Subsequent Christianity.

[ A thesis prepared by T. J. Van Horn of the University of Chicago. ]

History is not an artificial grouping of isolated facts. "No man liveth unto himself" is a well-established fact in social life. Equally true it is that no fact in history stands alone. If it is true, as Emerson says, that there is a relation between the hours of our life and the centuries of time, much more is there an organic relationship existing between the facts of history. One stands related to events preceding which have caused it, and to events following after, of which it is itself the cause. He is a poor student of history who knows only the location of the battle of Putters, its date, the forces engaged on each side, the number of killed and wounded, the name of the generals in command, and allows his inquiry to stop there. He will be a student in a truer sense who seeks an answer to the questions, Why did this battle occur? What are the consequences to follow?

In no branch of investigation is the question "Why?" more important and appropriate than in history. It is often times not the easiest of solution. It may require the wisdom of inspiration to reveal the import of the "Mere, mere, tekel upharsis," marking off the epochs of time. Some one has said that history is an intricacies of causes and effects, acting and reacting upon one another. And the success of the student will depend upon his ability to interpret a fact in its relation to other facts, and its bearing upon the whole.

Puritanism is one such epoch. It has had a marked influence, not only upon the life of the Church, but upon the general events of the world.

Like every other epoch, it has had its rising sun, its days, not without clouds and storms, and its setting sun. Martyrs has aptly said, an epoch is not cut short by dates.

The departure from the New Testament doctrine of the general priesthood of believers, and the establishment of an ecclesiastical hierarchy; the merging of pagan philosophy with the simple truths of Jesus of Nazareth; the confusion of Church and civil power; the substitution of the central doctrine of Christianity, salvation through faith in Christ, for the outward forms of that religion, were important steps leading down into the darkness of the age in which the popes, and ignorance and superstition, held sway. The age in which the word of man was substituted for the Word of God, and that precious document, hid away by the careful craft of jealous ecclesiastics, never reached the ear of man except as it came perverted and distorted. A period, in short, which made an age like puritanism necessary.

One stands aghast at the state of corruption in the Church which the early light of the reformation revealed. But the scholarship of Wycliffe, the wit of Erasmus, and the brave enthusiasm of men like Luther and Tyndale, drew the Bible from the monasteries; wrenching it from the jealous hands of the popes, they broke the seal of the dead languages which for centuries had kept it from view, and translating it into the tongue of the common people, scattered it broadcast over the land. Ere many years the prophecy of Tyndale to an angry theoligan,—"If God shall be my helper I will cause the boy who drives the plow to know more of the Bible than you do," began to be fulfilled.

The despotism of the hierarchy had been broken, and long strides had been taken in that reform which the Puritans sought to perfect, when Thomas Cartwright, in the middle of Elizabeth's reign, began his career which historians have somewhat arbitrarily indicated as the beginning of puritanism. But Elizabeth, as it has been said of Luther himself, did not begin to get the rags of popery off her. If her legislation against Romanism was especially "stinging and acute," it was prompted by a jealous care of her own prerogative. It was legislation aimed at Roman interference in England, rather than against Romish doctrine and discipline. "Her ritual," says one, "differed to little from the papal forms of service that a stranger could not detect the difference." Against the policy of this maiden queen so determined to root them out, the Puritans, with the open Bible before them, felt called upon to protest. These dissenters, who were becoming so obnoxious in the eyes of Elizabeth and her coadjutors, were people who were making, and were not without the means of making, a comparison of the forms of religion which she sought to force upon them, and the forms prescribed in the New Testament. For, as Green says, "England became the land of a book, and that book was the Bible."

They were philosophic enough to detect a wide difference. On the ground of this difference they based their objection to the Anglican faith.

The vestments, confirmation, kneeling at the sacrament, bowing at the name of Jesus when pronounced, the priest's holy days, the form of baptismal service, the burial service, were some of the points to which the Puritans sternly objected. Not only because they were unscriptural, but because they were imposed by civil authority alone, nor yet so much because they were imposed by civil authority,—as we may justly infer from their subsequent history,—as because this civil authority was vested in one person. The queen and the court reformers, insisted on these as matters of indifference as far as Bible authority was concerned, and therefore might be enforced by civil law. The Puritans regarded them as matters of importance, because they were points of contact with the Romish church, and therefore must not be tolerated.

Not a discussion, nor even a statement of all the points of agreement and disagreement between the two parties, interesting as it might be, should detain us here. One, however, stated by Neale, in his admirable resume of the salient features of these points, in his history of the Puritans, is important for us in the consideration of our topic. Both Puritan and conformist agreed too well in asserting the necessity of uniformity in public worship, and for using the sword of the magistrate for the support and defense of their principles of which both made an ill use whenever they could grasp the power in their hands. The standard of uniformity, according to one, was the queen's supremacy and the statute laws, according to the other, the decree of provincial and national synods allowed and enforced by the civil magistrate. Neither party admitted that liberty of conscience which is every man's right. With an inflexible zeal the Puritans began to promulgate their views; and with an iron purpose to enforce uniformity according to her standard, the queen began to persecute. But, in spite of her rigorous measures of suppression, they spread with rapidity, until, within half a century after the death of Elizabeth, the civil power of England was in the hands of the Puritans. The Lord Protector Cromwell was peremptorily dictating terms of peace with Holland, inspiring the awe, and receiving the compliments, of the crowned heads of Europe, and even frightening the Pope himself with the threat, that unless he redressed the cruelties inflicted upon the Waldeness in the Piedmont, his cannon would thunder at the gates of Rome. Such, briefly and imperfectly, was puritanism in its inception, principles, and what it came to be in temporal power. How shall we regard this strange phenomenon of civil and religious history, which, in so short a time, rose to such prominence in the annals of the world? How shall we interpret some of the strange facts and incongruities which we notice in the progress of their growth and development?

That there should arise such a reaction against religious tyranny and oppression, does not seem strange to one who knows something of human nature and has studied the movements of history with any purpose. With a principle which they considered of supreme importance and for which they firmly stood, though opposed by fire and sword, it is not unaccountable nor unnatural that the Puritans should develop a moral character which has exercised the power of orators to extol, and the genius of the poets to sing; and to which has been justly ascribed the preservation of the most in our moral and religious character that is of permanence and value. That this moral power should attain such strength among them, situated and environed as they were, until Cromwell's "Ironsides" advancing irresistibly against the forces of King Charles I., may be regarded as its fit emblem, is not phenomenal.

More difficult is it to understand why there was not a reaction against religious legislation, since he had suffered so much under it,—that, when on American shores the Puritan was left free to exercise his own prerogative, he would avoid it as he would an intolerant monster from whose clutches he had just escaped. How is it that with the Bible and the lessons of the past before him, he did not learn the lesson of religious toleration, and take hold of the idea of Christian liberty which the New Testament teaches? Why is it that their administration under the protectorate after all their bitter experience and sufferings, seemed so nearly to justify the criticism of Macaulay, who says of them, "They were as intolerant and meddling as ever Laud had been." They interdicted under heavy penalties the use of the Book of Common Prayer, not only in churches, but in private houses. It was crime, in a child, to read by the bedside of a sick parent one of those beautiful collects which had soothed the griefs of forty generations of Christians. Clergymen of respectable character were not only ejected from their benefices by thousands, but were frequently exposed to the outrages of a fanatical rabble. "One of the first resolutions of the Barebones Parliament was that no one should be admitted to the public service till the House should be satisfied of his real godliness." And after all there seems to be some occasion for the sneer of this brilliant historian that "the Puritans hated bear baiting, not because it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators."

(To be continued.)
