REV. LESLIE SPRAGUE of the Second Unitarian Church, of San Francisco, preached a sermon a few Sundays ago on the subject, "Sunday and the Midwinter Exposition," in which he said:—

> The question was raised in Chicago long before there was any certainty of a Fair, and the preachers became corrupt politicians by threatening the heads of congressmen who dared to make appropriations to an open Fair. The question came up here when the project was fully started, one preacher refusing to assist in the opening exercises unless he could be assured that the Fair would be closed on Sunday.

In this Sunday question a spirit has been raised which, be it conjured ever so wisely, will never down until the revealed end of all evil has come.
