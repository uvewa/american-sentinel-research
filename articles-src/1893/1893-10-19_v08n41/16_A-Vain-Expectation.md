**A Vain Expectation.**

The Sabbath Outlook seems to anticipate, as a result of the present agitation of the Sabbath question, a general return of Protestants to the observance of the Bible Sabbath. It is vain to expect any such thing. The language of the Apostle in 2 Tim. 3:1-5, forbids any such hope:—

> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incumbent, fierce, despiers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

This is a picture of the professed church of Christ in the last days, for it describes those who have a form of godliness.

The multitudes never have been loyal to God. God's people are the "little flock," the "remnant," etc., not the majority. Said the Saviour:—

> Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

That this is not true simply of a portion of what is known as the gospel dispensation, and that in the latter part of it all will be converted, is evident from the words of our Lord in Matt. 24:37-39:—

> But as the days of Nos were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Nos entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

The gospel is to "be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations," but nowhere are we taught that it will convert all, or even the majority. God is taking out of the nations "a people for his name," but the gospel deals with individuals. "Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord."
