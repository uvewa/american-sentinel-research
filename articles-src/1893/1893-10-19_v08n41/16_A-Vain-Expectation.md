THE Sabbath cannot be restored, or revived, as some seem to anticipate, as a result of the present agitation. It exists, as Sabbath of creation, as a general return of a community's observance of the Bible Sabbath. It is vain to expect any such result from even civil legislation. 1 Tim. 3:1-5, forhids any such hope.

Open Sunday streets must go; it is even now in evidence. For man shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.

This is a picture of the professed church of Christ in the last days, for it describes those who have a form of godliness while denying the power thereof.

This terrible forecast says no little thing about the hope of the world's conversion. Only one thing can be done by the observance. Godly. Said the Saviour, "When the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth?"

That this is not true simply of a portion of the people of the earth at some remote period and some distant country, but is a life picture, throughout the latter part of it is the latter days. A comparison of this with the message of our Lord in Matt. 24:37-39, compels the thoughtful student to the conclusion, "As it was in the days of Noah; so shall it be in the days of the Son of man." For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

The gospel he preached is in all the New Testament "the gospel of the kingdom;" nowhere are we taught that it will convert the whole world, but it shall be preached to all the nations "a people for his name;" and "then shall the end come." Matt. 24:14. Through these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, their righteousness would deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God.
