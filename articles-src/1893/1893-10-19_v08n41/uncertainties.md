# Uncertainties — v08n41 (1893-10-19)

## Article 01 — "Fatherhood of God and Brotherhood of Man" (WHM)

- **Author identification:** The article is signed "W. H. M." The masthead lists "WILLIAM H. BURKE" as an associate editor, not "W. H. McKee" (WHM in the known initials list). However, in other 1893 issues W. H. M. has appeared as William H. McKee. The masthead for this issue clearly names "WILLIAM H. BURKE" as the second associate editor. This discrepancy between the known initials list (WHM = W. H. McKee) and the masthead (WILLIAM H. BURKE) is noted. Transcribed as WHM per convention; the identity of the associate editor bearing these initials in this period should be verified against other issues.

## Article 07 — "The Influence of Puritan Religious Legislation" (T. J. Van Horn)

- **Attribution:** The article is introduced as "A thesis prepared by T. J. Van Horn of the University of Chicago." This is treated as a reprint/contributed piece from the University of Chicago. The original_publication field is set to "University of Chicago" as the institutional source, though it may have been originally published elsewhere (e.g., a journal). No attribution correction possible from the OCR file alone.

## Article 11 — "The Russian Stundists"

- **OCR uncertainty (Page 6):** The word "worship trans" at the end of the first paragraph appears to be an OCR error or scan damage. The sentence reads: "they would be taught to venerate everything connected with the corrupt Russian Church, and to worship trans." This appears to be a truncated or damaged word. Second pass: the word may be "transubstantiation" or similar doctrine, but the OCR is clearly incomplete. Transcribed as "worship trans" exactly as it appears in the OCR source; this should be verified against the original scan.
- **Confidence:** LOW — "trans" is clearly an OCR artifact; the full word is unknown from context alone.

- **Name consistency:** "Stundists" is spelled "Standist" in two places in the OCR source (page 6). These appear to be OCR misreadings of the same word. Corrected to "Stundists" throughout for consistency.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — "Standist" is clearly a misread of "Stundist" given consistent use of "Stundist" elsewhere in the same article.

## Page 8 date discrepancy

- The page 8 masthead area shows "NEW YORK, OCTOBER 19, 1899" — this is clearly a misprint or OCR error; the correct date is 1893-10-19 as established by the issue identification. All articles dated 1893-10-19.
