## Church and State.

POINT is given to the current discussion of the relation of Church and State in the efforts now being made in this country to bring them into essential union through sectarian appropriations by individual States of the Federal Government. These efforts are in direct violation of the genius of our institutions and the theory of our Government, which is that Church and State shall be separate, the one advancing the spiritual and the other the secular interests of the people, and each having its own revenues. Under the Constitution, no religious test as a qualification for official position or public trust is required, and the passage by Congress of any law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press is expressly prohibited. These provisions are tantamount to a declaration of the separation of Church and State, a condition further emphasized by the first amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits Congress from making any law respecting an establishment of religion or forbidding the free exercise thereof.

It is unfortunate that the principle thus enunciated has not been given complete and definite expression in the constitutions of all the States. Many of them provide no adequate safeguard against the violation of religious freedom, and impose no express prohibition against the making of sectarian appropriations. Legislation involving such appropriations, and through them the violation of religious freedom, is being constantly introduced into State legislatures, many of which can and do grant them by a mere majority vote of the assembly. Such legislation is a clear violation of the letter and spirit of the Constitution, and constitutes a serious menace to American institutions in that it not only stimulates sectarian greed, but introduces the Church into politics, to the grave peril of both Church and State. Its whole tendency is to degrade religion by involving its forces in an unseemly struggle for spoils, and to deprive questions which affect the rights and privileges of the people of proper consideration by bringing sectarian animosities and controversies into their discussion. Absolute separation of Church and State alone secures the religious freedom which is the right of all men, as well as the highest civil liberty. It is the divine order of relation, and assures the citizen complete liberty of choice in his religious and political faiths.—N. Y. Observer.
