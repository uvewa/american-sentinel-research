THE Sunday Rest Congress at Chicago closed with a supplementary meeting on Sunday afternoon, October 1. Among the auspices of the Sunday Best observance at Chicago. One of the speakers at this meeting said:

> Open Sunday streets must go; it is even now in evidence that the growing influence of the Illinois State Federation of Labor, and the Chicago Trades and Unions Council have also been heard was sending to their a telling and strong message on Sunday closings. We want education and instruction. The workingmen themselves demanded it. The government of the community upon all the work of moral, the pressure of all.

The government is proposed to meet in its several assemblies the questions of the day in the legislation on matters of religion. Liberty of conscience is the indisputable right of every man. Every man has the right to regard the first day of the week as a day of rest, or the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath.

Without the protection of the free government all labor stands together, and the protecting arm of the law workingmen would be the protecting arm of the law workingmen would be at the mercy of the unscrupulous employer, and if the employers regularly the employees were not threatened and persecuted for the free exercise of this right. It is the protecting arm of the law restraining the greedy arm of the employer which keeps the workingman from enjoying his one day of rest in seven. It therefore is plain that the principle of a civil Sabbath is wrong, and no person who keeps the Sabbath has a right to this protection.

The civil law should be framed and constructed so as not to interfere with the rights of such men, should they choose to keep any day of the week as their day of rest. There have been too many enactments in the United States requiring the observance of Sunday as a kind of civil permission: for principles sake, men who will
