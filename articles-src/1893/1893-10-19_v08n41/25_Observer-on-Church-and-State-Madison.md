ON another page is published a short article from the Observer, on "Church and State," which is worthy serious attention. One point is specially apt, namely, that efforts are now being made in this country to bring Church and State into essential union by sectarian appropriations. There is an admission that there may be a virtual union of Church and State without a legal establishment, or formal recognition of some denomination as the State Church. But why does the Observer use the word "sectarian"? "Who does not see," said James Madison in 1785, "that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish, with the same ease, any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other sects?" With equal propriety might the question be asked: Who does not see that the same authority which can give pecuniary aid or show special favors to Christianity to the exclusion of all other religions, can with the same ease confer pecuniary or other benefits, upon any particular sect of Christians in exclusion of all other sects? Many professed Protestants can see and appreciate the evils of Church and State union at the points of first contact, only when Roman Catholics are the beneficiaries.
