**Principle or Popularity?**

There is an infectiousness in the example of a crowd which only a firm backbone of principle and some independence of mind, will enable us to resist. The tendency is to follow the multitude, even when it is to do evil. Men like to be on the side that is popular. They dread the reproach of singularity. There are those who would almost rather die than be out of the fashion. A crowd can ridicule, and a crowd can intimidate. It may put pressure on us which we have not the moral courage to resist. A thing does not look so evil, when many are engaged in doing it. They do not, of course, call it evil. They put new names upon it, and laugh at us for our scruples. This may lead us to think that the course in which we are asked to join is not so very bad after all. So we belie or dissemble our real convictions, and do what the crowd bids us.

As counteractives to the influence of the crowd we do well to remember that the vox populi is not always vox Dei; that the fashion of the day can never make that right which the law of God declares to be wrong; that the voice of the multitude is one thing to-day, and another thing to-morrow, while truth and duty remain one and the same.—Pulpit Commentary.
