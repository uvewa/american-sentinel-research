THERE is an infirmity in the disposition of a crowd which only a firm backbone, which is a thing that can only be possessed of principle and not of popular will, unable to resist. The tendency of mankind is to go with the crowd when it is to do evil. Men like to be on what they think is the popular side. They dread the reproach of singularity. There are those who would almost rather die than be out of the fashion. A crowd can run millions, and a crowd can intimidate. It may put great store on us which we have not the moral purpose to resist. A thing does not look so evil, when many are engaged in doing it. They do not, of course, add any virtue. But put now names to sign it, and laugh at the fool or outrage. This may lead us to be very watchful of our own moral convictions and what the crowd would do, asked to join it is not so very bad after all. Let us beware of the weight of its temptations, and do what the crowd bids us not. Accomplishing the work to the use of the crowd we do well to remember that the real people is not always on our; that the fashion of the day can never make that right which the law of God declares to be wrong; that this voice of the multitude is one thing to-day, and another thing to-morrow, while truth and only truth abides and the name.—*Papal Communion.*
