**Vigilance Needed.**

In a "stall" in the Government building, at the World's Fair, there is, at this very time, persons soliciting names to a petition to have God recognized in the Constitution, and in the next "stall" is another petition to have the Bible taught in the public schools. And the awful truth is, that nearly everybody signs them! I got this, directly, from one who has just returned from the Fair, where he was asked to sign these petitions. Brethren, what does this all mean? Is not the situation an awful one? Is it not time to arouse and do active missionary work, by circulating the AMERICAN SENTINEL and other literature?

The alarming feature about these petitions is that many sign them, little thinking what the result will be.—The Reaper, Wash.
