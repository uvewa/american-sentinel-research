IN a word, in the discussions upon religious legislation, at the World's Fair, there is, at hand, a petition to have God recognized in the National Constitution. There is another petition to have the Bible taught in the public schools. And the truth is, that nearly every body signs them! A gentleman of high standing who has just returned from the Fair, where he had asked to have them signed, says: "But, what does this all mean? Is not the world asleep on our side? Is it not time to arouse the people?" We recommend circulating the AMERICAN SENTINEL, and the time calls for it.

THE alarming feature about these petitions is that many sign them, flat, unthinking what the result will be.—*The Reaper.*
