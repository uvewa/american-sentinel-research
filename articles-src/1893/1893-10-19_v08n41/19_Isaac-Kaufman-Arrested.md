ISAAC KAUFMAN, the keeper of a fancy goods store at 153 Grand Street, this city, was arrested on Sunday, October 8, by detective Sloan, for selling him a handkerchief, in violation of the Sunday law. Mr. Kaufman was held for trial and gave bail in the amount of one hundred dollars. An orthodox Jew has been arrested for buying the handkerchief on the same occasion.
