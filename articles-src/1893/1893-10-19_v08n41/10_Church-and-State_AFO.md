POINT is given to the current discussion of the relation of Church and State in the country now being made in this country to bring them into essential union through some of the offences daily committed by States of the Federal Government. These offences are in direct violation of the genius and letter of the Constitution of the Government, which is that Church and State are two things entirely separate, the spiritual and the other the secular institution of the country, each having its own revenues. Under the Constitution, no religious test as a qualification for holding a position or public trust is required, and no man need have any fear of being persecuted for abridging the freedom of speech or of the press is extremely prohibited. These Constitutional provisions, providing, so far as the separation of Church and State, a considerable amount of protection under and amendment to the Constitution, which absolutely precludes Congress from making any law respecting an establishment of religion or forbidding the free exercise thereof.

It is unfortunate that the principle thus recognized in the Constitution does not find definite expression in the constitutions of all the States. Many of them provide directly in their constitutions for the protection of religious freedom, and impose no religious test. But many of them make no separate appropriation. Legislating requiring public appropriations, and through them the violation of religious freedom, is being constantly introduced into these legislatures, many of which can and do pass with calmness, with a unanimity that is amazing. Such legislation is a direct violation of the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Even though the Constitution says to American institutions in that it not in every State been observed, and it has had done the Church into politics, to the gross part of both Church and State. Its whole tendency is to degrade religion by involving the forms in an undignifying struggle for spoils, and to deprave politics in lines which are affect the selfish privileges of the people of proper constitution by bringing sectarian animosities and corrupting and retarding legislation. The separation of Church and State also conserves the religious freedom which is the right of all men, as well as the highest civil liberty. It is the divine order of creation, and secures the citizen complete liberty of choice in his religious and political faith.—*N. Y. Observer.*
