REV. LESLIE SPRAGUE of the Second Church of Christ, of San Francisco, preached a sermon a few Sundays ago on the subject of "Sunday and the World's Exposition," in which he said:—

The question was raised in Chicago long before there was any pretence of a Fair, that the question of how to become corrupt politicians by threatening the heads of congressmen who dared to make appropriation on open Fair. The question, closing or being open, was from the very outset, one of political manipulation. There is an administration, and there seem to realize that the Fair would be closed on Sunday.

The Nashville *Christian Advocate* publishes an editorial article on the Parliament of Religions, in which it criticises with much severity the effectiveness of the divine priest who returned in kind the enthusiastic salutations of some of the over-wrought women of the parliament, and classifies the foreigners all together.
