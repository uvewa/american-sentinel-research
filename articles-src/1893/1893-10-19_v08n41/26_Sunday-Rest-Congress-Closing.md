THE Sunday Rest Congress at Chicago closed with a supplementary meeting on Sunday afternoon, October 2, under the auspices of the Sunday Rest Association at Chicago. One of the speakers of the afternoon said:—

> Open Sunday stores must go; it is even now in sight. The American Federation of Labor, the Illinois State Federation of Labor, and the Chicago Trades and Labor Assembly have declared that no man working for a living shall buy anything on the Sabbath day. Within a month an ordinance will be presented to the city fathers for their consideration. The storekeepers themselves have signed the petition to have the Sunday-closing ordinance passed, while, besides, there are thousands of clerks who are begging that the law shall be made. Employers and employers together on the same petition ought to make a profound impression on the city council. I have no doubt that within a month the law will be passed and in force. Let the council make the law and we workingmen will see to it that it is enforced.

To those who have spent any time in Chicago the past summer it looks like undertaking a large contract to stop all Sunday traffic in Chicago, especially as the "workingmen" for whom it is so glibly promised here that they "will see to it that it is enforced," are divided among themselves on the subject, with the majority against any such enforcement.
