ATTENTION of the so-called Sabbath sentiment at the South, the *New York Evening Post* observes:—

"Among of so-called Sabbath sentiment at the World's Fair is conspicuously strong in the South. Recently a clergyman of Mobile, Ala., said that he had been doing his best to build up a Sunday school—and then gave it up, and the Montgomery paper explains that the people are indifferent about Sunday. There are some other points in which Southern practice is in advance of Northern practice. There are no Sunday papers in the East, whether sales or *issues,* and the Monday morning paper is unknown."

We regard it as a very notable fact that the Monday morning paper is unknown, and yet, approaching the Monday morning the reader finds these same papers working on Sunday at the South. The "religious" papers and other journals that oppose Sunday issues and approve that of Sunday morning can hardly be consistent. If in the counting-rooms of the newspapers clergy that go to press on Sunday, it is for the opening of the Monday paper for Sunday work in the morning. How it is that a desire to observe the day of rest pays the penalty of the transgression on Monday; what purpose publishers were paid to by the Sunday's edition, Mr. Jones has yet to show, and that the Sabbath-keepers who believe and find that progressive printing ought to be done in the best cities in Washington.

The *Catholic Review* remarks that "we must not flatter ourselves that the Sunday spirit is dead. It is a restless, active, and ceaseless spirit that can never be content with its plan and scale of itself in fact accounting as it is still alive." This notion. But what is it found of Puritanism? Styling it in the world to its spirit of papery device, it is the instrument of a self-governing error, and the principle of papery used is in opposition to the spirit of the one great American right to fail faith with Puritanism; it is the legitimate child of popery."
