Not only is the State powerless to control sin and enforce morality, but the individual is powerless to control sin in his own person. No person can by any exercise of strength, will, or resolution, break the power that sin has in his own life. Every human attempt to cope with sin has proved a failure and is destined to be so. How then can a State do for its citizens what no man can do for himself? How could a community of lepers legislate the disease out of their midst? As well may civil government undertake to counteract the evils of the human heart. They have tried it in years gone by, but the attempt has made martyrs or hypocrites of the subjects, and monsters of the zealots.

The only force that can oppose the power of evil is that represented by the gospel of Christ. "It is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom.1:16. Only the power of God can match the power of Satan. But God works by different methods than those employed by the State. The latter accompanies its behests by no persuasions. It does not entreat obedience and respect. It lays its strong hand upon the offender with an unmistakable "come along," that has no savor of mercy or forbearance. But not such are the methods of divine goodness. Says Paul: "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." Says Christ: "Behold I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him, and he with me."

The Father says: "I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee." These words represent the spirit of the gospel. Moral principle can only be cultivated by moral influences. A good character can only be formed by a voluntary choice of the good, and then the will must be mightily assisted by the grace of God. Faith in Christ as the Saviour from sin brings the soul into connection with divine strength and breaks the bondage of sin.
