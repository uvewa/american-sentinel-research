THE World's Fair Directors have decided not to reduce the fee for admission to the grounds on Sunday. The Fair will therefore remain "practically closed" on Sunday, and the forty thousand or more people who persist in going on that day, many of them, probably, because they cannot afford the time on other days, will continue to pay full price for less than half the show.
