THE prevailing idea that Sabbath keeping is rest, is, to my mind, far from the truth. Nowhere in God's Word do we find the Sabbath placed in the obligation to rest; but the Sabbath upon the fact that man must rest. To set up an obligation to make the object and the proper observance of his Sabbath something secondary makes a means of it, itself, far from Sabbath keeping. We do not *have* the Sabbath that we may rest, but rest that we may keep the Sabbath. An individual might not do a stroke of worldly business on that day, and still be in Sabbath-breaker. Proper Sabbath keeping is that in which the person so intelligently recognizes God's authority as to wish, as the highest aspiration of his own selfish interests. When he recognizes the Sabbath as a precious gift, willingly observes the commandment as a whole, and when he sees the special divine blessings placed upon that, above all other

days, he realizes that he not only has all the blessings that he has upon all other days, but, in addition to those, he enjoys the special blessing. And when the spirit within itself realizes that he was not going to have, as a mere human, "I will give him all that he desires," without being made his secular duties, and all thought of worldly pleasure and worldly business, he gives himself time to meditate, as he can to rest to call the Sabbath a delight. Then in fact it was his blessed Lord that made the seventh day and rested therein and had himself rested, and has sanctified it. He said to himself, "may I not also rest?" And he could not "find rest;" and so he turned and rested, but "that it he had rested from his work, as God did from His." (Heb. 4:10.) He knows that Christ, the Son of God, made the heavens and earth, and now the laws, heavens and earth and all the foundations and the sea must rest for the sanctified (Mark 2:27, 28, and Col. 1:18, (27), that they need not "cease from their labor." "For the world to fall through man's fall, and to be restored only by a new creation, in another by, the work of redemption in which is greater than creation which is greater in order to make complete" (Heb. 4:3.) See Eph. 3:1; v: 14; 1:10; Isa. 11:12. The Sabbath is no longer a mere obligation; it is real, and a remedy, a truly great. This, and this alone, is true Sabbath-keeping. If we make no serious mistake when we, place anything before it.—*W. Walker, in the Carolina Sportsman.*
