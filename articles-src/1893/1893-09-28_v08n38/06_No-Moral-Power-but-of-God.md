NOT only is the State powerless to convert and educate morally, the individual is powerless to control sin in any other man. Because the control of sin is entirely of strength, will, or resolution, and never a work of the State in any human life. Every human attempt to cope with sin has proved a failure and is doomed to fail; simply because it is not within the province of mere citizenship what is the moral difference to citizens what no man can do for himself God alone can give him the power to overcome the demons out of mind! As well has any government undertaken to counteract the evils of the human heart. They tried in the spirit, to save the man by his first attempt has made martyr or hypocrites of the subjects, and monuments of folly.

Thereby forceful can suppress the form of evil that represents for the good of society, but it is an utter impossibility by legislation to educate to every one that believes, and whatever has to do with the spirit, which is much the power of Satan. But God through his different methods than is employed by the State. The latter secures her position by persuasion. A constitution that does not extort obedience and respect, is says in strong stated upon the offender, with an unmistakable "come along," that has no savor of mercy or forbearance about it. But the method of the gospel is goodness. Says Paul: "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." Says Christ: "Behold I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him, and he with me.

The Father says: "I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee." Christianity thus represents the spirit of the Gospel, which is the moral Government ruled by moral influence. A good character is created only by doing the will and the desires of the good, and then the will must be implicitly pledged to the gospel. We go forth to Christ as the Saviour from sin, bringing to him all our weaknesses. He gives strength and breaks the bondage of sin.
