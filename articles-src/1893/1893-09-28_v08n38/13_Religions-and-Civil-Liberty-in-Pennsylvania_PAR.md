*[Continued from previous issue.]*

AS it has held its time until all professed orthodox Christianity is ready to return to the feet of "Mother Church," bringing the romance of japonicism with it.

Conversely, another prominent oriental character is found and the Puritan-like attitude of some such reformers, is this spoken, in the person of the Japanese Buddhist, Kinza Higu of Hirai. This gentleman, who is a man of learning and ability, speaking English with fluency and accuracy, and evidently well informed about the civil and religious polity of this English speaking people, declared undeniable:—

If any person should claim that there are many in Europe or America who look upon the missionaries with contempt, I shall frankly state that I was the first in my country who tried to introduce into Japan the broad Christianity, in the interest of pure Christianity, and then the pure Christianity done to all by the people of Christendom. If they would believe me, I should say "more than I, was first in Japan who ever organized Christianity, too to protect ourselves from false and hypocritical Christianity; these few Japanese have kept and studied and practiced what the Japanese call "Christianization," which claims to be constituted "Christianity."

One of the extreme offered by foreign nations to Japan was so very important in its practice, the principle of civilized law that the rights and profits of the offending foreigners should be only by the civil law, and courts of the country they reside. On the account of law is to protect the rights of the offending foreigner. The interest and the standard of law that the weaker should be sacrificed or the so-called Christian nations instead. But the Japanese are shinelens and beaters themselves.

As in the case of a Japanese merchant, partners and brothers, it is in Christian morality to apply the same law. The reader is confronted now with the dark state of injustice! I read in the Christian holy book the story of the Good Samaritan that is related therein. And there are many passages which say "Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain." "Sell all that thou hast, and give unto the poor."  "Love your neighbor as yourselves." Again, I read in the Bible, "if any man sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;" but I cannot discover there any Christian nation who gives the coat and the cloak also. I do not know any nation that pursues its pure morality is that of the Bible, especially the New Testament, and yet cannot understand the truth of the Bible; I saw the beautiful religion perverted and my nation sacrificed; I was inclined to reject Christianity, to reject; but am not able to despise the eloquence of the savior and wonder at his mysterious power. He does not condemn Christianity as long as they there it is a West of pure Christianity.

This is a noble dissent. The conclusion table deduction from the theory that the only qualification for the entrance of a state "Christian nations;" and therefore the argument and suggestion that when this basis of pure morality is that of the Bible, especially the New Testament. Thus it is that this nation and its subsequent situation into which the gospel goes.

*Chicago, Sept. 14.*

Men inevitably come to keep the blind-fold side of religion. "Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye?" etc. From Bible truth the human appeal is not to Christ, but to God; to weakness of "Modern Sabbath Reform." Dissent is the word. To be sure of the just moral code, civil only, kept under the authority of the civil law, and all others under the subordination of each, in its duty under the moral law.

"When conscious, applying from the recognized authority of the Sabbath, a subject higher than bolshevism can be reached. The Christian law above every other is to be applied. Where the principle is higher, so is the sanctity which flows therefrom are responsible and applicable."

Such dissent from error and extravagance of methods of those on this platform reformers have voiced in this grandison re-examination of the subject. It should be borne in mind—from the beginning of history to this day—to think—to ponder whether or to the real. The truth, with its splendid march across the wide sea is yet for Christ, to be yet a greater imposition, and the theorist is of a more challenging individual to follow. "To abandon evil and errors, to be subjected and to be as little children." These are to which the earnest Japanese pledge himself as for the future.

Every person ought to know now who is right and who is wrong. Every person ought to know now that Sunday, as a religious day, is a man-made institution. The spirit of Christianity shows evil men and seducers have waxed worse and worse. All history shows that when civil authority is made the ground, or basis of "religious" religion, the moral virtue is weakly put; the question comes to be a Religious liberty and civil liberty, from beginning, with things human and temporary. This brings ruin and desolation, never good order, and a blessed salvation.

By this alliance with the civil power, Seventh-day Adventists were persecuted, to-day in Tennessee and Maryland, and other States. By this alliance Quakers and Baptists were persecuted. By this alliance Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were banished. By this alliance the Lord of glory was crucified. John 19:12, 15, 16.
