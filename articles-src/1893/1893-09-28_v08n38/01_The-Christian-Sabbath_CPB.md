THE primary object of the Sabbath is not physical rest, but spiritual worship, says the Lord: "I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, *that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.*"

*Just as* days by men are set apart to keep in memory important events, so the Sabbath was set apart by the Lord to keep in the minds of his people the fact that he was their Creator. And since the fall, the fact that God is the Creator is the assurance of his power to redeem; hence the Sabbath is a sign of God, both as the Creator and Saviour.

In the struggle for existence, man forgets that his chief end is, not to perpetuate his life in this world, but "to glorify God and enjoy him forever." It is for this reason that the words of our Saviour, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath," are so often wrested from their true meaning. The idea is not that the Sabbath is subordinate primarily to physical enjoyment, but that it is for man's highest good. It was not given as a bonus, but as a friend to elevate and ennoble man, by bringing him to a better knowledge of the true God.

This view of the Sabbath is not peculiar to those who observe the day enjoined in the fourth commandment. Many Sundaykeepers also say in the weekly rest, a day of physical relaxation merely, but above and beyond all, a day of spiritual worship. In this the *Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia,* itself a scholarly work, says:—

"We define the Sabbath to be" the name "of a more common *rest* from work. Not so that *"most Christian clergymen and other Christians who work hard on* Sunday *observe their Sabbath* on Monday." But might not a Christian clergyman find his needed bodily and mental rest on Monday in fishing, hunting, or playing music? Would that "rest" be in harmony with the divine institution of the Sabbath? Does not that interpretation necessarily include the idea of "rest" in a higher sense—spiritual rest in the worship of God? Even the hardest worked clergymen and their most devoted helpers in mission-school and similar work, find the sweetest rest of all in the spiritual divine worship. No day for mere bodily rest fulfills the true idea and design of the Sabbath of the Lord their God.

WHAT the *Examiner* says is most emphatically true of the Sabbath, but is not true of Sunday. That has spiritual significance only as it is the imagination clothed with the character of the Sabbath. Sunday does not commemorate creation, nor is it a sign of God as the Sanctifier of his people. It is not the ancient Sabbath in the same institution transferred to another day. It has nothing in common with the Sabbath, except the weekly occurrence, and that the idea of rest has been transferred to it.

SUNDAY is not observed for the reason assigned in the Sabbath commandment. To read Sunday into the fourth commandment is to read into it a falsehood; for God did not make the world in six days and rest on Sunday, nor on Sunday did he for this reason hallow Sunday. But, "in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the *seventh* day: wherefore the Lord blessed the *sabbath* day and hallowed it." It is the seventh day and not the first, therefore, that was *rested on,* therefore hallowed. The Lord's rest day; for the Lord did not rest on Sunday. Now to no day before nor since has there ever been committed it to be thus *kept;* and how could it be so kept inasmuch as it was never made so?

And because Sunday, the day falsely called "the Christian Sabbath," does not commemorate God's rest, because it is not enjoined by the fourth commandment, and because it has no reference to the finished work of redemption, it is confused in sentiment from the Sabbath, and is necessarily an entirely different institution. As well might the Mohammedan claim that Friday is the Sabbath of the Lord, merely transferred to the sixth day, for the Christian to claim that claim for Sunday.

Changing the day necessarily changes both the reason for observing it *and* the institution itself. And so we have in Sunday an institution commemorating, not creation and God's rest at its close, but an institution professedly commemorating the resurrection of Christ, and standing in opposition to the Sabbath of the Lord.

LET us illustrate this matter. Suppose that the Irish Catholics should become sufficiently numerous in this country to substitute the observance of the seventeenth of March for the Fourth of July, and celebrate it in the same manner, but for a different reason. Could St. Patrick's day ever become Independence day? And could this law making the twenty-first of July a legal holiday ever be applied, without change, to the seventeenth day of March? Could the seventeenth of March ever become the Fourth of July? No more can Sunday ever become the Sabbath of the Lord, enjoined by the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, a law which specifically points out the seventh day and requires its observance for reasons that cannot be made applicable to Sunday or any other day. For it always must be true that God rested on the seventh day, while it cannot be true that he also rested on the first day.

THE idea that the Sabbath is one thing and that the *day* upon which it is observed is quite another thing, has no foundation in the Scriptures. Turning to Ex. 20: 8-11 we read: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." Here we are told, not only that God rested, and blessed, and sanctified a certain day, but we are also told that that day was Saturday, and that any one who would keep a rest day and yet call it the Sabbath must keep Saturday. For no one can possibly keep the Sabbath and at the same time keep some other day. There may be other rest days, but there can be but one Sabbath; and the fourth commandment says, "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," while at the same time it forbids secular work on that day and commands that it shall be kept holy.

THE Sabbath is just as definite as that the fourth of July is Independence day. No one but the fourth of July is Independence day; no one can say that any other day is the Sabbath of the week. The Sabbath is not only a seventh day but *the* seventh day of each cycle of seven—the seventh day after six days of labor, but *the* seventh day of the *week.* This certainly will appear from Luke 23: 56 and 24: 1: "And they (the women) returned and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them." The day before the first day of the week is the Sabbath—the seventh day of the week. (*See also Matt. 28: 1.*) There is the Sabbath in the seventh day of the week. It is a fact as old and as well established as the weekly division of time. Of this the *Encyclopædia Britannica,* article "Calendar," says:—

"The week is a period of seven days, having no reference whatever to the celestial motions,—a circumstance to which it owes its unalterable uniformity.... It has been employed from time immemorial in almost all Eastern countries; and as it forms neither an aliquot part of the year nor of the lunar month, those who reject the Mosaic recital will be at a loss, as a learned chronologist has observed, to assign it to an origin having much semblance of probability."

The *Standard Dictionary,* article "Saturday," says:—

"Saturday.... The seventh or last day of the week, the Jewish Sabbath."

From the earliest period, indeed the names which we still give it are derived from the names of the pagan gods.

This fact constitutes it the most impressionable monument to the original Sabbath. The Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, and it is evident it can never be lost as long as the week endures. And the unchangeableness of the weekly cycle, the fact that the weekly cycle has always been the same, and consequently, Saturday has been the same everywhere, even as it is to-day. Seventy or eighty different races and seven ancient languages reveal not only a knowledge of the week but of the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, as the *Biblical Ency.* Lexicon says.

The nations that spoke many of these languages have had no intercourse with each other from the earliest periods, yet their practices are as indelible and unmistakable as could be made of the identity of the Sabbath. Time of recognition arose around the world in the seventh-day-of-the-week. Thus the Sabbath has been preserved. It has endured, stood all convulsions and changes in the measurement and reckoning of time. Kingdoms and empires have risen and fallen; wars, and money panics, and fire, and pestilence, and famine, are doing for general and wide-spread ruin.

THUS not only in the Scriptures but in all history, among every race, the Sabbath has always and everywhere been identified with the seventh day—*Saturday*—the day of the week, a well-known and universal day. *Neander* has declared that "the Sabbath (Saturday) has had its origin in the synagogues and week calendar. The first three centuries it is to be kept holy as the Sabbath (Saturday) too has its right." This may have its excuse for departing from the Sabbath the Creator had commanded by his providence; that in every nation the most familiar division of time, the weekly cycle, stands as an imperishable monument marking all with unerring certainty the day of his sacred rest.
