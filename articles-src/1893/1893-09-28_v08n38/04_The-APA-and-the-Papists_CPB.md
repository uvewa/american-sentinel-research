TROUBLE is brewing between the American Protective Association and the Roman Catholics. At Topeka, Kan., on the 11th inst., the Secretary of State declined to file a charter for a council of the A. P. A. on the ground that the organization, which is anti-Catholic, "seeks to oppose, by the sanction and assistance of law, a religious body in a country where the Constitution forbids interference with the religious opinions of any one."

The object of the association, as stated in the charter, is "to protect our country and its free institutions against the secret, intolerant and aggressive efforts that are being persistently put forth by a certain religio-political organization to control the Government of the United States and destroy our blood-bought civil and religious liberty; to maintain our free public school system, and oppose the union of Church and State."

So far as the avowed purpose of the A. P. A. is concerned, there is certainly no reason why it could not be incorporated under the laws of any State in the Union. It does not propose to act contrary to law but in accordance with the law, and only to oppose the Roman Catholics, so far as they are seeking to subvert civil and religious liberty, and to overthrow the public school system. It is not hard to discern in the action of the Secretary of State of Kansas the fine hand of papal influence.

But in our judgment the A. P. A. and the Papacy differ more in the objects which they have in view than in either principles or methods. The A. P. A., a secret political organization, is opposed to the Papacy, which, so far at least as the Jesuits are concerned, is a secret, religio-political organization. And every secret, political organization of any considerable magnitude is a menace to the State and to the liberties of the people who compose the State. The Catholics, plotting to secure public money for the support of their denominational schools, are a menace to our free institutions. But is it any better for the A. P. A. to invoke the power of the State to compel the Catholics to educate their children in the State secular schools instead of in the parochial religious schools? We do not believe in Roman Catholic doctrines nor have we any sympathy with the popish demand for a division of the public school funds; but we do most sincerely believe in the sacred right of the parent to educate his child in the church school.

The objection that the parochial schools make children Catholics first and citizens afterwards is not valid. With the papist, to be a Catholic, is synonymous with being a Christian, and the Christian who is not such first and above all things else is not worthy of the name, nor is his Christianity worth the professing. Says the Author of Christianity: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness." This is Christianity; but the idea that patriotism should have the first place, that every man should be a citizen first and a Christian second, is not one whit better than paganism, which subordinated everything, to the State and the State to the emperor, and then clothed the emperor with divinity and worshiped him. We would as soon commit the keeping of our soul to the Papacy as to the State. We would as soon submit to the despotism of the Papacy as to despotism that would compel us to educate our children to be citizens, or anything else, first and Christians afterwards. However much the Catholics may be astray in their understanding of divine truth, they are certainly right in putting their eternal interest first and in making everything subordinate to that.

But making religion the first concern and putting loyalty to Christ before loyalty to the State does not mean that the Church should usurp the functions of the State. Church and State should be entirely separate, and this for the very reason that while rendering "to Caesar [the State] the things which are Caesar's," the individual may be left perfectly free to render also "unto God the things that are God's." The papal scheme of making the State subordinate to the Church, destroys this liberty, for it places at the disposal of the Church the power of the State, and then the Church uses that power to coerce men, to compel them not only to render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, but also to force them to render "to God the things that are God's." But on the other hand, the A. P. A. scheme, which proposes to subordinate the Church to the State, would make it possible for the State to forbid the individual to render to God the things due him. The Catholic regards it as a religious duty—a service due to God—to educate his child in the parochial school; the A. P. A. would have the State say: You shall not educate your child in this way, but you shall send him to the public school in order that the State may have his first and best affections, and the Church and Him whom the Church represents the second place in his heart. The A. P. A. should see to it that in its efforts to preserve civil and religious liberty it does not destroy both.
