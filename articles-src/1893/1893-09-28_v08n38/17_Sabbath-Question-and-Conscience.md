THE Nashville Christian Advocate thinks that—

> The Sabbath question will never find its proper place in the Nation until its discussion is brought more fully within the realm of conscience.

Very true; but how can it ever be brought within the realm of conscience when the Bible Sabbath is disregarded and a man-made institution set up in its stead? The divine law is the only authority that can bind the conscience. It is vain to apply the fourth commandment to Sunday; men know better.
