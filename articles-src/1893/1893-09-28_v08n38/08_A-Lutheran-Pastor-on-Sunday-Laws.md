EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: The SENTINEL, on account of its independent tone, pure sentiment, and watchful character, well deserves a place at the fireside of every patriotic American citizen. Its avowed aim is to preserve intact the purity of the Constitution of this glorious Republic, and to reserve for the true Christian religion her rightful claim. That holy purpose can only be accomplished by keeping (as did our forefathers, the founders of this Government) forever separate State and Church. The separation of Church and State is both constitutional and biblical, as Christ's words prove, "My kingdom is not of this world." Therefore "render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Now, although I heartily indorse your articles, I cannot subscribe to an assertion made in the edition of September 14, vol. 8, No. 36, page 361, that the professed Protestant churches of the United States are completely apostate. The Lutheran Church, a potent factor in religious circles, did not go to Rome. It did not clamor for Sunday-closing at the Fair. It recognized the fact, that the display of progress to be exhibited at the Columbian Exposition, was an arrangement entered by the nations and governments of the world (hence the name World's Fair). It was neither an exhibition of religious bodies, nor exhibition by churches, consequently without religion in its nature. Therefore it is ridiculous for any church to interfere with its opening or closing, week-day or Sunday. Another common foe of our country and religion, is the temperance movement. It endeavors to fix its foolish notions into State laws. By its source it is sectarian, in principle unchristian. They try to curse the wine which Christ blessed.*

The passage in Scripture, Col. 2:21, from which the temperance exponents gathered their force, condemns their own action. Paul criticised the motto as an ordinance of men, which was doomed to perish. The 16th verse offers the key to the explanation. No man has a right to judge us in respect to what we eat or drink, for every creature of God is good, if used rightly and moderately. The only scriptural advice, which temperance enthusiasts might use, is, "Be temperate in all things." But they disallow to be temperate in some things, by prohibiting them entirely. What is the difference between commanding to abstain from meats, and prohibiting drinks? Both are ungodly, satanical. Both are "American highways" that lead to Rome. In this respect, also, you will see at a glance the right, constitutional, and biblical stand taken and defended by the Lutheran Church. This much, please, in vindication of the Lutheran policy.

J. G. HENRY.
