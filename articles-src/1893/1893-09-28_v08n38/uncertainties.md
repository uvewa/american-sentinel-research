# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, September 28, 1893 (v08n38)

## General Notes

This issue presented extraordinary difficulty for transcription due to:
1. Very small print size across all 8 pages
2. Low scan resolution making many individual characters ambiguous
3. Multiple long articles spanning several pages with text that was very difficult to distinguish at this resolution

## Page 1-2: "The Christian Sabbath" (C.P.B.)

- **Page 1, Column 1, Paragraph 4:** "physical enjoyment" vs "physical knowledge" — letter shapes ambiguous; transcribed as "physical enjoyment" based on context
- **Page 2, Left Column:** The article continues from page 1 through most of the left column. The transition from the Encyclopaedia Britannica quote to the Standard Dictionary reference was difficult to read precisely
- **Page 2, Right Column:** This column contains what appears to be a separate but related piece also titled "The Christian Sabbath" with a header about the General Conference of the United Brethren in Christ. The extremely small print and scan quality made many passages in this section very difficult to read with confidence. Multiple words and phrases throughout this section are uncertain.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for pages 1-2 left column; LOW for page 2 right column

## Page 2-3: "Known by Works"

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **The entire article is very difficult to read due to scan quality**
- **Multiple passages throughout are uncertain**
- **Confidence:** LOW

## Page 3: "The A. P. A. and the Papists"

- **Page 3, Right Column:** Several passages in the final paragraphs were difficult to read
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Page 4: "No Moral Power but of God"

- **Left column, various passages:** Some words were difficult to distinguish
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Page 4: "Fancy and Fact"

- **Right column:** Much of this article was very difficult to read due to small print
- **The article appears to be from the "Crusade for 'God and Religion'" series**
- **Confidence:** LOW

## Pages 3-6: "Religions and Civil Liberty in Pennsylvania" (P. A. Reno)

- **This long article spans portions of pages 3 through 6**
- **Many passages were extremely difficult to read**
- **The section about Japanese Christianity and Kinza Higu was particularly challenging**
- **Confidence:** LOW

## Page 5: "Casuistry"

- **This article about the "Casuistry" controversy and "Timothy" was very difficult to read**
- **Names: "Mr. Finley" and "Mr. Campbell" are reasonably certain; "Washington College" is uncertain**

- **Confidence:** LOW

## Page 5: "A Lutheran Pastor on Sunday Laws"

- **Bottom right of page 5:** The text was relatively readable but some passages were uncertain
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Page 6: "True Sabbath Observance"

- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Page 6: "More Sunday Cases in Maryland"

- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Page 6: "Monday Morning Newspapers"

- **Multiple short items; generally readable but some passages uncertain**
- **References to specific publications and names may contain errors**
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Page 7: Advertisements and Religious Liberty Library

- Not transcribed (advertisements and promotional material)

## Overall Assessment

This was an exceptionally difficult issue to transcribe due to scan quality. Many articles, particularly the "Christian Sabbath" companion piece on page 2 right column, the "Known by Works" article, the "Casuistry" piece, and the "Religions and Civil Liberty in Pennsylvania" article should be verified against a higher-quality scan or the original document. The editorial notes on page 8 were among the most readable content in this issue.
