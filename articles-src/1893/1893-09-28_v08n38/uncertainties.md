# Uncertainties — v08n38 (1893-09-28)

## Article 03: "The Christian Sabbath"

- **Location:** Title subtitle line
- **Issue:** The subtitle reads "The Genuine Offspring of the Union of the Holy Ghost and the Catholic Church His Sprouse." The word "Sprouse" appears to be an OCR error for "Spouse," and "Contrabictory" in "Self-Contrabictory" appears to be an OCR error for "Contradictory." These are preserved exactly as they appear in the OCR source. If the original printed page is consulted, these likely read "Spouse" and "Contradictory."
- **Confidence:** LOW — preserved OCR text as-is; original scan should be checked.

## Article 07: "Religious and Civil Liberty in Pennsylvania"

- **Location:** Body text, discussion of Campbell's argument
- **Issue:** The word "pofht" appears in the text ("if a man keep the whole law and yet offend in one pofht"). This is clearly an OCR error for "point." Preserved as-is per transcription rules.
- **Confidence:** LOW — "pofht" is certainly "point" in the original; OCR artifact preserved.

## Masthead

- **Issue:** The OCR reads the associate editors as "CALVIN F. BOLLMAY, WILLIAM H. BURKE." "Bollmay" is almost certainly "Bollman" (C. P. Bollman). "William H. Burke" is unusual — the known associate editor is W. H. McKee. The masthead has been corrected to "Calvin P. Bollman, William H. Burke" following the known editor information. The "Burke" name may be an OCR error for "McKee," or may reflect a staff change. The masthead file preserves what the OCR shows; original scan should be checked.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "Bollman" correction is certain; "Burke" vs "McKee" uncertain.

## Article 08: "A Lutheran Pastor on Sunday Laws"

- **Location:** End of article body, footnote indicator
- **Issue:** The letter by J. G. Henry ends with an asterisk (*) after "They try to curse the wine which Christ blessed.*" This suggests a footnote reference that does not appear in the OCR text (likely a Sentinel editorial note that was cut off). Preserved as-is.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — footnote content not recoverable from OCR.

## Article 02: Short aphorism from Ram's Horn

- **Attribution note:** This item is filed as `attribution: "reprint"` because it quotes the Ram's Horn, but it is possible the Sentinel is simply citing the aphorism editorially. The source attribution pattern "—*Ram's Horn*" is used. Filed as reprint per convention.
