THE Washington Post remarks that "we have heard so long and so regularly about the coming European war that one is disposed to pooh-pooh anything like a gloomy view of any situation on that continent, no matter how threatening its superficial aspect. But really it does not seem possible for these taunts and hostile overtures to go much farther without calamitous results. A few more military maneuvers and naval demonstrations, a little more fist-shaking and face-making and the sparks must fly."
