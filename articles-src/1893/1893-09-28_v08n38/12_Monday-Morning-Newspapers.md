APROPOS of the so-called Sabbath sentiment at the South, the New York Evening Post observes:—

> The sentiment against Sunday opening of the World's Fair is exceptionally strong in the South, and yet in many Southern cities the newspapers appear on Sunday morning, but not on Monday, with the approval of the religious element in the community. A paper in Birmingham, Ala., has been trying the experiment of printing on Monday and given it up, and the Montgomery Advertiser recalls the fact that it went through the same experience a few years ago. There are some cities in the West, notably in Iowa, where the same system prevails. It seem a very strange thing to people in the East, whether saints or sinners, and illustrates afresh, that it takes all sorts of folks to make up a world.

We regard it as very unlikely that religious sentiment has anything to do with suspending the Monday morning issue in Birmingham, Montgomery, or elsewhere at the South. The "religious sentiment" that protests against the Monday morning issue and approves that of Sunday morning is manufactured, we fancy, in the counting-rooms of the newspapers chiefly concerned. We suspect that the suspension of the Monday paper has its real motive in a desire to get seven days' pay for six days' service, and that if newspaper publishers were paid by the day only they would soon moderate their religious ardor and find that progressive journalism calls for seven issues a week without fail.—*Washington Post.*

The Catholic Review remarks that "we must not flatter ourselves that the Puritan spirit is dead. It is a restless, active, aggressive spirit that never ceases to agitate and plan and scheme until it has accomplished its object." This is true. But what is the spirit of Puritanism? Nothing in the world but the spirit of popery directed in so-called Protestant channels, that is, it is the principle of popery used in opposition to Roman Catholicism. Papists have no right to find fault with Puritanism; it is the legitimate child of popery.
