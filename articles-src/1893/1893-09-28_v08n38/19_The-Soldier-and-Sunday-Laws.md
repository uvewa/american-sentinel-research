THE Soldier, a South Carolina National Reform organ, says:—

> Now, brothers of the pulpit and tripod, why not take up your bugles and again sound the alarm until the marshalled hosts of the Lord shall make themselves felt against the Sunday running devil? It is right to close the Fair; it is wrong to leave the railroads free to grind their employee down to ceaseless toll. One victory should move the armies of righteousness for yet further conflict. Railroads, newspapers, street cars, and others should be taught the same salutary lesson so painfully learned by the Fair directors. Shall it be done? This Soldier is in the war, on the field of battle, and in the heat of conflict for victory. Let us hear from the editors and preachers. God calls us to conflict. Who is ready to act?

The friends of a legal Sunday will not be alive to act. Congress having yielded to the demand for legislation looking to the closing of the Fair, will be importuned to enact more stringent measures. The bribe having failed, mandatory laws will be asked for and secured. "As milder measures fail, the most oppressive laws will be enacted." These words were written long before the controversy about the Fair arose. They are proving true.
