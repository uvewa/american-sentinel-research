THE question of closing the Midwinter Fair in San Francisco is getting warm. A paper published in that city remarks that the first nail is not yet driven in the buildings, and yet the Sunday "clergy already pass resolutions asking the directors to close the Fair on Sundays, and thereby exclude those people who have to toil six days in the week for a living. This is all wrong. Clergymen cannot set themselves up as judges of the conscience of men. If those fanatics had their way every person who refused to believe as they do would be put to death, for they called upon the President of the United States to send troops to Chicago to prevent the gates of the Fair from being opened on Sunday. The question of morals and conscience should be relegated to moral and religious agencies, and no attempt should be made to legislate upon them. Nobody compels those ministers to visit the Fair on a Sunday."
