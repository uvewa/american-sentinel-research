OUR "Chicago Correspondence" is not completed up to this week. Do not omit reading it.

"RELIGIONS and Civil Liberty in Pennsylvania," continued in this paper is interesting and instructive. It will be concluded soon.

IF you have neighbors or friends who do not believe that the Catholic Church claims to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday, don't fail to furnish them the number of the SENTINEL containing the *Catholic Mirror's* articles.

THE Political Divorcee is so far from agreeing with the *Christian Statesman,* that "Sunday-closing of the Fair has been practically achieved," that it remarks in a recent issue that "already it is evident that the battle for the Sabbath Sunday, the *Divorcee* found in very little portion."

SO many orders have been received for a *Sentinel* in response to "a circular" and "A Warning from 'Father' Chiniquy," that we have had a number of extra copies printed, and can supply probably all that our friends require. Will those who ordered periodically and still desire the papers please renew their orders at once.

THE World's Fair directors have decided not to refuse the Fair to Sunday visitors to the grounds on Sunday. The Fair will therefore continue "practically closed" on Sunday, and the forty thousand or more people who persist in going on that day, many of them, probably, because they cannot afford the time on other days, will continue to pay full price for the sake of half the show.

THE question of closing the Midway at the Fair in San Francisco is getting warm. A paper published in that city remarks that the fine had in it not yet broken in the lists, and yet the Sunday "clergy already made resolutions asking the directors to close the Fair on Sunday, and thereby rebuke those people who have to tell six days in the week for a living. This is all wrong. Congress cannot set themselves up as judges of the conscience of men. If those faculties had their way every person who refused to believe as they do would be put to death, for they called upon the President of the United States to send troops to Chicago to prevent the gates of the Fair from being opened on Sunday. The question of morals and conscience will be relegated to moral and religious agencies, and no attempt should be made to legislate upon them. Nobody compels these ministers to visit the Fair on a Sunday."

THE *Nashville Christian Advocate* said:—

The Sabbath question will never fail in proper every fold within the realm of consecration. The time is coming—in its way it is very near; but how can it ever be brought within the realm of consecration when the Bible Sabbath is disregarded and a man-made institution set up in its stead? "The divine law is the only authority, if that you bind the conscience. The one who vainly to apply the fourth commandment to Sunday know better.

THE *Truth Seeker* points out an editorial series of service of "Everything Christian Trying to Shirk Taxes." The editor ought to know, if he does not, that some of the holiest and all of the Seventh-day Adventists are opposed to the exemption of Church property from taxation. Nos. 42 and 43 of the Sentinel Library, written by a Baptist and published by Seventh-day Adventists, is an able argument against the exemption of Church property from taxation. Moreover, at the last session of the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference at Battle Creek, Mich., February 17 to March 7, 1893, the following preamble and resolution was adopted:—

Whereas, In view of the opposition which we in common with others have raised to the principles underlying the exemption of Church property from taxation, it is inconsistent for the Church to accept exemption from the payment of taxes on its property, therefore,

*Resolved,* That we repudiate the doctrine that the Church or other ecclesiastical property be exempt from taxation, and further,

*Resolved,* That we use our influence in securing the repeal of such legislation as grants exemption.

Everything Christian is not "trying to shirk taxes."

THE *Soldier,* a South Carolina paper, says:—

Now, brothers of the pulpit and singed, and you who are yet burglars and have not sworn against the sinfulness thereof, the Lord and Washington, the fundamental basis of the Lord and the discussion fell against the Sunday-closing devil! It is the duty of all fair-minded business men to be old-time friends to get their daily news. It is the old-time press for others in their church; the old news, the same object, and the old way to make newspapers, street cars and other dealers to require the money lesson as partially contained in the Fair direction. Shall it not run on a road that would otherwise not exist? The *Soldier* is at the war, on the full of battle, and in the heart of the victory. Let us hear from the elders and preachers." God calls us to conflict. Who is ready to face?

The friends of a legal Sunday will not let us do so. act. Congress having yielded to the demand for legislation looking to the closing of the Fair, will be impatient to resort more stringent measures. The force having failed, mandatory laws will be asked for and secured. "As mildest

measures fail, the most oppressive laws will be enacted." Those words were written long before the controversy about the Fair arose. They are proving true to the letter.

THOSE who argue that Rev. 1:10 refers to Sunday have certainly never compared that text with Isa. 58:13; Ex. 20:10,11; John 1:1-3; and Mark 1:28. The first of these texts shows plainly that the Lord has a day which he terms "My holy day." The second identifies that day as the seventh day. "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." The third shows that the Son of God is the Creator of all things; and, that, consequently, it was he who rested on the creation day, and who blessed and sanctified it; while in the fourth, the Saviour himself declared that he "is Lord of the Sabbath day." In view of these texts it is nothing short of presumptuous to assert that John was in the Spirit on Sunday.

THE *Washington Post* remarks that Washington has so long ago no republic about the coming European war that one of the dailies of the District of Columbia gives a gloomy view of any situation on thanksgiving is not acceptable. But really it does not seem possible for these tantalite and hostile overtures to tip our much vaunted American civilization results. A few more military arms and naval (instruments,) a little more fist-shaking and face-reconciling by the Powers,

Some other submission may say to the Jews, "Become Christian or else leave the empire." The authorities of Russia sent Maryland yet the Adventists, say, "Keep Sunday or else get out." We can observe that it literally, except such as is sent to Jews in Russia, to the other, to Christian Americans. The principle is exactly the same.

THIS article we now republish. It is an article that the readers of the SENTINEL, and every Sabbath-keeper should have a copy of; that copies of the four tracts containing them to give to his friends and neighbors who will read them should also; and find that progressive printing ought to be done in the best cities of Washington.

The first of these articles was published last week. We print another this week, and there are still two to follow. These papers will be furnished in any quantity at cost per copy.
