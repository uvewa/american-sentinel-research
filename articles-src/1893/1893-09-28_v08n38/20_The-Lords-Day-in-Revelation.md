THOSE who argue that Rev. 1:10 refers to Sunday have certainly never compared that text with Isa. 58:13; Ex. 20:10, 11; John 1:3; and Mark 2:28. The first of these texts shows plainly that the Lord has a day which he terms "My holy day." The second identifies that day as the seventh day. "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." The third shows that the Son of God is the Creator of all things, and that, consequently, it was he who rested on the seventh day, and who blessed and sanctified it; while in the fourth, the Saviour himself declares that he "is Lord of the Sabbath day." In the light of these texts it is nothing short of a most unwarranted perversion of scripture to assert that John was in the Spirit on Sunday.
