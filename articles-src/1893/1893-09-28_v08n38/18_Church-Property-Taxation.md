THE Truth Seeker publishes an article entitled, "Everything Christian Trying to Shirk Taxes." The editor ought to know, if he does not, that some of the Baptists and all of the Seventh-day Adventists are opposed to the exemption of Church property from taxation. No. 43 of The Sentinel Library, written by a Baptist and published by Seventh-day Adventists, is an able argument against the exemption of Church property from taxation. Moreover, at the last session of the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference at Battle Creek, Mich., February 17 to March 7, 1893, the following preamble and resolutions were adopted:—

WHEREAS, In view of the separation which we believe should exist between the Church and the State, it is inconsistent for the Church to receive from the State pecuniary gifts, favors, or exemptions, therefore,

Resolved, That we repudiate the doctrine that the Church or other ecclesiastical property should be exempt from taxation, and further,

Resolved, That we use our influence in securing the repeal of such legislation as grants this exemption.

Everything Christian is not "trying to shirk taxes."
