"CONGRESS shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"—but they have. The effort of the Fifty-second Congress to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday is a plain violation of this part of our Constitution. The observance of Sunday is a religious custom, and to fix it by civil law is to establish a religion by law.

This part of our Constitution was intended to keep the Church and State forever separate, but now that it is made void, Church and State become united. The purpose of a union is too well known these days not to cause some alarm. All unions are to secure to the parties the power of united action in every thing that may advance their interest. All churches have taken more or less interest in the commandments of God and man. Usually they have taken more interest in the commandments of man and less in the commandments of God. At times serious disputes have arisen between them, and a union or combine with the civil power is no new or untried experiment, and has always been taken first by the party in error. A controlment by force, through the civil law or otherwise, can have no place in the mind of a Christian man. He "reproves, rebukes, exhorts with all long suffering and doctrine."

For many months there has been a serious dispute among the churches over the Sabbath question, or fourth commandment. Every person ought to know now who is right and who is wrong. Every person ought to know now that Sunday, as a religious day, is a man-made institution and not of God. Church history shows evil men and seducers have turned from the word of the Lord, the source of all power for good, to the civil law as a final resort.

By this alliance with the civil power, Seventh-day Adventists are persecuted to-day in Tennessee and Maryland, and many other places. By this alliance the Quakers and Baptists were persecuted. By this alliance Roger Williams and Anne Hutchison were banished. By this self-same alliance the Lord of glory was crucified. John 18:31, last clause.
