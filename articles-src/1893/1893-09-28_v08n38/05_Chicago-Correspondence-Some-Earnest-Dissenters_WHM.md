## Some Earnest Dissenters.

The Parliament of Religions has developed its distinctive characteristics, and they have proved to be Roman Catholic and pagan,—with but two dissenters, so far,—one a Seventh-day Baptist, and the other himself a pagan. With these two exceptions the entire Parliament bids fair to be a great council for the establishment of a man-made philosophy of religion. The method used is the same which was so effective in the degradation of Christianity in the early centuries, that is, compromise with paganism. As this Parliament progresses it becomes more and more evident that its projectors had but small comprehension of that which they were building, and that in reality another mind was planning the course and another hand was at the helm—the same which guided the union with paganism in the first great calling away. From that union resulted Roman Catholicism; it does not, therefore, do violence to its nature now by absorbing into itself the Protestantism which no longer protests, and the pagan stock from which it sprang in the beginning and again re-assimilating the scattered members into one family. In doing this Catholicism does not change,—it remains the same. That ancient boast of the Roman Catholic Church—that it never changes—has been gracefully reiterated here in the Catholic Congress and in the Parliament of Religions, and the progress of this cosmopolitan religious council has proved that it has no need to change,—for it has bided its time until all professed orthodox Christianity is ready to return to the feet of "Mother Church," bringing the remainder of paganism with it.

But even among non-Christians an occasional dissenter is found and the Parliament listened to one, most nobly outspoken, in the person of the Japanese Buddhist, Kinsa Ringe M. Harai. This gentleman, who is a man of learning and ability, speaking English with fluency and accuracy, and evidently well informed upon the civil and religious polity of English speaking people, declared unhesitatingly:—

> If any person should claim that there are many people in Japan who speak and write against Christianity, I am not a hypocrite, and I will frankly state that I was the first in my country who ever publicly attacked Christianity—no, not real Christianity but false Christianity; the wrongs done toward us by the people of Christendom. If any reprove the Japanese because they have had strong antichristian societies, I will honestly declare that I was the first in Japan who ever organized a society against Christianity—no, not against real Christianity, but to protect ourselves from false Christianity and the injustice which we receive from the people of Christendom.

This fearless Japanese told of wrongs which Japan had suffered from the nations which claim to constitute "Christendom," and said:—

> One of the excuses offered by foreign nations is that our country is not yet civilized. Is it the principle of civilized law that the rights and profits of the so-called un civilized, or the weaker, should be sacrificed? As I understand it, the spirit and the necessity of law is to protect the rights and welfare of the weaker against the aggression of the stronger; but I have never learned in my studies of law that the weaker should be sacrificed for the stronger. Another kind of apology comes from the religious source, and the claim is made that the Japanese are idolaters and beatless.

> Admitting, for the sake of argument, that we are idolaters and beatless, is it Christian morality to trample upon the rights and advantages of a non-Christian nation, coloring all their natural happiness with the dark stain of injustice? I read in the Bible, "Whosoever shall smile thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also;" but I cannot discover there any passage which says, "Whosoever shall demand justice of thee, smile his right cheek, and when he turns, smile the other also." Again, I read in the Bible, "If any man will sue thee at law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;" but I cannot discover there any passage which says, "If thou shalt sue any man at the law, and take away his coat, let him give thee his cloak also."

> We are very often called barbarians, and I have heard and read that Japanese are stubborn and cannot understand the truth of the Bible. I will admit that this is true in some sense, for, though they admire the eloquence of the orator and wonder at his courage, though they approve his logical argument, yet they are very stubborn and will not join Christianity as long as they think it is a Western morality to preach one thing and practice another.

This is a noble dissent. The conclusion which Mr. Harai has reached is the inevitable deduction from the theory that the peoples of so-called Christendom constitute "Christian nations," and therefore are exemplars, in their governmental policy, of Christianity. Thus it is that this theory antagonizes those whom the gospel should reach.

On Sunday, September 17th, Rev. A. H. Lewis, D.D., of Plainfield, N. J., spoke in the Parliament on "The Divine Element in the Weekly Rest Day." One strong paragraph from the Doctor's address is as follows:—

> Another decided hindrance to the recognition of the divine element in the weekly rest day is reliance on the civil law for the enforcement of its observance. This point is worthy of far more careful and scientific consideration than it has yet received. The vital divine element in the weekly rest day is eliminated when it is made a "civil institution." The verdict of history on this point is unmistakable, uniform and imperative. Any argument is deceptive and destructive if it places the rest day on a par with those civil institutions that spring from the relations which men sustain to each other in organized society. The fundamental difference is so great that the same treatment cannot be accorded to each. Civil institutions spring from earthly relations between men. But, as we have seen, duration is so essentially an attribute of God, that man's relations to it and to God are relations supremely religious. Hence it is that when civil authority is made the ground, or the prominent ground of obligation to observe the weekly rest day, the question ceases to be a religious one. It is taken out of the realm of conscience, and of spiritual relations, and put on an equality with things human and temporary. This brings ruin, and nothing good can be built thereon by any sort of indirection, or by compromise.

> Men inevitably cease to keep the Godward side of the question in sight, when "the law of the land" is presented as the main point of contact. The ultimate appeal is not to Caesar, but to God; to conscience, not to Congress. Here is the fatal weakness of "Modern Sabbath Reform." History sustains these conclusions with one voice. No weekly rest day has ever been religiously or sacredly kept under the authority of the civil law alone. On the contrary, the religious element is always destroyed by the supposed protection of civil law. When conscience, springing from the recognition of the divine element is wanting, nothing higher than holidayism can be reached. The weekly rest day loses its sacredness and its power to uplift and bless whenever divine authority and the sanctity which flows therefrom are separated from it.

Such dissent from error and outspoken expressions of truth as these two brave dissenters have voiced in this greatest religious council of the ages should be heard by some,—should cause some to stop and think,—to ponder whether or no the realities of truth are not really of the highest importance, and the theories of a man-made religious philosophy, with all its attendant evils and errors, to be antagonized with no less zealous effort than that to which the earnest Japanese pledges himself.
