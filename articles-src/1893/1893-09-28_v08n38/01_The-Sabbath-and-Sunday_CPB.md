THE primary object of the Sabbath is not physical rest, but spiritual worship. Says the Lord: "I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."

JUST as days are by men set apart to keep in memory important events, so the Sabbath was set apart by the Lord to keep in the minds of his people the fact that he was their Creator. And since the fall, the fact that God is the Creator is the assurance of his power to redeem; hence the Sabbath is a sign of God, both as the Creator and Saviour.

IN the struggle for existence, man forgets that his chief end is, not to perpetuate his life in this world, but "to glorify God and enjoy him forever." It is for this reason that the words of our Saviour, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath," are so often wrested from their true meaning. The idea is not that the Sabbath was designed primarily, or that it is now, to minister first to man's physical necessities, but that it is for man's highest good; not as a burden to be borne, but as a friend to elevate and ennoble men by bringing them to a true knowledge of the true God.

THIS view of the Sabbath is not peculiar to those who observe the day enjoined in the fourth commandment. Many Sunday-keepers also see in the weekly rest, not a day of physical relaxation merely, but above and beyond all, a day of spiritual worship. On this point, the Political Dissenter, a Reformed Presbyterian paper, replying to something which appeared in another religious paper, says:

> You define the Sabbath as "a rest" in the sense of a mere cessation from work. You say that "many Christian clergymen and other Christians who work hard on Sunday observe their Sabbath on Monday." But might not a Christian clergyman find his needed bodily and mental rest on Monday in fishing, hunting, or playing tennis? Would that "rest" be in harmony with the divine institution of the Sabbath? Does not that institution necessarily include the idea of "rest" in a higher sense—spiritual rest in the worship of God? Even the hardest worked clergymen and their most laborious helpers in Sabbath-school and mission work, enjoy the true rest of the Sabbath in exercises of divine worship. No day for mere bodily recreation could be to them the institution of the Sabbath of the Lord their God.

WHAT the Dissenter says is most emphatically true of the Sabbath, but is not true of Sunday. That has spiritual significance only as it is in imagination clothed with the character of the Sabbath. Sunday does not commemorate creation, nor is it a sign of God as the Sanctifier of his people. It is not the ancient Sabbath, nor is it the same institution transferred to another day. It has nothing in common with the Sabbath, except its weekly recurrence, and that the idea of rest has been associated with it.

SUNDAY is not observed for the reason assigned in the Sabbath commandment. To read Sunday into the fourth commandment is to read into it a falsehood; for God did not make the world in six days and rest on Sunday, neither did he for this reason hallow Sunday. But, "in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." Not one word of this applies to Sunday, the first day, therefore Sunday is not the Lord's rest day; for the Lord did not rest upon it, neither did he bless nor hallow it; neither has he ever commanded it to be kept holy; and how could it be so kept since it was never made so?

AND because Sunday, the day falsely called "the Christian Sabbath," does not commemorate God's rest, because it is not enjoined by the fourth commandment, and because it has no reference to the finished creation, it is observed for entirely different reasons from the Sabbath, and is necessarily an entirely different institution. As well might the Mohammedan claim that Friday is the Sabbath of the Lord, merely transferred to the sixth day, as for the Christian to make that claim for Sunday.

Changing the day necessarily changes both the reason for observing it and the institution itself. And so we have in Sunday an institution commemorating, not creation and God's rest at its close, but an institution professedly commemorating the resurrection of Christ, and standing in opposition to the Sabbath of the Lord.

LET us illustrate this matter. Suppose that the Irish Catholics should become sufficiently numerous in this country to substitute the observance of the seventeenth day of March for the fourth of July, and celebrate it in the same manner but for a different reason. Could St. Patrick's day ever become Independence day? and could the law making the fourth day of July a legal holiday ever be applied, without change, to the seventeenth day of March? Certainly not; and no more can Sunday ever become the Sabbath of the Lord, enjoined by the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, a law which specifically points out the seventh day and requires its observance for reasons that never by any possibility can be true of any other day. For it always must be true that God rested on the seventh day, while it never can be true that he rested on the first day.

THE idea that the Sabbath is one thing and that the day upon which it is observed is quite another thing, has no foundation in the Scriptures. Turning to Gen. 2:3 we read: "And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made." Nothing is said about blessing and sanctifying an institution; the blessing attaches to the definite day; with this conclusion agrees also the fourth commandment: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." Here we are plainly told that "the seventh day is the Sabbath." This is just as definite as that the fourth of July is Independence day. No day but the fourth of July can be Independence day; no more can any day but the seventh be the Sabbath.

The Sabbath is not only a seventh day but it is the seventh day. Not merely the seventh day after six days of labor, but the seventh day of the week. That this is so will appear from Luke 23:56 and 24:1: "And they returned and prepared spices and ointments: and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them." Here the Sabbath is the day just before the first day of the week. (Cf. also Mark 16:1, 2.) It inevitably follows that the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week. And the week is an ancient and well-established division of time. Of the week, the "Encyclopaedia Britannica," article, "Calendar," says:—

> The week is a period of seven days, having no reference whatever to the celestial motions. It has been employed from time immemorial in almost all Eastern countries. As it forms neither an aliquot part of the year nor of the lunar month, those who reject the Mosaic recital will be at loss, as Delambre remarks, to assign to it any origin having much semblance of probability.

The same authority, article, "Babylonia," says:—

> The week of seven days was in use from an early period, indeed the names which we still give to the days can be traced to ancient Babylonia; and the seventh day was one of zolum, or rest.

This fact constitutes the week an imperishable monument to the original Sabbath. The Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, and it is evident it can never be lost as long as the week endures. And that it never has been lost, is attested by the fact that the weekly cycle has always been known by almost all nations; and it has been the same everywhere, even as it is to-day. Seventy-five out of one hundred and seven ancient languages reveal not only a knowledge of the week but of the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week. On this subject Rev. Dr. Lewis says:—

> The nations that spoke many of these languages have long since gone from the earth. But the words of their mother tongue embalm their thoughts and practices as ineffaceable and unmistakable monuments showing the identity of the week and of the Sabbath. Tides of emigration have swept bitter and thither over the earth. Empires have risen, flourished, and fallen, but the week has endured, amid all convulsions and changes. . . . Philology has done for the truth concerning God's eternal Sabbath, what cuneiform inscriptions, and mummy pits, are doing for general and national history.

Thus not only in the Scriptures but in all history, even among pagan peoples, the Sabbath has always and everywhere been identified with the definite seventh day of the week, a well-known and uniform division of time. God has declared, "The seventh day is the Sabbath," and has commanded it to be kept holy as he made it in the beginning, and that men may have no excuse for departing from this precept the Creator has so ordered by his providence, that in every nation the most familiar division of time, the weekly cycle, stands as an imperishable monument marking with unerring certainty the day of his sacred rest.
