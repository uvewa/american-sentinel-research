TROUBLE is brewing between the American Protective Association and the Roman Catholics. At Topeka, Kan., on the 11th inst., the Secretary of State declined to file a charter for a council of the A. P. A. on the ground that the organization, which is anti-Catholic, "seeks to oppose religious liberty in a country where the Constitution forbids interfering with the religious opinions of any one."

The object of the association, as stated in its charter, is "to protect our country and the free institutions against the secret, intolerant and aggressive efforts that are made permanently just forth by a certain religio-political organization to control the Government of the United States and the public offices of the Government of this country; to maintain our free public school system by preventing any union of Church and State.

But as the avowed purpose of the A. P. A. is concerned, there is certainly nothing to which it could not be the uncomplaisance under the laws of any State in the Union, for it proclaims no principles contrary to law in its accordance with the law, and only to oppose the Roman Catholics, or at least they are seeking to subvert civil and religious liberty, and to overthrow the system of free public schools; and the disclosure in the action of the Secretary of State at Topeka is a very strange proceeding.

But in our judgment it is not *in* the A. P. A. to do much good. The character of this *Papist* differ more in the sheets in which they act than it even in the ethics of theory or methods. The A. P. A., a secret political organization, is opposed to the Papacy, which, so far at least as the doctrine is concerned, is a secret, religio-political organization. The A. P. A., a political organization of no considerable strength, so far as religion is concerned, seeks to secure money for the support of their institutional mission, or churches, a menace to our free institutions. But is it any better for the A. P. A. to compel the power of the State to compel the Catholics to educate their children in the State and to refuse them the right to maintain their religious schools? We do not believe it is. We have no sympathy with the Papacy, but any sympathy with the popish demand for a division of the public school fund, but we do most sincerely believe in the sacred right of the parent to educate his child in the church school.

The doctrine that the parochial schools make disloyal children free and citizens of the world is not valid. With the popish, a Christian is not always just the good citizen, a Christian, and the Christian who will not educate his child for citizenship is not worthy of the name, nor is he an American. The Author of Christianity: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness." This is Christianity; but the idea that patriotism has as for any Christian, in the first place, that every man should be a citizen first, and a Christian second, is not one of the doctrines taught in the New Testament, which enjoins upon the believer to be obedient to the law, to his conscience, donated everything, to the State and the right of the free school, with which the compeer with divinity and worship goes. We would at once acknowledge the passing of our soul to the Papacy as to the depotism of the Papacy as to despotism

that would compel us to educate our children in secular, or anything else, first and all, Christian, or otherwise. However much the Catholics may be astray in their indoctrination of divine truths, they are certainly right in putting their eternal interest first and in making everything else subordinate thereto.

But making religion the first concern does not require the parochial school. "The necessity to the State does not mean that the State should be first in the life of the man. Church and State should be entirely separate, and having all the interest that while rendering "to Cæsar" (the State) things that are Cæsar's, the Christian patriotism may be left perfectly free to observe its "citizenship in heaven," and to work for "the glory of God." The papal scheme of making the State subordinate to the Church, and the Church to the Pope, the rule of the Church the power of the State; the idea of taxing the Protestant to come once, to compel them with any Cæsar's, 'est also to force them, to render unto their children in whatever manner, on the other hand, the A. P. A. would, in compelling all children to be educated in the State, would make it practically impossible for parents to give to their children the religious training to which the things of the State the things of the Church. The Catholic regards a religious duty—right or wrong in his opinion—to educate his children in parochial schools. The A. P. A. would not allow him to do this. It would educate his child its way, but with almost the same spirit. In other words the one would have a parochial school, and the other would have a State school, to claim the first place in its power to govern and religion liberty's best and deepest rights, both alike.
