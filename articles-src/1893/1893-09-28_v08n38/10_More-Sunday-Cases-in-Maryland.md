Ford's Store, Md., Sept. 11.

EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: Yesterday, Sunday, September 10, Alexander Dodd and Joseph Warram, Seventh-day Adventists, were on Winchester Creek shore, quietly fixing their oyster rakes, preparing for the oyster season which is about to open, when, in, and behold, our wide-awake constable (who aims, if possible, to be on hand on these occasions) appeared on the scene of action. This morning, at 9 o'clock, they were arrested and notified to present themselves before Justice Kerr at 10 o'clock. They were in time, and the justice opened with the case of Alexander Dodd. The defendant requested to look at the warrant upon which he was arrested; the justice refused that right. The defendant then requested that the writer appear as counsel for him; the justice refused this also. Defendant then requested that his case be postponed until he could get counsel that was legally sworn in court. Justice Kerr refused to allow such postponement, saying that Mr. Dodd was present at the trials of other Seventh-day Adventists, and they had counsel, and he knew the verdict; intimating that the same verdict would be rendered, counsel or no counsel. Seeing that their cases were already decided, Mr. Dodd and Mr. Warram, knowing that no justice would be shown them before this so-called justice, both waived an examination, and their cases will go before a jury at the November term of the Circuit Court. This makes a total of seven cases of Adventists to be tried in this court, in November.

CHAS. O. FORD.
