*Ford's Store, Md., Sept. 11.*

EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: Yesterday, Sunday, September 10, Alexander Dodd and Juday Warfield, Seventh-day Adventists, were on Winchester Creek shore, quietly going trout-line crabber preparing for the oyster season which is about to open, when, lo, and behold, our friend the constable came for Alexander, and to be on hand on those concerned. Upon appearing before the trial Monday morning, at 8 o'clock, they were arraigned before Justice Kerry at 10 o'clock. They were in the presence of a number of the followers of Alexander Dodd. The defendant was requested to look at the warrants upon which he was arrested; the justice refused that right. The defendant then asked that the writer appear as an attorney for him; the writer appear and as counsel for him; the justice refused this also, saying that he represented that his case be postponed until he could get counsel; was legally considered. The prosecution was unwilling to allow such postponement, saying that Mr. Dodd was present and in fact all the parties were. Dodd and Warfield are Seventh-day Adventists, and they had been working on Sunday. It was ascertained that the same verdict would be rendered in this case. As the trial proceeded, their cases were severally decided; Mr. Dodd and Mr. Warfield, knowing that their defense would be shown them the evidence was well known, both waived on examination, and were duly committed for the action of the Autumn term of the Circuit Court of Dorchester County. They are the first Adventists to be tried in this court, it seems.
