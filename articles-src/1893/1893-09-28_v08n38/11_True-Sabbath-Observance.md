The prevailing idea that Sabbath keeping is rest, is, to my mind, far from the truth. Nowhere in all God's Word do we find the Lord placing the obligation to regard the Sabbath upon the fact that man needs rest. To do so is to lower both the object and the proper observance of his holy day. Idleness from worldly employment is, of itself, far from Sabbath keeping. We do not keep the Sabbath that we may rest, but rest that we may keep the Sabbath. An individual might not do a stroke of worldly business on that day, and still be a Sabbath-breaker. Proper Sabbath keeping is that in which the person intelligently recognizes God's authority as the reason for keeping it, and not his own selfish interests. When he recognizes the divine presence with him on that day, and when he sees the special divine blessings placed upon that, above all other days, he realizes that he not only has all the blessings that he has upon all other days, but, in addition to those, he enjoys the special blessing that was put upon that day above the other days. He lays aside his secular duties, and all thought and care of them, that he may, unhindered give himself time to meditate, as he could not do in his busy cares of life, upon the fact that it was his blessed Lord that made the heavens and the earth in six days and had himself rested, and has sanctified the day "because," not that man needed rest, but "that in it he had rested from all his work, which God created and made." He knows that Christ, the Son of God, made heaven and earth and that he was the one who blessed the Sabbath (Mark 2:27, 28, and Col. 1:15, 17); that he could not suffer the plan in creating the world to fail through man's fall, and so now he is carrying out the original plan in another way, by the work of redemption. And how can we say that redemption is greater than creation when it is only creation itself,—a new creation in Christ Jesus? See Eph. 2:10, 4:24; Isa. 65:17, 19. The Sabbath of the Lord is a memorial of both events, and he recognizes that fact. This, and this only, is true Sabbath keeping; and we make a serious mistake when we place anything lower than this as Sabbath keeping.—*E. W. Webster, in the Carolina Spartan.*
