THE Russian authorities say to the Jews, "Become Christians or else leave the empire." The authorities of Tennessee and Maryland say to the Adventists, "Keep Sunday or else get out." We can discern little difference, except that one is said to Jews in Russia, the other, to Christians in America. The principle is exactly the same.
