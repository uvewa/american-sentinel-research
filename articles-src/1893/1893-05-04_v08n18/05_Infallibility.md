WHOEVER assumes to enforce his religion by law assumes the attribute of infallibility. A few considerations will make this apparent to all. 1. He assumes that he is right beyond mistake else he would not want his opinions so fixed that he himself could never change them. The language of his feeling is, "I am right and I know and feel it in my inmost soul. Right must prevail and in order to prevail it must be in authority fixed beyond a chance of change, therefore I would have my righteous opinions established as fundamental law."

2. He assumes that he is acting for God and because he is acting for God he is surely right. "God is right and I am right and mankind must bow to God's authority in religion, therefore, my religion which is the religion of God must be incorporated into the law of the land for the government of all men. My religion which is the religion of God is the only religion that will save men therefore it is pure philanthropy on my part to have my religion enforced by law so that all may be saved even though it be by fire."

3. His zealous convictions are proof that he is right beyond a doubt. "If I am not right why then this fervent zeal and piety? why this energy of desire to see this pure and holy religion which burns in my soul made triumphant? Surely by the holy fires of zeal burning within I am right and naught can turn me from my righteous and heaven-born purpose. I will have religion enforced by law, not my neighbors' but mine which I am fully and deeply and surely persuaded is the holy religion of God. Ah, my soul, this must be true else whence these burning longings and this supreme anxiety of soul, this unutterable desire, this vehemence of purpose? Ah, my soul, thou art right and thou art God's own commissioner and by the fires within, God's will shall be established and his kingdom prevail among men."

This is but a faint expression of the tropical logic that surges and swells in the soul of the religious legislationist. It was this silent assumption of infallibility which produced the religious laws and the consequent slaughter of souls to save them in the Dark Ages. The modern assumption of the infallibility of the Papal See has set the seal of righteousness—selfrighteousness I mean—to every act in the history of that corrupt murderous power. And now in the face of all the history of the last sixteen centuries professed Protestants are assuming this same attribute in their effort to have their religious opinions made supreme in American law, over American consciences. The logic of this modern history will be the same as that of the mediæval. An infallible Protestant Church will be as cruel and intolerant as an infallible Papacy. Let modern Protestants no longer deny their ancestry. Let them own their mother—Rome—and draw near by this common bond and enter into close communion with her. This bond of union makes them blood relations. They can not fail to recognize their holy (?) mother, and she—why she has just discovered by this birth-mark, branded soul-deep, that they are her daughters and she graciously would receive them into sweet communion, pardoning all their waywardness if only they will coöperate with her in trying to dominate the civil power in America.

As this unholy alliance strengthens let American freemen lift their voices in no uncertain tones, and while they plead for the "liberty which is in Christ," let them lift their voices in proclaiming the words dictated by the Spirit of God eighteen centuries ago: "If any man worship the beast and his image the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation." G. D. Ballou.
