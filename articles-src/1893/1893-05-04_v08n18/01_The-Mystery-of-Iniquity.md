WHAT is the origin of the present development of human law for the enforcement of religion? Paul asked the Thessalonians if they did not remember that when he was with them he had told them of these things; that they should let no man deceive them, for there should be a falling away and the man of sin be revealed, by whom the mystery of iniquity was already, even at that time, working.

THE Thessalonians were to remember—and are we to forget that this was said to them?—that God was to be opposed, and there should be one who would exalt himself above God, and should, from the very temple of God itself, attempt to show that he was himself God. They were told not to forget—and are we to fail to remember?—that the iniquitous workings, then begun in secret, should at length be revealed, and that which was planned in secrecy should finally be proclaimed on the housetops.

This subtle deceiveableness of unrighteousness which is now working with power and signs and lying wonders is the mystery of the deeds of sin of that wicked one who will be consumed and destroyed by the brightness of the coming of the Lord. This wicked one still works in secret and his deeds are yet a mystery to most—but not to all. That mysterious antichristian influence which has permeated the world—has invaded and corrupted its churches—has, with consummate tact and diplomacy, insinuated itself into civil councils and dominated governments—is not now utterly unknown.

PROPHECY has pointed out the progress of the mystery of iniquity, and history has recorded the fulfillment and realization of prophecy step by step, and emphasized each prophetic milestone by such unmistakable inscriptions that the unlettered wayfarer, even, may understand, and all who run the race along life's highway may read. The line of march of the mysterious commander of the forces of antichrist is marked by ever-increasing inroads into the confines of true religion and civil justice; pagan observances, unholy rites, and idolatries have been added to, or mingled with, the methods of worship, and practiced, until they have become the accepted forms; those who have resisted the encroachments of evil, and remained true to the teaching of Christ and the apostles, acknowledging no rival authority, and submitting their lives to no rule but that of God and his word, have, at the behest of this commander, filled the cells of the Inquisition, suffered under its instruments of torture, fed the flames with their flesh, and soaked the earth with their blood.

THE same spirit of fraud, and violence, and force, and cruelty, and injustice, is now at work. Its field of operations is not circumscribed; it is not confined to the battle grounds of former campaigns; fresh fields of conquest have opened in this New World. The same tactics which have been so successful in former ages, in forms modified to suit the age, the social and political conditions, are being put into practice in this country. Religious observances, pagan and idolatrous in their derivation, have been ingrafted into the accepted religious formality and they have grown and developed until they overshadow the real purpose of religion, and take the place in the minds of their devotees of true religion itself. The test of a profession of religion has become the acceptance of the popular and accepted forms of superficial and fashionable devotion, and a zeal for the legal enforcement of the national religion by pains and penalties. The highest development of civil processes yet attained in any government is that now in vogue in the United States. In just that proportion in which it is available for proper governmental uses when correctly applied, in just that same degree, when unjustly and incorrectly applied, may it become an engine of persecution and of civil injustice.

THOSE now occupy the highest seat in the synagogue who ignore Christ and his teachings, and, while professing to accept the Word of God, deny the authority of its precepts and affirm the authority of the traditions of men. The pulpit has been set in the open doorway of the temple of Janus. While it remains there the doors can never be shut. From such a pulpit only the gospel of force can be preached,—the policeman's club, the prisoner's dock, the common jail. The missionaries from this pulpit are the detective, the informer, and the white cap. Such a gospel does not persuade or convert, it subjugates; it does not convict of sin, it establishes the sinner in a hypocrisy which covers evil with an affectation of good, and imputes evil where good is.
