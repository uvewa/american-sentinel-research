WHAT is the origin of the present development of human law for the enforcement of religion? Paul asked the Thessalonians if they did not remember that when he was with them he had told them of these things; that they should let no man deceive them, for there should be a falling away and the man of sin be revealed, by whom the mystery of iniquity was already, even at that time, working.

THE Thessalonians were to remember— and are we to forget that this was said to them?—that God was to be opposed, and there should be one who would exalt himself above God, and should, from the very temple of God itself, attempt to show that he was himself God. They were told not to forget—and are we to fail to remember?—that the iniquitous workings, then begun in secret, should at length be revealed, and that which was planned in secrecy should finally be proclaimed on the housetops.

THIS subtle deceivableness of unrighteousness which is now working with power and signs and lying wonders is the mystery of the deeds of sin of that wicked one who will be consumed and destroyed by the brightness of the coming of the Lord. This wicked one still works in secret and his deeds are yet a mystery to most—but not to all. That mysterious antichristian influence which has permeated the world—has invaded and corrupted its churches—has, with consummate tact and diplomacy, insinuated itself into civil councils and dominated governments—is not now utterly unknown.

PROPHECY has pointed out the progress of the mystery of iniquity, and history has recorded the fulfillment and realization of prophecy step by step, and emphasized each prophetic milestone by such unmistakable inscriptions that the unlettered wayfarer, even, may understand, and all who run the race along life's highway may read. The line of march of the mysterious commander of the forces of antichrist is marked by over-increasing inroads into the confines of true religion and civil justice; pagan observances, unholy rites, and idolatries have been added to, or mingled with, the methods of worship, and practiced, until they have become the accepted forms; those who have resisted the encroachments of evil, and remained true to the teaching of Christ and the apostles, acknowledging no rival authority, and submitting their lives to no rule but that of God and his word, have, at the behest of this commander, filled the cells of the Inquisition, suffered under its instruments of torture, fed the flames with their flesh, and soaked the earth with their blood.

THE same spirit of fraud, and violence, and force, and cruelty, and injustice, is now at work. Its field of operations is not circumscribed; it is not confined to the battle grounds of former campaigns; fresh fields of conquest have opened in this New World. The same tactics which have been so successful in former ages, in forms modified to suit the age, the social and political conditions, are being put into practice in this country. Religious observances, pagan and idolatrous in their derivation, have been ingrafted into the accepted religious formality and they have grown and developed until they overshadow the real purpose of religion, and take the place in the minds of their devotees of true religion itself. The test of a profession of religion has become the acceptance of the popular and accepted forms of superficial and fashionable devotion, and a zeal for the legal enforcement of the national religion by pains and penalties. The highest development of civil processes yet attained in any government is that now in vogue in the United States. In just that proportion in which it is available for proper governmental uses when correctly applied, in just that same degree, when unjustly and incorrectly applied, may it become an engine of persecution and of civil injustice.

THOSE now occupy the highest seat in the synagogue who ignore Christ and his teachings, and, while professing to accept the Word of God, deny the authority of its precepts and affirm the authority of the traditions of men. The pulpit has been set in the open doorway of the temple of Janus. While it remains there the doors can never be shut. From such a pulpit only the gospel of force can be preached,—the policeman's club, the prisoner's dock, the common jail. The missionaries from this pulpit are the detective, the informer, and the white cap. Such a gospel does not persuade or convert, it subjugates; it does not convict of sin, it establishes the sinner in a hypocrisy which covers evil with an affectation of good, and imputes evil where good is.

Legal Religion Antichristian.

THAT civil legislation on religious questions is inimical to liberty of conscience, has often been shown in these columns, but that any interference whatever by the civil power is just as inimical to the work of the gospel itself may be just as clearly shown. The gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is not merely a code of morals for the regulation of outward conduct but is the mystery of God for the moral transformation of the human soul, through the divine power that resides in that gospel, and which accompanies it, when carried in humble reliance on that power and on that power alone.

The Scriptures teach that the gospel is the mystery of God for the regeneration of the natural, or carnal mind, which, it is declared, "is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither, indeed, can be. So then they that are in the flesh can not please God. But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you."* This is a most positive statement that all true moral reformation is the work of the Spirit of God; and this the Spirit accomplishes through the gospel, which is "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." +

And not only has God ordained the means by which moral reformation shall be wrought in the human soul, namely, by faith in the gospel, but he has also ordained the means by which the gospel shall be brought to the notice of men; not by force, not by means of civil law, but by "the foolishness of preaching."++ And so the Saviour sent his disciples forth into a hostile world under the commission: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." |

The only guarantee of success given the apostles was the presence of their Lord by his Spirit; and by the power of this Spirit, through the word of God, they went forth "conquering and to conquer," making converts not only without the aid of the civil power but in the face of bitter opposition by the rulers of this world. Jesus Christ, who could have prayed the Father who would have given him more than twelve legions of angels, could have commissioned those heavenly messengers to overcome by their mighty power all the opposition of wicked men and demons to the truth, and to have compelled men to have accepted the gospel, but such was not the divine plan. As one has expressed it:—

The government of God is not, as Satan would make it appear, founded upon a blind submission, an unreasoning control. It appeals to the intellect and the conscience. "Come now, and let us reason together," is the Creator's invitation to the beings he has made. God does not force the will of his creatures. He can not accept an homage that is not willingly and intelligently given. A mere forced submission would prevent all real development of mind or character; it would make man a mere automaton. Such is not the purpose of the Creator. He desires that man, the crowning work of his creative power, shall reach the highest possible development. He sets before us the height of blessing to which he desires to bring us, through his grace. He invites us to give ourselves to him, that he may work his will in us. It remains for us to choose whether we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share the glorious liberty of the sons of God.

It was not without reason that God made man a free moral agent, and it is likewise not without reason that the Creator leaves him free. In no other way could God have been the recipient of loving, willing service from intelligent creatures. Without the power of choice there could be no moral development, no approximation to the divine standard of character, no such thing as putting on Christ, and no possibility of being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.

What men need to understand is the true power of the will. It is a citadel that God himself will not invade. He invites, he beseeches, but he does not coerce. He implants in the heart of every man the desire to be better than he is and to do better than he does, and then he freely offers to make him better, and thus give him the power to do better. But it is for the recipient of these favors to choose to receive them. When man desires them God gives them, not before; for if so given they would not be used. But when the soul yields to his Creator the whole nature is brought under the control of the divine Spirit, the affections are centered upon God, and the life is in harmony with His will. But such a change is never produced by force.

The gospel is the power of God to bring about this change; it is "the mystery which, from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ." + "Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." + "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord." | And this purpose in Christ concerning those who give themselves to him, is to present them "to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish." S But it is only the willing and obedient who shall eat the good of the land.

God is the only source of moral power. To use a homely, but forcible expression, as well might a man attempt to lift himself by the straps of his boots as to elevate himself morally without the divine power that comes alone from God. And what one man can not do for himself, in this respect, no number of men can do for him. God alone knows the heart, and he alone can change the character. Civilization is not morality. The most cultured are sometimes the most corrupt. Social customs and civil laws may, in fact do, restrain, but they do not transform. God alone has power to create a new heart and to renew a right spirit. But the natural man can not receive this. His trust is in the arm of flesh; and even when he fails he does not turn to the true source of strength, but tries, by allying himself with a multitude of his fellows, each as weak as himself, to do, not only for himself, but for the whole mass of humanity, what not a single individual can do for himself. And not only is this hope vain but it causes men to lose sight of the only true source of moral power, the Lord Jesus Christ. It is for this reason that when men attempt to aid the gospel in any way, except by teaching it in the power and demonstration of the Spirit of God, they only hinder it, and blind men's minds to the great truth given as a parting injunction to the disciples by our Lord: "Without me ye can do nothing." Governmental religion is always and everywhere a negation of this truth, and is therefore, antichristian. C. P. B.
