VERY unfortunately General Grant once said that the best way to get rid of a bad law was to rigidly enforce it. It is a great mistake. The enforcement of a bad law means injustice to somebody, and injustice is never justifiable. The best way to get rid of a bad law is to repeal it; and as a general thing if those who are charged with the enforcement of such laws would speak out promptly and demand their repeal, legislatures would be quick to respond.

We remarked last week that it remained to be seen whether the courts of Maryland would sustain the Sunday law of that State. As will appear from an article on another page, this question has been affirmatively answered, at least so far as the minor courts are concerned. The Circuit Court of Kent County has not only affirmed the law but has decided that in enforcing it justices and constables may ride roughshod over the statutory guarantees of the citizen. It requires only a like decision from the Supreme Court of Maryland to entitle that State to rank with Tennessee in the iniquitous work of persecution for conscience' sake.
