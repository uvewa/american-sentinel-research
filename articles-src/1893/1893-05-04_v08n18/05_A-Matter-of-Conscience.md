# A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE.

## A CASE OF UNUSUAL CHARACTER IN THE CIRCUIT COURT.

A Seventh-day Adventist on Trial for Working on Sunday—His Attorney Sets Up the Defense that to Forbid Him to do so Infringes His Religious Liberty—It Appears that the Warrant in the Case was Both Issued and Served on Sunday—Some Important Legal Points Involved in the Case.

VERY wide-spread interest has been taken in this community in the case of the State against J. W. Judefind, a Seventh-day Adventist, which was tried on appeal from Justice Wilkins, last week in our Circuit Court under a charge of working on Sunday. The interest was due partly to the fact that no similar prosecution has been undertaken in this county for many years, and partly to the fact that the defendant was a member of a religious denomination which has been making many converts recently in Kent County, and which entertains peculiar and pronounced views in regard to the nature of Sunday laws and to their constitutionality in this country.

The case assumed still more importance because it is one of a number which have recently arisen in various parts of the country, and have engaged the special attention of a large and influential body known as the International Religious Liberty Association, which has undertaken to test the validity of Sunday laws to the utmost, wherever their enforcement is attempted, and has employed Mr. James T. Ringgold, of the Baltimore Bar, author of a work on "The Law of Sunday," an earnest opponent of Sunday laws, as counsel to defend such cases as they arise from time to time. Mr. Ringgold was seen by a Transcript reporter at the Voshell House last week, and explained himself and friends in this matter substantially as follows:—

"I am very much obliged to you, sir, for calling on me, as I am a newspaper man myself, both by virtue of my first love and considerable experience, and I have a particular pleasure in talking with Maryland members of the fraternity, because I used to publish a newspaper that included every journal in the State in its list of exchanges. Another thing—a man gets a chance in a matter of this sort to do more real good for a good cause through an informal talk with a press representative than he does by trying a case in court. I am not myself a member of the Seventh-day Adventist community, nor do I represent the organization directly. My connection is with the International Religious Liberty Association, a body of men who have organized for the purpose of securing an absolute divorcement of the State from the Church, which they believe, and I think rightly believe, is very far from existing in the United States. There are other things included in our jurisprudence which represent this union of Church and State, besides the Sunday law, and the Association is pledged to destroy these, as well as the Sunday laws themselves. I could show you if I had time express provisions in the constitution of this State which are nothing more or less than religious dogmas incorporated into our organic law, but our present concern is mainly with the established Church, as set up in Maryland by the Act of 1723. If you will look at that act, you will see what I mean when I say that it sets up an established Church in this State. You will find that it mentions a certain day in the week as 'The Lord's Day.' Now, it does not need a legal education to enable a man to understand that the question of whether there is or is not such a day as 'The Lord's Day,' and the further question of what particular day of the week, or of the month, or of the year, or of the century is 'the Lord's Day,' are purely religious questions, that is to say, questions upon which the churches are divided, and that, therefore, for an American legislature to designate any day of the week, or of the month, or of the year, or of the century as 'the Lord's Day,' is to set up an established Church in the State. Moreover, in our Sunday law, the old colonial legislature which passed it two hundred years ago, not only set up one established Church over all others, by determining the purely religious question of what was and what was not 'the Lord's day,' but it undertook to determine the also purely religious question, of what was and what was not the proper 'observance' of that day. Notwithstanding the numerous decisions sustaining Sunday laws in this country, the International Religious Liberty Association is of the opinion, and I think rightly of the opinion, that their constitutionality has never yet been thoroughly and radically tested. Its purpose is in future cases to secure explicit and precise rulings on every point which it considers can legitimately be raised against such laws at nisi prius, and to have these rulings explicitly and precisely sustained or reversed by the courts of last resort in every State, and ultimately to bring the question in all its aspects before the Supreme Court of the United States.

"It is probable that most Sunday law cases in the immediate future will involve the prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists. I have only recently become acquainted with these remarkable people, and I shall be obliged to you if you will give me space enough to tell you just how much I think of them, and why I think it. You know that among the pagan philosophers it was a fundamental principle that the social order could not be preserved without a union of the Church and the State. None of these old pagan philosophers believed in the Church themselves but they thought that it was absolutely necessary for the mass of the people to be compelled to pretend, at any rate, that they believed in it. About A. D., 321 the professed followers of Christianity adopted this pagan theory, and effected a union of their alleged Christian Church with the State under the pagan Emperor Constantine, to which pagan they thereafter dutifully submitted points of Christian doctrine for final decision. If you will look at Dean Milman's 'History of Christianity,' you will find that he states, as a pretty conclusive reason to him against the reality of the pretended miracle of the pagan Constantine's conversion, the fact that the result of it was that the symbol of salvation and peace became in consequence of Constantine's vision the emblem of destruction and slaughter. It does not seem, however, to have occurred to the dean that the union of the Christian Church with the pagan civil power was an all-sufficient evidence that the Christian Church, as such had ceased to exist. Nor has this occurred to any of the so-called Christian denominations until within a very recent period. All of them have in turn objected to a union between the State and any other Church than their own, and have eloquently protested against persecution of the saints by the sinners, but all of them have been anxious to secure a union between the State and their own Church, and have regarded with complacent approval the persecution of the sinners by the saints.

"So far as I know, the Seventh-day Adventists are the only Christian denomination who insist upon it that a union between the Christian Church and the State, to any extent whatever, is an impossibility, because, the instant that a church becomes united with the State to any extent whatever, it thereupon ceases at once to be to any extent whatever a Christian church. Now the astounding thing about this proposition to my mind is, that it contradicts not only the wisdom of the ages, as we find it in the works of the pagan philosophers and in the works and actions of other so-styled Christian denominations, but that it takes us back nearly two thousand years to find a single person of historical importance who agreed with these people. Unfortunate as it is for them, they have absolutely no authority whatever for this extraordinary position of theirs, except the Founder of Christianity himself. To him was due the formulation and announcement of the theory, repudiated by his so-called followers in the early part of the fourth century, and by most of them ever since, that the things which were Caesar's should be rendered to Caesar, and the things which were the Deity's should be rendered to Deity—that the domain of religion was within men and not without, and that the sword of the civil power, so far as religion was concerned, should remain forever within its sheath, because all who would thereafter take up that sword in the name of religion should 'surely perish' thereby. Having planted themselves upon the basis of this particular Preacher's principles, the Seventh-day Adventists repudiate quite as strenuously any union of their own church with the State as they do the union of other churches therewith. Thus, while they oppose Sunday laws, they by no means advocate, nor would they accept, Saturday laws, of like character, for their benefit, on account of their religious belief. Some comment has been made upon my failure to make in court the point that they are molested in their religious belief or practice by the Sunday laws. I will be glad to have you state that neither the principles of their church nor my instructions from the International Religious Liberty Association would have permitted that particular line of defense. Recently, in trying some cases of a similar character to this, in Tennessee, when we endeavored to make up an 'agreed' statement of facts' for purposes of appeal, we declined to insert therein any statement whatever as to the religious belief of the defendants who were Seventh-day Adventists. Now, in the Bill of Rights of our State constitution, it is laid down, substantially, that no man should be molested in his religious profession or practice, unless he, under the color thereof 'disturbs the good order, peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil or religious rights.' You will see that the Sunday law under which Mr. Judefind was arraigned was passed in 1723, when Maryland was a colony of Great Britain, and the union of Church and State, which still exists in that country was, naturally, a recognized part of our polity. This old ecclesiastical statute, embodying and exemplifying the English union of Church and State, we claim is inconsistent with our American, Maryland, State Bill of Rights. We claim that the special provisions of the statute, and the use of the words 'Lord's day' therein sufficiently show that the law infringes the religious liberty of every one.

"We assert, as a mere fact of physics, or the material world of which, as of course the courses of the planet, the dates of the almanac, and such like, every court is bound to take judicial cognizance, that no acts of ours can possibly 'Disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, or infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil or religious rights,' because those acts are done on Sunday, but that the effect of all human acts herein is precisely the same, no matter upon what day they may be done. Our position is, that to require of us any special line of conduct on any particular day because that day happens to be, in the opinion of the legislature of 1723, 'the Lord's day,' is to deprive us of an inherent and inalienable right as American citizens to determine for ourselves, not only whether there is any such day as 'the Lord's day,' but, if so, what that day is, and, what its proper observance may be. We deny the right of the legislature to prescribe regulations for our conduct upon any other ground whatever except that it interferes with the legal rights and privileges of other people, and we deny the right of legislatures or courts to inquire of us whether we recognize any day as 'the Lord's day,' or recognize any special observance thereof, or whether we have any religion, or no religion. What we complain of in the Sunday laws, as American citizens, is not that they prevent us from holding any religious belief we prefer, or none at all, but that they cram down our throats a religious dogma of other people, and force us into an external compliance with the religious dogma of Sunday idleness, which we assert our right to believe in or not to believe in, to comply with or not to comply with, just as we choose. This, as I understand, is the position of the Seventh-day Adventists.

"You will easily see how charmingly consistent, how thoroughly American, and how uncommonly close to the New Testament precepts it all is, and you can readily understand how this makes the cause of the Seventh-day Adventists the cause of the International Religious Liberty Association as well as the cause of every man in the country who believes in religious equality, as distinguished from religious toleration. I am afraid that I have kept you too long, but the fact is that the identification of Christianity with religious equality by these people has interested me so much that when I get started to talking about it I am apt to run at considerable length. You will understand, however, that this is not their battle alone, but the battle of our Hebrew fellow-citizens, as well as of all men who believe that there is a radical inconsistency between the spirit of true religion and the use of the policeman's club or magistrate's 'varrants,' whether technically correct or otherwise."—*Chestertown, (Md.)
