[The following from the Pittsburg *Leader* is interesting as an earnest expression of the views of one Methodist who very heartily disagrees with the legal enforcement of formal religion. This correspondent of the *Leader* is not the only one of his kind who understands the actual facts in these matters. Why should not more speak? They can not always hold their peace.]

*Editor Leader:* For some weeks past I have been watching the war that has been raging between the friends of common sense and human rights and the band of fanatics known as the Law and Order League, and I must say that in all my travel, both in this country and Europe, I have never met with a community so infested with narrow-minded bigots as Pittsburg and Allegheny.

One is carried back to the early part of the fourth century where the so-called Christian Church in Rome had lost its power and influence over the hearts and consciences of men, and in order to perpetuate itself was compelled to resort to civil authority. The Roman emperor was deluged with petitions from friends of the Christian (?) Sabbath demanding the closing of the theaters and circus on that day, because their churches were empty and the places of amusement were well patronized. The gospel, as preached by them, had lost its power; men had no use for an apostate church which paid so little attention to the plain teaching of the Scriptures, and a clergy who were overly anxious about their own support, determined that if they could not persuade men by the love of God they would whip them in by the scourge of civil law, and so they, like the law and order leagues of to-day, had a Sunday law passed.

History repeats itself, and away down here in the latter end of the nineteenth century, the century of progress and increase of knowledge, under a Government that pretends to offer an asylum to the oppressed of every nation, and guarantees freedom of religious thought and worship, we find ourselves burdened with a law that ought to be relegated to the oblivion of the Dark Ages, and which finds its only basis in the opinions of a few hypocrites who, despite all their religious cant, are afraid of the Bible and wrest it to their own destruction.

Upon what are Sunday laws based? Upon the Scriptures? No! a thousand times no!! notwithstanding the fact that Rev. R. H. Hood, in his paper on "Sabbath Reform," read before the United Presbyterian ministers' meeting, actually had the audacity to say that Jesus entered into the sanctuary and healed the sick on Sunday. Hear, oh, ye heavens! A minister of the gospel, an ambassador of Jesus Christ, defending an unscriptural, unrighteous, un-American institution by such a perversion of the inspired word of a holy God! Where is the passage in the Bible that states that Jesus Christ entered into the synagogue or healed on Sunday? Luke 6: 1-16 mentions the fact that Jesus Christ entered the synagogue and taught and also healed a man on the Sabbath, but was it Rev. Mr. Hood's Sunday? If so, why did the Pharisees condemn him for it? Were they as jealous for the sacredness of the pagan holiday of their heathen rulers as modern reformers are?

In all the Bible there is not a single word authorizing the observance of any other day than the one set apart by God as the memorial of creation and which he said should be a "perpetual sign between him and his people." Nor is there a single instance of any other day being observed. The disciples were gathered together in an upper room, their common dwelling-place, with the doors closed for fear of the Jews on the evening of the day of the resurrection, not to celebrate that event, for it is evident from the reproof administered by their risen Lord that they did not believe he had risen. It is plainly evident that there is no scriptural basis for Sunday legislation.

The next argument used is that the American people have decided to adopt Sunday as the American Sabbath. When? How? The people can not do anything except through Congress, and that body is, by the Constitution, prohibited from making laws of a religious character. The people have never adopted Sunday as the national Sabbath.

Another argument used is that ordinary traffic on Sunday interferes with religious worship. Let us see. Does the regular business of the week interfere with the Wednesday night prayer-meetings or the daily meetings during a revival season? No such complaint has ever been made. Did anybody ever hear of a congregation of Hebrews or other Saturday keepers complaining that they were disturbed by the ordinary business that was carried on during their hours of worship? No! But it may be that the sneaking, narrow-minded bigots of "Sabbath" reform are made of a better grade than anybody else.

As a last resort we are told that a majority of the citizens of this country are in favor of Sunday laws. I most emphatically deny it. Of course if, according to that apostle of bigotry, "Rev." Wilbur F. Crafts, editor of the *Christian Statesman*, the signatures of two Methodist bishops stand for 4,000,000 of Methodists, and Cardinal Gibbons' indorsement pledges the signatures of 7,500,000 Roman Catholics, and 15,000,000 petitioners from Pennsylvania desire such legislation, is all true, then I will withdraw from the field of battle. But the writer is one of a good many Methodists who believe in the Bible and the Constitution of the United States, who decline to be represented by a bishop's signature as supporting such unrighteous legislation.

I have no objection to a man believing and preaching any doctrine he chooses, but I most strenuously object to his forcing his theological views upon the community by means of the civil law, and having been born and reared in this country, the great-grandson of a man who laid down his life for its freedom in the Revolutionary War, I just as decidedly object to taking the advice of a "Sabbath" reformer to go to some desert island and in the name of His Satanic Majesty and for the sake of the "prince of darkness" set up a government of my own. We have a superfuity of Satan's government under the rule of the "Sabbath" reformers.

*Allegheny, Pa., April 21, 1893.*
