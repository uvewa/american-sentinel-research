THE following resolutions, recently adopted by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, and re-adopted by the Litchfield church of that denomination speak for themselves:—

WHEREAS, in view of the separation which we believe should exist between the Church and State it is inconsistent for the Church to receive from the State pecuniary gifts, favors or exemptions, therefore,

*Resolved*, That we repudiate the doctrine that church or other ecclesiastical property should be exempt from taxation, and further,

*Resolved*, That we decidedly protest against such exemption, and favor the repeal of such legislation as grants such exemption.

*Litchfield Independent, Litchfield, Minn.*
