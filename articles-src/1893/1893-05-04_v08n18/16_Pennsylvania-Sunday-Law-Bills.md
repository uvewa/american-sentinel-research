THE Associated Press despatches note the progress of the attempt to modify or repeal the Sunday laws of Pennsylvania as follows:—

Harrisburg, April 21.—When Senator Flinn yesterday asked unanimous consent to make a motion to discharge the committee on vice and immorality from further consideration of the bill to repeal the Allegheny County special Blue Law act of 1855, several noes were heard. Mr. Flinn stated that the committee stood four for reporting affirmatively, and four for negative recommendation, and the tie might remain unbroken. The bill had been reported Wednesday, but recommitted on his motion to satisfy an absent member of the committee, and he could not see why senators objected to reporting the bill at this time. Several senators did object, and the matter went over until next week.

The rival "Law and Order" organizations of Pittsburg are awaiting the result of these bills like hounds straining at the leash—there will be a full throated chorus and a view-halloo either way the quarry turns. The hunt is on.
