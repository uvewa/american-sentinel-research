THE systematic persecution of the Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, in Maryland, and elsewhere, and the organized effort throughout the country to establish and enforce the most strenuous legal discrimination against all seventh-day keepers, does not abate in the least the activity of the Seventh-day Adventists in good works, in the lines of educational and medical missionary labor which require large outlays of means and the time and strength of many self-sacrificing laborers. The Mt. Vernon Sanitarium building, Mt. Vernon, Ohio, where this denomination has conducted a medical institution, well and favorably known for some years, will be closed as a Sanitarium on May 1, and opened September 1, as an academy. It is understood that already about two hundred prospective students have applied for entrance next fall. All the medical appliances and furniture will be removed to 28 College Place, Chicago, where a new sanitarium is to be opened, in connection with a training school for medical missionaries. The medical missionary work of the Seventh-day Adventists is far more efficient and thorough than anything of the kind ever before attempted, and is being rapidly extended.
