# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, May 4, 1893 (v08n18)

## Article 01: Legal Religion Antichristian

- **Page 137, Column 1, Paragraph 2:** "and are we to forget that this was said to them?" — The text may read "all" instead of "said" but "said" makes more grammatical sense in context.
  - **Second pass:** On closer inspection, "said" is the correct reading.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

- **Page 138, Column 1:** The long indented quotation about "The government of God is not, as Satan would make it appear..." — This appears to be a quotation from a Seventh-day Adventist source (likely E. G. White). The text was carefully read but some line-level details in the small print were difficult.
  - **Second pass:** Text verified against column layout.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

- **Page 138, Column 2:** Scripture reference markers (* + ++ | S) — The original uses footnote symbols (asterisks, daggers, double daggers, section marks). The footnote text at the bottom of the column reads: "*Rom. 8:7, 8." "+Rom. 1:16." "++Eph. 3:9. Col. 1:25, 27. Eph. 3:10, 11." "|Eph. 5:27." — These are footnote references within the article. Transcribed using generic symbols rather than exact typographic marks.
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The exact sequence of footnote symbols may vary slightly from the original typographic marks.

## Article 02: Some Straightforward Preaching

- **Page 138, Column 2:** "Rev. L. J. Andrew" vs "Rev. L. J. Andrews" — The headline text says "ANDREW" but later in the body it says "Mr. Andrews said." The original appears to use both forms.
  - **Second pass:** The name appears as "ANDREW" in the introduction and "Andrews" in the discourse attribution. Both forms preserved as printed.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

- **Page 138, Column 3 (top):** "Broad-minded men say" — This paragraph begins at the top of column 3 of page 138. The transition from column 2 to column 3 was verified.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

## Article 03: Trial for Sunday Work

- **Page 139, Column 1:** "Here he was interrupted by Mr. Ringgold" — The exact wording around "that he considered—Here he was interrupted" is slightly uncertain due to the em-dash positioning.
  - **Second pass:** Reading confirmed.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

- **Page 139, Column 2:** Jefferson quotation in italics — "The spirit of the times may alter, will alter." — Verified against the well-known "Notes on Virginia" passage.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

## Article 04: A Matter of Conscience

- **Page 139, Column 3:** Subheadline text — "that the Warrent in the Case was Both Issued" — The word "Warrent" appears to be spelled this way in the original (rather than "Warrant"). Preserved as printed.
  - **Second pass:** The text is small but appears to read "Warrent" rather than "Warrant."
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM

- **Page 140, Column 2:** "So far as I know, the Seventh-day Adventists are the only Christian denomination who insist upon it that a union between the *Christian* Church and the State..." — The word "Christian" appears to be italicized in the original.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

- **Page 141, Column 1:** "'warrants,' whether technically correct or otherwise" — The ending attribution reads "Chestertown, (Md.) Transcript, April 27, 1893." Date verified.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

## Article 05: Infallibility

- **Page 141, Column 1-2:** Author name "G. D. Ballou" — This is clearly printed. Location "Grant's Pass, Oregon" is also clear.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

## Article 06: Religion by Law

- **Page 141, Column 2:** Author name "A. F. Belo" — The surname could potentially be "Belo" or "Bela" but appears most clearly as "Belo."
  - **Second pass:** The final letter appears to be "o" making it "Belo."
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 07: Bishop Ireland and the Public Schools

- **Page 141, Column 3:** "Monsignor McGoide of Duluth" — The name could be "McGoide" or "McGoide." This is an unusual name.
  - **Second pass:** The text appears to read "McGoide" though this may be an error in the original for "McGoide" or another spelling.
  - **Confidence:** LOW — The name is unusual and the print is small.

## Article 08: A Methodist on Paganism in Pittsburg

- **Page 142, Column 2:** "Rev. R. H. Hood" — Name clearly printed.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH

## Article 10: Pennsylvania Sunday Laws and the Press

- No significant uncertainties.

## Article 12: Editorial Notes

- **Page 144, Column 3:** "Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods" notice — This appears to be an announcement/advertisement but is presented as editorial content rather than a display ad. Included as it contains substantive information.
  - **Confidence:** HIGH
