# Uncertainties — v08n18 (1893-05-04)

## Associate Editor Name

- **Location:** Page 1, Masthead
- **Issue:** OCR reads "WILLIAM H. BULKAR" for the second associate editor name
- **Transcribed as:** "WILLIAM H. McKEE" in 00_masthead.md
- **Confidence:** HIGH — "BULKAR" is clearly an OCR error; William H. McKee (WHM) is the known associate editor for this period
- **Reason:** McKee is the documented associate editor; the OCR garbled the name

## Author "A. F. BELO"

- **Location:** Page 6, article "Religion by Law"
- **Issue:** The author signature reads "A. F. BELO." — this name is not in the known authors list. It may be an OCR error for "A. F. BELO" (a real name) or a misread of another name (e.g., "A. F. Bell" or another variant).
- **Transcribed as:** "A. F. Belo" (as printed)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — preserved exactly as printed; could be a genuine contributor or an OCR/print error
- **Reason:** No correction made; name preserved as-is per transcription rules

## Rev. Fred Stuart / "HEY. HRED STUART"

- **Location:** Page 7, editorial note "Some Deep Irony"
- **Issue:** OCR reads "HEY. HRED STUART" — likely a severe OCR distortion of "Rev. Fred Stuart" (the "HEY." may be garbled "REV." and "HRED" garbled "FRED")
- **Transcribed as:** "HEY. HRED STUART" (exactly as printed in OCR source)
- **Confidence:** LOW — the name is clearly garbled; "Rev. Fred Stuart of Detroit" is the most plausible reading
- **Reason:** The OCR source is the only available text; without access to the original scan, the garbled form is preserved, flagged here for correction against the original

## "Crazmer" (article 03)

- **Location:** Page 2, article "Some Straightforward Preaching"
- **Issue:** OCR reads "Crazmer" — likely "Cranmer" (Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, Protestant reformer)
- **Transcribed as:** "Crazmer" (as printed in OCR source)
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly an OCR error for "Cranmer"
- **Reason:** Preserved as printed; flagged for correction against original scan

## Dr. "Boquillion" and Monsignor "McGolick"

- **Location:** Page 6, article "Bishop Ireland and the Public Schools"
- **Issue:** OCR renders "Dr. Boquillion" (likely "Bouquillon" — Thomas Bouquillon, Catholic theologian) and "Monsignor McGolick" (likely "McGolrick" — likely James McGolrick, Bishop of Duluth)
- **Transcribed as:** "Dr. Boquillion" and "Monsignor McGolick" (as printed in OCR source)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — common OCR errors for these names; preserved as printed
- **Reason:** Both are likely OCR distortions; flagged for verification against original

## "tecimony" (article 08)

- **Location:** Page 6, article "Bishop Ireland and the Public Schools"
- **Issue:** OCR reads "tecimony" — clearly a garbled word, almost certainly "testimony"
- **Transcribed as:** "testimony" (corrected in article text)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — "tecimony" is not a word; context confirms "testimony"
- **Reason:** Obvious OCR error corrected silently in transcription

## Footnote references (article 02)

- **Location:** Pages 1-2, "Legal Religion Antichristian"
- **Issue:** Footnotes appear as "*Born. 8: 7, 8." and "†Born. 1: 16." — these are almost certainly "Rom." (Romans) misread as "Born." by OCR
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved as "*Born. 8: 7, 8." etc. within the body text where they appear (as footnote markers in running text)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — "Born." is certainly OCR for "Rom." (Romans)
- **Reason:** Footnote references preserved as appearing in OCR source; flagged for correction

## Scripture reference footnotes (article 02)

- **Location:** Page 2, "Legal Religion Antichristian"
- **Issue:** "‡Eph. 2: 9. Col. 1: 26, 37. Eph. 3: 10, 11." — the "Col. 1: 26, 37" may be "Col. 1: 26, 27" (common citation); preserved as printed
- **Transcribed as:** Footnote markers (‡ and §) and their references are retained in the article body as they appear in the OCR
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — exact verse numbers uncertain from OCR

## Page 8 header "THE NATIONAL SENTINEL"

- **Location:** Page 8
- **Issue:** The page 8 section is headed "THE NATIONAL SENTINEL" — this appears to be a running section title or header for the editorial notes page, not a separate publication title. The American Sentinel is the correct publication name.
- **Decision:** Treated as a section header for the page 8 editorial notes, not a separate entity
