THE newspapers of the country are beginning to have an opinion on the subject of Sunday laws. Below are extracts showing the views of some prominent papers:—

The Law Needs an Overhauling.

A man has been arrested and fined in Pittsburg because he owned stock in a paper published on Sunday. An alderman having learned from observation that the fire in the Carnegie works are not entirely extinguished on Sunday, and that men are engaged to watch them, announces his intention to have warrants issued for the arrest of the stockholders in the company. As half the fine goes to the informer the Sunday law opens to a certain class of men a new field for enterprise. All who own shares in a railroad company which runs any trains on Sunday are liable to arrest and fine under the construction of the Sunday law. If some judge would extend the interpretation of the law so as to render all who hold annual passes over a railroad which runs trains on Sunday liable to arrest and fine, the entire legislature might be hauled into the Criminal Court and led to see, perhaps, that the old Sunday law of 1794 would be the better for a little overhauling.—*Philadelphia Press.*

Reciprocity That May Do Good.

The Law and Order Society of Pittsburg proposes to stop the publication not only of Sunday papers, but of Monday morning papers as well, because most of the labor on the latter is done on Sundays. The newspapers, in retaliation, propose to have all the Sunday laws enforced, and if the undertaking is successful some of the law and order people will be hit in financially tender spots. That is a kind of reciprocity that they do not look upon with admiration.—*Rochester Democrat.*

Enforce the Law to the Letter.

The people of Pittsburg evidently do not propose to let the Sabbatarians have a monopoly of the business of enforcing the Blue Laws of Pennsylvania. If it is wrong to issue Sunday newspapers, it is also wrong to do any work on the Lord's day, and so the authorities will see to it that the statutes that were enacted over a century ago to meet the stern Quaker sentiment of those times are enforced to the letter. That is the way to do away with them forever.—*Boston Herald.*

The agitation of this subject is not to cease with the Sunday closing, or opening, of the World's Fair, but it will continue until every municipality, from the least to the greatest, shall have had its decisive contests over the question,—until every court shall have made its authoritative precedent; and until every individual citizen has taken his stand upon the question, either for or against.
