EVERY man should be left free to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, but by the way the churches and the preachers are exerting their influence with our law-makers, it seems that they want to force man to worship God according to the dictates of another's conscience, not his own. That is what is called religion by law, or forced religion. Religion should be voluntary, not forced. The churches and the preachers show a great weakness when they try to get the Government to enact religious laws to force their particular beliefs or tenets or doctrines upon the people. They show their utter inability to make converts by their preaching, but want the Government to help force people to be religious; but this can not be done.

When they get Sunday laws passed why do they not go a step further and have a law enacted compelling people to attend church, be baptized, celebrate the Lord's supper, read their Bibles, and pray so many times a day, and ask a blessing at the table?—all of which is just as reasonable as forcing people by civil law to keep any day holy. Every man has to give account of himself to God. If the churches would stick to the Bible, and not try to get the civil Government to help force people, they would prosper more, and do more good.

Men will not be forced in matters of religion, or anything else if they can avoid it. Man can not be made religious by law, and the sooner the churches find out this fact the better. It seems that history is repeating itself, for in the past when the Church attempted and even got the assistance of the State, then religious persecution began, and the bloodiest part of the world's history was then. It seems that such a time is fast approaching now. May God in his goodness and mercy open the eyes of those who are trying to enforce their views upon others by law.
