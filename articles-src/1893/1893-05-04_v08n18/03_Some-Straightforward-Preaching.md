REV. L. J. ANDREW, of Pittsburg, Pa., is reported as having preached on the evening of Sunday, April 16, in the Grand Opera House, Pittsburg, to a congregation of over a thousand people on the Sunday question. During his discourse Mr. Andrews said:—

Within the last few months the Sunday question has been brought prominently before the American people. It has been decided to close the World's Fair on Sunday. This is in accordance with the wishes of honest, but misguided people. It does not accord with the views of the majority of mankind.

In the last year the people in our State and city have taken a narrow view of things pertaining to Sunday. Now, the individual is supreme; he is above all government. Some people are born with small natures. I do not know of anything that will make a dwarf a giant, or a bigot a gentleman. America leads the world in liberality, but it is a question whether we are freer than the Germans or the French. Christianity is in danger as much from the bigotry of adherents, as from immorality.

Broad-minded men say, "Look! Does Christianity make a man intolerant and a bigot? If it does we will have nothing to do with it." This is the most conglomerate Nation in the world, and we ought to be the most liberal people on earth. So, I say, Jesus Christ was a liberal man.

Shall we keep Saturday or Sunday? The great reformers of the world were equally tolerant. This is true of Luther, Crazmer, and the rest. This is not the Sabbath. That day was yesterday.

The preacher had noticed elsewhere that religious laws did not regenerate the people, for he said, "I observe that the most degraded cities of Europe are those governed by Puritanic laws." He also scored the inconsistencies of prosecuting the publishers for issuing newspapers which had been prepared and set up on Saturday, and letting those go free upon whose papers all the work was done on Sunday, and declared, if the positions taken by those who would enforce the Sunday laws were correct, then it was wrong to hire janitors to heat and care for churches on Sunday, and an infraction of the law for salaried ministers to preach.
