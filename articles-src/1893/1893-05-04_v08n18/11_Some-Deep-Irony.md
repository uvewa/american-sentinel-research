REV. REED STUART, of Detroit, Mich., lately expressed himself in the following language of deep irony in reference to the part which the religious element of this country has taken in securing the action of Congress to close the World's Fair on Sunday:—

We have shown that we have great influence. We have made Congress do an unconstitutional thing. We have succeeded in compelling our lawmakers to do for us what, if it were done for the Catholics, all of us would denounce, and some would take up arms to oppose; that is, deciding a religious question, and voting money for a national purpose with qualifications to fit the opinions of certain religious sects.

Some of our methods have not been of the highest the human mind could conceive. We have indulged in some denunciation, which is never very just, even when a cause is just. We have mistaken the word Sunday for religion, and have permitted our zeal for the former to make us say some things which the latter would forbid.

Idolatry is the worship of that which is seen; of the thing rather than the principle; of the symbol rather than that which is symbolized. The institution is not a means but a finality. The temple is holder than the religion which built it. A rite or ordinance is esteemed of more value than the soul. Humanity is often sacrificed to a mere custom.

We say the Sabbath was not made for man—for humanity—but for some men and women; namely, for those who think as we do about it and will observe it as we do.

These paragraphs contain facts. It would be well if those who have succeeded in securing such undesirable and contradictory results, would give them some consideration. The arraignment of the course taken towards the World's Fair in Sunday closing as unconstitutional, unjust, and idolatrous is merited by the facts.
