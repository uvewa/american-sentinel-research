THE case of Mr. J. W. Judefind, accused of husking corn on Sunday, referred to in these columns last week, was tried at Chestertown, the county seat of Kent County, Maryland, on the 19th ult., with the result that Mr. Judefind was convicted, and on refusal to pay the fine and costs was sent to jail for sixty days.

Mr. Jas. T. Ringgold, author of "The Law of Sunday," and member of the Baltimore Bar, appeared as counsel for Mr. Judefind. The defendant waived a jury and the case was tried by the judges. The Circuit Courts in Maryland have a bench of three judges, but in this instance only two were present.

Before the examination of the witnesses was begun the defense moved to dismiss the case (1) because the information did not charge a crime under the statutes of the State, and (2) because the statute itself is unconstitutional. The court, however, refused to hear any argument at this stage of proceedings, and ordered the State's attorney to proceed with the examination of the witnesses, remarking that the legal points could be argued later.

The first, and indeed the principal witness for the State, was Rev. Robert Roe, pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Rock Hall, and the person at whose instigation the arrest was made. The transcript from the magistrate's docket stated that the warrant was issued "on the information and oath of Rev. Robert Roe," but Mr. Roe testified positively that he did not make oath to the information, that he was not sworn at all in connection with the case until he appeared as a witness after Mr. Judefind had been arrested, and that the record was false. This question was not thoroughly sifted, but it is probable that Mr. Roe told the truth, and that the magistrate was guilty of making a false record.

At the trial before the magistrate Mr. Roe was not able to identify Mr. Judefind positively, but before the Circuit Court his testimony was positive on this point. One or two other witnesses corroborated Mr. Roe as to the identity of the defendant, proving conclusively the fact that he did husk corn on Sunday, November 13, 1892.

The only incident of interest in the taking of the testimony was the cross-examination of Rev. Mr. Roe. This gentleman who testified that he was on his way to meeting, in company with his presiding elder, when he saw the defendant husking corn, was asked by Mr. Ringgold whether he was not carrying on his own regular work by which he earned his bread when he saw Mr. Judefind carrying on his regular work and earning his bread and butter. After some hesitation Mr. Roe admitted that he was engaged in his usual occupation by which he earned his bread, but said that his duties were religious and that he considered— Here he was interrupted by Mr. Ringgold, who told him to confine himself to the facts, that the court could be relied upon to do the considering. The witness was very ill at ease, and the fact that the audience several times laughed at his discomfiture added to his confusion. As soon as the evidence was all in the reverend persecutor fled the court room and was seen no more.

In his plea to the court Mr. Ringgold assailed the constitutionality of the law on the ground that it was in conflict with Article 36, of the Bill of Rights, which provides:—

That, as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to him, all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore, no person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practice, unless under color of religion any man shall disturb the good order, peace, or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil, or religious rights.

The court remarked that it was not in evidence that Mr. Judefind's work had anything to do with his religion, but Mr. Ringgold replied that that was not necessary, inasmuch as the purpose of the law was clearly to secure the recognition of a religious institution it was an interference with the rights of the individual whatever his religious convictions might be; that the purpose of the Bill of Rights clearly was to leave every man absolutely free, not only to believe as he pleased in religious matters, but to practice has he saw fit so long as he did not disturb "the good order, peace, or safety of the State," or "infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil, or religious rights."

That ordinary, quiet Sunday work does not properly come under any of these exceptions was clearly shown. The observance or non-observance of Sunday is not a moral question in the legal sense of that word, but is a religious question. That is the moral aspect of the question must depend wholly on the religious views of the individual. A point was also made against the law on the ground of its uncertainty. What are works of necessity and charity which are excepted by the statute? On this point Mr. Ringgold read the case of Lyon *v.* Strong, 6 Vt., 236, as follows:—

The statute exempts all acts of necessity and charity. These are lawful, and who is to judge what are such? If the jury, it will depend on the religious opinions of each jury, and of course be pregnant with the utmost uncertainty. If the court, as matter of law, *then it will nearly convert a bench of laymen into an ecclesiastical council, for "necessity" and charity in connection with the Sabbath must very much depend upon the creed or religious belief of the individual to whom the question is submitted. . . . . How ungracious for a court to mark the law upon this duty for all denominations to be governed by and with judges usually belonging to different religious societies of several sects.*

The points, however, which seemed most to impress the judges were that the information did not charge a crime under the statute, and that the writ was served on Sunday. On the first of these it was urged that inasmuch as the statute excepts certain kinds of work, or rather work done for certain reasons, it is not enough to charge that one has worked on Sunday but that the work was not a work of necessity or charity, or that it was done contrary to the statute. On the second point the court was shown that the statute itself forbids arrests on Sunday except for treason, felony, or breach of the peace.

But however much the court was impressed at the moment, the effect was not lasting, for after some delay, owing to the illness of one of the judges, the decision of the magistrate's court was affirmed, with costs above and below; and on refusal to pay the fine and costs the defendant was sent to jail for sixty days.

The court further held that Sunday laws do not infringe personal rights, and that the issuing and serving of the writ on Sunday did not affect the case, notwithstanding the fact that an old English statute (29 Car. II., c. 7), now a part of the law of Maryland, provides that "no arrest can be made, nor process served upon Sunday, except for treason, felony, or breach of the peace." Just how the court got around this provision we are not informed, for it was probably by adopting the view urged by the State's attorney, that by appearing before the magistrate that functionary acquired jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, notwithstanding the fact that the service was irregular. Just how Mr. Judefind could have avoided making an appearance when he was under arrest and without counsel to advise him of his rights, neither the State's attorney nor the court undertook to explain. The fact is that unlike all other statutes, Sunday laws can be defeated, ordinarily, neither by pleading constitutional rights, statutory provisions, nor technical defects in their administration. However, this decision is so manifestly unjust, illogical and without legal warrant, that it ought to be tested in the Supreme Court, and we hope that it will be.

Before this comes under the eye of the reader another case of similar nature will have been tried before the same court at Centreville, Queen Anne's County, Md. And these cases are only the beginning of what will certainly be a bitter persecution under the Maryland Sunday law. Thomas Jefferson's words, "A single zealot may commence persecution, and better men be his victims," is being verified in Maryland. Jefferson, foreseeing that the spirit of intolerance, which, during the Revolutionary period was held in check, would revive, desired to have all religious laws swept from the statute books. He was not willing that they should remain even as dead letters to be revived at any time by partizan zeal. In his "Notes on Virginia" he said:—

*The spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may commence persecution, and better men be his victims. It can never be too often repeated, that the time for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest, and ourselves united. From the conclusion of this war we shall be going down hill. It will not then be necessary to resort every moment to the people for support. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights.* The shackles, there-

fore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion.

This is exemplified in Maryland to-day. Sectarian zeal and bigotry have set in motion the machinery of the law to oppress and harass an opposing sect, and thus the State becomes a party to a religious persecution similar to that in Tennessee. Like laws and similar possibilities exist in other States, and indeed in various forms and in greater or less degree in almost every State in the Union, and will, according to the natural course of events as indicated by the history of the past and by the sure word of prophecy, culminate in the utter extinction of our liberties, as predicted by Jefferson a century ago.
