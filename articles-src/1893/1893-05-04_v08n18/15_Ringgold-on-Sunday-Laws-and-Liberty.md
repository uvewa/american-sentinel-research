THE interview on another page which we republish from the Transcript, of Chestertown, Md., should not be omitted by any reader. It is full of interesting facts and opinions. Mr. Ringgold is never prosy, and especially is this true when he discusses Sunday laws and their relation to liberty of conscience.

The assumption by the courts of Tennessee and Maryland that a man must show that he has a religion before he can plead the constitutional guarantee of liberty of conscience is entirely unwarranted. The right to worship God, implies also the right not to worship. A man is not free to do that which he must do. The declaration of the Tennessee Bill of Rights that "no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience," is broad enough to cover with its mantle of protection the right of every man to absolute freedom in religious matters, and should be so construed by the courts. That it is not is ominous. It foreshadows even more serious assaults upon religious liberty than we have yet witnessed.

Likewise the language of Article 36, of the Maryland Bill of Rights, would seem to be sufficiently explicit to secure the rights of all, but that it does not is evidenced by the fact that a Seventh-day Adventist is in jail at Chestertown to-day for no other reason than practical dissent from his neighbors on the purely religious question as to which day of the week should be observed as the Christian Sabbath. The Bill of Rights declares that "all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore no person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practice, unless under color of religion any man shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil, or religious rights." But this is ignored, and a Seventh-day Adventist is imprisoned for husking corn on Sunday, a day which his religion teaches him should be devoted to secular pursuits in obedience to that part of the divine law which says: "Six days shall thou labor and do all thy work." That husking corn is immoral can not be maintained; that it interferes with others is too absurd to be even asserted; but that the law of Maryland forbids it on Sunday in deference to the religious prejudices of a portion of the citizens of that commonwealth, and that the courts stand ready to enforce the law notwithstanding the Bill of Rights, has been demonstrated, at least as to the inferior tribunals. What the court of last resort will do remains to be seen.
