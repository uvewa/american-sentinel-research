A PRIVATE letter, from a Seventh-day Adventist, in Asheville, N. C., says:—

> The prospect is that one or two of our brethren may be indicted for Sunday work. The court will be in session next week, and we hear they will not say anything until near the time. One is a farmer and has seven children; he was plowing in his field. He is a good man, and has been observing the Sabbath nearly a year.

What a strange inconsistency is here! This worthy farmer and father of a family who is conscientiously "observing the Sabbath" is to be put under arrest, and perhaps subjected to fine and imprisonment, upon the claim that he is failing to observe a Sabbath according to the statute made and provided.

The list of banner States of the American Sabbath Union is increasing. This is the roll of dishonor—Arkansas, Tennessee, Georgia, Maryland, and now North Carolina is about to swell the number. Although the attempted enforcement of religious law has become quite universal throughout the United States, in these States only has it yet attained to a definite religious persecution.
