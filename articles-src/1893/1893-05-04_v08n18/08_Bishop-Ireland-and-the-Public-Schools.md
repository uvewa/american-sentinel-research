Of all the leading men of Catholic influence in this country, none are better known, or have greater regard shown for their plans or utterances than Bishop Ireland. His plan for the adjustment of the school question as between the parochial and State institutions has met with the favor of the Vatican and the hearty approval or indorsement of a large class of citizens in this country aside from those of his own faith. So placid is the apparent settlement of the intruding question that has rasped against the State heretofore, that people are thrown off their guard and imagine that sentinels are no longer needed to stand upon duty lest an enemy should gain an entrance to this stronghold of the republic. There are some, however, who view this matter with great concern, knowing that there is no policy that is openly pursued towards the State, but what carries with it, or behind it, that which is intended to subvert the institutions of a free Government, towards which there has always been a menace by this autocratic power.

Of the thousands who read the plans, publicly set forth by this celebrated prelate for securing State aid for religious uses, there are very few who can distinguish the principles involved in the solution of this question, because a goodly exterior hides the serpent's tooth that is calculated, if once it strikes, to poison the whole circulation of the State. He says of his plans:—

> The objections are of two different kinds—practical and speculative. I could discard the speculative ones by simply observing that they are deductions derived from imagination or from designs of these persons, and are excluded by the practical conditions with which I have surrounded my settlement with the directors of the school committee.

Now it is easy to see how speculative objections may be excluded by practical conditions, that might surround any plan of action. But speculative objections are unworthy of consideration in themes that pertain to vital interests. It is the practical things that are to be sought. As to the practical objection, he says:—

> They say first that this settlement is only the beginning of a system which I intend to make, eventually, universal, and prove this alleging my speech at the Congress of public school teachers, the publication of a pamphlet by Dr. Boquillion, and a speech of Monsignor McGolick of Duluth.

After having stated that there was a practical objection to his plan and the proof that was urged in defense of that fact he proceeds to say that the practical objection is a "mere supposition." Thus it has ever been that when practical things and objections are advanced against the incursions of the Church upon the State, the invariable reply is, it is mere supposition. If the objection is practical, why parley over the matter? Why not seek and maintain a true position?—one that will bear the scrutiny of men and the test of principle, instead of covering up the issue beneath the rubbish of mere supposition. Again he says:—

> Whatever are my hopes for the future, the practical question of the moment is how to provide with a religious education, all those Catholic children to whom we can not give parochial schools, and it is proved by our statistics that they are sixty per cent. of our youth.

Since the prelate so artfully dodged the practical objection to his plan by the handy phrase of mere supposition, it is to be presumed that he would dodge the practical question in the same manner if pressed to the wall.

In the practical question of how to provide with a religious education this sixty per cent. of Catholic children, the whole issue is involved of obtaining the aid of the State to teach religion. Various have been the means by which Rome has sought to obtain an entering wedge that Catholic religion may be taught at the expense of the Government. The entering wedge has been secured; a few sturdy blows have been struck and others will surely and swiftly follow. For when once this bulwark of our Nation's greatness has succumbed to the conniving of this invincible foe, the rest will speedily bend beneath its crushing power. But he further says:—

> While we wait for the time far and uncertain when the Government shall endow our parochial schools. . . . shall we permit that sixty per cent. of our children to remain without that instruction (religious education) and shall we entrust them unconditionally with the public schools.

Again, the practical question receives farther impetus by the statement that the plan adopted—

> is an attempt by the episcopate to provide in a certain measure with a good Catholic education that sixty per cent. of our children who are now out of the parochial schools.

Thus the practical question assumes through the testimony of the instigator of the plan, not only the proposition of State aid for religious purposes, but for Catholic religious purposes and the worst feature of it all is that the plan is in process of execution. And so it is that while the State is constantly harassed by Protestant invasion upon its principles of liberty, there is the Catholic foe tearing at its vitals, and between the combination of these two elements the State, as a civil institution, will surely be slain.
