THE introduction of resolutions into both houses of the legislature now in session in Springfield, asking for a Congress to repeal the Sunday-closing provision of the World's Fair appropriation, stirred the so-called religious people of the city, and a mass-meeting was called to protest against the action of the legislature. The meeting was held in the First M. E. Church, a mass meeting, the Sunday advertised the "mass" of assemblage mainly did not exceed six or seven hundred. The meeting was called to order by Rev. D. T. Logan, who introduced the following resolutions:

Whereas, Resolutions have been presented to both branches of our State legislature, petitioning Congress to repeal the Sunday-closing provision of the World's Fair bill; and,

Whereas, These resolutions have been set on foot by those who have been interested in having the World's Fair opened on Sunday; and,

Whereas, Of the citizens of Springfield, assembled together in mass-meeting, desire to enter our protest against any action being taken by the legislature of the State of Illinois, requesting the United States Congress to repeal the said provision.

*Resolved*, That it has for a considerable time been regarded as a matter for State legislatures to petition Congress upon any subject of general interest. These resolutions are sent by people who have not been generally made known to the public of our State that is the opening of the Exposition, and as residents of this city, of the capital of the State of this State of Springfield called a mass meeting of the people of that city to protest against the action of the legislators.

The meeting was extensively advertised, but only two or a hundred persons were present, Nevertheless, the resolutions set forth that "the citizens of Springfield assembled" as "in the mass-meeting do most respectfully yet earnestly request."

That—

First.—An open Fair would lead to the running of railroads into Chicago and their return on Sunday, thus opening up many avenues and highways through which they pour, and pour into Chicago, and thus creating a necessity for labor on the part of many, if not actually or practically and eventually compelling them to work seven days in the week, instead of six.

Second.—It would bring into notice and activity and place in a false light before the nations of the earth the great republic of the United States, as having done in European cities at All done at all European expositions by closing our own Exposition on Sunday.

Third.—It would open the moral and religious life of our nation to an immense degree of damage, and morals.

Fourth.—It would be a violation of the law of the people and of the law of the State, and of civil government. As such it ought to be respected and upheld by those to whom it is committed.

*Resolved*, That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to our State Senators and members and to all the members of our delegation in Congress.

Several speeches followed the reading of these resolutions. Rev. Berry I. McLane, of Chicago, the Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was the chief speaker. He was quite enthusiastic in his remarks. He paid his respects to the directors of the Exposition in scathing language. He did not hesitate to say that they were moved entirely by mercenary motives in asking that the Fair be opened, and that the one and a half millions given by Congress was being used by them in lobbying in favor of the anti-closing movement and paying the expenses of men to go to Washington and labor for its opening. He also urged sweeping changes about the administering of the Exposition funds, and that the Fair should be opened on the so-called Lord's day. Such things were predicted. "Open the gates on Sunday and there will be poured into the Fair the infernal element of Chicago, Springfield and other large cities, and they will view the display on that day will simply see bull." He went on to disclaim several things the Tweed, pastor of Grace Lutheran church, of this city, who is the deacon of the Congress Exposition of the World's Fair in Chicago and Springfield. The human mind first, in dealing with the problems of cities could be "Christian," when according to Dr. McLane, there is the element in them "infernal" enough to manufacture the "men of evil." And this in spite of the fact that America is constitutionally a "Christian Nation" and we "a Christian people" with such malice, impression.

The resolutions were also spoken to by members of the Presbyterian, Christian and Methodist churches, after which they were adopted en masse.
