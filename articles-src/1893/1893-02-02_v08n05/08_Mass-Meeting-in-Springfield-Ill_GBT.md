The introduction of resolutions into both houses of the legislature now in session here in Springfield, asking Congress to repeal the Sunday-closing clause of the World's Fair appropriation, stirred up the so-called religious people of the city, and a mass-meeting was called Sunday, January 15, to protest against such action being taken by our legislators. The meeting was held in the First M. E. Church, and although quite generally advertised the "mass" of assembled humanity did not exceed two hundred.

The meeting was called to order by Rev. T. D. Logan, who introduced the following resolutions—

WHEREAS, Resolutions have been presented in both branches of our State legislature, petitioning Congress to repeal the Sunday-closing condition upon which the sum of $2,500,000 was granted to the Columbian Exposition.

Therefore, we, citizens of Springfield, assembled in mass-meeting, do most respectfully, yet earnestly, protest against any action being taken by the legislature, for the following reasons—

First—The question of Sunday opening has not been regarded as a matter for State legislative action, and consequently the sentiments of the people have not been generally made known to the members of the legislature. On the other hand, petitions have been sent to Congress in great numbers, including many thousands from the State of Illinois. The action of the last session was taken after mature deliberation; it represents the prevailing sentiment of the people and ought to stand.

Second—It will be a glaring inconsistency for our legislature to petition Congress to do that which would lead to the violation of existing State laws.

Third—An open Fair would lead to the running of special Sunday excursions, which would have a demoralizing influence upon the communities through which they pass, and pour into Chicago largely the vicious elements of society.

Fourth—An open Fair on Sunday will lead to a permanent increase of labor on that day, thus depriving wage-workers of their needed rest, and eventually compelling them to work seven days in order to hold their positions.

Fifth—It would be unpatriotic and un-American, and place us in a false light before the nations of the earth, which will expect us to show respect for national traditions and customs. This we have done in all European expositions by closing our exhibit on Sunday.

Sixth—It would encourage the spirit of anarchy which is even now rife in our large cities, threatening the overthrow of our national institutions.

Seventh—It would ignore the moral and religious elements of this State, inasmuch as they have freely expressed themselves in opposition to an open Fair on Sunday.

Eighth—It would be a violation of the law of God, which is supreme, and the foundation of all civil government. As such it ought to be respected and obeyed by our legislators, "as they that must give account."

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to each member of the Senate and House of Representatives.

Several speeches followed the reading of these resolutions. Rev. L. McLean, of Chicago, Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was the chief speaker. He was quite enthusiastic in his remarks. He paid his respects to the directors of the Exposition in scathing language. He did not hesitate to say that they were moved entirely by mercenary motives in asking that the Fair be opened, and that the two and a half millions given by Congress was being used by them in lobbying in favor of the anti-closing movement and paying the expenses of men to go to Washington and labor for its opening. He rang the usual changes about the demoralizing effect of Sunday excursions, etc., if the Fair should be opened on the so-called Lord's day. Said the reverend gentleman, "Open the gates on Sunday and there will be poured into the Fair the infernal element of Chicago, Springfield and other large cities, and those who visit Jackson Park on that day will simply see hell."

The doctor was followed by Rev. Troxell, pastor of Grace Lutheran church of this city, who in the course of his remarks thanked God for a Christian Chicago and Springfield! The human mind will reflect, and we wondered how these cities could be "Christian," when according to Dr. McLean, there is an element in them "infernal" enough to manufacture a "hell" out of! And how this can be a "Christian Nation" and we a "Christian people" with such a vicious, depraved people among us.

The resolutions were also spoken to by the pastors of the Presbyterian, Christian and Methodist churches, after which they were adopted by a rising vote.
