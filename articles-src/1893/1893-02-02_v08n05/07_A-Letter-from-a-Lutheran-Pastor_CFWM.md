Gar Creek, Ind., Jan. 11, 1893.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: Inclosed you will find a postal note, my subscription for the SENTINEL. I have now read your paper for three or four years and like it. I as a Lutheran do not accept all of your teachings but fully endorse your position against a union of Church and State. Our church has resented the attempt in Illinois and Wisconsin, and especially our synod was foremost in the battle. God knows we had rather never entered politics, but politics sought to enter, dominate our church schools, and so it became our sacred duty to take up the gauntlet. We will gladly retire from the political arena, but other issues are at stake and "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and thus we are forced to do battle again.

I am very glad that the SENTINEL was among the few papers (English papers) that correctly saw and stated our position. One expression, recurring several times in various numbers of your valuable paper, is too strong. It stated that "the" preachers of Toledo, St. Paul and other cities sought to enforce Sunday laws. The use of the definite article is erroneous, for there are to my certain knowledge in each of the places named preachers of our synod who did not, would not join such a movement, protested against it, refused co-operation, such as use of their churches for these meetings, etc. A more correct way of expressing it would be, "some," or "certain preachers," etc. Willingly the SENTINEL would do no injustice, I know, therefore I call attention to it.

I remain very respectfully yours,

C. F. W. MEYER.
