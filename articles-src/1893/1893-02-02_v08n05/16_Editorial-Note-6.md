At Coin, Iowa, September 20, 1892, Rev. W. F. Crafts made the statement that "by writing letters twenty ministers in Kentucky made the congressmen from that State believe that the whole State was in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair." Is not this plan being worked now on a much larger scale? And are not comparatively few people, under the leadership of the Sunday preachers, making congressmen think that the whole United States is in favor of Sunday closing?
