SUNDAY STATUTES IN SUMMARY.

It is the natural right of every man to labor. Government has no right to forbid labor on Sunday. If one chooses to labor on that day as on any other day it is his right to do so. For government to compel physical idleness on Sunday is simply tyranny. Physical recreation, rest, is not idleness. Idleness breeds criminal physical idleness. A change of physical employment is healthful physical recreation, or rest.

Government can not enforce idleness any more than it can enforce labor. So with reference it must to the old day Sunday as to command him to be idle all day on Sunday.

This point is well stated in the decision of the Supreme Court of California.

This argument—namely, that for the benefit of those employed by others, especially in manufacturing and other industries, that mankind are in the habit of working too closely and continuously,... we do not think sufficient to justify the Legislature in making the necessary repose which their exhausted natures require.... We have heard in all ages of the world that some are combating idleness and indulgence; but we have yet to learn that there has been a Legislature or any other authority that has ever been or ever will be necessary to compel men to take the country, we know that mankind seek recreation and rest... they seek their comforts, and their ease; they seek amusement, relief from pain, or food to eat... It has always been the desire of the human race to regulate their own labor, its times of resting, and its modes of recreation. Though the laboring classes would act prudently in resting on the days of rest for them, then it would be equally wise and prudent for the Legislature to pass a law compelling them to eat their dinners.

The Constitution of the United States plainly declares the manner in which the United States Government should legislate, or rather non-legislate, concerning holidays, or rest-days. In the Constitution, Sunday is recognized as a holiday, or rest-day, and as such, with a bill before Congress for the signatures of the President. It should have been by both houses of Congress for the signatures of the President. The President has ten days to consider it Sunday excepted, as they say the Constitution. Sunday is not a holy-day, it is simply designated by the secular name of the day. "The Constitution knows nothing of a 'Christian Sabbath' or of a 'Sunday' or of the 'Lord's day.'" By not using either of these names, and by not using them for the sake, the framers of the Constitution, the Government's founders, meant to recognize Sunday as a holiday, or rest-day, only, and not in any sense as a holy-day or religious institution, therefore, recognizing Sunday as a holiday, how does it regulate its observance. It does not regulate it at all. It leaves the President perfectly free to, if he chooses, worship on Sunday, or work on Sunday. It leaves each man perfectly free and how he shall observe it. It simply leaves each man perfectly free to work on Sunday if he chooses; or play or rest as he chooses; or go to church or theater or opera; or hunt or fish or travel; or stay at home. If the President is a Jew in religion, or a Seventh-day Adventist, or a Seventh-day Baptist, the Constitution does not interfere with his observance. For the same reason a Jew or a Seventh-day Adventist can keep holy the Saturday and work on Sunday.

This is an admirable example for Congress to follow—shining in the Constitution itself, placed there by the wise and far-seeing founders of our Republic.

The honored Congress legislates concerning the observance of Sunday as a holiday, or rest-day, by forbidding any kind of labor, it violates the inherent natural rights of individuals.

They consistently can observe Sunday as a holiday, or rest-day, only by not requiring the Government to compel them to lose the observance of the following day either on the plea that it is a holy-day or holiday, failing the violation of both the First and the Constitution and no injustice will be done anyone.

In giving the management of the World's Fair Commission no ordinance to open or close the Fair on any particular day. It assumes no condition as to opening or closing the Fair on any particular day. Surely, if Congress can not legislate concerning the observance of any particular day by the constitution of Declaration day to the description of the World's Fair Commission can not also leave the observance of Sunday to the management of the Fair. For Congress now to assume the power to close or restrict the expenditures of the millions given to the Fair, is to the last degree arbitrary. The question is not the sincerity of the commission so far as the use of the money is concerned, for if they do not leave with the commission the regulation of the six honest and able six days of the week and their earnings, to compensate them for the seventh day? As the Constitution left the observance of religious days to the individual, Congress be equally was, just and business-like in leaving the management of this to the World's Fair directors every interested in the gates of the Fair. This is therefore, is my argument, therefore, to the commission and to Congress that the question is for the Commission itself, and Congress should not make any law as to the matter of the Sunday opening or closing of the Fair.

The Sunday, therefore, whether it is a holy-day, or holiday, or rest-day, and not as an act with a bill before Congress for the signatures to it by any regulation is should have been by both houses of Congress for the President. It should have been by the Congress resolution that any particular days to consider it Sunday excepted, as they say the Constitution. Sunday is not a holy-day, it is simply designated by the secular name of the day.

As far as Sunday is different from any other day of the week, it is either a holy-day or a holiday. And Congress cannot, should not, be any legislation concerning the observance of its citizens of a religious subject that it is a holy-day or a holiday.

Congress has not the power to close the Fair on Sunday. If there were no religion in Sunday there would be no Congressional legislation, therefore, for the observance of Sunday as a holy-day or a religious day, is in violation of the Constitution itself. And such legislation is a violation of a religion or church in the matter of religious belief. But such legislation is not only unconstitutional, it is absolutely unjust. "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." Madison says that "religion is entirely exempt from the cognizance of civil society." Washington says, "In no sense whatever does the Government of the United States rest on the foundation of the Christian religion." Jefferson also has the same understanding of religion to the exercise of religion. Let there be no legislation concerning the unmentionable of religion to the exercise of religion.

As long ago as August 11, 1884, in an article in the *Christian Statesman*, Mr. Miller, he writes,—

"As a 'complete' pledge of personal religious liberty to every citizen in the land. I very well received your favor of the eighteenth, and shall examine the whole subject of religious liberty. It is more agreeable for everybody to work with Mr. Miller."
