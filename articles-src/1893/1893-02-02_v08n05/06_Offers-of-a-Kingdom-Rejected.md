THE devil once offered the kingdoms of this world to Christ. At another time the Jews tried to make him King, and his people were determined to make him king of Israel, but neither would he accept it. He also declared his kingdom was not of this world, and that tribute to Caesar and they should render tribute to Cæsar to Cæsar, and unto God the things that are God's. He took to make Christ rule as king of the earth; national reformers in every case, to establish him upon a throne as Christ's viceregent, and the history of that dark experiment in the blood of sixty million of God's creatures contains for us a most solemn lesson. Last of all, National Reformers, so called, and that last of those are trying to make Christ king of this Nation, and to place the laws, and usages of the Christian religion upon a specifically legal basis in the fundamental law of the land. He has refused every offer and all of them; and it will certainly result, as all the past experiments, in great evil, trying to force Christ upon the world, and to Christ's own people—in fines, in imprisonment, in chain-gang labor, in sentence.

In Dan. 7:25, referring to earthly kings, "And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws." And in Isa. 14, those of these kings shall the Lord of hosts has purposed, who shall disannul it? And his hand that is stretched out, who shall turn it back? The kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.

God has commissioned his servants to persuade and entreat men to accept the gospel and obey His precepts, but he has never directed them to force this acceptance, and in their effort to do so, either civil or ecclesiastical, tyranny and persecution have been the result. Whatever the matter believe or does not believe among their followers who should demand that the law of the land shall compel them to keep their particular methods might believe or do; he warred them to keep their swords in the sheath, and their hands from the weapons of work, and taught them to patiently endure the sufferings of their time and season to extract a fallen church and missing a Kingdom to come.
