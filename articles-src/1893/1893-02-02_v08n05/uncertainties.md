# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, February 2, 1893 (Vol. 8, No. 5)

## General Note

This issue presented significant OCR challenges due to the very small, dense text in the two-column layout. The 300 DPI B&W scans, while generally clear, contain text that is often difficult to resolve at the character level, particularly in the middle and bottom portions of each column where the text becomes very dense. Many passages throughout this issue have LOW confidence readings. A thorough review against the original PDF is strongly recommended.

## Article 01: "The Advent of Archbishop Satolli"

### Page 1, Column 1, Paragraph 2
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "it would not be at all strange if, with the soon-coming change of administration, the Pope would *not* press the project"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The sentence structure is awkward; the original may read differently

- **Confidence:** LOW — The Briggs quote may read differently
- **Reason:** Very small text, difficult to resolve individual words

### Page 2, Column 1
