THE humbling of our times is the proposed "congress of religions" to be held in Chicago in connection with the big Fair.

Having discovered Columbus, the Americans determined to make the greatest discovery to the world. ". . . That nothing is too great for such a country, people the world" are summoned to appear, make the speeches, and explain their different "reasons for the faith that is in them." As though one might not get a fair view of all religions (Anglicanism prefers to call itself a church, and then there has been some inkling to set forth something more subtle and some "militant to justify," which has been taken up with palaver, tongue-fence, and dialectic generally. If the "peaceful kingdom of heaven cometh not with observation," do the American committee who thus plan a congress of religions think of Him as making out a programme for the world for a "complete exhibit" of the way and the truth and the life and heresies, infidelities and heathenisms? To what "completion" and in what sense are the beliefs and history of the sect called Methodists, sent to this entire group, a world; and thus is to be presented "a complete exhibit of religion." This looks, to say the least, ambitious.

This proposed to have in connection with the World's Fair a series of world conventions representing all branches of human progress, including the congress of religion extending through the summer. We take the following from one of the pamphlets issued by the committee having this congress in charge: "It is proposed to hold in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, a series of conventions, which will give a comprehensive representation of all the great departments of human thought and life. The denominational congress in proportions—the gathering of an ecclesiastical assemblage so diverse—is that which found its North Africas.

Why should the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, care for representation among the denominations of the world how long they covered? Why a Church, in its Christly missionary work, to go to Judea and Samaria—where religion has gotten into those parts—take that missionary work long enough to reach the "uttermost parts" down to Asiatic Islanders? If we have the gospel,—the power unto saving souls; if we will repent of the sin of waste that is spreading among us like a festering leprosy; if we will only return to the simplicity and earnestness of our Methodism, we need not worry about being in this Chicago game of dice. "One thousand revivals of religion"—"pare and methodical"—as entered our Said Shepherd, the late Mr. Moody, or one revival of the spirit of the living God will be of 1893, will be worth more to us than the recognition of all the world."
