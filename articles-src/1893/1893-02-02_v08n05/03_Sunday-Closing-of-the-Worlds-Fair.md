NOTWITHSTANDING the permission with the advocates of Sunday closing of the World's Fair by congressional legislation has been very great, the end is not yet. It is said, before both Congress and the legislatures of the various States, additional legislation which they asked they have been passed, and we will have court over the matter is, after all, yet to come.

The interest which the public press is taking in the matter is growing, and has any previous time. Every organization is expected to array itself either on one side or the other; so that resolutions of factions and individual petitions presented to Congress are now of daily occurrence.

At the Woman's Suffrage convention, which lately convened at Washington,

Whereas, the Committee of the United States Senate, a bill has been introduced prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors from a portion of the people.

Whereas, Congress is now threatening to take similar action in the case of the religious institutions of the people, either on the Jewish Sabbath or the first day of the week; such action being clearly unconstitutional and violating the sanctity of Sunday.

*Resolved*, That we earnestly protest against the present attempt to enforce all the people to follow the religious practice of a portion of the people, and thus to destroy that absolute completeness between Church and State, which is the glory of our national Constitution.

These resolutions received both hearty applause and opposition. They will most seemed likely that they would be adopted tabled indefinitely, on the plea that it was an individual question and outside the province of the convention as representing the Women's Suffrage Association.

It will be seen that these resolutions while they are in the main the Protestant churches advocate of popular liberty, do not go far enough. They speak only of the particular legislation, and do not seem to grasp the broad principle of the movement for legislation to close the Fair on Sunday. Any legislation which goes beyond a civil purpose and does interfere with the constitutional provision protecting liberty of conscience is an attack upon the liberties of the nation, and does not allow all the people to follow the religious dictates of a portion. Any legislation by Congress upon a religious question is a violation of the Constitution of Church and State; unless all this is done, in the name of religion do not touch the liberties of the people.

No more striking confirmation of these views could be asked than the fact that Congress does do all this need be asked. Congress appropriated $2,500,000 for the Exposition even thought for an instant of closing the Fair on Sunday; but this is to be by the Sunday closing of the World's Fair.

The petition clerks of the congressional committees are swamped with petitions, thousands of petitions from all parts of the country for the Sunday closing of the Fair. The *Record*, of the dates January 20, 21, in its reports of the proceedings of Congress presents and receives a vast number of petitions on this subject. The *Record*, of January 20, shows ninety-two separate numbers, some of which include large numbers of petitions either for Sunday closing or against Sunday opening of the Fair, and contains columns of petitions either for Sunday closing or opening, and for or against additional legislation on the subject.

Fred. End is a member of parliament, resident in New York City, addressed a letter to Congress, in which he said:—

"I personally object the delivery of souvenir coins to the Fair unless the Fair shall be open Sundays. The whole attempt to close the Fair on Sunday is against the provisions of the law making the gift to the Exposition and providing that its admissions shall be closed on Sunday; and this law was passed in July, 1892. But the Exposition was formally opened in October, 1892, and at the opening ceremonies nothing was said about closing the Fair on Sunday—the Fair was simply opened. To restrict its closing on Sunday is a violation of the law of July, 1892, which says nothing about Sunday closing."

This letter was referred to the appropriate committee. If there were no religion in Sunday there would be no Congressional legislation, therefore, for the observance of Sunday as a holy-day or a religious day is in violation of the Constitution itself, placed there by the wise and far-seeing founders of our Republic.

given by Mr. Pettingrew that this would be offered as an amendment to the sundry bill, and the same idea by the Editors. Mr. Ketcham, of New York, introduced by request a joint resolution which recites that it is practicable that an appropriation of five million dollars had been made in aid of the Exposition on condition that the World's Fair corporation is now seeking to violate this condition. The resolution asserts the facts in this relation, and if all it says is true, the transaction amounts to a fraud upon Congress of the country, faith marrying out the condition and closing on Sunday. The resolution provides in the name of the United States sue the World's Fair's corporation and recover the nominal value of the coins paid to the corporation.

All these things, together with the fact that a movement has been taken in Chicago, to enjoin the World's Fair Board from compelling Sunday and compel its continued opening, and that the churchmen that compel Sunday closing,—go to show that the matter is not ended, but will extend into this future, progress and, perhaps we, it is to these, programs, perhaps we, it is the closing.
