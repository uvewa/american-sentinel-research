THE advent of Archbishop Satolli to the United States, clothed as he is with extraordinary powers, is an event not lacking in probable political significance. Neither is the fact that he has established his court at Washington, without meaning. Thus far there is no positive authority for saying that the Monsignor is to be the political as well as the spiritual representative of the Pope in this country; but inasmuch as it has long been understood that the Vatican desires to establish diplomatic relation with the Government at Washington, it would not be at all strange if, with the soon-coming change of administration, the Pope would renew the proffers of "friendly relations," and ask that either Satolli or someone else be accepted by Mr. Cleveland as the political representative of the Vatican.

If is by no means certain that Mr. Cleveland would receive a papal representative; but on the other hand it is by no means certain that he would not. Indeed it is asserted that there is at least a tacit understanding that Satolli is to receive some sort of recognition as a political representative. The Sun, of this city, in its issue of the 22d inst., has this to say upon this subject:

> While the fact that the Pope is no longer a temporal sovereign deprives the papal delegate of any recognized diplomatic rank, there appears to be a tacit purpose to accord to Mgr. Satolli in Washington an unofficial recognition as an added member of the diplomatic body. This has been already made manifest by the interchange of visits with the Secretary of State, and the marked courtesies extended to the distinguished Italian by the French Minister and other members of the diplomatic corps.

But it is not impossible that the papal delegate will be received on an equal footing with other members of the diplomatic corps. It is almost certain that the incoming President will find on his hands a fight of no small magnitude inside his own party; and he might think it "wise statesmanship" to secure at the outset the hearty support of the great body of the Catholic Church in the United States; and in no way could he do this more effectively than by receiving at Washington a papal nuncio, thus acknowledging the Pope as a temporal as well as a spiritual sovereign.

At present that portion of the Catholic Church which supports Tammany is presumably hostile to Mr. Cleveland. Archbishop Corrigan is a creature of Tammany. He owes his elevation to Tammany influence; and in turn Tammany owes much of its power to Corrigan's influence. Tammany is hostile to Mr. Cleveland, and will doubtless try to ruin, if it can not rule, his administration. In this work it can without doubt command the support of Archbishop Corrigan, unless strong church influences can be brought to bear upon him. How much "the church" will do for Mr. Cleveland and his administration may depend in very large measure upon how much Mr. Cleveland will do for "the church." The greatest service he could render "the church," probably, just now, would be to establish diplomatic relations with the Pope, thus recognizing his pretensions to temporal power.

This sort of talk may sound strange to American ears, but they will soon become accustomed to taking into account church influence in all political matters. This has long been the case in the Church and State countries of the Old World, and it will very soon be the case here. Nobody doubts that Mr. Burchard's "Rum, Romanism and Rebellion" defeated Mr. Blaine eight years ago; nor is it a matter of much doubt that Indian Commissioner Morgan's hostility to Romanism had a marked influence upon the result of the late presidential campaign. This makes it inevitable that in all future, national, political contests in this country the Roman Catholics must be reckoned with by any party that would win.

Nor is this the only reason why church influence will cut a large figure in our politics in the future. The Protestant churches, so-called, have, in the contest concerning the World's Fair, learned their power, and having learned it they will not be slow to use it. True, the Protestant churches have not that perfect organization for political purposes that the Catholics have, but they have shown wonderful skill in mobilizing their forces, and with the experience they have had in the matter of the Sunday closing of the Fair they can readily wield an immense political power in the future. We may not at once have, as is the case in some other countries, a Church party, but we shall have parties very largely dominated by churches, which amounts to about the same thing.

Nor does it necessarily follow that Protestants and Catholics will, in future political contests, be opposing forces, and thus neutralize one another's influence. On what are very generally regarded as the most vital religio-political questions of the day, Roman Catholics and Protestants are a unit. On the general principle of religious legislation there is no difference of opinion between apostate Protestantism and Romanism; both believe in it. In the past both have endeavored to so shape legislation as to benefit only themselves. In the future they will compromise and so shape legislation as to bolster up the dogmas which they hold in common. Freedom of conscience in the United States has nothing to hope for from the differences between Romanism and Protestantism.

As long ago as August 31, 1884, in an article in the Christian Statesman, Rev. Sylvester Scovel, writing of the common interests of Protestants and Catholics, said:

> This common interest ought both to strengthen our determinations to work and our readiness to co-operate with our Roman Catholic fellow-citizens. We may be subjected to some rebuffs in our first proffers, for the time is not yet come when the Roman Church will consent to strike hands with other churches—as such; but the time has come to make repeated advances and gladly to accept co-operation in any form in which they may be willing to exhibit it.

DECEMBER 11, 1884, the Christian Statesman said editorially:

> Whenever they [Roman Catholics] are willing to co-operate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join with them.

In the Christian at Work, of April 19, 1888, Prof. Charles A. Briggs, D.D., of Union Theological Seminary, said:—

> In all matters of worship we are in essential concord with Roman Catholics, and we ought not to hesitate to make an alliance with them so far as possible to maintain the sanctity of the Sabbath [Sunday] as a day of worship.

The response to these utterances was made by the Congress of Catholic Laymen, held in Baltimore, Md., November 12, 1889, as follows:—

> There are many Christian issues in which Catholics could come together with non-Catholics and shape legislation for the public weal. In spite of rebuff and injustice, and overlooking zealotry, we should seek an alliance with non-Catholics for proper Sunday observance.

This was adopted, declares Rev. W. F. Crafts, in his "Addresses on the Civil Sabbath" (page 7), "after correspondence and conference with the American Sabbath Union."

Do we not well say that freedom of conscience has nothing to hope for in this country from the differences between Roman Catholics and so-called Protestants? And may there not be a deeper significance in the attitude of this Government toward Rome than appears on the surface?
