The Adventist cases soon to be tried in Paris, Henry County, Tenn., will be reported for the Sentinel by one of the editors who is on the ground for that purpose. These reports will be valuable, and every friend of religious liberty ought to have the papers containing the facts relative to the Tennessee persecution, not only for his own reading but to put into the hands of others. We can not now tell in just what numbers the reports will appear, nor in how many, but the papers will be furnished at the rate of one cent per copy.
