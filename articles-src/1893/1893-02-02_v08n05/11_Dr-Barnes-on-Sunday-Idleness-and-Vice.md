Dr. Barnes on Sunday Idleness and Vice.

THE purpose of this article is to present the testimony of the eminent Christian and scholar, Dr. Albert Barnes, on this subject. But, that the reader may better appreciate its application at the present time, I desire, before introducing the testimony, to call attention briefly to two facts.

First, it will be conceded by all, that the purpose of Sunday legislation is to compel those to rest on Sunday who do not want to rest on that day. No person needs to be compelled to him do to what he voluntarily does, or what he voluntarily desires to do. Second, it is diligently affirmed by those who are working for Sunday laws, that there is no intention of forcing any one to be religious. All that is claimed is to compel those to stop work and remain idle, whose religious convictions do not bind them to sacredly regard the day, and so, give the laboring classes a much-needed physical rest, and give all time for religious worship, if they feel inclined to do so.

But an important question arises in this connection, namely, are these people to be benefited by the provisions of that would be beneficiary? If a person has not enough regard for religion, to observe a day without compulsion, will he be likely to go to church and avail the society of the Lord if a whole day of enforced idleness is forced upon him against his will? Every one knows that he will not.

The effect of Sunday statutes, then, is to enforce idleness upon the irreligious; and many affirm that a great blessing will come upon those who come under the influence of these laws. To be sure, we have been taught that "Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do," that "the criminal classes are largely recruited from the idlers of the community," that "ease is the mother of vice," etc., but the people who are thus, in the same relation that all natural laws are reversed on Sunday? Sunday being, the idleness would certainly be a blessing to mankind. This is the point which is so ably answered by Dr. Barnes; and I trust every word will be carefully read and considered. The quotation is from "Barnes' Practical Sermons."

To see we have a Sabbath, sacred is no offence to an ecclesiastical institution to, or to a public sentiment, rather than by known laws; there is a vast area in which we ought to labor for reform; a day when men shall delight in spiritual pleasures, and seek higher and nobler joys, and enter upon a more elevated community. God is made in this land, and our country is a free Christian land.

If we compel a man to "rest" from his daily occupation, and he does not choose to worship, to regard or holy time, it will be regarded as an opportunity of recreation or pleasure in his own way. Since this is to be so, the question is, what is to be the effect of a compulsory cessation from the ordinary employments of life as a matter of divine observance? What will be the effect of so many periods of leisure upon the morals of the community? What will be the result if they are brought under the operation of our civil laws? What bearing will rest or relaxation have on habits of virtue, happiness, and patriotism? Can we estimate the amount of damage done to any country and to the community, and to all the estimates that bind us during the six days? We can show it, by a single consideration of three parts of this question.

Since this is to be so, the question, in a moral point of view, is a simple one. What is the effect of so much universal exposure to vice? Can we safely guard the community from the effects of having them compelled to cease from their regular employment, and then forced and thrown them one day in seven upon their own resources? Can we close our workshops, and count-houses, and stores, and our stores, and send them forth under the idea that though they may not be idle, we safely open, as we do, fountains of poison at every corner, and roll out streams of fire. Is a man made better merely by being idle and by being compelled to forego his opportunity? Can there for a season of idleness on the earth when a great community like this shall be presented a spectacle of temptation which shall be piled up with all that art and skill can do, to decoy the unsuspecting and unwary, and to drag them down to hell?

"A Sabbath merely of rest—of cessation of toil—will not be suited to man. It would not be sufficient to remove all desire from every man for the accustomed pleasures of life. It would not satisfy a dweller in our large cities and their vicinities, if every factory, and storehouse, and workshop, and counting-house, and office, were closed, to do them to resemble the habits of virtue, and administer to the perpetuity of pure morals.

"A Sabbath of mere rest would do nothing to lay the foundation for future repentance or improvement for those who have gone astray. It would not stop the work of the penitentiary and the gallows on this day then to do. The idlers of the community would be seen at their posts on that day, as on all other days. They become as powerful in evil as they were in good, and find that to be plunged into the dense population of a city, with all the consciousness of tremendous power for good or evil. If it is a forced Sabbath, it is a forced idleness, and if it is forced idleness, it is open up, in a new manner, the very sources of all our iniquity, our morals, our religion. If we for evil, it is well to consider that this is a consideration so momentous as to demand the most careful thought, convinced the evil of a Sabbath given to mere rest and recreation.

Every person of candor and intelligence must admit that what Dr. Barnes has said on this subject is the simple, unanswerable truth. And it is evident that the observance of a weekly rest-day in this country has not enough regard for religion to observe a day without compulsion, he will be likely to come to an alarming degree. This is because so many have observed the day only because the law compelled them to. Everything goes to show that those who observe the day because the law required it would be far better off, and the country would be far better off without the legal recognition of it at all. And this illustrates what can often been attested, that religious institutions in the hands of irreligious people become only the instrument of iniquity and vice.

Shall we then forbid these people to work, and compel them to be idle? No. For if there is to be found a man who, in all the world, is fitted to enter upon his labor than, to follow his wicked associates in crime, and the same time the guardian of morality, good government, and public decency, by that man alone.
