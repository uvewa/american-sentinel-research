A GOOD deal of reliance has by the religious press been based upon the ecclesiastical arguments and the most extended legal defense ever given on the constitutionality of the Sunday-closing provision is in the argument rather than refutes it, if not demolishes it.

It has been said that the Supreme Court decision of last February is a sufficient answer. But is it? Of course that decision has given great color to the claim that the Supreme Court would sustain Sunday legislation; but it by no means proves that the Court in considering the Sunday question would hold to the same line of reasoning of being in harmony with the purpose of being a political basis.

To understand the real purpose and intent of the Constitution, we must, as Chief Justice Waite remarked in 1878, not go to recent declarations, but to the history of the time in which the Constitution was adopted, and give to the language of the Constitution the meaning which the authors of the instrument intended. We shall find that the First Amendment was designed not merely to prevent Congress from setting up of a State Church, but to forever prohibit all Federal legislation upon religious questions.

"Religion" is not defined in the Constitution, but the Virginia Declaration of Rights, adopted in 1776, furnishes us a definition as follows: "Religion, or the duty owe to our Creator, can be directed only by reason and conviction." It was instrumental in securing the adoption of the clause in the Constitution against government by "religion," and in the light of that definition, that amendment would mean just what it was intended to mean, if read, "Congress shall make no law regarding the duty which we owe to our Creator or Changes of the First Amendment."

That this is the meaning of the First Amendment is evident also from the fact that a number of attempts while the Bill of Rights was used in the form of amendments, were defeated by a number of States which proposed an amendment on this subject, namely, Virginia, North Carolina, and Rhode Island; while New Hampshire had simply nominative no legislature, namely, "Congress shall make no law touching religion, or to infringe the rights of conscience." It was plainly the purpose of the several States represented here to take religion entirely away from the jurisdiction of Congress upon religious questions, and no Court can make it otherwise. This is not so much a question of law as of fact.

That the First Amendment to the Constitution was designed not only to keep Church and State separate in the sense of making one independent of the other, but in the truest sense of separating religion from the State—making the Government absolutely secular, is evident not only from the facts cited, but also from what follows. Those who framed it seem to have been the universal opinion until in recent years State and church religionists have attempted to overthrow the grand charter which they gave to their countrymen. In 1797 Washington and his cabinet and the whole Senate of the United States, in a Treaty with Tripoli, "The Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion." It is, perhaps, not saying too much, to assert that President Washington and his advisers were in a position, at least as good to point of knowing what the meaning of the Constitution better than, the Supreme Court of 1892. The former made the instrument for they helped to make it and understood and for the adoption of the First Amendment.

*In his autobiography Jefferson also*

The bill for establishing religious freedom, the preamble of which commences with "Whereas," recited before, I had drawn in all the latitude of reason and right. It still met with opposition; but with some mutations in the preamble, it was finally passed; and a singular proposition proved that its protection of opinion was meant to be universal. Where the preamble declares that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, an amendment was proposed by inserting the word "Jesus Christ," so that it should read, "a departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy Author of our religion;" the insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its protection the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and the Mohammedan; the Hindoo and Infidel of every denomination.

There is no need of any further quotation to show that any legislation for the Christian, the religious, or the holy observance of Sunday is entirely beyond the legal power of Congress.

Every sentiment and every argument in favor of keeping sacred a particular day as the Sabbath should therefore have no weight whatever with our legislators.

The only possible ground left, therefore, upon which to base legislation as to the observance of Sunday is the fact that it is a holiday or rest-day.

It is a relief for physical recreation; it is not a religious holy-day, but a holiday, free from ordinary vocations of business.

Our legislation has to do about Sunday as a holiday, or a rest-day; it is not a religious holy-day.

Sunday is recognized as a civil institution. It is a rest-day for physical recreation. It is but a holiday beyond that the function of the legislature ceases.

To start right in this discussion I will first quote from *Jefferson.*

Our legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their power; that their true office is to declare and enforce our natural rights and duties; and to take none of them from us. No man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another; and this is all from which the laws ought to restrain him; every man is free to do as he pleases with himself and his property.

It is the American principle that the government is for the people and not the people for the government. If at any point government infringes upon any natural right at that point its action is null and void.

It is a contradiction in form as well as in substance to say that, "all men being of any human being, the natural rights of any other human being should be invaded. The exercise of all human rights is perfectly harmonious.

Whatever legislation there is, therefore, for Sunday as a holiday, or rest-day, there must be no infringement upon the natural rights of any human being.
