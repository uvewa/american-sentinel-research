THE advent of Archbishop Satolli to the United States, clothed as he is with extraordinary powers, is an event not lacking in possible political significance. Neither is the fact that he has established his court at Washington, without meaning.

Thus far there is no positive authority for saying that the Monsignor is to be the political as well as the spiritual representative of the Pope in this country; but inasmuch as it has long been understood that the Vatican desires to establish diplomatic relations with the Government at Washington, it would not be at all strange if, with the soon-coming change of administration, the Pope would *not* press the project of "friendly relations," and that he should fail to secure one no one should be accepted by Mr. Cleveland as the political representative of the Vatican.

It is by no means certain that Mr. Cleveland would receive a papal representative; but on the other hand it is by no means certain that he would not. It is distinctly understood that there is at least a tacit understanding that Satolli is to perform some sort of recognition as a political representative. The *Tribune,* of this city, in its issue of the 23d inst., has this to say upon this subject:—

While the fact that the Pope is no longer a temporal sovereign deprives the papal delegates of any recognized diplomatic rank, there appears to be an unofficial recognition as an add-on and of considerable significance, similar to that made manifest by the interchange of visits with the Secretary of State and the marked courtesies extended to the distinguished Italian by the French Minister and other members of the diplomatic corps.

But it is not impossible that the papal delegate will be received on an equal footing with other members of the diplomatic corps. It is almost certain that the incoming President will find on his hands a fight of no small magnitude he holds concerning the Vatican's political interests in this country.

The powerful political party which has won, is his own party; and he might think it "wise statesmanship" to secure at the outset the hearty support of the great body of the Catholic Church in the United States; and in no way could he do this more effectually than by receiving at Washington a papal nuncio, thus acknowledging the Pope as a temporal as well as a spiritual sovereign.

At present that portion of the Catholic Church which supports Tammany is pre-eminently hostile to Mr. Cleveland. Archbishop Satolli's presence is a constant reminder to Mr. Cleveland that there is a higher power than the Cleveland presidency. He owes his elevation to Tammany influence, and to turn Tammany owes much of its power to Corrigan's influence. Tammany is hostile to Mr. Cleveland, and will endeavor to try, if it can not ruin, his administration. But in all this it can without doubt command the support of Archbishop Corrigan, unless strong church influence can be brought to bear upon him. How much "the church" will do for Mr. Cleveland and his administration may depend in very large measure upon how much Mr. Cleveland will do for "the church." The greatest service he could render "the church," probably, just now, would be to establish diplomatic relations with the Pope, thus recognizing his pretension to temporal power.

This sort of talk may sound strange to American ears, but they will soon become accustomed to taking into account church influence in all political matters. This has long been the case in the Church and since the accession of the 600,000 it will be very well seen in the case here. Nobody doubts that Mr. Burchard's "Rome, Romanism and Rebellion" defeated Mr. Blaine eight years ago; nor is it a matter of much doubt that failure Commissioner Morgan's hostility to Romanism had a marked influence upon the result of the last presidential campaign. This makes it inevitable that in all future, national, political contests in this country the Roman Catholic must be reckoned with by any party that would win.

Nor is this the only reason why church influence will cut a large figure in our politics in the future. The Protestant churches, so-called, have, in the coming contest, the very same hold on parties and political power, and having learned it they will not be slow to use it. True, the Protestant churches have not that perfect organization for political purposes that the Catholics have, but they have shown wonderful skill in mobilizing their forces; and with the experience they have had in the matter of the Sunday closing of the Fair they can readily wield an immense political power in the future. We may at once have, as in the case in some other countries, a Church party, but we shall have parties very largely dominated by churches, which amounts to about the same thing.

Now does it necessarily follow that Protestants and Catholics will, in future, political contests, be opposing forces, and thus neutralize one another's demands? By no means. When the two get to acting in the most vital religious and political questions of the day, Roman Catholics and Protestants will unite. In the whole discussion of religious legislation there is no difference of opinion between apostolic Protestantism and Romanism; both believe in it. In the past both have endeavored so to shape legislation as to result in bodily penalties, even unto death, upon those who differ from them in religious belief. The time is not far distant when this will again be done.

In 1889, Prof. Charles A. Briggs, D.D., of Union Theological Seminary, said:—

Those of us who are working as we are in connection with Roman Catholics, and we ought not to hesitate to make an alliance with those of like faith with us. No one of us alone is strong enough.

The response to this utterance was made by the Congress of Catholic Laity November 14, 1889, as follows:—

There are various issues in which all Catholics could come together with one Catholics for the conservation of the public, to oppose atheism and combat materialism, and we should not seek an alliance with one Catholic for other purposes.

This was adopted, declares Rev. W. F. Crafts, in his "Address on the Civil Sabbath" (page 7), "after correspondence and conferences with the American Sabbath Union."

We are not well say that freedom of conscience has nothing to hope for in this country from the future more than it has had in the past—and its past has been but indifferent? And why not a deeper animus at heart toward Rome than appears on the surface?
