The Churchman should now be "read out of church" by the American Sabbath Union, so-called, for it has endorsed Bishop Potter's declaration in favor of the Sunday opening of the World's Fair. The Churchman says:

> The contribution of the bishop of New York to the discussion in the Forum (October) on "The Opening of the Chicago Fair on Sundays" seemed to us so reasonable, becoming, and, withal, intelligible that we gave in our adhesion to its positions without any wavering or doubtfulness.

Of like questions in England, the Churchman says:

> Exactly similar questions, as to Sunday opening of museums, pleasure grounds, art galleries, and the like have been threshed out in England, decided affirmatively, tried experimentally, and accepted so finally that nothing but a moral revolution can reverse the decision. Bishops and clergy and laymen and nonconformists, in overwhelming majority, support and applaud the result.

In this connection the following news item from the New York World, of the 11th inst., is interesting:

> The managers of the Dore Gallery have now given four Sunday exhibitions, which have been great successes, but notwithstanding this they announce January 15 as the last Sunday the gallery will be open. . . . They only opened for a few Sundays at the earnest solicitation of several well-known clergymen whose schools wished to attend.

If it is all right to open a few Sundays to accommodate certain clergymen, would it be wrong to open every Sunday to accommodate the public? or must one belong to a church in order to be entitled to devote Sunday to sight-seeing?
