Concerning the effort now making to repeal the religious legislation pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition, the Christian Advocate, of this city, says:

> We believe the American Sabbath to be in great peril, and the crisis at hand. Hence we write at length, in the hope that every lover of God and his country whom we may reach, will be roused to do his utmost to save the day from being dishonored in the face of the world by our Government.

This reveals clearly the real purpose of Sunday closing; it is to exalt the day. "Every lover of God" is exhorted to rally to the support of a day of which God says nothing, except to tell us in his word that he worked upon it and to, inferentially at least, command us to work upon it also. "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work" includes the first day. Is it not blasphemy to thus thrust in the face of the Almighty a day which he has never claimed, and to devote to secular uses the day which he sanctified and blessed and commanded to be kept holy?
