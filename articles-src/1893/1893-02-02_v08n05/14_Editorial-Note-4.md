Both houses of the Illinois legislature recently passed a resolution asking Congress to repeal the Sunday-closing proviso in the World's Fair bill, whereupon the ministers of Springfield called a mass-meeting of the people of that city to protest against the action of the legislature. The meeting was extensively advertised, but only about two hundred persons were present, nevertheless, the resolutions set forth that "we, the citizens of Springfield, assembled in mass-meeting do most respectfully yet earnestly protest," etc.
