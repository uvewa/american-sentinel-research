NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 2, 1893.

------

ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it, may know that it is sent to them by some friend. Those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need not fear that they will be asked to pay for it, as no paper whatever will proceed from this house that is not paid for in advance by somebody else or by themselves they take it from the post-office.

------

READ the article on page 34, "Facts vs. Fictions." It is hard to find two such facts. "Facts are stubborn things;" true the ones given in this article are not rare, but a good many people have forgotten them or overlooked them entirely.

------

THE *Adventist* seems soon to be tried in Paris, Henry County, Tenn., will be reported for the SENTINEL by one of its editors who is on the ground for the purpose. These reports will be valuable, and the events of the trial will supply facts relative to the Tennessee persecution, not only for us own reading, but to put into the hands of others. We can not foretell just what members the report will appear, or in how many, but the papers will be furnished at the rate of two cents per copy.

------

BOTH houses of the Illinois legislature recently passed a resolution asking Congress to repeal the Sunday-closing provision in the World's Fair bill, whereupon the citizens of Springfield called a mass meeting of the people of that city to protest against the action of the legislators. The meeting was extensively advertised, but only two or a hundred persons were present. Nevertheless, the resolutions set forth that "the citizens of Springfield assembled" as "in the mass-meeting do most respectfully yet earnestly protest."

In its issue of the 10th inst., the *Christian Advocate* has the following, under the head of the subject of divine and human legislation, is a very live one. It is one that the American public, as communities and as individuals and a preserve the of Sunday question the equal of our Sunday law, we the holding worldly work on the Christian Sabbath, because they are not only religious in nature and opposed to the genius of our American nation and to the word of God. They are also bad economics. The Seventh day Baptists and the Jews do not do in these arguments, but what they will do is continue them, others in that communion are alive to the issues and are one with this our Adventist in protesting against all Sunday legislation, as wrong in principle and mischievous in practice.

------

The Sabbath *Outlook*, a Seventh-day Baptist monthly, published at Alfred Centre, this State, is very outspoken in its opposition to Sunday legislation. We have often quoted from it in the SENTINEL. But this is not a question of man's best or of right. Sunday laws would be no better than they now are if there was not a single Sabbatarian to raise his voice against them. It is all the same so far as the protest is concerned. It would still be true that they are wrong in principle.

AUG. OHIO, Iowa, September 30, 1892. RAY W. F. Cradle made the statement that "by writing letters twenty ministers in Kentucky made the compromise from that State believe that the whole State was in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair." Is not this plan being worked on now on a much larger scale? And is not comparatively few people, under the leadership of the Sunday preachers, making Congress think things that they are. Does the United States is in favor of Sunday closing?

------

The *Mail and Express* says "the World's Fair Directors are committed to Sunday closing. By every consideration of honor and good faith they are bound to adhere to it." But they are bound also by the of the Congressional contribution of the management of the Columbian Exhibit to provide for the expenses of the celebration. The condition was that the Fair should be closed on Sunday. They accepted the congressional grant under these conditions, and by consequence they are bound by both moral and legal obligations to either surrender the grant or to acknowledge and enforce the condition.

Why has Congress not taken Sunday closing? It has been adopted so Congress had power to close the Fair has it not also power to open it? If it had power to impose the Sunday-closing condition has it not at least an equal right to remove the direction from that condition? Or is it only the Sunday advocates who have a right to ask of Congress?

------

THE Churchman should now be "read out of church" by the American Sabbath Union. The since it has indorsed Bishop Potter's declaration in favor of the Sunday opening of the Exposition, the *Church-man* says:

The contribution of the bishop of New York to the Adventists did not only say that Sunday laws are religious legislation, but they prove it by far the most indubitable evidence.

The statement of the *Church-man* is its contribution to the discussion in the *Forum* October of the Opening of the Chicago Fair on Sunday," assent to us is so reasonable, becoming, and withal, intelligent and perspicuous as an argument which might without any wavering or disturbance.

------

Of like questions in England, the *Church-man* says:

Exactly similar questions, as to Sunday opening of amusements, pleasure grounds, art galleries and the like have been thrashed out in England, and their settlement, which trial experimentally, and accepted to finally that nothing but a moral sense has come that can reverse the decision. Bishops and bishops and laymen and nonconformists, in men and woman, have approved the settlement.

------

In this connection the following news item from the *New York World*, of the 11th inst., is pertinent:

The managers of the Ion Gallery have now given free Sunday admission, which have since great interest, not withstanding this they are annoyed. "I happened it is the the last Sunday that the Fair exhibition was opened and the great masses came. They only opened for a short time due to the wants of masses of Artisans and working classes who desired to visit their collection."

It is all right to Sunday opening for the public to accommodate certain clergymen, would it be wrong to open an exposition to accommodate the public or must the Exposition be kept closed simply to accommodate clergymen who desire it to be closed or to devote Sunday to sight-seeing?

------

NOTWITHSTANDING the effort now making by certain organizations to influence Congress in the management of the World's Columbian Exposition, of the management of the World's Columbian Exposition, its object being to require the Fair to be kept closed on Sunday, petitions, and the crisis at hand. Hence we are desirous that those of our subscribers, and others who are acquainted with our work, should call the attention of people of their community—persons not so well acquainted with our work, that we may reach, will be moved to add their influence to save our country from being dishonored in the face of the world by such un-American legislation.

------

This reveals clearly that real purpose of Sunday closing of the Fair. "Every lover of God" is exhorted to rally to the support of a day of which God says nothing, except to recall to all that he has worked upon it and to, inferentially at least, condemn those who do observe it. "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work" includes the first day. It is not blasphemy to thus thrust in the face of the Almighty a day which He has never claimed, and to devote to obscure the day which he sanctified and blessed and commanded us to be kept holy?

"Therein a matter is settled," says the *Independent*. "In the Indorse the Illinois Resolutions, has also to the effect that Sunday legislation is not for closing that Congress shall petition in their preservation of the Sunday institution. The latest step taken is the appointment of a committee to prepare the money to be spent up into a list of books which shall be read by the youth of the province. It has been decided that all books in the leading libraries on not on these lists are to be removed at once. As the literature and writings of the methods of the Catholic church, they certainly will not do all books will be considered dangerous to the interests of the body. It follows that the essence of an empire is Christian if it followed the government must guard its subjects against every hint of heresy.
