*Gat Creek, Ind., Jan. 17, 1893.*

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: Inclosed find fifty cents for your renewed subscription for the SENTINEL. I have now read your paper for three or four years and like it. "I am a Lutheran, I do not accept all your religious views, but I do accept your position against a union of Church and State. Our Church body, in the Synod of Wisconsin, and the General Council practically of every state, has expressed itself this way. We have not entered politics, but politics ought to be entered by the Christian man, and it is so it became our united duty to take a hand in politics. We will gladly gather from the political arena, but other fears are great. We stand for "eternal" religious freedom for himself or liberty of liberty," and thus we are forced to do battle.

I am very glad that the SENTINEL was started for the purpose for which it stands, viz., the exposition of the American principles of liberty, receiving several times encouragement, receiving several times this expression, receiving several times in various numbers of your valuable work, in this respect. I repeat that "the priestiance of Toledo, St. Paul and other churches ought to enforce Sunday laws. The use of the deifiable article is erroneous, of for there have no my certain knowledge, each of the places named preachers of every type did not, would not join such a movement, protested against it. On the contrary, such as use of their churches for these purposes. An easy, a more correct way of expressing it would be, some clergymen of the priestiance, etc. Willingly the SENTINEL would be so intelligent in this matter.

I remain very respectfully yours,

C. F. W. MAYES.
