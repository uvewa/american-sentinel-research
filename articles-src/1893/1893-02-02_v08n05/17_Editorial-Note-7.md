The Mail and Express says that "the World's Fair Directors are committed to Sunday closing. By every consideration of honor and good faith they are bound to respect and observe the specific condition of the congressional contribution of 5,000,000 of Columbian half dollars to provide for the expenses of the celebration. The condition was that the Fair should be closed on Sunday. They accepted the congressional grant under these conditions, and by consequence they are bound by both moral and legal obligations to either surrender the grant or to acknowledge and enforce the condition."

Why committed to Sunday closing? If Congress had power to close the Fair has it not also power to open it? If it had power to impose the Sunday-closing condition has it not at least an equal right to release the directors from that condition? Or is it only the Sunday advocates who have a right to ask anything of Congress?
