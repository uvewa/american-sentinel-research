"There is method," says the Independent, "in the madness of the Russian Baltic provinces in their persecution of Protestantism. The latest step taken is the appointment of a commission who have made up lists of books which can be read by the youth of the provinces. It has been decided that all books in the school libraries not on these lists are to be removed at once. As the commission consists of members of the orthodox church, they naturally condemn all books that can be considered dangerous to the interests of that church." And why not? if the empire is Christian it follows that the government must guard its subjects against any taint of heresy.
