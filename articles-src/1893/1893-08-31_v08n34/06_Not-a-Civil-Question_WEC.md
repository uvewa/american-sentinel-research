THE questions of morals and conscience should be referred to moral and religious agencies. Questions of conscience suffer enormously when there is an attempt to legislate upon them. It is not within the prerogative of either prince or potentate in the realm of the law, and it is just as much out of place for the civil law to attempt to decide the question as it is for any matter of conscience, as for instance the Sabbath question.

The present governor of Iowa, whose name is just the last government, whom almost made a burden, by the assumed authority of several churches, particularly the Methodists, to dictate his policy in reference to certain public questions, addressed these would be guardians of the people's morals in the following, which has the ring of true Americanism:—

> The fundamental precept on which the whole system of civil government rests is that the rights of each citizen the greatest possible degree are of that character, the natural and inalienable right.

> It is the uncontroverted right of every man to persuade men to accept his beliefs and practices of conscience that he holds to right, but when conscience is to be enforced, . . . no, these tyranny enters and with it would establish the Inquisition and the stake for the burning of all who would not know the fire of religious enthusiasm.
