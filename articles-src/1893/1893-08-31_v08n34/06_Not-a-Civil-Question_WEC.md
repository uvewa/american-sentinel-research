The question of morals and conscience should be relegated to moral and religious agencies. Questions of conscience suffer enormously when there is an attempt to legislate upon them. It is not within the province of religion per se, to enter the realm of civil law, and it is just as much out of place for the civil law to come in and compel the enforcement of any matter of conscience, as for instance the observance of the Sabbath.

The present governor of Iowa, whose life at the last gubernatorial contest was almost made a burden, by the assumed authority of several churches, particularly the Methodists, to dictate his policy in reference to certain public questions, answered these would-be guardians of the people's morals in the following, which has the ring of true Americanism:—

> The fundamental principle on which the whole fabric of our political institutions is based, guarantees to each citizen the greatest possible degree of individual liberty consistent with a just preservation of the natural rights of every other individual.
>
> It is the uncontroverted right of every man to persuade men to accept the beliefs and practices of conscience that he holds to be right, but when compulsion is resorted to, then tyranny enters and we have established the Inquisition and rekindle anew the fires of persecution.
