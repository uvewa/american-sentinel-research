REV. J. J. RANSOM, a correspondent of the Nashville Christian Advocate in a communication to that paper of July 20, quotes a young minister as saying in justification of the boycott on the Fair: "We want to show them that we can't be run over." Mr. Ransom's only comment is: "there spoke the natural man." But that means a good deal when we remember that the "natural man" is but another term for the "carnal mind," which is declared to be "emnity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
