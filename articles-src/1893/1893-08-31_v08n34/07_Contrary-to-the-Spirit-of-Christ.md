ACCORDING to the teaching of our Lord no minister of his gospel has any discipline to call down his vengeance upon those who do not obey his message, or upon those who are not doing what those who claim to be Christians say is right. He does not approve of it; neither does he answer their prayers. He bade us be "fishers of men." He came not to condemn to save men's lives and not to do, but to save them.

And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of his Samaritans, to make ready for him. And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. Luke 9:51-56.

Did the disciples right in asking that fire might come down upon these people who refused to receive the Saviour as they ought to? They certainly did not. They did not have the right spirit. He rebuked them and told them they did not. Christ *cannot* discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. God alone can do this. Therefore man cannot judge his fellows as righteous. God the righteous Supreme Judge of the conscience. What a world it would be if this is a man had the power to punish others if they did not do as he wanted? Babel! Let the force of the universe take hold.

If the spirit of persecution is not the spirit of Christ. "Come unto me," the Lord said, "Ye know not what manner of spirits ye are of, and in the same text he shows that it is not the Spirit by the Spirit not to come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." Those spirit of Christ will never use force. "Put up thy sword," the Lord said to those who were professing to be defenders of truth by slaying with the devil; and the works of your father ye will do." So the spirit of persecution, being contrary to the Spirit of Christ, must be of Satan, and when men pray for destruction to come upon their opponents the Lord does not hear them; but there is one who hears them, and that one is Satan. He is he who will destroy man's prayer for destruction. May we honestly answer their prayers if the Lord would not?

Now, what must the Lord think of those preferring his name-today the Government to him to send destruction upon those who visit the Fair on Sunday? Even if Sunday were the Sabbath, would he answer such petition? Surely the that which was is breaking the Sabbath of the Lord—if ever they say, still does the God of creation say the world? Would he destroy it if his name therein to call upon him in this way? He surely does not. Of all people in his early disciples. It is a beacon of light. They would have the Christian Sabbath to be trodden upon, that the Christian Sabbath. They do not know that they are going wrong and turn and serve God.

National Reformed profess to serve the one true God. They ask to close the Fair, and yet they petition him for send destruction upon their fellowmen for not keeping Sunday. . . . However; it is upon a Sunday. However it is upon a Sunday, however keep and not Friday or Saturday. They profess to teach the consciences of men. If they had their own they would not ask that destruction, as they believe would be put to death, for keep the day the Lord has blessed as they are to be. If to Chicago to present the gates of the Fair to open on that day? . . . What is your faith? Would they go there if God opens that mean? It simply means that they have no faith in the day they profess they prefer, to having National Reform, and they, and National reformers and all others who care for nothing about God's rest, thank the Lord, they have not the power to bring down fire from heaven to destroy others.

The record of Satan is certainly at the back of the National Reform movement, and there is, in all America, no doubt; that heart can see. Where are the churches that the matter has been urged? . . . where are the churches in what is called the apostolic movement? Is it of love that the Christian bodies are now destroying? what do they fear? The fire a law will be over them? the Lord a slave? Of course not far,—a day to be given as a day of religion and of sin, and that we may receive not of theirs.
