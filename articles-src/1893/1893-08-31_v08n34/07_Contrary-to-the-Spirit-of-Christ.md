According to the teaching of our Saviour, it is not right for his professing disciples to call down his vengeance upon those who are not doing his will, or rather upon those who are not doing what those professing Christians think is his will. He does not approve of it, neither does he answer their prayers. He tells us he came to save men's lives and not to destroy them. We read in Luke 9:51-56, these words:—

> And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, and sent messengers before his face; and they went, and cotered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.

Did the disciples do right in asking that fire might come down upon these people who would not do just what they thought they ought to? They certainly did not. That spirit is contrary to the Spirit of Christ. Man cannot discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. God alone can do this. Therefore man cannot judge his fellow-man righteously. God is the Supreme Judge of the conscience. What kind of a world would this be if men had the power to punish others if they did not believe as they believed? Let the foregoing quotation answer.

If the spirit of persecution is not the Spirit of Christ then whose spirit is it? Jesus said, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of," and in the next verse he shows that it is not his Spirit by the following words: "For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." Then whose spirit is the persecuting spirit? In another scripture the Lord said to those who were professing to serve God: "Ye are of your father the devil, and the works of your father ye will do." So the spirit of persecution, being contrary to the Spirit of Christ, must be of Satan, and when men pray for destruction to come upon their opponents the Lord does not hear them; but there is one who hears them, and that one is Satan. He it is who will destroy men's lives, and he would be only too glad to answer their prayers if the Lord would allow him.

Now, what must the Lord think of those professing his name to-day who are calling to him to send destruction upon those who visit the Fair on Sunday? Even if Sunday were the Sabbath, would he answer their petitions? Nearly the whole world is breaking the Sabbath of the Lord—the seventh day, but does the Lord destroy the world? Would he destroy it if his disciples were to call upon him to do so? His answer would be the same as he gave to his early disciples. It is because of his love and mercy that he allows his Sabbath to be trodden upon, that the honest in heart may eventually see that they are going wrong and turn and serve him.

National Reformers profess to serve God. They profess to be Christ's disciples, and yet they petition him to send the accursed cholera upon the land rather than have the World's Fair a success. Why? Because it is open on Sunday. They have set themselves up as judges of the consciences of men. If they had their way every person who refused to believe as they believe would be put to death, for they call upon the President to send troops to Chicago to prevent the gates of the Fair from being open on Sunday. What does that mean? It simply means that the troops are to shoot the people down if they persist in having that Fair open on Sunday, and National Reformers would do it themselves if power was given them. But, thank the Lord, they have not the power yet. They must wait God's appointed time.

The spirit of Satan is certainly at the back of the National Reform movement, as every man and women with an honest heart can see. Where are the churches to-day that they would join in such a satanic movement? Is it not true that Babylon has fallen, and seeing that it is true, what is the duty of God's people? Let the Lord answer: "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Rev. 18:4.
