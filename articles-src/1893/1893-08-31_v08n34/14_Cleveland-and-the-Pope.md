IT now transpires that, as reported some time ago, President Cleveland did write a letter of congratulation to the Pope, upon the occasion of the golden jubilee of his episcopate. When President before, Mr. Cleveland sent the great "infallible" a copy of the Constitution of the United States. Both acts are entirely out of place in the chief magistrate of this country. As an individual, Mr. Cleveland could have a perfect right to write such a letter to the Pope, who some thing a foreigner to think these Home, but as President he has no right to do anything of the kind.
