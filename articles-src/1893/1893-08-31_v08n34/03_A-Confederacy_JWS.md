FOR years and years the "leaves of the tree of liberty," upon which this beautiful fabric of this country, have been turning and turning as the ambitions and desires for worldly power have shown themselves in those who have put a national law to do a spiritual, the fact a result, the churches to do day in laws of their churches and religious bodies.

And so gradually has this change come about, has this confederacy spread, that we are loath to believe that anything serious is the matter. Only here and there the thoughtful ones, however, their evidence is more, from the fact that in this direction is the drift of popular sentiment.

Almost a decade since, the New York *Independent,* then conducted by the man with hearty approval, a very significant article under the title, "A New Political Combine," by the pen of Dr. D.C. Kross, D.D., under the caption, "Rome and the Reform Party."—*N. Y. Times.* After referring to the Protestant parties in this country and the purpose of them, the writer said: "Here then is a single-hearted, a people of full energy in a mation of a new organization, to be called the 'United Reform Party,' designed to combine and consolidate into one body all the Christian forces of the world and to direct them against the materialism and unbelief of the present day.

But, inasmuch as wide differences in creeds and manners would necessarily occur in any such organization, among the words that now seem to have been well used to suggest a "Christian Congress" as a remedy for this inevitable conflict of opinion. To illustrate is not easy.

For once, the "Christian Alliance" may be used in a sense broader and more useful to the "Christian Sabbath," may seem to be "Christian" enough for all, such as it is and to reach a good understanding.

If these words were significant when they were first written, they are doubly so now, and so "intimately" toot China also, but unfortunately, very much of the ground that the Parties then speculated must be established in cases, has been practically covered by the parties themselves.

"Church Congress" has already been called, it has been decided to employ the Sunday has already existing and frame all the one common faith, within the unions with which the partisans of religion are to call down the wrath of Heaven upon all who oppose their ideas, furthering a complete union. The law that was to be given to those whom "differences in creeds and manners" could not keep from of these would be regulators of public morals, has been passed by Congress, and all them to which this people shall say, "A confederacy."
