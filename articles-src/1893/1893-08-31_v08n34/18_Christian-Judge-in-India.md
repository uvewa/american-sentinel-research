A WRITER of the *Christian Judge* (Baptist) refers to his editorial in India in the issue of June 29, says:

If we cannot persuade men into our way of thinking about religious matters, we must never resort to force or compulsion for our convictions. If cannot conscientiously train the religious consciences of all the people then with it Thackeray or Shakespeare or the another writer in the novel. . . . The Christians may not challenge each others and interfere to force their brethren. I say the right to force my own opinion upon him; . . . It is the business of the preacher to persuade and convince and win the way of thinking; but this time is long past for any man to expect legislative or compulsory measures in aid of the . . . obligations to religious worship and . . . to demand in legislation to enforce them think and act for themselves as matters of conscience.

It is in our republican sense. It is truly a pity all professing Christians cannot see the truth of this argument. God the Lord, not certainly take our religion to the aid of civil law. If he wanted his religion the medium he uses to bring men to him, and his Spirit is to give to all those who truly follow him. It is only to them to appeal to civil law. Paul tells us that the "weapons of our warfare are not carnal," and "this is the word of the Lord, not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit." The Spirit of the Lord is the weapon the Christian should use to fight the powers of darkness, and only this he will succeed, not by evil Spirit.
