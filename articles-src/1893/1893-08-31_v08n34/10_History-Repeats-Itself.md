THE truthfulness of the statement made by Neander, in his history of the "Della Religion," as given in our issue of August, page 728, has specially never proved its good more true than in the case of the recent decision, the decision of the President of the United States to use troops to enforce; Blackstone, a 319 law, commenting on Sunday. Speaking of the time of the Homily, he says:

Toleration was not a virtue of the times, and to all Bannerets the most arbitrary efforts of these princes. But when the prince descended to the narrow bigotry of a sectarian, and began to prescribe by the priesthood of power, and to cleanse without legal authority, we may say that the most tyrannical authority shut eyes against the light of the demonstration.
