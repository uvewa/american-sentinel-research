[The following was written for the Interior, a Presbyterian paper published in Chicago, but was rejected. "Father" Chiniquy, appeals to "all the papers which take an interest in the present and too successful efforts of Popery to take possession of the United States, to reproduce this warning letter."]

Editor of the Interior:—I consider it a duty to address you a few remarks on your article of 25th of May last, "The Rumor."

1. You are right when you say that the letter of Leo XIII. ordering the Catholics to kill the Protestants on the 5th of next September, is a hoax. But you are sadly mistaken when you say that they, the Roman Catholics, do not prepare themselves for the impending bloody conflict which they are provoking.

2. It is an undeniable fact that the Roman Catholics are forming secret and military companies under the names of Hibernians, St. Patrick's Cadets, St. Patrick's Mutual Alliance, Knights of St. Peter, Knights of Columbkill, The Sacred Heart, etc. Those secret societies are not only drilled, but they are well armed, some of them with arms bought by themselves; some got from the governors who bought their votes under that condition. They parade your streets several times a year under the name and mask of State militia.

3. I was a priest of Rome twenty-five years, and have been a citizen of the United States since 1856. During that time I have lectured in more than three hundred of your largest cities, towns and villages, and I have had many opportunities of being acquainted with the undeniable facts which I proclaim here, though they are kept under the most sacred secrecy by the Roman Catholics.

4. Before many years your country will be drenched with the blood shed by these secret Roman Catholic societies, armed with the best modern weapons, forming an army already more than half a million of men.

5. To prove that there is no danger, you tell us that the Roman Catholics are not insane.

Surely the Roman Catholics are not insane when they take possession of New York, Boston, Washington, St. Paul, St. Louis, Cincinnati, New Orleans, Mobile, San Francisco, Chicago, etc., etc., and drive away almost all the Protestants from the positions of honor, power, trust and money.

6. You are right to tell us that the Roman Catholics are not insane when, with their marvelous, mysterious, diabolical deceptions, they persuade every year more than ten thousand (10,000!) of the very best Protestant families to entrust the education of more than ten thousand young Protestant ladies to the nuns of the Pope, who soon make them Papists, and then get their millions of dollars for the holy (?) church.

8. You are perfectly correct when you tell us that the Roman Catholics are not insane when, being ordered by their church to destroy the great principles of liberty, equity, tolerance, self-respect and patriotism, which are melting Romanism as the rays of the sun melt the ice and snow, they so obstinately and sternly aim at destroying your schools where your young men learn those great principles of liberty, equity, tolerance and self-respect which are the death knell of Romanism in the United States if they stand.

9. It is evident to every one of your readers that the Roman Catholics are not insane when, not being more than the eighth part of the population, they not only rule your press, command your armies, man your navy, but they are forcing you to yield, yield, yield, day after day, till very soon the American Protestants will have to take the background everywhere, and let the Roman Catholics rule this country for the benefit of the Pope.

10. But those Roman Catholics who are not insane know very well that there are many Protestant Americans who think that the time has quite come to put a stop to those concessions, privileges and yieldings in favor of Rome—if they do not want to become as strangers in their own country.

The order has come from Rome to sharpen the swords and the bayonets—to prepare the powder and the bullets, in order to get rid of those who will refuse to be ruled by the priests, the bishops and the cardinals of the holy (?) church.

When you say to the Protestants, "There is no danger," you must have forgotten that the Jure Canonis says positively: "It is not a sin nor a murder for a Catholic to kill a Protestant." You must also have forgotten the declaration of St. Thomas, who has lately been put among the Doctors of the Church of Rome, and whose works have been approved by all the Popes, and by Pius IX. in particular. These are his words:—

> Though heretics must not be tolerated because they deserve it, we must wait till they are twice admonished to submit to the holy church. But if, after a second admonition, they persist in their errors, they must not only be excommunicated, but they must be delivered to the secular power to be "exterminated!"—St. Thomas, "Theologia," vol. 4, p. 30.

The 30th December, 1870, I forced Bishop Foley, of Chicago, to swear before the court of Kankakee that this was the present law of the church of Rome towards the heretics, wherever they are the ruling power.

11. You must forget that the few years before the last terrible and so bloody civil war, several prophets had been sent by our merciful God to warn the northern people against the approaching storm, and to reproach them for their yieldings and coward concessions to the slaveholders. You remember that, with a burning eloquence, these prophets foretold that those concessions made to the merciless slaveholders would be paid with the blood and the tears of the northern people!

How were these prophets answered? Just with the very words you use to-day:

"There is no danger!"

"The southern men are not insane!"

"We are two northern men against one in the south!"

And those who saw and foretold the impending danger then were rebuked and called fanatics. They were accused of spreading false alarm—they were even driven away from their towns and cities; more than that—a good number of them were stoned; and even put to death as fanatics and disturbers of the peace.

The ministers of the gospel were the most in earnest in those days, as they are, unfortunately, to-day, crying peace! peace! and put the people to sleep till the echoes of the land reverberated the booming of the cannon of Sumpter. You know the rest. Yours truly,

C. CHINIQUY.
