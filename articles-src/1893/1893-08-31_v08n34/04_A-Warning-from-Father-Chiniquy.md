A PATRIOTIC paper published in Chicago, but was well pointed reference to the attitude of the Roman Catholic which takes an interest in the present and immediate future of the country. It addresses itself to "Protestants" of the present day.

*Editor of the Interior.—*I consider it a duty to address you a few remarks on the present crisis of our fair republic. "The signs of the times." "The warnings."

1. You are right when you say that the letter of *Leo XIII, telling the Catholics to kill the Protestants* on the 5th of next September, is very probably a forgery. My intimate knowledge of Rome leads me to intimate when you say that they, the present conditions are already sufficiently ominous for the impending bloody conflict between Rome and liberty.

2. It is an undeniable fact that the Roman Catholics are training large military companies under the names of Hibernians, St. Patrick's Catholic, the St. Patrick's Mutual Alliance, Knights of St. Peter, Knight of Columbus, The Sacred Heart, etc. Those military associations are only drilled, but they are well armed. Where do their arms and ammunition come from? . . . Do they not come from the governors who bought their votes when ballot was a fraud? . . . They parade your streets several times a year under the arms and mask of State militia.

3. I was a priest of Rome twenty five years, and have been a citizen of the United States since 1856. During that time I have visited and studied the one hundred of your largest cities. Here some people whom I have met have given me items of being acquainted with the undeniable facts which I proclaim here, though they are made under the most sacred secrecy by the Roman Catholic Church.

1. Before many years your country will be drenched with the blood shed by those same Roman Catholic societies, armed with the best modern weapons, forming an army already more than half a million strong.

2. To prove that there is no danger, you tell me that the Roman Catholics are loyal.

Surely the Roman Catholics are not in a small minority in the United States. New York, Boston, Washington, St. Paul, St. Louis, Cincinnati, New Orleans, Mobile, San Francisco, Chicago, etc. etc., and every other almost all of the Protestant from the positions of honor, power, trust and emolument?

8. You are right to tell us that the Roman Catholics are of sincere desire, with a few exceptions; but because they are deceptive, they persuade every year more and more the politicians . . . they are the best Protestant families to entrust the education of their children to the Roman Catholic Sisterhood. In a brief summary Protestant ladies to the sons of the Pope, who seem more elegant in dress, and then art their millions of dollars at the help of its clergy.

9. You are perfectly correct when you tell us that the Roman Catholics are not insane where, being ordered by their priests to destroy all that is dear of liberty, equity, tolerance, and respect and fair dealing in this country. . . . for as surely as the rays of the sun shall the one and some day their obedience is absolutely required—as destroying at schools where your young men learn those grand principles of liberty, equity, tolerance and self-respect with which the should hold to of people of the United States if they staid.

12. It is useless to carry one of your statesmen of other persuasion as an intruders when, not being more than the majority in the Southern countries, they only rule your press, command your legislators, and after assailing and forcing you to yield, yield, yield, day after day, without a blush, a protest or a fight, ask will have to take the background everywhere, and to let the Roman Catholic rule this country for the benefit of the Pope.

13. But those Roman Catholics who are ignorant know very well that there are many things going on which they cannot openly condemn. If is time you must hear that the time has quite come to put a stop to this. . . . If the Protestants do not come openly in favor of Rome—if they do not come out boldly to act now—it will be too late.

14. Rome has come from Rome to sharpen the swords and the bayonets—to prepare the powder and the bullets, to be ruled by the priests, the bishops and the Pope alone. . . .

When you say to the Protestants, surely you must also sometimes forget, forgotten that the Jew Connors says positively: "It is not a sin nor a murder for a Catholic to kill a Protestant." You must also have forgotten the declaration of St. Thomas, who has lately been put among the Doctors of Catholicism, that all the Protestants are nothing but "vermin," the Pope, and by Pius IX, in particular.

Though heretics must not be tolerated because they deserve it, we must bear with them, . . . administered to submit to the only bulk. But if, afterwards, they are found to be falling away, they must not only be excommunicated, but they must be delivered to the secular power to be put to death.

1. Before many years your country will be drenched with the blood shed by those same Roman Catholic societies, armed with the best modern weapons, forming an army already more than half a million strong.

2. You must forget that for five years, as in any nation on the verge of civil war, several prophets had been sent by our good to announce to the perishing people against the approaching storm, and to respond to them for their unfaithfulness and general concessions to the slaveholders. You must remember that, as a nation of Christians, those prophets foretold that those whom the conscience approved of should be hundreds would be put with the blood of their own citizens, to be told their own household be put.

> With the very words I tell you to-day: "The northern men are not insane!" That "the slaveholders will never be drowned in the south!"

4. And those who saw and foretold the impending danger then were rebuked and denounced. . . . The prophets were not "Appraisers: bare-after"—not men driven away from their home-town and cities, by mobs. Some who warned the people were stoned; and even put to death as unreliable and unpatriotic.

The ministers of the gospel were the last to wake. . . . Not a few preachers are unfortunately, to-day, crying peace! peace! when there is no peace. They like the sons of the land reverberated the boosing of their favorite doctrine of slavery: "Let us alone."

Yours truly,

C. CHINIQUY.
