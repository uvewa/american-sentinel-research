WHAT is the matter with England? There they have a Sunday law, and yet "A startling discovery," says The *Free Church Monthly,* "has lately been with regard to the condition of Methodism in the midland counties of England. In Birmingham alone there are 11,000 empty sittings. Wrexington, on this same Sunday, the chapels were found to be nearly three empty as in the Birmingham district. In many churches the minister nearly preaches to a 'desolate flock.'" It seems that there is something more than a legal Sunday is needed to fill the churches.
