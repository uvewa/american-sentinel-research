THE series of religious congresses will open in Chicago, September 11, and continue seventeen days. The object of this so-called parliament of religions, is thus stated by J. H. Barrows, D. D.: "To furnish a great school of comparative religions; to bring the different faiths into contact and conference; to deepen the spirit of brotherhood; to bring out the distinctive truths of each religion; to show why men believe in God and in the future life; to bridge the chasms between Christians of different names and religious men of all names; to induce good men to work together for common ends, and to promote the cause of international peace."
