THE new President of the American Sabbath Union, Rev. G. S. Mott, has a series of articles running through *The Soldier,* a South Carolina paper, in which he says of a divine command for Sunday observance:

> He either is no is each command. But if we are to be limited by such a demand, all of us shall soon find ourselves in a very perplexing position.

Let us point to one as in an instance. Polygamy is an institution recognized in the Old Testament. Its conditions were permitted for by divine endorsement. Now polygamy is strictly in terms in our Constitution. It is the prevailing desire of the State. Yet there is no positive divine command against, or in abridgement of this privilege which was granted in the Old Testament. The Mormon interest himself behind the same breastwork of argument, as that put up by the Seventh-day Adventists. He also circumstantially denoted that of America which once just as emphatically demand the text of scriptures which commence prohibiting polygamy. It is true that polygamy was permitted under the Theocracy, but it never so commanded as a moral duty. If polygamy had ever been so plainly commanded as to show the keeping of the seventh day of our time commanded or observed as our seventh day, our commanding all of it, this might not reasonably demand as plain a repeal, but as it was only permitted like divorces, "because of the hardness of their hearts," the Methodists or any other National Reformers ought to make it stand as a par with the Sabbath of the Lord.
