A WRITER for the Christian Index (Baptist), in an article in its issue of June 29, has the following:

> If we cannot persuade men into our way of thinking about religious matters, let us concede to them the same rights of opinion which we claim for ourselves. If I cannot conscientiously visit the World's Fair grounds on Sunday, or read Dickens or Thackeray or Shakespeare or the secular newspapers on that day, that is my affair. My more liberal minded neighbor dare not interfere to force me by law to accept his views on the subject. No more have I the right to force my views upon him. I may endeavor to courteously persuade him to my way of thinking; but the time is long past for appeal to the civic magistrate in such matters. About the most unprofitable business that any government can engage in, is legislation on religious subjects. Let it preserve order and allow men to think and act for themselves on matters of conscience.

This is in our opinion sound sense. It is a pity all professing Christians cannot see the truth of this statement. The Lord can certainly take care of his own without the aid of civil law. His Spirit is the medium he uses to bring men to him, and his Spirit he gives to all those who truly follow him. It is only when they are without his Spirit that they appeal to civil law. Paul tells us that the "weapons of our warfare are not carnal," and "this is the word of the Lord, . . . Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit." The Spirit of the Lord is the weapon the Christian should use to fight the powers of darkness, and with this he will succeed, but not by civil enactments.
