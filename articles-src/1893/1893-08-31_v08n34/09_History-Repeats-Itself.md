The truthfulness of the statement made by Gibbon, in his history of the "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," Vol. 4, page 528, has probably never proven itself more true than in the case of the Boston preachers, calling upon the President of the United States to use troops to enforce the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. Speaking of the time of Justinian, A. D. 519-565, Gibbon says:—

> Toleration was not a virtue of the times, and indulgence to rebels has seldom been the virtue of princes. But when the prince descends to the narrow and peevish character of a disputant, he is easily provoked to supply the defect of argument by the plenitude of power, and to chastise without mercy the perverse blindness of those who wilfully shut their eyes against the light of the demonstration.

The demonstration being satisfactory to their own minds everybody must bow in silent submission or take the consequences. Any number of men bound together to enforce unjust laws, can be as cruel as one prince, if the same power is given to them. Just let these men, with such a spirit, get the laws they are seeking for, and how quickly we would see our glorious land of liberty filled with violence from one end to the other. How soon we would learn by sad experience, that, indulgence to rebels has never been the virtue of law.
