THE town of Somerville, Mass., about five years ago, Henry I. Padfield, tried one of its most prominent citizens of that state, arraigned and tried for continuously and keeping open store on Sunday. Complaints were filed by persons who had no interest in the matter, to indiscretion, was aroused over by others, paid to institute the proceedings; the magistrate was on the trial. This and particularly that the crime, there was something in the flaming flame of liquory furnish burning.

The alleged ground of Mr. Padfield's offence was selling certain articles of groceries, on Sunday; this time newspapers and cigars on Sunday. . . and also a drug store, and preventing the delivery of the dressing. Mr. Padfield was arrested for the first offence of June and of June 17 with the whole bare printed on the back of the warrant, at once these were set down before the court for its examination. "At the heads of the complaints and warrants stood the title, "The Commonwealth of Massachusetts vs. Henry I. Padfield." "Blue Laws," with dates. October, 1692, . . . "That no person shall do any bodily work, labor, or business, or travel, by land, on the Lord's day (Sunday), under pains of punishment." . . . Although, a penalty of First of every money for violation thereof; November, 1697, "that no person shall sell any cakes or any other thing on the Lord's day"—penalty a fine; the selling of cakes "made for any burial, . . ." September, 1634, "That no person shall, either buy or sell, on the Lord's day;" September, 1634, "That no person make or buy any apparel either woolen, silke or lynen, with any lace on it, silver, gold, silke or thread, under the penalty of forfeiture of such cloathes, etc.," and a statute dated Nov. 4, 1690, that no salted cod; November Nov. 4, 1690, that the sheriff could be imprisoned "For allowing Baptist conventicles to be held in his town."

The following extracts from the *News Letter* give the situation. In the first page of the letter, under the heading of "Somerville's first Experience in Puritanical Persecution," the paper says:

Last Sunday our citizens had their first experience of . . . Puritanical persecution, in compliance with the order issued by the Chief of Police of Somerville, two policemen visited all the stores on the avenue. . . . Those which they found open for business were notified to close. . . . All complied with the order, and within half an hour the avenue was without an open store . . . and remained so until Sunday. The druggist was also required to close at once. . . . The cause for the issue of this order was the complaint of a person not an account of the Blue Laws, and of a similar character.

There follows an enumeration of cases where in citizens was refused to ride, per force, the well known who has been asked to give reasons for so doing; . . . these persons too, forcibly, inducing is what obligation for a man accused, sending prohibition of labor to a provision packing company, railroad employs, etc.

While these little grievances may be considered serious enough by those having to endure them; the enforcement of these statutes will work vastly more serious results for the whole community, as well as to individuals, should other cases come or be driven to the wall. Not mere policy and enforcement of law, it is unjust and clearly means not a matter of policy and right, it, but principle is involved. Once let the spirit of bigotry get hold of this city of law and persecution is sure to follow. The truth of this assertion is attested in every land. Religion and morality cannot be forced upon the people by legislative enactments.

A whole world of truth is wrapped up in that one sentence. And the writer of it was made fair and square, and we will wanton to see any person who can ever be convinced after he has considered and told this than righteousness.

It would be an infinitely more just and humane law that every one shall be hungry for a day, whenever the community as hungry the other day, than to pass a law that they shall be full of food. . . . That law would be just as successful as the other; both would be equally futile. But the law concerning the State slipping into just such absurdities, concerning matters of this kind, that State and Church forever separate; . . . a simple fact of her sister States, and seen her sisters of other States take warning, and beware of Arkansas, Tennessee and Maryland. Let other States take warning, and beware of the Puritanical bigotry and hatred. Only failure awaits such efforts before it kills the tender growth.
