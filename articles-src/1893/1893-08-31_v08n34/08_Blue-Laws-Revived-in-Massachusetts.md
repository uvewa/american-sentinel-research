In the town of Somerville, Mass., about three months ago, Henry D. Padelford, one of its most prominent druggists, was arrested and fined twenty-five dollars for keeping open store on Sunday. Considerable feeling, which in some cases amounted to indignation, was aroused over this action at the time. This had partially died down, however, when the smoldering, flickering flame of bigotry burst forth anew.

The alleged ground of Mr. Padelford's arrest was selling candy to children and cigars to smokers, on Sunday; this time orders were issued closing barber shops and drug stores, and preventing the delivery of ice cream on Sunday. Accordingly the Somerville News came out under date of June 17 with the whole issue printed on blue paper, and headed, "Blue Law Edition." At the heads of four columns on the first page are printed the following "Blue Laws," with dates: October, 1632, "That no person shall take any tobacco public, under paine of punishment," attaching a penalty of 1d (one penny) for violation thereof; November, 1637, "That no person shall sell any cakes or buns, . . . upon paine of 10s fine," excepting the selling of cakes "made for any burial or marriage, or such like spetial occasion;" September, 1634, "That no person, either man or women, shall hereafter make or buy any apparel either woolen, silks or lynnen, with any lace on it, silver, gold, silks or thread, under the penalty of forfeiture of such cloathes, etc.;" and a notice dated Nov. 8, 1666, that the sheriff had been removed from office, fined £50 and imprisoned "For allowing Baptist conventicles in his house."

The following extracts from the News will give the situation. In the first page editorial entitled, "Blue Law Sunday; Somerville's first Experience in Puritanical Ways," is the following:—

> Last Sunday our citizens had their first experience of the coming Blue Law era of this city. In compliance with the order issued by Chief of Police Parkhurst, the barber shops were closed and the unfortunate that did not get shaved on Saturday, went without it until Monday. The druggists (with three exceptions) also closed their stores and had hung in conspicuous places signs, "Closed on account of the Blue Law," and of a similar character.

Then follows an enumeration of cases where ice cream was refused to sick persons (to well persons too, forsooth), inability to obtain liquor for a case of poisoning, prohibition of labor to a provision packing company, railroad employés, etc. While these little grievances may be considered serious enough by those bearing them, yet the same spirit at work in Somerville will work vastly more serious results, if it is not zealously opposed and driven to the wall. Not mere policy and expediency for the present, as many regard it, but principle is involved. Once let the spirit of bigotry get hold of the civil law and persecution is sure to follow. The State is ruined and religion is suppressed. Religion and morality cannot be forced upon an individual.

A whole bundle of truth is wrapped up in the following humorous editorial:—

> How old Sol steamed up last Sunday! The issue was made fair and square, and we will venture to say that there was more hungering and thirsting after ice cream and soda than after righteousness!
>
> It would be no more absurd to pass a law that every one shall be hungry for a certain article of food at five o'clock every other day, than to pass a law that they should hunger for righteousness every first day of the week. One law should be just as successful as the other; both would make hypocrites and fools. But is not the State dipping into just such absurdities when it makes a Sunday law? "Keep the State and Church forever separate."

Massachusetts is following the evil example of her sister States, and soon her records will be stained with blots like those of Arkansas, Tennessee and Maryland. Let other States take warning, and root out the dangerous weed of bigotry before it kills the tender plants.
