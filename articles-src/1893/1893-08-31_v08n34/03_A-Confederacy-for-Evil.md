For years and years the "leaven of hypocrisy" has been working in the religio-social fabric of this country. With increasing wealth has come increasing worldliness and desire for worldly power on the part of the churches. This has just as naturally led to a decrease of the real power of God and spiritual life. As a result, the churches today are in large measure turning toward human laws for help, and are seeking to accomplish, by the force of legislation, what they have failed to do by the power of the gospel, namely, to convert and control men's consciences.

And so gradually has this change come about, that many honest-hearted Christian people are loath to believe that anything of the kind has even yet occurred. To the thoughtful ones, however, the evidence is very conclusive on this point, and the more so, from the fact that the drift of religious thought has been in this direction for several years.

Almost a decade since, the New York Independent (February 14, 1884) published with hearty approval, a very significant article from the pen of Bishop A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D., under the caption, "A Christian Alliance the Demand of our Times." After referring to the restrictive conditions of the National Reform Association and the Evangelical Alliance, so far, at least, as cooperative work was concerned, the article suggested the formation of a new organization, to be called the "Christian Alliance," which should combine and consolidate into one body all the Christian forces of the world and direct them against the materialism and unbelief of the present day.

But, inasmuch as wide differences in principles and measures would necessarily occur in any such organization, the bishop, in words that now seem to have been well-nigh prophetic, suggested "Church Congresses" as a remedy for this inevitable condition of affairs. To illustrate his point he says:—

> For example, this "Christian Alliance" may agree to sustain the Sunday laws. Differences of views as to the "Christian Sabbath" may seem to clog the effort, but then, it will call a "Congress," and give freedom to all Christians to compare their ideas, and to reach a good understanding.

If these words were significant when they were first written, they are doubly so now. Such an "alliance" (not Christian, alas, but unfortunately, very much the opposite of it), while not theoretically established in name, has been practically at work for some time in fact. The "Church Congress" has already been called, it has been decided to sustain the Sunday laws already existing and frame all the new ones possible, while the unanimity with which the partisans of the Sunday movement are already beginning to call down the wrath of Heaven upon all who oppose their ideas, furnishes a reliable index to the "freedom" likely to be given to those whose "differences of views" are such as to "clog the efforts" of these would-be regulators of public morals. "Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy." Isa. 8:12.
