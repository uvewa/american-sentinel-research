THE Sabbath Recorder (Seventh-day Baptist) thinks that it might be right under "certain conditions," to make a law shutting up dramshops on the first day of the week, but says: "In our own experience and observation, however, the conditions never appear. The situation is an imaginary one rather than real. If the saloons can be closed on Sunday, they can be closed all of the time. It is difficult to conceive of a man who should want liquor sold on all other days of the week but not on Sunday. Sunday-closing is a half way measure; but it can be attained no more quickly than the 'whole loaf.' Leaving out of account its flavor of religious legislation, it is unsatisfactory. No wonder that many good men have not enough faith in it to write their name on a petition in its behalf."

WHAT is the matter with England? there they have a Sunday law, and yet "A startling discovery," says The Free Church Monthly, "has been made with regard to the condition of Methodism in the midland counties of England. In Birmingham alone there are 21,000 empty Wesleyan sittings. On the census Sunday the chapels were found to be two-thirds empty in the morning, and not two-thirds filled at night." It seems that it takes something more than a legal Sunday to fill the churches.
