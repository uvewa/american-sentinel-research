A CHRISTIAN is a follower of Christ, and since Christ is an *individual,* and says, "Therefore, watch and to-day is a day of salvation for every man and all of Christianity, and that is the life of Christ. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and the things that I say?" the Saviour says, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;" he says, "He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness." To be a follower of Christ is to be abiding in him, and Christ also in the follower. And how can a nation be led to walk to be shown? to man, it has to be led; and how can such a one teach it? It is a perversion of the term "Christian" to apply it to a national thing.

"Come unto me." "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart." Matt. 11:28, 29.

Did you come unto him, Matt. 11: really of a Christian. How what followest me, of a Christian. How what followest me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." John 8:12.

"Abide in me, and I in you. . . . If a man abide not in me he is cast forth." John 15:4, 5. "He that believeth on the Son of God heareth the witness in himself." 1 John 5:10. "Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith." 2 Cor. 13:5. Let every man do his part to be in the right way. "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven." Matt. 7:21. "For not the hearers of the law are just before God." Rom. 2:13. "And, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake." Matt. 5:3-9. "Blessed are they which are persecuted." Matt. 5:10, 11. "If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub." Matt. 10:25.

Hearers. Matt. 5:3-9. "Blessed are the poor them their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." Matt. 6:15. "For if ye forgive men their trespasses unto Peter to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven." Matt. 18:21, 22. He also says, "If he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him." Luke 17:4.

All this was practically illustrated in the life of our Lord. He let us set an example that we should follow in his steps. "Who, when he was reviled, reviled not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously." 1 Pet. 2:21-23. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. And his words concerning those who were torturers him on the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do;" and love and forbearance as this are not natural to man, yet they are possible. All this Christ did as man, but not with the strength of man alone. What in the character of Christ reconciling the world into him working out his righteousness of faith, through the way was by faith dwelling in our hearts by faith, that we may be rooted and established in the love of God." Eph. 3:16-19. This cause again is individual. It is the sign of the power of God to create men in Christ Jesus new creatures, to take them how it is possible for an entire nation to become Christian? Only those individuals who accept of Christ, and a follower of Christ. But in that case each would have to come by the gospel on his own and from his own heart.

How saying, "Believe on Government of Christ, and thou shall be saved." The only Christian is a follower of Christ, and Christ, and remains in existence. Just as it would be impossible for a Christian Nation to go against its foe and in the injunction, "Love your enemies."

But still one says "in substance," the States got set up is a "Christian" nation, known as more, and it would be absurd for a nation to attempt to carry them out, maintained only by force, and violence to violence is the character of Christ. So it is utterly impossible that there should be such a thing as this which sets a Christian nation. "That soul that sinneth," every government should be abolished, it being at all impossible.

In the present condition of things; since there are so many who will not believe without the use of force, In the world to come, when all the world over the nations have become the kingdom of our Lord and his Christ, civil government will be done, and reign of God's government, a more simple administration. The peace and love of God will reign supreme.
