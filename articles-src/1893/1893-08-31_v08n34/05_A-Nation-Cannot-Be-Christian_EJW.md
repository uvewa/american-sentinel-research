A CHRISTIAN is a follower of Christ, and since Christ is not divided, but is "the same yesterday, and to-day and for ever," there can be only one standard of Christianity, and that is the life of Christ. "Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say?" the Saviour asks. The beloved disciple says: "He that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself also so to walk even as he walked." 1 John 2:6. "He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to humble thyself to walk with thy God?" Micah 6:8, margin. "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls." Matt. 11:29.

Meekness, then, is an essential quality of a Christian. Hear what Jesus says: "I say unto you that ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." Again: "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven. Matt. 5:39, 44, 45.

Again the Master said: "If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." "Then came Peter to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, until seven times; but, until seventy times seven." Matt. 18:21, 22. He said also, "If he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him." Luke 17:4.

All this was practically illustrated in the life of our Lord. He left us an example that we should follow in his steps. He, "when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judge is right to right to right." 1 Peter 2:23. "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth." His only words concerning those who were torturing him were, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."

Such love and forbearance as this are not natural to man, yet they are possible. All this Christ did as a man, but not with the strength of man. "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself." As God was in Christ, so may Christ dwell in our hearts by faith, that we also may "be filled with all the fullness of God." Eph. 3:17-19. This cannot be done for a people as a whole, but only as individuals. It is not accomplished by any formal statement of belief, to which all give assent, or subscribe their names, but by Christ's dwelling in each man's heart, through his personal faith. Each one must be able to say for himself, "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ's path in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." Gal. 2:30.

Then how would it be possible for an entire nation to become Christian? Only by every person's becoming converted, and a follower of Christ. But in that case the nation would cease to occupy a place among the governments of earth. How so? Because no government on earth could follow the instructions of Christ, and remain in existence. Just imagine a government acting according to the injunction, "Love your enemies;" or "Resist not evil." Its place would be known no more, and it would be absorbed by others. Earthly governments can be maintained only by force, and violence is foreign to the character of Christ. So it is utterly impossible that there should be such a thing on this earth as a Christian government. This does not mean that civil government should be abolished; on the contrary, it is imperatively demanded in the present condition of things; since there are so many who will not behave without the use of force. In the world to come, when the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ, civil government will come to an end; for God's government is a moral government. Then the peace and love of God will reign in every heart.
