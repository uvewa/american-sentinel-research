THE proceedings of the various branches of the World's Congress Auxiliary, meeting on the Art Institute, the past week have been interesting and suggestive. The different branches of the Government Department of the Government, in several weeks, have been The Department of Suffrage and the National American Suffrage Association, the Congress of Jurisprudence, the International Congress of Suffrage, in Republics, Kingdom, and Empires, the International Reform Congress, and the City Government Congress. It probably was not intended that any particular branch of the general subject of suffrage and its kindred form should monopolize the attention of its congress during the week, but several themes, the fact has been, that the way of making suffrage prove to say how generally the subject of female suffrage monopolized the mass of attention.

Among political subjects in which women have been interested, in the different congresses which have been held, women from various countries have been here, and much enthusiast enthusiasm has been shown in the organizations of the congresses and in the bringing forward of papers, presentations of facts and arguments by women of interest, of interest, attractiveness, and the listing of times by speakers who are known to their audiences, and to humanity in general.

At the opening address of welcome, William Dudley Foulke, on behalf of the Congress, spoke as follows:

The subject which will arouse the greatest interest at this Congress will be the removal of the disability of sex. That the world has been unjust to her, and it is true, that woman did not care for the removal of the disability . . . she is content to be a beautiful, unthinking being, a butterfly, . . . assisting and displaying the utmost ingenuities in the arts of the toilet and charms of persons; . . . her place is in the house; she has no concern with the affairs in the affairs of government. "Women in politics," is an unpleasant phrase; it suggests the mining of smoking wicked's public spirit, for greater than it is the Congress on Jurisprudence, and on in public questions will be of great benefit.

In the World's Congress on Jurisprudence and Law Reform, a paper from Judge Dudley of New York read, in the administration of civil justice, which was a model of clearness and perspicuity. A duplicate paper from David Dudley Field was read, and after extended discussion it also read at length in the course of which it was said:

In the category of individual rights I recourse to the right of universal suffrage. The great classes of human society is the ruled and their rulers . . . in the administration of civil justice. Also an article of organic law that the relations between the rulers and the ruled . . . should be so defined in all cases that there could be no doubt as to the resources the stroke this made for the emancipation of the citizen from arbitrary authority. There are dreadful prosecutions in the name of religion which come from all quarters—the persecutions of Catholics in Spain; the mystery suffering in the Mormons; the bloody massacres of the Christians of Mexico; and the slaughtered saints whose bones whitened all the soil of the Republics; . . . these of the States that they alone to ease to stop before the persecution that is everywhere present, but there is one rift in the clouds through which,

in the mind's eye at least, the daylight shines all over the world issue. This Note it was held before a jury . . . in most cases; and the world, were it still will remain that there was a Nation of free institutions, and that the liberty of the individual was the corner stone of the republic. . . . The reasons and solemnly decreed that no man should be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

In the face of the religious laws in the statute books; in the face of the enforcement of the laws in many States in the Union, it would seem as if there should be an organized effort to secure the complete enforcement of the laws themselves; a complete survey of the laws themselves that are in the statute books. To that end a congress has been formed to meet in special contest over the religious question, and to form over religion a question at law. This is made public faith through the periodic press; in the face of a reasonable faith in the farce of the absurd these same made the farce incumbent upon both. It has been evident for years that the religious intolerance has been truly of a religious nature; and the fact that a particle of that religious intolerance has been present in every session. When a reason was read, has been accepted of a State is to be observed. These congresses, of the semi-judicial works of the half dozen " voluntary" organizations that combine for the enforcement of the religious "voluntary" organizations "enforce the law of the laws" in the face of all this and more than this, a writer in the *Chicago Tribune* objects, a protest of the United States must appear as of her the law of the United States, must appear as of her law of the States; and no one, no matter how bigoted, or how dense or of what persuasion or faith, should be so blind to the cloud of witnesses gathered here from all parts of the world; the splendid intelligence that is expressed, and through which there is being freely set in the through, such largeness of mind in civil and religious affairs, shining through these various congresses, as not to be benefited thereby.

W. E. CORNELL.
