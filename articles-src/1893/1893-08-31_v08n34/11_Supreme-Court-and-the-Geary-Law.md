IT is announced that the Supreme Court is to grant a re-hearing on the Geary law. As one of the five justices who sustained the law has since died, it is thought that the court may reverse itself and declare the law unconstitutional.

———

A PURELY civil and political law, it ought not to be difficult for the courts to decide against the act if it would only adopt the same course of reasoning pursued in the case of the Better Society of Truth or Verity of Truth Church on the Mormon question.

In the decision of Feb. 20, 1892, in the case just referred to, the Supreme Court said that Congress could not legislate against because this is a Christian nation.

If that reasoning could apply to the Mormon case it ought to be able to in the other. Nobody can defend the anti-Chinese law from a Christian point of view, and the "Christian sentiment" of the country is "clearly against it." That meanwhile further by the churches ought to lead the justices around to their side of the Chinese question, and thus to adjust their Church and State views and look at the Geary law upon a correct basis.
