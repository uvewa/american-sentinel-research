## Article 01 — The Sabbath Question (ATJ)

### Page 2, Constantine edict quotation
- **Issue:** Several words in the Constantine edict quote (block quote on page 2) appear to be OCR artifacts or damaged scan text.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** "cunity" (appears twice), "t'ch", "Cec", "impions", "beguites"
- **Confidence:** LOW — these are clearly OCR errors or scan damage within the quoted Latin/historical edict. The surrounding text and context are legible.
- **Reason:** These words do not form coherent English. They may be corruptions of: "cunning" or "contumacy" (for "cunity"), "such" (for "t'ch"), "because" (for "Cec"), "impious" (for "impions"), "begotten" (for "beguites"). Transcribed as-is per the OCR output to preserve fidelity to source; the original printed text should be consulted.

### Page 1, Psalm 34:8 quotation
- **Issue:** "O laste and see" appears in the OCR — likely "O taste and see."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** "O laste and see that the Lord is good."
- **Confidence:** LOW — "laste" is almost certainly an OCR error for "taste" (Ps. 34:8 KJV reads "O taste and see"). Transcribed as-is per OCR output.

## Article 03 — A Confederacy for Evil (J. W. Scoles)

### Attribution note
- J. W. Scoles is not in the known authors list. Name and location (Graysville, Tenn.) appear at end of article. Treated as explicit attribution.

---

## Article 04 — A Warning from "Father" Chiniquy

### Attribution and numbering
- The letter is signed "C. CHINIQUY." — attributed as editorial since the letter was submitted for publication (introduced by editorial note) but signed by Chiniquy himself. Frontmatter uses `attribution: "editorial"` since the Sentinel is reprinting/publishing the letter without separate author attribution.
- **Second pass note:** The numbered paragraphs in the original skip from 6 to 8 (no paragraph 7). This appears to be the original text's numbering, not a transcription error. Transcribed as-is.

---

## Article 05 — A Nation Cannot Be Christian (EJW)

### Page 5, 1 Peter 2:23 quotation
- **Issue:** "but committed himself to him that judge is right to right to right" — clearly an OCR error with repeated phrase.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** Reproduced OCR text as-is.
- **Confidence:** LOW — 1 Peter 2:23 KJV reads "but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously." The OCR has corrupted the end of this verse. Original should be consulted.

### Page 5, Galatians 2:30 reference
- **Issue:** "Christ's path in me" — likely "Christ liveth in me" (Gal. 2:20, not 2:30 as cited in OCR).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** Reproduced OCR text as-is, including the citation "Gal. 2:30."
- **Confidence:** LOW — standard text of Gal. 2:20 reads "Christ liveth in me." The verse number and wording appear to be OCR errors.

## Article 07 — Contrary to the Spirit of Christ (Alfred Mallett)

### Author name
- Signed "ALFRED MALLETT." Known author list has "AM=Alfred Mallet(?)" with uncertainty. Transcribed exactly as signed. The MEMORY.md notes this as a possible OCR variant.

### Page 5, Luke 9:54 quotation
- **Issue:** "cotered into a village" — likely "entered into a village."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** "cotered into a village"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "cotered" is almost certainly an OCR error for "entered."

## Article 08 — Blue Laws Revived in Massachusetts (W. E. Howell)

### Author note

## Page 8 Editorial Notes — General

### Item about "WILL the gentleman who has sent us a communication from Muddy Lane, Mo."
- This very brief item (one sentence) was not given its own article file as it contains no substantive argument — it is a purely operational/correspondence notice. Skipped per instructions.

### Subscription rates table
- The subscription rate table on page 8 was skipped (boilerplate publisher info).

### "READ the 'ad'" notice
- The brief notice directing readers to the advertisement for "Little Folks Bible Gallery" was skipped (promotional notice, no substantive content).
