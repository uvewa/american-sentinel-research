REV. J. J. RANSOM, a correspondent of the *Nashville Christian Advocate* in a communication to that paper of July 8 sets a young minister straight as saying in justification of the boycott of the Party: "We want to show them that we can't be run." Mr. Ransom's only comment on this "there spoke the natural man." But that is all there is of it. There is no evidence that the "natural man" is but another name for the "carnal mind," which is defined not to be "the enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
