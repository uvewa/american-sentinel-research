It now transpires that, as reported some time since, President Cleveland did write a letter of congratulation to the Pope, upon the occasion of the golden jubilee of his episcopate. When President before, Mr. Cleveland sent the great "Infallible" a copy of the Constitution of the United States. Such acts are entirely out of place in the chief magistrate of this country. As an individual, Mr. Cleveland has a perfect right to thus truckle to Rome, but as President he has no right to do anything of the kind.
