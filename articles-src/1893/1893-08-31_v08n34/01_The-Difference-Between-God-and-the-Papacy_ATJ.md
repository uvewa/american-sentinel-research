FOR the plain, candid consideration of scriptures we have found, and all may find, that the Sabbath question, which has been the leading question of the country and is now paramount, instead of being a question merely of day—of one day or of another, of the seventh day or the first, of Saturday or Sunday—as such, is a question of rival institutions representing rival powers.

THUS every day which God has made is the Sabbath, by resting upon it, by blessing it, by making it holy, and by sanctifying it, which he declared from Sinai is the seventh day, and which Jesus Christ has claimed to be the Lord's, the Sabbath of the Lord—God has set to be the sign by which men may know him to be only the true God and Saviour. It is the sign which God has set, by which men may know what Jesus Christ is to the world. It is the sign of the power of God to create men in Christ Jesus new creatures, to take them even at their worst, not to make them better, to bless them, to make them holy, to sanctify, to save them.

THEN SOLELY, which is the only authority, "by her own infallible authority," "has substituted" the Sabbath of the Lord, which she has declared to be "holy" and which she also "sanctifies"—in the sign of the "salvation" provided by the Papacy, "the mass of sin," which has expanded and exalted itself above God, the place of God, showing itself that it is God. This she has done, and by this the Catholic Church has set, to show what the church is to man. It is the sign of her power to bless, to make holy, and to sanctify, to save.

AND all this is what the Sabbath question means. The question as to whether men shall observe the Sabbath of the Lord, or whether they shall observe Sunday, is the question as to whether men shall honor God, or honor the Papacy above God. It is a question as to whether men shall depend upon Jesus Christ himself, alone, for salvation, or whether they shall depend upon the Catholic Church for salvation. It is a question as to whether men shall bear the signal of the Creator of the heavens and the earth, or that of the Papacy; whether they shall receive the sign of the living God or the sign of the Catholic Church—"the mark of the living God" or "the mark of the beast"; whether we shall serve Christ or antichrist.

THERE is a difference between God and the Papacy; a difference between Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church. The one is "the Son of righteousness;" the other is "the man of sin;" the one makes the provision "of the *mercy* of God;" the other the revelation of "the *mystery* of iniquity;" the one is "the Prince of life;" the other is "the son of perdition." Now, just as there is a difference between God and the Papacy, between Christ and the Catholic Church, so there is a difference between the way of salvation provided by Jesus Christ and the way of salvation provided by the Catholic Church. And the difference between the way of salvation provided by the Lord and that provided by the Catholic Church, is just as great as is the difference between God and the Papacy or between Jesus Christ and any pope that ever lived.

THERE are a number of points upon which this difference might be demonstrated; but for the present occasion we shall dwell on only one, and that is, that it shows the salvation provided by Jesus Christ is of *grace* only, *manifested through earth's cross, and the gift of God;* the salvation provided by the Catholic Church is of *force* only, *manifested through persecute and "the law and State authority."*

Now to the evidence: "By grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast." Eph. 2:8, 9. "To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth [maketh righteous] the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness." Rom. 4:4, 5. "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, . . . even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all that believe: for there is no difference. For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God." Rom. 3:20-25.

THE man who believes these scriptures, at this time, his righteousness; that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus." Rom. 3:26. "Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay; but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified [made righteous] by faith without the deeds of the law." Rom. 3:27, 28. "By one offence judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life." "That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ." Rom. 5:18, 21. "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved." John 3:16, 17. "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." John 12:47. This is the way of salvation provided by Jesus Christ.

Now for the other. Everybody knows that penance is the very keystone of the Catholic system. What is penance, and what does it teach?

> Penance, by which the sins that we commit after baptism is forgiven.

Now, as "baptism" is to be administered "at a mature age" in the Catholic system ("Faith of Our Fathers," p. 311) it is evident that all the sins that a Catholic can possibly commit are "after baptism." And from this it certainly follows that "penance" is the way by which the sins "we commit after baptism" must be forgiven. No person guilty of sins after baptism can possibly be forgiven of sins; no person can be justified—"made righteous"—in the Catholic system by the way of salvation provided by the Catholic Church—unless by "penance." And without "baptism," he can be grown up without "baptism;" he can come only through "the great justification," forgiveness, by among a number of other things, "a detestation of sin" and "a purpose of committing it no more."—"Sacrament of Penance."—"Catholic Belief."

BUT what is penance in its definitions, what is it in practice? "What are works of penance and what are they really for?" Here is the official answer, under the heading, "Works of Penance."—

> They are certain actions imposed on the sinner for the satisfaction of the everlasting punishment due to sin forgiven. What is the meaning of satisfaction of the everlasting punishment, to be paid by the sinner? That not only the guilt of sin, and the everlasting punishment due to it, are freely forgiven from any want of efficacy in the atonement of Christ, but the remains of a temporal punishment, proportionate to our transgressions, and serving as a remedy against future relapses, are frequently left on us, to be cancelled by works of penance, as a check to prevent us from again falling, and as a satisfaction or atonement.—*Catholic Belief.*

FROM this we see, whilst the God man, Jesus Christ, with all his infinite perfection of merit, could not possibly do for ourselves. He has not the merit enough to put away our sins from us, there still remains a certain satisfaction, which for the sins and offences we have offered to God. God cannot do, and yet we, poor sinful, mortal men must do for ourselves!

So essential, so indispensable indeed, is penance to salvation in the Catholic system, that even the dying thief, whom the Lord Jesus himself pardoned at the cross—even he is taken up by the Catholic Church and is made to "do penance." Says she, "in the spirit of penance, suffered the breaking of his limbs, as penalties justly due to his sins; and it may be that it was the first time that he repented and received pardon of his sins."—*Cath. Bel.*

WELL, then, when the guilt of sin, and the everlasting punishment due to it, are freely forgiven, if there still remains a debt to be paid by the sinner, then is not the sinner's justification, his salvation, incomplete?—Most assuredly it is so. And as this debt is to be paid in punishment proportionate to the transgressions, and the sinner himself upon himself, then is it not evident that the justification, the salvation, of the sinner, in the last analysis, is accomplished only by himself? Not by punishing himself, and therefore by force—force exerted upon himself by himself to save himself. This is not the salvation provided by Jesus Christ. The salvation provided by Jesus Christ is wholly of the Lord, not of self. The salvation provided by the Catholic Church is wholly of self and not of the Lord, except wholly that God may appear wholly.

BUT not only is this self-inflicted punishment required. When a person has committed, it is to "act as a check to prevent us from again falling into sin." And as I am to punish myself, to keep myself from sinning, this means that I am saving myself from myself; again it is by force. It is saving myself, against myself, from myself; by punishing himself, and therefore by force—force exerted upon himself by himself to save himself from himself. Thus completely is it demonstrated that the salvation provided by the Catholic Church is "salvation" not of grace, not by faith, but of works, by force; not through faith but through penance.

So far however the application of this way of salvation is only to his own self. It extends also, however, to all others—to those to whom he may and whom he may force to "do penance." He professes to have the power; it is the identical power. With it he presumes to pronounce and to determine about who are not here, and who are here—those who are in "purgatory." He prescribes and defines what is required for them, and thus in the last analysis it is perfectly logical, and as the "*force* of penance" is the principle of it, he naturally strengthens the resolution of punishment, and has yet recourse to the greatest force of all—civil force—force by aid of "the help of the law and State authority." Thus, in this last final analysis also, it is in force inflicting the due amount of punishment that penance is "to act as a check to prevent us from again falling into sin." This is not only the logic of the case but it is the plain, historical fact; and that fact Leo XIII only a little more than a hundred days ago commended to the world for the world's instruction, that—

> The Church has ever been accustomed and is now determined to do her utmost to prevent the dreadful consequences of such errors; and she perseveres with all the strength at her command, in the manners and degree, to the help of the law and State authority.

Thus it is demonstrated that it is "force to direct" "the life and conduct of" men that is the "salvation" of the Papacy. "The Catholic Church," says Leo XIII, "will not voluntarily conform to those principles which we have tried to set before them, prescribes a part of the 'civil' law with all the penal sanction attached to it. ... The fear of temporal punishment" may only "act as a check to prevent the people from falling into sin." And so she has "recourse to the help of the law of the State authority;" in short by her law she prescribes the life and conduct of men into the mold of the standard of the Papacy. And still it is all of force only, and but the salvation of the Papacy. It is but the penance which is in itself only force.

Now of the way of salvation—that without penance the system is even, in the church's own language, an empty shell. So clearly connected, indeed, is penance with justification, you so essential is penance to salvation, that Cardinal Gibbons, in his book, "The Faith of Our Fathers," in discussing "The Sacraments of Penance," takes it all under "penance" as a part of "justification."—See pp. 291-298, 411, etc. And such other Catholic authorities as Scripture reads, "Do penance," where the Protestant version reads, "Repent." It is therefore in order in this place to inquire, What is that doctrine, that "sacrament of penance?" In answer, we quote from a "Catholic" source. "Catholic Belief of a Short and Simple Exposition of Catholic Doctrine. By the Very Rev. Joseph Faa di Bruno, D.D. Fifteenth Thousand edition, edited by Rev. Louis A. Lambert, author of 'Notes on Ingersoll,' etc." Imprimatur, John, Cardinal McCloskey, Archbishop of New York; Nihil obstat, R. Bren, Censor Deputatus; and also by Franciscus Edwards, Card. Archiep. Westmonast. Bishop of Brooklyn, priest of the Holy Apostolic See." It is stated thus:—

And such has been her course from the first day that she ever succeeded in gaining the help of the law and State authority. This is what Constantine did when he turned his alliance to bring by force to the Servants, and so to render them fit subjects of the kingdom of God. Come then to the Catholic Church. The great Neander, who could not for the world cite one or two from the history of that time, testifies that he has done the most precious of these great illustrations.

Eusebius, the favorite bishop of the court, in his panegyrical style speaks of all that scheme of securing to the church the help of the law and State authority, has told us not only what the object of it was but what it has thereby accomplished. In speaking of Constantine's great plan, benefited by the great generation, he says—

> Thus penance of sin (inverse Christ) orders and determines about those who are in consistency with the Father's will. Even in our institutions are written the true words of life and character and matters making of true religion.

Such was the object. Now as to how it accomplished the object: "It brought about . . . by persecuting to the very suffering of those who were followers of the heresy."

———

WHEN Cardinal Manning hastened to the Vatican, besought now, by this greatest statesman of the time, to direct him, he said: Everybody is against her; yet she is master, and in every issue of the day she deals with the powers of this world with authority, yet she can go amongst them masters; there was a time when the States, your destinies are inexplicably linked with the power of Rome; Rome bides her time; she bides her time; bear with your persecutions; cross, ye give warning to the peoples of the earth—be advised. Whether assembled, that you or dispersed in your State assemblies; whether in the Cabinet of your nation or laid to rest in the holding of your place of power—remember the word: not in public assemblies only, but in any private house or place whatever.

Now for the other side. All the world knows that the religion of the Catholic Church is by far her better course of exalting the Catholic Church to the "help of the law and State authority" in the maintenance and extension of the truth. In any case, the delusion, the deception of those days could not stand before the logic of the facts. The men brought before the inquisitors and were horked and cast before them that they might give an account; others deserving of that punishment were arraigned, and had penalties laid upon them. Rome brought, from all irregularity and error to every mind and every household and every community of the state, order and harmony; these that certainly may be applied to them; and the law and right authority directed; may we set before you most soberly and sincerely at the end of your superstitious meetings; I must all the religious people of this land, and I must the Christian people and the better influences that may belong to heaven, or Catholic Church, thus at the end of this era, after all, is not the Catholic Church, that never has surrendered, nor fails, whatever be left for any future of this country; but you who know her—she owns them—at the last also, you are against in any public or private place. Let us reason together.

Thus the very first fruit of her original design; and by giving to the religious authority only the further, and the more extended authority by her, that same old way of salvation provided by her.

And right there was the very point at which the Catholic Church proved to the heathen men under what. God's truth was met by the sign of the way of salvation provided by her. Right there she by "the help of the law and State authority" substituted her own Sunday for the Sabbath of the Lord, set up this sign of her power into salvation instead of the Sabbath of the Lord which he has set as the sign by which men may know his power to create and to save. "These have *one* mind."

> All things whatsoever that it was duty to do on the Sabbath, those we have transferred to the Lord's day.

And again, referring to what "Christ" accomplished in Constantinian Sunday legislation, which was enacted to please "the church," he makes boasting that—

> The conversion and the diversion of the commercial interests of this mighty globe to the furtherance of the aims of the Catholic Church is a festival, not indeed for the purporting of the cause of God, but for the cause of the Church.

THOROUGHLY it is apparent how and why the Church substituted for the Sabbath of the Lord and with the sign and the power of the Catholic Church to save, was set in the place of the sign by which men may know the power of Jesus Christ to create and to save. And that this was done is it upon every count that the Sunday institution is the way of salvation by force only, whilst the Sabbath of the Lord is the sign of salvation by the grace of God through the power of Jesus Christ through the benign operations of his Spirit.

NOW, which of these two ways did the Governments of the world and the United States take? Did they have every man free on the Sabbath question to choose for himself the way of salvation, and the sign of it? Or did they, by "the help of the law and State authority," go into the way of salvation by force, and set up the Sunday institution, the sign of salvation by force, in the place of the Sabbath of the Lord, the sign of salvation by the love and grace of Jesus Christ? Did they set up everywhere the sign of the salvation provided by the Catholic Church—the sign of the salvation of the Catholic Church—as though they would proclaim to all the nations that they are of Rome. And now how certainly this is so, the same church teaches us when, by force, of threats, had required Congress to set up the sign of salvation by force, elevated to all the world by loud sins, even by Bulgers, to the aid of the Government and the Church to enforce, at the point of the bayonet, the proper observance of, and respect for, the sign of the salvation provided by the Catholic Church, for all men and for all the rights. Right worldly indeed have they vindicated her claim. "The sign" of the papal salvation, the sign of salvation by force.

LET them wear it as they have chosen; but, oh! will the people of the United States continue to wear it? shall they be presumed to force it? Will the people of the United States tamely submit to the wearing of the badge of papal authority and of papal salvation, whilst, by apostate Protestantism, has been forced upon them? Choose ye this day whom you will serve. Will you honor God, or honor the Papacy? in the place of God? Will you keep the sign of the Creator of the heavens and of heaven and earth and the Saviour of the world—or the sign of the predicted man of sin—the mystery of iniquity—the Papacy? Will you keep the Sabbath of the Lord, or the Sunday of the Catholic Church?
