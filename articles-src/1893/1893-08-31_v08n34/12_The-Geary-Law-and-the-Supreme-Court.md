It is announced that the Supreme Court is to grant a re-hearing on the Geary law. As one of the five justices who sustained the law has since died, it is thought that the court may reverse itself and declare the law unconstitutional.

ASIDE from the merits of this law from a purely civil and politic standpoint, it ought not to be difficult for the court of last resort to decide against the act if it would only adopt the same course of reasoning pursued in the case of the Rector and Vestry of Trinity Church vs. the United States.

IN the decision of Feb. 29, 1892, in the case just referred to, the Supreme Court held that Congress could not exclude clergymen because this is a Christian Nation. If that reason is proved in the one case it ought to be also in the other. Nobody can defend the anti-Chinese law from a Christian point of view, and the "Christian sentiment of the country" is clearly against it. The attorneys for the Six Companies ought to lead the justices around to their side of the Chinese question, and ask them to adjust their Church and State goggles and look the Geary act over again.
