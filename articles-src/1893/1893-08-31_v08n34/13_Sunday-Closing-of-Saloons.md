THE *Sabbath Recorder* (Seventh-day Baptist) thinks that it might be right under "certain conditions" to make a law shutting up dramshops on the first day of the week, but says "in our own experience and observation, however, the conditions never appear. The situation is an imaginary one rather than real. If the saloons can be closed on Sunday, they can be closed all of the time. It is difficult to conceive of a man who should want liquor on all other days of the week but not on Sunday. Sunday-closing is a half way measure; but it can be attained no more quickly than the 'whole loaf.'" Leaving God out of account is a factor of religion legislation. We are forced to the conclusion that many good men have not enough faith in truth to its better sense a cause or a prohibition in this belief.
