The Christian Statesman does not spare its lurid rhetoric in denouncing the World's Fair officials for their part in Sunday opening, but it is compelled to acknowledge that Christians, in their organized capacity, as well as in individual cases, set the example which the Chicago directors have followed. In its issue for July 8, 1893, the Statesman said:—

> We frequently hear of a minister going to the pulpit from a Sunday train. Why not prelude the sermon with theft or adultery, or murder, the commands against which are in the same code and much briefer than the Sabbath law? We will be glad to give evangelical ministers who use Sunday trains, half a column each to explain, over their own signatures, if they dare, how they harmonize a ride on a Sunday train with either the Old Testament law of the Sabbath, or the New Testament spirit of the Lord's day. Most preachers who use Sunday trains explain that they do so only in emergencies? But do they steal in emergencies? No man can do as much good by a sermon as he can do harm by going to it, or from it, on a Sunday train. The excuses made do not satisfy other people, nor the offender himself.

> At this season of the year there is special danger that churches that have protested against a large Sunday picnic at Chicago, will advertise their inconsistency by holding small ones in camp-meetings and assemblies. The mother Chautauqua keeps the Sabbath and most of her children, but at Sedalia, if newspaper reports are correct, one of the Sunday-school assemblies, on the 25th of June, opened its gates with an admittance fee, and a preacher—just like the World's Fair, to that extent—and no doubt in the fact that Sunday pleasuring followed the sermon. We are glad the pastors of Sedalia set themselves against this attempt to sanctify the Sunday show business, and we hope that if any other assembly or camp-meeting brings such a scandal on Christianity, its officers will be called to account in the church or in the courts. It is one of the strange things that, while a man who steals a dollar is "churched," a man who steals time from God and man is not even reproved. A greater peril to the Sabbath even than Sunday-opening at Chicago, is the widespread Sabbath-breaking of Christians. It is this Achan that causes our defeats and delays our victory.

Undoubtedly these Sunday-breaking preachers would answer the Statesman as they do the Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, when it presses the claims of the Sabbath, by saying that the "Old Testament law" has nothing to do with Sunday, and that there is no command in the New Testament to regard Sunday. Should they do this their pics would be half true, which is more than can be said of the words of the Statesman while it asserts that the fourth commandment requires men to keep Sunday holy, and that the preacher who rides on a Sunday train is as wicked as he would be if he committed a theft before going to the pulpit. The mock piety of the Statesman has no foundation.

Nevertheless it is true that the danger to Sunday, and to all Sabbathism, and all confidence in the Bible, is far greater because of the false and inconsistent position of Christians than it is from "Sunday opening." But the "Achan" lies further back. He does not dwell wholly in Chicago. The stealing began when pagan influences drove the Sabbath out of the Christian Church and put Sunday and many other holidays in its place. The wicked theft was continued when Puritanism stole the name of the Sabbath and sought to make Sunday sacred by pasting the sacred name thereon. The Statesman keeps up that theft and indulges in many prevarications to make the theft appear honest. There is the real trouble. The days of ignorance on these points are passed and God cannot be cheated by the thin gulses the Statesman weaves. Hence defeat follows defeat, and Congress, the Congress of a "great Christian Nation," cannot save Sunday from ignominy. The Statesman is doing excellent work in undermining and ruining the Christian Church by its false claims concerning Sunday and the false accusations against the Sabbath. Go on if you will. Plenty of defeats await you, they lie in ambush all along the path you have chosen. How many must you suffer before you will cease fighting God and truth?
