THE new President of the American Sabbath Union, Rev. Geo. S. Mott, has a series of articles running through The Soldier, a South Carolina paper, in which he says of a divine command for Sunday observance:

> We admit there is no such command. But if we are to be limited by such a demand, all of us shall soon find ourselves in a very entangling predicament. Let us point to one as an illustration. Polygamy is an institution recognized in the Old Testament. Its conditions were provided for by divine enactment. Now polygamy is utterly prohibited by the Church, and it is a crime punished by the State. Yet there is no positive divine command recalling that permission of polygamy which was granted in the Old Testament. The Mormon can intrench himself behind the same breastwork of argument, as that put up by the Seventh-day Adventists. He can triumphantly demand the text of Scripture which repeals polygamy.

And everybody else can just as emphatically demand the text of scripture which ever commanded polygamy. It is true that polygamy was permitted under the Theocracy, but it never was commanded as a moral duty. If polygamy had ever been as plainly commanded as is the observance of the seventh day, or commanded at all, then might men reasonably demand as plain a repeal, but as it was only permitted like divorce, "because of the hardness of your hearts," neither Mormons or any other National Reformers ought to insist that it stands on a par with the Sabbath of the Lord.
