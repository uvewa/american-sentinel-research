Chicago, Aug. 11.

The proceedings of the various branches of the World's Congress Auxiliary, in session at the Art Institute, the past week, have been interesting and suggestive. The different branches of the Congress of the Department of Government, in session this week, have been: The Department Congress of the National American Women Suffrage Association, the Congress on Jurisprudence and Law Reform, the General Congress of Suffrage, in Republic, Kingdom, and Empire, the Civil Service Reform Congress, and the City Government Congress. It probably was not intended that any particular branch of the general subject of suffrage and ballot reform should monopolize the attention of the congress during the week, but nevertheless, the fact has been, that the woman's suffrage question has overshadowed all else in interest, enthusiasm, and occupancy of attention.

As in previous subjects in which women have been interested, in the different congresses which have assembled here, much greater enthusiasm has been shown in the organization of the congress and in the bringing forward of papers, presentation of speakers, and the general working up of interest, attendance, and the filling of time by speakers who are known to their constituency, and able to command their attention.

In the opening address of welcome, William Dudley Foulke, on behalf of the committee, said, among other things:—

> The subject which will arouse the greatest interest in this congress is that of woman suffrage. It used to be said that women did not care for the right of ballot, but no one who was present at the congress last May and saw hundreds of women assembled and displaying the utmost eagerness in the women's movement will fail to see that the time is approaching when women will take an equal part with men in the affairs of government. Women will bring some inconveniences into our politics, but they will bring, on the other hand, an overwhelming wealth of public spirit, far greater than men present at this moment. Their unselfish interest in public questions will be of great value.

In the World's Congress on Jurisprudence and Law Reform, a paper from Judge Thomas M. Cooley was read, on the administration of civil justice, which was a philosophic discussion upon the civil law of this country and its derivation. Another paper from David Dudley Field, Justice of the United States Court, was also read at length in the course of which Justice Field said:—

> In the category of individual rights I conceive that the greatest achievement ever made in the cause of human society is the total and final separation of the State from the Church. If we had nothing else to boast of, we of this country made it an article of organic law that the relations between man and his Maker was a private concern into which other men had no right to intrude. To measure the stride this made for the emancipation of the race, we have only to look back over the centuries that have gone before us and recall the dreadful persecutions in the name of religion which have filled the world with horror. Think of Torquemada in Spain; the martyrs suffering at the stake or in prisons in many other lands; the exiles driven from France by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; and the slaughtered saints whose bones lay scattered on the Alpine Mountains. Amid all our shortcomings it will remain forever to the glory of the States that they allow no man to step between his fellow-man and his Maker. Clouds of darkness do indeed often seem to cover the land, but there is one rift in the clouds through which, to the mind's eye at least, the daylight will shine as long as the world lasts. This Nation may be torn into fragments, or other nations and races may occupy the land in some city for away, but the fact will still remain that there was a Nation of free men on this continent which first rent the shackles that priestly domination had been forging for centuries and solemnly decreed that no man should dare intercept the radiance of the Almighty upon the human soul.

In the face of the religious laws in the statute books; in the face of the enforcement of those laws in many States in the Union; in the face of the marvelously organized effort to secure the complete enforcement of these laws and the increased severity of the laws themselves; in the face of the strange and unexampled contest over the religious question of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair as it has made itself public through the proceedings of Congress, and courts, and the public press; in the face of a remarkable religious opinion delivered in a well-known case from the supreme bench itself; in the face of the fact that a portion of this very congress of the week, in which Justice Field's paper was read, has been occupied by a consideration from its secretary and others, of the extra-judicial work of the International Law and Order League and other "voluntary organizations to aid the constituted authorities in the enforcement of the laws;" in the face of all this and very much more that might be enumerated, what a pitiful thing it is that a member of the bar of the United States, as high in place and authority as Judge Field, should be so blind to the cloud of intolerance with which this land is already covered, and through which there is no rift to let the daylight, and complete liberty in civil and religious affairs, shine again as long as the world lasts.
