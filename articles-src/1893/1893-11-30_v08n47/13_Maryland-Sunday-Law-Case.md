In the case of Geo. W. Marvel/Cravell, of Stanley labor and committed to jail, at Centreville, Maryland, the fine and costs, amounting to about twenty-six dollars, have been paid by Samuel Marvel, the son, who was just then producing witnesses and the constable who made the arrest. The failure has been by this means rescued from imprisonment. Isaac Baker of Maryland born remains in confinement.
