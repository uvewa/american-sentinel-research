The United Presbyterian remarks that "the Faribault compromise on the school question worked fairly well as long as the schools remained in fact Catholic, but when the directors elected two Protestant teachers, the Catholic priest announced to the board that the agreement was at an end. So Rome ordered." And so Rome always has ordered when such "compromises" have served her purpose.
