The event of the season in National Reform circles was the convention held in the First United Presbyterian Church, Allegheny, Pa., November 14, 15, and 16. As stated last week, this was the largest and most enthusiastic meeting of the kind ever held in this country, or in any country, since the palmiest days of the Papacy, when so-called Christianity was the supreme law of the Roman world,—as National Reformers demand that it shall be of the United States,—and the State promptly laid its hand upon any religion that did not conform to it, as these same pseudo-reformers demand shall be done also in this country.

The programme was elaborate and almost every phase of National Reform work was discussed. The subjects of the papers and addresses were:—

The Broad Basis of National Reform, Qualities of the Christian Reformer, You Can't Make Men Moral by Law, Practical Aims of the Convention, Moral Problems in National Life, The Law of the Lord of the Sabbath Paramount in the Nation, The Kingship of Christ, The Sunday Newspaper, Our Divorce Laws and the Law of Christ, The Chinese Exclusion Law and the Law of Christ, Our Danger from Infidelity and How to Meet It, The Drink Traffic, The Labor Problem, The Moral Character and Accountability of the Nation, The Ultimate Source of National Authority, The Place of the Bible in National Legislation, The Relation of the Nation to Christ, Constitutional Expression of Fundamental Moral Principles, Public Education and the Christian Religion, Railroad Men and Sunday Work, Christian Reform or National Ruin,—Which?

Nearly all the papers were able, some masterly; but a single question raised, innocently enough, by one speaker revealed the innate weakness of the whole movement, namely, "If God is the Ruler who are his executors?" The answer was, "We, the people." It is equally true that in their scheme, "we, the people" are also the interpreters of the will of God. And "we, the people" are simply the dominant party.

In treating the subject, "You Can't Make Men Moral by Law," President Scovel of Wooster University, Ohio, denied the proposition in toto, and affirmed most emphatically that law is the very agency by which men are made moral. This is unquestionably true of the moral law, the law of God, for the Psalmist declares, "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul;" but it is not true of human law. But in treating the subject President Scovel made no distinction between human and divine law, and practically affirmed divinity of all law, whether human or divine. This was the weak spot in his otherwise able paper.

"The Kingship of Christ" was treated by Rev. W. F. Crafts, who showed how in all the Scriptures "the kingship and saviourship of Christ are linked together." But he forgot to mention, or did not know, that while the kingship and saviourship are frequently mentioned in close connection the two offices do not in fact run contemporaneously. It is when Christ comes again that he comes "King of kings and Lord of lords." Christ is now "a priest upon his Father's throne." At the close of his priestly work Dan. 7:13, 14 and Ps. 2:7-9 will be fulfilled; but those who now insist upon the kingship of Christ, in the National Reform sense, are merely following in the footsteps of those who anciently would have taken Jesus by force to make him king; and like them they practically deny him.

But notwithstanding the sophistries of National Reform and the structural weakness of the system, the movement is gathering force, and in connection with various other so-called reform organizations the National Reform Association is destined to do a good deal of practical work in the near future. It is true that the Supreme Court decision of Feb. 29, 1892, renders unnecessary the amendment which the association has long demanded, but National Reformers are not satisfied and are still demanding "the embodiment in our fundamental law of a suitable acknowledgement of God as the ultimate source of national authority, of the Bible as the supreme rule of moral legislation, and of Christ as the Nation's Sovereign, Lord and King." Not all the energies of the association are however to be devoted to the securing of this amendment. A lobby is to be established in Washington "to press at every opportune time, in cooperation with agents of other kindred reform organizations, any such bill or bills as may be before Congress in defense of our public schools, for the investigation or suppression of the drink traffic, or for divorce or any other Christian reform; that the committee labor as far as possible for the enactment of a national Sabbath law, and for the promotion of such an amendment to the national Constitution as will justify beyond all peradventure the declaration of our Supreme Court that 'this is a Christian Nation.'"

That much will erelong be accomplished by the National Reformers can scarcely be doubted by those who have watched the trend of recent events. They have learned that they hold Congress in their hands, and they will not hesitate to use their power. Petitions, letters, and telegrams will be showered upon congressmen until they will be made to believe that the people demand various and far-reaching measures of religious legislation. And now that the precedent has been established by the World's Fair legislation, Congress can scarcely do otherwise than grant whatever the churches ask.

But really it makes little difference what legislation is had henceforth, or whether a religious amendment shall be secured or not; the union of Church and State has already been effected. The evil principle has been recognized by the three branches of the Government, and whatever may be done hereafter will be only the logical outcome of what has been already done. The National Reformers of the various schools, embracing all the various so-called reform associations that have lent their influence to the furtherance of National Reform principles, have already subverted our free institutions; they have established a veritable image to the Papacy. It is there, though scarcely discerned by many; and, like the shadow on the sensitive plate, only needs to be developed to be seen by all; and also like the photographer's negative it must be developed in a dark room. The clear sunlight of truth would ruin it, hence the seductive hues in which it is colored. The time long since foretold by a prominent National Reformer has come. Politicians are tumbling over one another to secure front seats in the pseudo-reform car, and the careless masses cheer them on, caring nothing for the consequences, many of them indeed thinking that they are doing God service. But in fact National Reform is only making void the law of God by the traditions of men.
