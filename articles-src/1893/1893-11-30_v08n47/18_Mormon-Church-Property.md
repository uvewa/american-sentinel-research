A large amount of Mormon Church property confiscated some time since has been returned to the church through the joint action of Congress and the Supreme Court of Utah. The *Sun* of this city, remarks that "this is an act of justice, and yet the seizure of the property was not unjust." The reason for this remarkably statement is that given by the *Sun* itself, namely:—

> Such made was upon the Government, and as a matter of prudence it had to be made. In the past they have been both peaceful and compliant citizens, and the same force of popular opinion which compelled the Government to act now properly pending against them. Mormonism have been converted to monogamy and republicanism. It is not a polite enemy, as it was forty years ago.

This is a very different statement of the case from that made to the courts at the time of the confiscation. The reason then assigned for the seizure was that the Mormon Church had accumulated property far in excess of its charter limit. If this was not the true reason, but the property was in fact taken merely upon a pretext for the purpose of punishing the whole Mormon Church for the acts of individual members, has not a dangerous precedent been established? As we have served time shows in those columns, the Government property prohibits polygamy, because it is an invasion of natural rights, but to undertake to change the policy of a church by confiscation of its property is, as it strikes up, unjust on either thing.
