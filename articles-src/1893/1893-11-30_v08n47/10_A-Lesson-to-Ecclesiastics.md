**THE NEW YORK Examiner,** of Nov. 23, has among its editorial paragraphs this lesson for ecclesiastics:—

> The Roman Catholic clergy of the Province of Quebec are much chagrined by a discovery they have just made, namely, that priests are subject to the civil law, like other mortals. The archbishop of Quebec put certain publications under the ban and ordered all good Catholics to refrain from reading them, because they had spoken plain words about the scandalous conduct of an ecclesiastic. An action for damages to the amount of fifty thousand dollars was brought by the publishers, and there is an excellent prospect that this ecclesiastical boycotter will be compelled to pay handsomely for his indiscretion. The idea that an ecclesiastic can ruin a legitimate business by a word, and be responsible to nobody for speaking it, may be very pleasing to those who have been in the habit of tyrannizing thus over the community, but it is quite intolerable to every one else. Catholics, who have breathed the free air of America, are as little inclined as Protestants to submit to the despotism of priests in matters not spiritual.

The thought which inspired this paragraph is commendable; the inferences from it lead to just and sound conclusions. But will the Examiner accept all the conclusions? Grant that ecclesiastic interference to ruin legitimate business, exercised by Roman Catholics in the Province of Quebec, is a "despotism of priests in matters not spiritual" to which no man should submit, then would similar interference in the United States be any different? And would it change the principle any if the ecclesiastics in question were Protestant rather than Roman Catholic?

Is there any reason why an ecclesiastical boycotter of one denomination in Canada should be condemned, and many ecclesiastical boycotters of another denomination in the United States be commended? What is the religious legerdemain which can make that which is tyrannous and despotic, in the Province of Quebec, a most cherished and freely exercised prerogative of the Christian Church in the United States?

The boycott is tyranny. It is no less tyrannous when instigated by a Protestant minister, in the United States, than when ordered by a Catholic priest in a province subject to the English crown. Who is willing to deny so plain a proposition? And if it cannot be denied, to what legitimate conclusions must it lead? Must not the inevitable conclusion be that it was an exercise of ministerial despotism, when the Protestant clergy of this country threatened congressmen with the ban of their religious and political displeasure, if Congress should not pass a measure to close the World's Fair on Sunday? Can the conviction be avoided that the attempts which ecclesiastics of this country have made to ruin the business of the World's Fair, and of corporations, and of individuals, by their words, and be responsible to nobody for speaking them, is pleasing only to those who are in the habit of tyrannizing thus over the community, but quite intolerable to every one else?

What is the particular odor of unsanctity which attaches to a Roman Catholic boycott, from which a Protestant boycott is free? Is "Protestant" such a name to conjure with that merely prefixing it in the place of "Roman Catholic" should make the boycott smell as sweet incense to heaven? There is no such virtue in names. No prefixing of any denominational name can make the boycott anything else than tyrannous and wicked.
