On Sunday, Nov. 19, over eighty arrests were made in Philadelphia for violation of the Sunday liquor law. The warrants were sworn out by agents of the Law and Order Society, who had personally secured evidence. This is supposed to be real reform, but its practicality is only equalled by its futility. The liquor business should be suppressed on all days, but not on the purpose of such arrests as these. Such arrests as these are not made with the intent to reform or suppress the liquor traffic, but to vindicate the right of civil officers to enforce an ordinance of municipal police.
