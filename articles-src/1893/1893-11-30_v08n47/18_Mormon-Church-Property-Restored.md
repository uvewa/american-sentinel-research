A large amount of Mormon Church property confiscated some time since has been restored to the church through the joint action of Congress and the Supreme Court of Utah. The Sun of this city, remarks that "this is an act of justice, and yet the seizure of the property was not unjust." The reason for this paradoxical statement is thus given by the Sun:—

> When it was seized, the Mormons, who had previously made war upon the Government, stood in an attitude of defiance toward it, while for years past they have been both peaceful and completely submissive to the laws of the country. They have not now any grievance, and there is not any complaint pending against them. Mormonism has ceased to be law defying. It has undergone other changes. It is not a public enemy, as it was forty years ago.

This is a very different statement of the case from that made to the courts at the time of the confiscation. The reason assigned then for the seizure was that the Mormon Church had accumulated property far in excess of its charter limit. If this was not the true reason, but the property was in fact taken merely upon a pretext for the purpose of punishing the whole Mormon Church for the acts of individual members, has not a dangerous precedent been established? As we have several times shown in these columns, the Government properly prohibits polygamy, because it is an invasion of natural rights, but to undertake to change the policy of a church by confiscation of its property is, it strikes us, quite another thing.
