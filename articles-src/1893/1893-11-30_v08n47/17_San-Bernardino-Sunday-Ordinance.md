The piecemeal conquest of California by the Sunday legislationists still goes on. The latest place to surrender is San Bernardino. A news item says:—

> On Sunday, November 5, the ordinance closing all stores, save bakeries, drug stores and news stands, in San Bernardino, Cal., because operative, and the city took on the appearance of a quiet, modern town of rest. Thus about the last vestige of the mining camp and frontier town has been legislated out of existence, and San Bernardino will no longer be spoken of as "the place to go to spend Sunday if you want to have a lively time."

When a large proportion of the municipalities within the State are furnished with a full complement of Sunday ordinances, then it will be a comparatively simple matter to secure the passage of Sunday statutes by the legislature.
