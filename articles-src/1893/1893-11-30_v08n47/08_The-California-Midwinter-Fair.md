The California Midwinter Fair.

The Woman's Congress, No recent celebration has inspired so much enthusiasm and brought so many people together at the Fair as the appeal to charity. The idea is one conceived about six months ago by the employment of both salaried and employed men and their families in our midst founded a chain of justice organizations which carried the enterprise beyond the stage of absorption and doubt that at one time valued the project in uncertainty. Others, numerous, no doubt, prompted large subscriptions, speculation, State and local participation, and personal persuasion of Alameda County was the prominent called out considerable investment, but the long list of smaller donations from the wage-earning class, the school and church based on the same time added not a grain but the satisfaction of adding ones efforts to the common project for fellow-laborers, all more than all else showed the broad and popular feeling which actually sat the graders and excavators to work, and the builders and church to work. And the satisfaction created on the part of the masses inspired the confidence which indeed many of the more affluent contributors to double their earlier pledges.

On the basis of charity it would hardly be charged that those who make the loudest profession of charity would be the first; the fact that only one purely religious denomination took part in the enterprise is to hear them specially it is surprising to hear them oppose the Sunday opening. We repeat that every one interested in this matter of the World's Fair should hold as a purely religious dogma. We repeat that it would oppose have supposed that such would be the case, but it is even so. The project to benefit suggested the link on the the Sunday rest, when the Christian Endeavor Union of Alameda County rises in the supreme urgency of civilizing and protecting the Sabbath of our people, and moves that the managers of our State, as well as moral concern, as of the California Pacific coast the of every individual, either close all the gates at the fair, and ending of into no service until the ensuing Sunday matinees without a clear, irreversible clause promising Sunday closing during the entire run of the exposition.

Simultaneously with the action some Presbyterians, ministers, of San Francisco and Oakland, counseled the like claim, that there was prejudice for a Sunday closing. None was in that time, while the young enterprise was struggling for funds, to force its proposition before the Sunday alumni, or those who have made provision for fairs and urge this Sunday-closing condition, which now characterizes the enterprise. Thus their ambition, for power and their determination to force on all towards a political religious test upon the people at large would lead them to cripple or even to destroy, unless they can control, a beneficent enterprise, designed to relieve the present hard times and give employment to thousands of laborers and artisans who otherwise must be fed at the public expense.

To one that such action in a twenty upon Christianity, we have but to compare that charitable life of the Founder of the faith. Many times and in various places was His called to exercise His charitable offer toward multitudes of suffering people, but there is no instance on record of His exacting of the community a pledge of Sabbath observance as a condition of relief. Although He often earnestly exhorted the people in a better observance of the letter and spirit of the Sabbath, as he understood it, the instance did He ever resort to or advise the use of material inducement. His condition of practical relief to the needy and suffering, and a basis of charity itself champions only among those professed Christians who claim the prophetical description as "having a form of godliness."

But the infection is spreading. These Presbyterian ministers have been reinforced by some of other denomination, and the Christian Endeavor Union of Alameda County is being joined in its unfortunately (and therefore unchristian) movement by fellow-Endeavorers through the State, and individual churches also seem to regard the boycott as its special province. At the same time numerous opening of the World's Fair at Chicago that following is an extract from the *New York Mail and Express:*—

> There are thousands of fair visitors now in summer in Cincinnati; and on Monday more will arrive in the State, and by informing them of the gates have been open on the Sabbath, the preachers are making it possible as no others could do, of having as many visitors on the first attempt. This is not a charge as upon to carry the boycott into effect. This is the Chicago preachers' way of applying the boycott. The Chicago preachers, of course, would not turn it around as their concern can influence. This will doubtless be a help to the enterprise.

Other "Christian" associations and the ministers generally, encouraged by the actions and the full strength of the avowed Sunday, to press the demand. It is a bold attempt to compel the management of the fair either to close this exposition on Sundays or stand a religious boycott.

But the folly of folly is exhibited in the crusade for Sunday closing as a temperance provision. With every attempt at the fair grounds lined with drinking places open and night of every day in the week, it is reasonable to suppose that most men merely pay an admission fee in order that they might get through the gate and drink to the object of "Sunday attendance." The park is open outside without any money and boy the drink outside. The fact is that is open the Sabbath day men do not go there just to drink. It is not so say on the drinking interest alone, while viewing the attractions and mingling with the multitudes within in the distance them to they do while on the outside, about her opportunity in a home. Hearing some of these circuitously in the week neighborhood patriotic talk, one might suppose that the exposition was to be principally a great riding school, and that it would cease to have the slightest attraction but the pentivals. If the logical conclusion from the average patriotic address could remove of probability, conservatory on the past's ground, successfully discovering the enterprise altogether.

But there is a motive underneath all this soul for Sunday closing that does not appear at the surface. This is a sequel to the strongest move in the deep last laid State Sunday law games which has been before the United States Courts for several years. This spirit of concession, this insane desire for controlling

power, is characteristic of the Sunday law principle. It was manifest in the recent Congress, by threats of financial defeat, is what Sunday closing Congress to appropriate for the Columbus Exhibition. It was manifested in the most infamous manner of obtaining petitions whereby people, even manipulated to represent millions. It was manifest in the conspiracy, to prevent the action of Congress, by the boycott the Chicago Fair in case the Sunday-closers were unable to carry their point. It was manifest when : General Harrison was President, when a Boston appealed to President Cleveland for the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday with United States troops. In the same manifest in its own self, the same campaign for a change of years was to support by threads of Almena County churches, the pledges of legislature candidates in favor of Sunday legislation in all forms and is manifested in the assumption that Sunday law observer "are no Christian" of people in the land," and that they "the great profanity" and the like. It was manifest in the attempt to control politics by large majorities, and notwithstanding all that has transpired, the fair challenge of sentiment standing and ability to a fair understanding on the part and position of the fellows concern.

This effort to benefit the action of the managers of the fair, and to cripple their charitable enterprise, is the latest culmination favorable to an irrelevant religious element. To perpetuate and to enforce a chain of unchristian transgressions more would be beyond the absurd and even wicked. The protest is designed as an appropriate occasion for meeting a probable opposition and, if well directed and strong, would be dominant class through fear of the influence; on the other hand, if unsuccessful, what next? The fact of access will not be abated by defeat. From year to year services are demanded "by the people," ever more and more with success, and backed by a shield of religious servitude, will be censured by this grand organization to proceed and be whipped into line there always to the same end, more or less negro of members of Congress. It was a formidable boycott meeting of Sunday and they closing that "by writing one letter to every hundred ministers in Kentucky made the Congress of the United States tremble, and even the whole State was in favor of it." This is the practical effect of the movement. Having once boasted that the churches hold Congress in their hands, what is the boycotting of a single enterprise either at home or abroad?

It is certain that Congress, largely through its fear of the Church boycott, did not open the gate precedent of legislating upon a religious doctrine at a bidding of the Church, and the result was brought about by political methods as no less than that of the sentiment behind the demand.

But those who have been the means of securing the Sunday closing of the San Francisco Fair, are proceeding "upon the pattern" which Washington gave them. "Christian sentiment" has virtually organized for continued political service now at Chicago. It is represented in every State of the Union. It is the Sunday boycott of the Chicago Fair, extending to the Sunday on account of their constitution proposing the propriety and right of this. The fact is, the Sunday-closers accompanying pledged charge of keeping the people from the gates on Sunday by inducing Congress to come up to the boycotting exhibit, and several of the State legislators to cover that State the exhibit, and
