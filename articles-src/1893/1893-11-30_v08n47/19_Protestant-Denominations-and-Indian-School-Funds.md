As shown in a reprinted paragraph, from the New York Independent, on another page, some Protestant denominations are very loath to give up the union with the State which they have secured in Government appropriations for their Indian schools. This is evidence, and it has been evident from the beginning, that the objections of the Protestant churches to Government appropriations for sectarian schools has not been because of opposition to State support of religion on principle, but because the Roman Catholic denomination was receiving the lion's share of the money. There seems to be no likelihood that the Catholic hand will be taken from the people's pocket, and so long as it remains there these Protestant denominations, being without conscientious scruples in the matter, see no reason why they should refuse a share in the spoils, though it be humiliatingly small. Rather than receive nothing the Protestant churches are willing to be the jackal herd which follows the successful beast of prey that they may feed upon the surplus left from its feasts.
