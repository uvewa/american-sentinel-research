To every night there comes the break of day. No matter how dense the gloom before the dawn, at the hour appointed the daylight comes. The beautified blending of the sunlight never fails. Every successive morning at the instant, and from the beginning, the sun appears. The current day, even-time, comes to-morrow comes the beauteous dawn. Promised sunshine and rain come to all. God's promises are more than prophecies of eternal fulfillment.

That earth shall receive the rain—promise is in the earth, and the earth receives the rain. This whole round earth, till its renewal, is in the great curse of sin. Here are established the seed and death of some of all men until the moment the righteous are caught up to meet Him in the air. This is—the will, the woe, the money of sin—the sad and tearful tragedy of,—the sin—the second death.

When this work of Satan is finished, and neither he, nor his evil angels, nor his wicked dead, will be anywhere any more forever. Then it will be—"The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand." All those thousands of years Satan has been upon the earth seeking whom he may devour,—has he been without success;—he has found and devoured many.

Shall this go on forever? Shall man be born here but to live out his few pains and sorrow and toil,—to sin and to die? Shall the earth continue forever to be a charnel house, and its surface the scene, through out infinite time, of the continuous re-enactment of the curse, while all created nature, man and beast, and the produce of the earth, and its own itself, suffer, and the whole world is full of war,—woe of man, and woe of beast, woe of plant, and woe of the very soil itself which brings forth sickness or imperfect fruits, or perhaps lies helpless in barren death?— prophetic of the time when, because of the breakings of the everlasting covenant, "therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate."

This will not go on forever. God is merciful, his promises are sure, and he has promised that in his mercy he will make an end. His very mercy, and the gracious light of his countenance, will be to the wicked a consuming fire, while to the righteous it is health "a sun and a shield." The first heaven and the first earth shall pass away,—there will be a new heaven and a new earth, perfectly beautiful, without a shadow of sin, or illness of death, or any rock evil thing. All created natures will be renewed in its Edenic beauty and perfection. God will fulfill his original purpose.

He that made the earth did not create it in vain. He made it to be inhabited,— to be the abode of his children,—and when it has become the heritage of the righteous and they "shall inherit forever," then will his original purpose be fulfilled. Then, and not till then, will that be restored which was lost to sin through sin. Christ will have purged it all through sin. Christ will then be King of all,—for the prince of this world into whose hands man had given himself and all his dominion, the earth, will have been vanquished and consigned to eternal death, with the extinction of all that is evil.

This is the glorious consummation. This is the end to be desired. To this the faithful have looked forward since the beginning. Not only man has desired this, but says the apostle, "We know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now, and not only they, but ourselves also, . . . we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body." If mankind and the whole creation have longed for this day, despite the tribulation and the terrors by sea and land, in the heavens and in the earth, which are to signal its approach, ought not these successions to be carefully noted and their progress toward completion pestilences, strange disaster, and wars and rumors of wars, are not wanting, but that which may be the last noted is the most significant and that is in the vast and complicated organization, taking in the whole civilized world, to secure the civil enforcement of certain religious observance which the theologians have decided are necessary to the maintenance of the religion itself.

For years this movement has been softly working underneath the surface and gradually, and unperceived, gaining ground and impulse. Such a system of organization has now been set on foot as never before has been known in the history of the world. Those who have protested this have but little comprehension of the completeness and vastness of that which they have accomplished, as they have no understanding of what will be its ultimate result. Some of the most earnest and deeply interested, and even active antagonists, organized ostensibly, and with no basis, to oppose one another, are yet unconscious factors in the accomplishment of a common end. The ambition of those religious activists insatiably. They look forward to bringing all men into their ranks or subjecting to their influence and authority all who refuse to be numbered with them. Their purposes are far-reaching indeed. Their purpose to capture heaven itself and the dominion for themselves against the earthly, while yet burdened with the curse, and with which they think to be millennial, bodes the magnitudes of the understanding of the continuation. The mystery of its iniquitous make it as having originated elsewhere fails in the human mind. The contemporary reasons birth of similar organizations in different parts of the world, without apparent collusion, and having in the end the same aim, is evidence that the general power, to which day all men are and must bend their energies, had its origin outside of the human mind.

If they should think of this, and realize it, no doubt they would take courage and fasten themselves still farther with the belief that they are ordained of God to a great work and are the ministers of his providence.

But no, they doing this will do it anyway. There is a difference as broad as the gap between eternal life and eternal death, which marks the path of the righteous who keep his commandments and do his will in his way,—and the broad road which they follow, who having given themselves to the furtherance of the great deception are unconscious, and yet zealous, advocates of evil in the last great controversy. By them will the wrath of man and beast be made to praise God. If this communication is soon to be reached, and it is now glowing toward the distant hour just before the day, shall not the watchman on the walls—"All is well, all is well"—shall he not announce that then God's sure promises are about to be redeemed, his blessed purpose fulfilled that they "arise and shine." W. H. M.
