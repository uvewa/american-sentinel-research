[THE following is a memorial of a Tennessee Seventh-day Adventist to the authorities, where the trial of Seventh-day Adventist observers is now in progress for Sunday labor.]

In behalf of the Seventh day Adventist I desire to present a respectful, but decided protest to the enforcement of the Sunday law making it a crime to do or clumsy labor on the first day of the week. Our position plainly stated is as follows:—

Sunday observance is based on a religious belief in the sacred character of that day. They recognize the fact is in itself conclusive; only a religious custom could find similar expression. No one can reasonably deny that any work which is necessary and commendable on six days of the week, are in themselves changed to done on another day. It is not the work done, but the day on which it is done, that makes it a violation of the law. That is the law is made in the interest of a day, rendered sacred by a portion of the people, and, therefore, it seeks to enforce that idea upon others. Whatever days that law is thereby compelled to acknowledge a religious institution and to pay homage contrary to his convictions concerning his own religion. This is to punish for the penalty or he must at least outwardly acknowledge that which is contrary to his faith. This is not only contrary to the inalienable right of every man to worship how and when he pleases, but it is opposed to the Constitution of the State and Nation of which we are citizens. Our claim is that work on any day except a recognized day shall be regarded differently from rest on that day which is the day of choice of religion. It might as well decide how men shall be baptized and in what form they shall support.

Seventh-day Adventists believe in and practice cheerful obedience to all civil authority, when it does not make compelling authority, when it does not relate to the worship of God. But Sunday laws have no other purpose than to secure rest on that day because the law makers consider it the Lord's day. Rome if it could be shown beyond question that the day appointed is the true Sabbath of the Bible, it still would be unjust and outside the jurisdiction of any earthly court to enforce it in favor of any religion as between God, the individual and his Maker.

Seventh-day Adventists absolutely object just the same to a law that should compel themselves, compelled, by the law to suffer fines and imprisonment, or strictly our consciences. We choose the former, but not to protest against the surrender of our rights. We stand on principle that it refuses to do us human liberty. It further refuses to obey the laws of men that interfere with the claims of God. We desire our fellow-men to know our reasons our protest and to be duly considered.
