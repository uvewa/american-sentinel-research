[The Centreville Record, published at Centreville, Md., where the late trials of Seventh-day Adventists for Sunday labor were had, prints the following in its issue of Nov. 18.]

In behalf of the Seventh-day Adventists, I desire to present a respectful, but decided protest to the enforcement of the Sunday laws making it a crime to do ordinary labor on the first day of the week. Our position briefly stated is as follows:

Sunday observance is based on a religious belief in the sacred character of that day. The law recognizes the fact in calling it the "Lord's day," "Sabbath," and similar expressions. No one can reasonably assert that acts of common labor necessary and commendable on six days of the week are in themselves criminal if done on another day. It is not the work done, but the day on which it is done, that makes it a violation of the law. Thus the law is made in the interest of a day considered sacred by a portion of the people, and, therefore, it seeks to enforce that idea upon others. Whoever obeys that law is thereby compelled to acknowledge a religious practice which may be directly contrary to his conscientious conviction. He must either disobey the law and suffer the penalty or he must at least outwardly conform to a religion in which he has no faith. This is not only contrary to the inalienable right of every man to worship how and when he pleases, but it is opposed to the Constitution of the State and Nation of which we are citizens. Our claim is that the State has no right to say that one day shall be regarded differently from others and so undertake to decide matters of religion. It might as well decide how men shall be baptized and which church they shall support.

Seventh-day Adventists believe in and practice cheerful obedience to all civil authority, when it does not relate to the worship of God. But Sunday laws have no other purpose than to secure rest on that day because the law makers consider it the Lord's day. Even if it could be shown beyond question that the day selected is the true Sabbath of the Bible it would still be a matter outside the jurisdiction of any earthly court to enforce it upon any person. That matter is between the individual and his Maker.

Seventh-day Adventists would object just the same to a law that should compel the seventh day to be observed. We are, therefore, compelled by the law to suffer fines and imprisonment or stultify our consciences. We choose the former, but we protest against the usurpation of our rights. We stand on principle that is dearer to us than liberty or life. We utterly refuse to obey the laws of men that interfere with the claims of God. We desire our fellow-men to know our reason and so we invite careful consideration to our protest and to the principle involved.

H. E. ROBINSON.
