It is said that a store is being closed up, we are in receipt of news of the arrest of two Seventh-day Adventists in Gainesville, Ga. These men, one of whom is a minister, were doing some work on Sunday inside the new Seventh-day Adventist church which was in course of being finished. They were arrested, and so they were charged with disorderly conduct. They were fined $60 each and costs, with the alternative of ninety days on the streets. They refused to pay the fine and were locked up, but friends, one of whom was a lawyer, interfered, and their fines have been appealed and they released on bond. Prosecution laws have been instituted against them under the statutes of the State for "Sabbath-breaking."
