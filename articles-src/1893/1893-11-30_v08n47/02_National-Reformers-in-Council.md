The first event of the season in National Reform circles was the convention held in the First United Presbyterian Church, Allegheny, Pa., November 14, 15, and 16. As stated last week, this was the largest National Reform convention, as such, that was ever held in this country, or in any country. The supreme question discussed was the so-called Christianity was the national religion. And the demand of National Reformers demand that it shall be of the United States—and the State properly has its hand upon any religion that did not conform to it, as those same pseudo-reforms demand shall be done also in this country.

The programme was elaborate and all most every phase of National Reform was discussed and presented. The subjects of the papers and addresses were as follows:

The Broad Basis of National Reform. Qualities of the Christian Religion, Sufficient for National Life. The Nation of God. The National Motto. Protection of American Homes. Protection in National Life. The Law of the Lord of God the Basis of Sovereignty. Natural Law and the Christian Religion. Sabbath Laws and the Law of Christ. The Chinese Question. Sabbath and the Common People. Truth, The Labor Problem. The Blair's National Reform. Morals. American Morals. Moral Influence. Sources of National Authority. The Place of the Common Reason and the Sovereignty of God. Industrial Peace Through Righteousness. Devotional Moral Principles. Public Education and National Reform. The Supreme Court on National Reform. Christian Reform or National Reform?

Any one of these subjects, alone, would furnish merely but a single question raised, impossible of being discussed in so many papers, the innate weakness of this whole movement comes to be a question, "Who then are its executors? The answer was, "We, the people." It is equally true that in their scheme, "we, the people" are also the interpreters of the will of God. And "we, the people" are simply the reformed churches.

In treating the subject, "You Can't Make Men Moral by Law," Rev. Samuel McSever, Wooster University, Ohio, denied the proposition in toto, and offered most the philosophy that law is the very agency by which men are made moral. This is not merely the theory, but the logical end of the law of God, for the Political declares, "By the law is the knowledge of sin." But the law was given to reveal sin, not to atone for it, this is not law that is true of human law. But treating the subject Federal law, Seceder made no distinction between human and divine law, and practically affirmed divinity of all law, whether human or divine. This was the weak spot in his otherwise able paper.

"The Kingship of Christ over the Nations" by Rev. W. P. Crafa, who showed how all the Scriptures "the kingship and sovereignty of Christ are linked together." But he forgot to mention, or did not know, that while the kingship and sovereignty are frequently mentioned in close connection the two offices do not in fact run concurrent comparatively. It is when Christ comes again he becomes "King of kings and Lord of lords." Christ is now at peace upon his Father's throne." At the time as he is plainly wrote: Day, "23, 1 said to the 5, 7: 8 we to fulfilling, but now are now lands upon his kingship of Christ, in following in the footsteps of those who have been "teaching and setting up temporal kingdoms to make him king; and like them they have been taught."

But notwithstanding the sophistries of National Reform and the structural weakness of the system, the movement is gathering force, and in connection with various other so-called reform organizations the National Reform Association is destined to do a good deal of practical work in this near future. It is true that the Supreme Court declares of Dec. 18, 1892, is not an uncommonly the amendments which the Constitution has received, nor are the National Reformers are not satisfied and are not likely to be satisfied with anything short of a fundamental law of a suitable acknowledgment of God in and the acknowledgment of national authority, of the Bible as the supreme norm of moral legislation, and of Christ as the Nation's Sovereign, Lord and King." Not all the energies of the association are however to be devoted to the carrying of this amendment. A lobby is to be established in Washington "to press at every opportunity, in co-operation with agents of other kindred reform organizations any and every bill or law on right lines." Schools, settlement of disputes or problems, for the investigation or support of the claims of any sect or denomination, or any other Christian reform; that the main efforts of the organization be the enactment of a national Sabbath law, and for the protection of man, an amicable to the national Constitution as will justify beyond all predecessors the declaration of our Supreme Court that 'this is a Christian nation.'"

That much will evolving be accomplished by the National Reformers can mostly be doubted by those who have watched the trend of recent events. They have many zealous workers, they have some unusual, and they will not hesitate to use every means in their power, and not a few dollars will be showered upon congressmen that will be to make to believe that the people demand various and far-reaching enactment of religious legislation. And now that the precedent has been established by the World's Fair legislation, Congress can scarcely observe or deny that that great what may be.

But really it makes little difference whether legislation is in bad knowledge, or whether religious amendment shall be secured or not, the union of Church and State has now been brought about in fact, and it has been recognized by the three branches of the government. Whatever may in the future however will be only the logical consummation of what has been already done. The National Reformers of the various schools, embracing all the various national reform associations that have lent their influence to the furtherance of National Reform principles, have already subverted our free institutions; they have established a veritable image to the Papacy. It is theirs, though scarcely discerned by many,
