No man, no matter how earnestly he may desire, and try even, to get holiness or salvation, if he tries to get it from the law, he gets wrath and wrath only. Why? Because it takes power, and the power of God, too, and that power has never been revealed to a single sinner, only in the gospel, and, even then, only "to every one that believeth;" "for therein [in the gospel] is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith." Then what must the man get, who, without the love or the power of God in his heart, is forced by his fellow-men to go to a national law for holiness? What can those expect to receive, who, by their own power, have set up this law in the government, that they might use the power of man in enforcing their own ideas of holiness upon poor sinners?

As I look over the many organizations to-day having religious legislation as their prominent purpose, I think of the words of Paul, "They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, for they being ignorant of God's righteousness [the life and power of God, revealed only in the gospel] and going about to establish their own righteousness [the life and power of man, revealed only in the law of force] have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God." Rom. 10:2, 3.

The only power God has ever revealed to man, that can save him or make him holy, is revealed, not in the law but in the gospel, not in force or fear, but in love. "The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance." Therefore, when men seek in the law a power to do this work, they can be doing nothing else but leaving the Bible (the only source of true power) and making an open denial of our Lord Jesus Christ; for, says Paul again, "I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain." Gal. 2:21.

Now, I ask, in all sincerity, all who have favored legislating in religious matters, to weigh these things carefully, to see if, perchance, the work you have been advocating and upholding, in honesty, perhaps, is not striking against the Lord and the truth of the Lord, whom you love. I ask you how much holiness you think can ever be forced into a man by law through a policeman's club or sheriff's irons? Will you look into the past and tell me how many have been made holy by law? Philip Schaff, D.D., says truly, "Secular power has proved a satanic gift to the Church, and ecclesiastical power has proved an engine of tyranny in the hands of the State." Which, think you, if you were a poor sinner, like other men, would have the most wholesome effect unto salvation to you; to hear professed ministers of Christ say, "What we want and must have is, more of the gospel of Christ, if we save these sinners," or "What we want, and are going to have, is 'law' in this matter, etc."?

I would, with the spirit of my Master, ask my brethren in the ministry, "Do you not really believe that if as much time and zeal, as has been spent in boycotting, and in lobbying Congress and legislatures, to bring upon our statute books laws to make men hypocrites, and thus bring the 'woe' of Christ upon them, had been spent in the closet, seeking God for his power revealed in the gospel; and by the fireside, in the shop and in the field, with their sinful neighbors, pointing them to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world; I ask you which course think you would make the most and best Christians, or develop the most and best holiness and salvation? Which would make the best nation? We all know that the devil will tremble before this latter work. The ministry and truth would be exalted in the eyes of sinners, and we would hear once more the good old-time cry, "Men and brethren, what must we do to be saved?" Then we could reply, with the tenderness of Christ, "Repent and be baptized;" and three thousand in one day might be seen "gladly" receiving the word. But be assured that such a work is not the result of the power of man, through the enforcement of moral law upon the bodies of men, but the "power of God" through his Holy Spirit, shining in the gospel into the hearts of men, writing there his perfect law of love, with all the tender, touching lessons of Calvary. "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus," and the weapons of your warfare will cease to be carnal, and will become spiritual and "mighty through God, to the pulling down of strongholds." Your sword will be only "the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God." You can say, "If any man hear my word, and believe it not, I judge him not," and "Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely." Then, even sinners will call us blessed, and the good Lord will say at last, "Well done."
