No man, no matter how earnestly he may desire, and try, even, to get holiness or salvation, if he tries to get it from the law, he gets wrath and wrath only. "Because it issues from power, and the power of God, and that power has never been revealed by a statute law: but only through faith." "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God, revealed from faith to faith." What a vast difference it makes and enters into the love of the power of God is his heart, is forced by his followers on to sign a national law for holiness? What can those expect to receive, who, by human power, have set up this law in the government, that they might use the power of men in enforcing their own ideas of holiness upon all the people?

As I look over the many organizations to-day having religious legislation as their end, and recall the emphatic language of Paul, "They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge; for they being ignorant of God's righteousness [his life a power, a power of God, revealed only in the gospel] and going about to establish their own righteousness [his life and nature of man, revealed only in the law of force] have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God." Rom. 10:1, 3.

"By the power of God" has come down to man, that can save him or make him holy, is revealed only in the gospel. "For it is the power of God unto salvation."

"The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance." "If the goodness of God in the law is the power to do this work, they are its doing nothing else but leaving the Bible (the only source of true power) and making an open denial of our Lord Jesus Christ; for, says Paul again, "I do not frustrate the grace of God; for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain."

Now, I ask, in all sincerity, all who have favored legislation in religious matters, to weigh these things carefully. In one of God's promises, the work you have entered upon may look very much like a real, and very good work, and God, perhaps, is not striking against the Lord and his work in this thing.

I ask you how much holiness you think can ever be forced into a man by law in a policeman's club or sheriff's fine? Will you look back to the past and ask me how many have been made holy by law? For I shall truly say, it is "not by power."

"Secular power has proved a satellite and failure to the Church, and ecclesiasticism has proved an engine of tyranny in the hands of the State." While, think you, if you were a poor sinner, like other men, would have the most wholesome effect unto salvation to you; to hear professed ministers of Christ do? "What ministers and many have, as most, of the gospel of Christ," it was ever in persuasion that "this we want, and are going to have." Is it to this matter, of a, "or would it tend to cause you to repent, to hear ask my brethren in the ministry, "Do you know?" and to then be made of much in soul, and as has been spoilt in legislatures and in lobbying Congressmen for legislation to bring upon our statute books laws to make men righteous, and thus bring the "woe" of Christ upon them, had been spent in the closet, seeking God for power revealed in the gospel; and by the fireside, in the shop or in the field, with the individual singleness, pointing them to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world? I say you were a man, I think you would make his true and best reasoning of the love of Christ that saves holiness and salvation. Which would you follow? A government that says, "be holy or we will make you pay for it;" or the devil will tremble before this letter force. You willingness itself would be limited in the eyes of sinners, and we would hear more from the good old time cry. "Men and brethren, what must we do to be saved?" The very reply would, with the tenderness of Christ, "Repent, and be baptized," and have thousands "in that day might be seen " gladly" receiving the truth. But so learned that such, and work is not the result of the power of man, through the enforcement of moral laws; but it is the fruit of the reception of "a power of God" through his Holy Spirit to man from God; only through a crucified Redeemer, writing there his perfect law of love upon their hearts, all the law in Emmanuel. Calvary. "Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus," and the weapons of your warfare will come to be enough, and will be "become spiritual and "mighty through God, to the pulling down of strongholds," and these weapons are only "the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God," "for you say, my kingdom is not of this world." "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his." teaching him not, "and Whosoever will, let him come." If men would see plainly, even stubborn sinners will call us "Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord." Trust, "Well done."
