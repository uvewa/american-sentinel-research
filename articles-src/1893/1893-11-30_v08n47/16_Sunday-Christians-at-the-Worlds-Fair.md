The Christian Statesman thus bemoans the fact that many Sunday "Christians," themselves disregarded the Sabbatic claims of that day, in order to visit the World's Fair:—

> Some very sad and suggestive statistics come to us from a town in Iowa (which we have no reason to suppose are not representative rather than exceptional) in regard to the use of Sunday trains by Christians in going to and returning from the World's Fair. On the Sabbath preceding "Chicago Day," which was Monday, when rates were low and inducements high, a leading deacon of one of the churches and several members of the church he was appointed to lead aright took the Sunday train for Chicago. Many other Christians of the town started Saturday night and reached Chicago on Sabbath morning. Other Christians of the same town started for home on Saturday night and arrived on Sabbath morning. Among the above offenders against divine and human and humane laws, were four members of an elder's family—all church members. Of twenty-three members of one church that went to the Fair, eight used Sunday trains, all but one of whom had petitioned against Sunday opening. Many of those who thus offended were also members of the young people's societies of the churches.

It is not to be presumed that Iowa Sunday "Christians" are worse than their fellows in other States; hence we must conclude from the facts given in the Statesman that one-third of all the petitioners for Sunday-closing were moved to so petition by caprice and not by principle; for when opportunity offered to save a paltry sum by visiting the Fair on a certain day they did not scruple to travel on Sunday to do it. After closing the Fair to others on Sunday, they themselves travelled on that day in order to see the show on Monday!
