In the case of Geo. W. Marvel, convicted of Sunday labor and committed to jail, at Centreville, Maryland, the fine and costs, amounting to about twenty-six dollars, have been paid by Samuel Marvel, the son, who was both prosecuting witness and the constable who made the arrest. The father has been by this means released from imprisonment. Isaac Baker and Milton Bryan remain in confinement.
