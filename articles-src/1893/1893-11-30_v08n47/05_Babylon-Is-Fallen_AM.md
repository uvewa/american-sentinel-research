In the earlier days of Protestantism the Church had with it the power of God—the only weapon of the Church of God with which to fight the evil elements of the world, the flesh, and the devil. This weapon, when possessed and used, is mighty, even to the pulling down of the strongholds of evil. This power is nothing less than the Spirit of God, which Christ promised to his disciples, as he was about to leave them, when here in the flesh. It is by this power that the work of God is to be accomplished. He himself says that his work shall be done, not by the might and power of men, but by his Spirit—not by the civil power, which is nothing more than the might of man—but by his mighty power. When the Church is endowed with this power, this weapon, she will need no other, for who can overcome God? Who can gain the victory over him? Can all the powers of earth? No, never. God is supreme; he rules supreme. The Church is offered his power, his strength, and even his wisdom.

The Protestant Church was once the possessor of this power, and with it she made the enemies of God, the evil elements of this world, tremble. When such men as Luther, Zwingle, Huss, Jerome, and other reformers, filled with the power of God, and therefore full of courage, firmness, self-possession, and determination, stood before the enemies of truth and righteousness, these same enemies were made to tremble before them, not because there was anything more in them, as men, than in themselves, but the power of truth defeated them. Falsehood cannot stand before truth, for truth is of God, and it will, it must, be vindicated. The power of Satan cannot stand before the power of God. The final victory belongs to the Church of God,—to those who will stand firm and loyal to God. It is predicted by God that in the last days, and consequently, in these days, because wickedness shall abound the love of many shall wax cold, but whose endureth unto the end, the same shall be saved.

The Protestant Church once made Rome tremble at her fearlessness, her firmness, her loyalty to God. Why? Because error cannot stand before truth. There is a power in truth, because God is in it. Rome was defeated by the truth, but to-day how is it? Does Rome fear this same Protestantism now? Does she tremble at it now? No; Protestantism has ceased to protest. She no longer has the power of God. It is lost and she knows it, and her enemies know it, too, and this is the reason they fear her no longer. They know that Protestantism can do nothing without this power. Satan is more powerful than men, and if they have not God's help, can overcome them every time. God alone can overcome Satan, and so Protestantism can only overcome evil when God is with it.

The Protestant Church, finding that she has lost the power of God, that power she once possessed, must have power of some kind to carry on her work, not the work of God but her own work, which is a selfish work, and so she does the same as Rome did before her, that is, gets control of the civil power. Indeed, what else could she do? She has no power of her own. She once was exalted, but now she has fallen from grace; her pride, her selfishness, has caused her to be abased. She has changed her work. She once did the work of God, having his power and might to carry it forward, but now she is doing the work of Satan, with his power, or the power of self, to carry it forward. What must be her final end?—Destruction; for Satan and every evil thing will at last be destroyed. Her final end is predicted in Revelation 18:1-21, as follows:—"And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judges her. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all."

Thus is the end of that Church that was once clean and unspotted; that once walked the earth in the strength and might of God, conquering all her enemies, and making even Satan stand in awe of her; she who once took God and God alone for her defense; the Bible and that alone for the weapon of her warfare; she who pledged herself to protest against evil and every appearance of evil. She is now defiled with the evil of this world; she has forsaken her Lord and Master, and joined herself to another; she can no longer go forth to conquer evil, because she is evil herself; she is working for Satan, therefore she cannot gain the victory over him. And what has brought her to this?—The love of self, the pride of life.

But in the Protestant Church there are many honest souls who see that the Church has fallen; who see that she has not the power she once had. God calls such, "Come out of her, my people." Will they hearken to the kind Shepherd's voice, and come and follow him? Will they cast their influence on the side of truth and righteousness, or on the side of error? Will they still continue to have "a form of godliness," but deny "the power thereof"; or will they accept God and his power in all its fullness? Victory is theirs if they stand loyal to God and retain his power. "He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved."

ALFRED MALLETT.
