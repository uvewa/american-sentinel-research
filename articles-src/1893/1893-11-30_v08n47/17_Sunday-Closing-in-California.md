The pronounced conquest of California by the Sunday legislatures still goes on. The latest place to surrender is San Bernardino. A news item says:—

> On Saturday, November 6, the ordinance closing all stores, bar barbers, cigar stores and news stands was passed on its first and final reading, and the city took on the appearance of a quiet Christian Sunday. The business men had been legislated out of existence; and thus Bernardino will be happy or miserable of the "lost purpose" to be by its own petition.

When a few large proportions of the municipalities within the State are furnished with a full complement of Sunday ordinances, then it will be a comparatively simple matter to ensure the passage of Sunday statutes by the legislature.
