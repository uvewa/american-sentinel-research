# Uncertainties — v08n47 (1893-11-30)

## Article 01 — "The Morning Comes" (WHM)

- **Title:** This article has no explicit title in the original. The title "The Morning Comes" is editorially inferred from the dominant theme and closing phrase "All is well, for the morning comes." Confidence: MEDIUM.
- **Word "FORVER":** Line reads "THIS WILL NOT GO ON FORVER." — This appears to be an OCR artifact or original typo for "FOREVER." Transcribed as printed (FORVER) per accuracy policy. No [sic] added. Confidence: LOW (likely OCR error; original may read "FOREVER").

## Article 05 — "Babylon Is Fallen" (Alfred Mallett)

- **Author name:** Signed "ALFRED MALLETT" at end. The known-authors list records "AM=Alfred Mallet(?)" with a question mark. The OCR reads "ALFRED MALLETT" (double-T). Transcribed as printed. The project memory notes "A. Malley vs Alfred Mallet" as a variant to verify. This instance is "ALFRED MALLETT."

## Article 08 — "The California Midwinter Fair" (W. N. Glenn)

- **Word "prestaion":** Appears in the phrase "force its prestaion before the Sunday shrine." This appears to be an OCR error for "prostration." Transcribed as printed per accuracy policy. Confidence: LOW (likely OCR error for "prostration").
- **Attribution note:** The article ends "—W. N. Glenn, in Sacramento Record-Union." This is both an explicit author attribution and a reprint attribution. Treated primarily as a reprint with WNG as the known author, since the article body was written by Glenn and published in the Record-Union before being reprinted in the Sentinel. The attribution field is set to "reprint" and original_publication to "Sacramento Record-Union"; author fields also populated.

## Article 09 — "The Power Unto Salvation" (A. E. Place)

- **Author initials:** Signed "A. E. PLACE." Not in the known-authors list. Assigned initials "AEP." Flagged as unknown author.

## Article 10 — "A Lesson to Ecclesiastics" (W. H. H.)

- **Author initials:** Signed "W. H. H." Not in the known-authors list. Could potentially be W. H. Hickok or another contributor. Assigned initials "WHH." Flagged as unknown author.

## Article 03 — "The Just and Considerate Views of a Sunday Keeper"

- **Title:** The OCR source text has "The lust and Considerate Views of a Sunday Keeper." The word "lust" is clearly an OCR error for "Just" — the editorial introduction describes it as "an excellent article." Corrected to "The Just and Considerate Views of a Sunday Keeper" in title and filename. Confidence: HIGH (context makes correction certain).

## General

- Page 7 contained several advertisements (Vest-Pocket Dictionary, Apples of Gold envelope series, Abiding Sabbath and Lord's Day book, Special Holiday Offer poetry books, The Medical Missionary journal, Prison Light, Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods). These were all skipped as advertisements/subscription boilerplate.
- The subscription terms/rates table on page 8 was skipped as boilerplate.
