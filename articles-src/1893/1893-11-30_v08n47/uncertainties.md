# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, November 30, 1893 (v08n47)

## General Notes

This issue presented extreme OCR challenges due to the scan quality. The images are from B&W scans with significant degradation, making many words and passages ambiguous. The text is very small and densely packed across three columns per page.

## Page 1 - Front Page Article (01_To-Every-Night...)

- **Throughout article**: The scan quality is poor and many words are extremely difficult to read with certainty. Multiple passages may contain misreadings due to the degraded image quality.
- **Paragraph 2**: "Here are established the seed and death of some of all men" — very uncertain reading, text is blurred
- **Paragraph 2**: "the will, the woe, the money of sin" — "money" is uncertain, could be "misery" or another word
- **Paragraph 3**: "Write this work" — may be "When this work"
- **Column 3**: Much of the text about "the mystery of its iniquitous make" is uncertain; the philosophical passage is very difficult to read

## Page 2 - National Reformers in Council (02)

- **Speaker name**: "Rev. Samuel McSever, Wooster University" — the surname is extremely difficult to read, could be different
- **Rev. W. P. Crafa** — surname uncertain, could be "Craig" or similar
- Multiple passages in this article are very hard to read with certainty due to scan quality

## Page 2-3 - Tact and Considerate Views (03)

- This article appears to be written in an unusual style with non-standard grammar, which makes it difficult to distinguish OCR errors from the original author's writing style
- The article may be from an uneducated correspondent writing from North Carolina

## Page 3 - A Protest (04)

- **Signature**: "H. E. ROBINSON" is clear, but "ALFRED MALLETT" below it is uncertain
- Some passages in the protest text are difficult to read

## Page 3 - Tradition or Bible? Which? (05)

- **Attribution**: "W. N. Glenn, in Sacramento Record-Union" — fairly confident but the last word may be slightly different
- Multiple passages are uncertain due to scan quality

## Page 3-4 - "Babylon is Fallen" (06)

- This article spans pages 3 and 4 and the text flow between pages is difficult to trace precisely
- Some content may have been mixed with the "Nature and Effect" article due to column layout confusion

## Page 4 - Nature and Effect of American Sunday Laws (07)

- **Author attribution**: At the bottom of the article there appears to be an attribution to "Rev. J. Brunsteed, member of the Baltimore bar, Md." — name very uncertain
- Much of this article overlaps thematically with "Babylon is Fallen" and the column boundaries are unclear

## Page 5 - The California Midwinter Fair (08)

- This is a very long article spanning all three columns of page 5
- Multiple passages are extremely difficult to read due to scan quality
- Block quotes from the New York Mail and Express are uncertain in places

## Page 6 - The Power Unto Salvation (09)

- **Author**: "A. F. PLACE" — clear
- Several Bible quotation passages are uncertain but likely accurate based on known Scripture

## Page 6 - A Lesson to Ecclesiastics (10)

- The block quote from the New York Recorder is quite difficult to read
- Specific dollar amounts and dates may be inaccurate

## Page 6-7 - Appropriations for Denominational Indian Schools (11)

- Dollar amounts cited ($394,756, $25,756, $8,300) are uncertain
- Some denomination names and amounts may be misread

## Page 8 - Short Items (12-22)

- **Maryland case (15)**: The name "Geo. W. Marvel/Cravell" is very uncertain — the surname is extremely hard to read
- **United Presbyterian item (16)**: The quoted text about Nashville schools is very difficult to read
- **Christian Statesman item (17)**: The block quote about Iowa is challenging to read precisely
- **Gainesville item (22)**: The fine amount "$60 each" is uncertain
- Many details in the short items on page 8 are difficult to verify due to the scan quality

## Layout Uncertainties

The three-column layout made it challenging to trace article boundaries and text flow, particularly:
- Where the "National Reformers" article ends and "Tact and Considerate Views" article continuation begins on page 3
- Where "Babylon is Fallen" ends and "Nature and Effect" begins on page 4
- Whether some short items on page 8 are parts of larger items or separate notes
