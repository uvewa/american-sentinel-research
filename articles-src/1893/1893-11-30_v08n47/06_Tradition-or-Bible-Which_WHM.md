In commenting on a paragraph from a sermon delivered by a London divine, on the subject, "Is Protestantism Decaying?" the Sabbath Recorder says:—

> Protestantism must meet the fact that in so far as it yet holds to "tradition" as a source of authority in religion, it is un-Protestant and must, by an unfailing law, go back to Rome, from which it revolted on the theory of "the Bible alone, etc." Nothing can save it from being re-Romanized except compliance with its fundamental theory. That it does not yet do this on several points, especially in the matter of the Sabbath, is too well known and too generally acknowledged to admit of question. Until it does accept the Bible wholly, without manipulating texts, and repeating the fourth commandment with "mental reservation," saying in effect, "Oh, Lord, incline our hearts to keep this law, thy law according to the traditions of the Catholic Church," it cannot escape the backward undertow which sweeps into the heart of historic Romanism.

This is true. Of course it is asking a great deal of the Protestant churches which call themselves orthodox to give up all the unbiblical theories to which they are so fondly wedded, and attach themselves to the Bible alone. That, however, they must do, otherwise the inevitable result will be a relapse to Romanism.

What are some of the cherished doctrines which they hold, in common with the Catholic Church, and contrary to biblical teaching? One is a union of religion with the State, that such religious observances as the Church may dictate shall be enforced by the civil law. This is contrary to the words of Christ and the whole spirit of the gospel.

A second is the institution of Sunday, the first day, as a substitute for the Sabbath, the seventh day. For this there is not an iota of biblical authority, and that the substitution was made through the decree and practice of the Roman Catholic Church, the learned men of the church themselves declare and are supported by their ecclesiastical archives, by profane history, and by prophecy. This, then, is an unbiblical observance practised in deference to Roman Catholic tradition, and must be given up.

A third is the baseless theory that man is naturally immortal, independent of his Maker, and instead of going at death into the grave among the dead who "know not anything" until he shall rise in the resurrection at the call of his Saviour,—assuming to be co-equal in immortality with God and scorning the mission and the service of a Saviour to raise him from the dead,—making a mock of those lofty words of exultation which are put in the mouths of those who rise in the first resurrection, "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"—making possible all the Roman Catholic deceits of purgatory and saint worship, with the multitude of satanic deceptions of Spiritualism and the last great deception, wherein Lucifer himself, as an angel of light, attempts to counterfeit the second coming of Christ. This is a tradition of man, and of the Roman Catholic Church, it, too, must be given up.

A fourth is that libel on a merciful and omnipotent God, the never-ending punishment of the wicked in an eternal burning place of torment, a theory of furious-hearted theologians which directly contravenes the revelation of God as to "the second death," and contradicts the word of Scripture in many places. This almost insanely cruel theory must be given up for biblical realities.

But this is sufficient to show that it is no small task which the Sabbath Recorder has set popular Protestantism, to do away with the authority of "tradition" in religion and accept fully its fundamental theory of "the Bible alone."
