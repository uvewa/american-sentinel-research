From one standpoint it certainly behooves France to keep on good terms with the Pope, for it is stated that of the 2,000,000 foreigners found by the recent census to be living in France, 800,000 have received a military education and belong to the reserve in their respective countries. More than 350,000 are Italians, and no doubt very largely Roman Catholics, who in case of war would, at the bidding of the Pope, at once array themselves against the country which now affords them shelter.
