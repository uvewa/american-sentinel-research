In commenting on a paragraph from a sermon delivered by a Lansing clergyman, on the subject, "Is Protestantism Dying?" the *Lansing Republican* says:—

Protestantism must meet the fact that it is far weaker to-day than it was twenty-five years ago; instead of growing stronger, it has been losing by an unfailing law, to get back to Rome, from which it sprang, or shall Protestantism resolve its present weakness into a new and greater strength by an exact compliance with its fundamental theory. And that theory is that the Bible, and the Bible only, more especially in the matter of the Sabbath, is the sole and only rule of faith. . . . If Protestantism is to stand on the Bible alone, it must face the test without manipulating texts, and repeating the dogma that Sunday is the "Christian Sabbath;" or boldly step, by law according to the tradition of a human church to the point of demanding that Sunday observance shall in human law, by the law, according to the tradition of a human church sweep into the basis of the Church.

This is true, of course it is asking a great deal of the Protestants of this country. A revolution in religious opinion after centuries which will call themselves orthodox to give up their cherished tradition. And those who confine themselves to the Bible alone, That, however, true it will be a relapse to Romanism. And the more clearly may yet be demonstrated the several doctrines which they hold, in common with the Catholic Church, are contrary to the Biblical teaching? One is a union of religion with the State, that each religious observances as the Church may dictate shall be enforced by the civil law. That is contrary to the words of Christ and the teaching of his apostles.

A second, is a substitution of the Sabbath of the Fourth Commandment by a Sunday, not as a matter of Bible teaching, not acts of biblical authority, but entirely upon the decrees and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. And beyond one of the numerous authorities that have in the past declared that these decrees and doctrines are supported by their ecclesiastical authorities, by profane history, and by prophecy. This, then, is an exact statement of the truth. It is as a return to Roman Catholic tradition, and hence to Rome herself.

A third, in the baseless theory that man is naturally immortal, independent of his Maker, and instead of going at death into the grave awaiting the dead to do "know not anything" until he shall rise in the resurrection; at the call of his Saviour; seeming to be so-original to immortality of God with teaching the man-made and the service of a Saviour to raise him from the dead,—a mockup of a more than fifty years of evolution which put in its place all-sufficient in the true Sabbath of the Bible, it shall enable the saints at the very just petition of day's earthly court to confront in God to face the enemy of man, both as to the individual and his Maker.

W. N. Glenn, in *Sacramento Record-Union.*
