On Sunday, Nov. 19, over eighty arrests were made in Philadelphia for violation of the Sunday liquor law. The warrants were sworn out by agents of the Law and Order Society, who had personally secured evidence. This is supposed to be moral reform, but its puerility is only equalled by its futility. The liquor business should be suppressed on all days, but this is not the purpose of such arrests as these. Such arrests as these are not made with the intent to reduce or suppress liquor selling, but to vindicate the right of civil officers to enforce an ordinance of municipal religion.
