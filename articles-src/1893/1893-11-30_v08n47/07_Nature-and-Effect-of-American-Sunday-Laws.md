*(Concluded.)*

NOTHING could more conclusively demonstrate the purely religious character of Sunday laws, as understood and appreciated by their advocates, than the recent proceedings against Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee and Maryland. In both these States every man did practically what he pleased on Sunday, under the same police restrictions as surrounded him on other days, and thus it had been "from the beginning." But now come these Seventh-day Adventist people and teach, rightly it must be said, because it is a matter of history, that "Saturday" is the weekly "Sabbath of the Lord God" of the Bible, and that Sunday is the feast of the pagan deity, Mithra, which was "established," as a general rest-day or Sabbath in his honor by Constantine; and further teach, rightly or wrongly is not to be argued here, because it is matter of doctrine, that the acceptance of this pagan substitution of Sunday for the biblical Sabbath by the Christian Church constituted a "great falling away" from the Master's teaching, which is repeated wherever Christians acquiesce, even externally, in the following of Constantine's example by a so-called Christian State. And for preaching this doctrine, and by no means for doing, like all around them, whatever work they please on Sunday, these Seventh-day Adventists are harried and badgered and persecuted, rather than prosecuted, under the forms of the Sunday laws. "Did the accused disturb you in any way by his alleged work?" was asked of a witness in a recent Maryland case. "Not at all," was the answer. "Then why did you swear out this warrant?" was the next question. "Because," said the witness in reply, "I loved him so that I wanted to save his soul." "And do you still seriously consider that his paying a fine of five dollars and costs, or going to jail for thirty days, as the outcome of this trial will be calculated to improve the condition of his soul, or to impress him with a sense of the 'sweetness and light' possessed by your religion, as distinguished from his own?" was then asked, but to this query no response was vouchsafed. Similar language might be quoted from the testimony in all the other cases. There was nowhere any pretense that any harm had been done to anybody, or that any complaint would have been made about the work, if any one had done it except a Seventh-day Adventist. It must be said of these people that, whatever "rankling" there may be in their hearts, which are but human, there appears neither in their conduct, nor language a trace of bitterness against their persecutors. The zeal of these last has in more than one recent Maryland case outrun their discretion, and some of them owe immunity from criminal prosecution solely to the forbearance of those whom they have most "despitefully used." But the tale of the persecutors themselves is a sad one. In most of the Tennessee cases, the "informers" objected to having their names given as such, and showed a creditable reluctance to appearing in court,—thus demonstrating that fanaticism had not wholly destroyed their sense of self-respect, and that they were ashamed of the business they had undertaken. In one Maryland case a brother asked the magistrate to "look up the law and see if he could not have his sister arrested for sewing on Sunday." (The sister having recently joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church.) In another, a son, newly appointed constable, being himself engaged in making a business trip on Sunday, stopped his horse, left his buggy, and walked a considerable distance across a rough field, in the hope of "catching" his venerable father (a Seventh-day Adventist of course), "violating the Sabbath," as he himself, not being a Seventh-day Adventist, was doing without peril. A prominent citizen swore that he spent the greater portion of the morning of his Sabbath watching his Seventh-day Adventist neighbor through a hedge, with the view of accumulating data for his prosecution; and he declared, with evident sincerity, that he considered it no "desperation" of his own sacred day thus to spend it in playing the spy and doing the work of a volunteer detective! And at every work we have seen manifested either an honorable shame, as of one carried along despite his own better impulses, or a boastful, swaggering, defiant, aggressive demeanor, strongly suggestive of a consciousness of doing dirty work, coupled with a fixed determination not to admit it to oneself or anybody else; one or the other frame of mind being the invariable characteristic of prosecuting witnesses in Sunday law cases, and either sufficiently proving the demoralizing effect of these prosecutions on those upon whom they depend for success.

If, then, a Sunday law is a religious dogma embodied in a statute; if the dogma is itself disputed among Christians; if every attempt to enforce such a law is at once absurd in its inevitable futility, and tragic in its demoralizing effects upon the people—may we not trust that sound American sense will soon reduce every such law to a state of "innocuous desuetude," even if formal repeal be too much as yet to hope for?
