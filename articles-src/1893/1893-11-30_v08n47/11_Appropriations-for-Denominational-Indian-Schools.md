The Independent for November 9, has an article under the title "A Year of Indian Affairs," by the Commissioner, in which he says:—

We have been told, over and over again, that the Protestant denominations are voluntarily withdrawing or are withdrawing from contract relations with Government for Indian education, and we find that the Roman Catholic Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions claimed $394,756 in 1892-93, an additional increase of the total amount asked last year, although that for the Presbyterians the figures have decreased from $25,756, in 1893, to $8,300, for 1894; the Episcopalians retained their allotments. The Government postponed the date of withdrawing from the Government but for Congressional appropriations.

The thought which inspired this paragraph is commendable in that it recognizes therein it to just and accord consideration. But the Recorder's error all the denominations, the Government in all its separate transactions. Grant that ecclesiastical interference for rule might legitimatize honoring, now Roman Catholics in the Province of Canada. Roman Catholics of preachers in the Territories of the United States, should submit, then, would this similar interference, that you would think them a little different? And would it change the principle any if the denomination were called Protestant rather than Roman Catholic?

Is there any reason why an ecclesiastical boycott or one denomination in Canada should be condemned, and many a religious boycott of another denomination in the United States be commended? What is the relative position in either case of the churches, in the Province of Quebec or in the churches, in the Province of Quebec or the churches, in the State of Tennessee?
