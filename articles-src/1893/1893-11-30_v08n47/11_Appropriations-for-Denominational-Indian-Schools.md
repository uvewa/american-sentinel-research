[The Independent, for November 16, has an article under the title "A Year of Indian Affairs," from which this paragraph is taken.]

We have been told, over and over again, that the Protestant denominations have withdrawn or are withdrawing from connection with the Government in their Indian schools; and yet we find that the same amount, $30,090, is allotted, in 1894, for Presbyterian contract schools, as was allotted last year, although that for the Congregational schools has been reduced from $25,736, in 1893, to $8,950, for 1894. It is true that the Presbyterians have postponed the date of withdrawing from the Government but for the Congregationalists, the American Missionary Association has entirely withdrawn. The appropriation is for the independent Ramona school and perhaps one other. Last year the Episcopalians reduced their claims on the Government from $23,220 to $4,860, but for the year ending June 30th, 1894, they have increased the figures to $7,020. The Friends still take $10,020, the Mennonites $3,750, the Unitarians $5,400, and the Lutherans $15,120. . . . The amount assigned for the Protestant denominations sums up $80,350 against $365,045 assigned to Catholic schools.
