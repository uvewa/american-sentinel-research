As shown in a reprinted paragraph, from *New York Independent*, on another page, some Protestant denominations are very loath to give up the union with the State which they have secured in Government appropriations for their Indian schools. This is evidence, and it has been evident from the beginning, that the objections of Protestant churches to Government appropriations for sectarian schools has not been because of opposition to State support of religion on principle, but because the Roman Catholic denomination was receiving the lion's share of the money. There seems to be no likelihood that the money will be taken from the people's pocket, and so long as it remains, being without conscientious scruples in the matter, see no reason why they refuse a share is to be speak, but it is humiliating result. Rather than nothing would the Protestant denominations are willing to be the tail jerked by which follows the summond heads of proof that they may feed upon the surplus left from the Roman Catholic repast.
