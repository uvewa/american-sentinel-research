[These extracts are taken from an excellent article in the Wilmington Messenger, of Wilmington, North Carolina, written from the standpoint of a Sunday keeper, by a lawyer of that city.]

This duty [rest-day observance] is only one of the many duties resting on Christian people, and the observance of it, whether at all, or to what extent, is a matter which addresses itself only to the conscience of each particular individual, and no outside interference to enforce its observance seems consistent with Christian peacefulness and forbearance. The appropriate agencies for the conversion of the world are preaching, praying, and the exercise of a godly life and conversation. All of the apostles and evangelists, and the great teachers and preachers of the world, contented themselves with preachings and warnings and prayers, and then left the responsibility with the world; but they abstained from all overt acts of opposition or interference in their work of reformation.

One Church [the Methodist Episcopal], by a canon passed in 1832 only enacts, that "all persons within this church shall celebrate and keep the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, in hearing the word of God taught and read, in private and public prayer, in other exercises of devotion, and in acts of charity, using all godly and sober conversation." But this law binds only the members of that church, and with its customary good sense and conservatism simply enjoins a duty, and contains no negative proposition whatever. It leaves the world alone, and its own members to their individual consciences. I do not know how it is with other churches; but manifestly their laws bind only themselves, and they should attempt no more. Upon all outside of the Church, excepting the laws of the State, there is no law at all requiring any observance of the Lord's day, or forbidding any work, recreation, relaxation, or thing whatsoever. I say then that the observance of the Lord's day is simply a moral duty which rests on all mankind at all times, to love and worship God, and keep his commandments, and that he who keeps it with any other motive or feeling than a profound thankfulness for, and the remembrance of, the love of Jesus Christ in rising from the dead for our sakes, does not keep it at all.

The preaching of the truth, and the setting forth of godliness, in our lives and conversation, are the only efficacious means of converting the minds and hearts of mankind. "If they hear not Moses and the prophets," it is not necessary to do anything further; the responsibility is with them. Further contention or resistance only excites opposition, and is incompatible with the Christian character. To single out the Lord's day, and treat its religious observance as a duty resting on all men, out of the Church as well as in it, and to prohibit all recreation, amusement, or other diversion whatever on the part of everybody, and not also at the same time make a corresponding exertion to suppress and prevent the grosser sins of stealing, lying, adultery, fornication, slandering, backbiting, and all uncharitableness, seems to be giving undue prominence to one idea, and surely strikes the world as illogical, unreasonable and unsound. This was the mistake the lawyer made when he asked, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?" Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment; and the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."

The truth is, all parts of God's law are of equal importance. Spread it all before the world, and exhort mankind to keep it all, and let the law of liberty, and individual responsibility, and conscience, work it out the best it can. This singling out of one part of it and unduly magnifying it is the way in which Protestant Christendom has been divided into more than four hundred different sects. Persons who travel on Sunday, not members of a church prohibiting it, without sufficient excuse, their own conscience being the judge, are guilty perhaps of discourtesy to the religious sensibilities of Christian people, but towards God, so far as his law is concerned, come in only to the condemnation which rests on all thoughtless and impenitent persons generally, and on general principles.
