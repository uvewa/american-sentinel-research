*The Christian Statesman* deplores the fact that many Sunday "Christians," themselves disregard the Sabbath claims of that day, in order to visit the World's Fair:—

> Where every and suggestive similitude can urge from a town in Iowa (which we have no reason to doubt) that not less than thirty-five of the Christians or going to and returning from the World's Fair, broke God's Sabbath to visit the "Day," which was Sunday, when races were held for competition, and the management took its share of the admission fee. He was appointed to lead strict took the Sunday. "These Church people Christians," "the effect on Sabbath worship. Other Christians of the city were discouraged in their efforts to hold services on Sabbath morning. Among the absent church members. Of twenty-three members of one churches, from the choir: the left, eight from day vesture, all but one of whom had performed some Sabbath Sunday opening. Many of those who thus offended were also members of the young people's societies of the institution.

It is to be presumed that those Sunday-"Christians" are worse than their fellows in other States; hence we must conclude from the facts given in the *Statesman* that one-third of all the petitioners for Sunday-closing were moved to petition by policy and not by principle; for when opportunity offered to save a gallery man by visiting the Fair on a certain day they did not scruple to travel on Sunday to do it. After closing the Fair to others on Sunday, they themselves traveled on the day in order to attend the saloon on Monday!
