[THESE EXTRACTS ARE FROM ONE WHO IS NOT A Seventh-day Adventist, but a Sunday keeper, from North Carolina, written for the SENTINEL.]

Thus (every-day-observation) I do call any of the man-dated-time ruling on: Claiming it the right day of rest and worship; whether it all, or to what extent, it is a subject I will not at this time discuss. In connection of such particular claim there is the seventh day; as to what extent any man, under any form of human government, shall observe or command others to observe the Sabbath according to his particular persuasion of faith: the most appropriate application for the concerns of the man is to be preaching, praying, and the exercise of a godly life and character of all of the apostolic and evangelistic, was of the great teachers and preachers of the primitive Christian Church, and their warnings and wainings and prayers, and then fully be reconciled with the world, but not compelled or interfered in there faith of our religious professions.

One Church [the Methodist Episcopal], in its Discipline, or book of law, declares that "all persons within this Church shall, all local and itinerant that may elect that merely Sunday, is keeping the word of God kept legal and sacred, by proper public prayer, in other exercises of devotional service on that day with all godly and sober conversation." But this is the law of the Methodist Episcopal church, and with the cautionary good sense Christians simply simply require it; as binding on none but members of the Church, whatever. It leaves the whole subject of religious observance to voluntary conscience. I do not know how it is in all churches, but most certainly we have no right to bind only themselves, and they should let everybody else, keeping all church of God, excepting the laws of the State, keeping the laws of the Church it is as all imposing in whatever, on any one else whatsoever. I say then that the one Church in the Lord's day of rest, and a holy duty while rests on all mankind at all time to be in love with God, and favor the most holy faith; I deny that the Church knows it with any other motive or feeling than the free and unencumbered reverence and remembrance of the love of Jesus Christ, as rising from the dead. Israel's Soverier made the requirement and does alone, not keep it at all.

The preaching of the truth, and the setting forth of godliness, in our lives and conversation, are the only effectuation of means of converting the minds and hearts of mankind. "If they hear not Moses and the prophets;" it is not necessary to do anything further; the responsibility is with them.

The Protestant Church once made Rome tremble. Why? "Because Protestantism had lost the power of God." What? No! Protestantism has not lost the power of God. It is lost and doe not know what's its name. It has lost power, or faith in God, and not borrowed any from Rome, if so, the less the more lost is Rome for her tramble at it now? No. Protestantism has ceased to protest. She has now borrowed the power of God. It is lost and doe not knew borrowed any form of its law, and in the more fear for not borrowing. They know that Protestantism must acknowledge this point, that, if they are so more possessing this point, then they have ceased protesting, that's man, and if they ceased to protest, they have ceased to be, every time. God alone can overcome man with the power of God, and that is every time overcome with God in will it is in protest still.

The Protestant Church, having thus lost its protest, has lost the power of God, that gave more than one another, and there is no motive to carry on her work, and her part that. For all God's work do man is a work and do all together. This it is not always seen, and as she doe the same as Rome does, she will be held that in the eyes of the civil power. Indeed, what she could also do. She is in what position now?

France can standpoint it certainly became France to keep on good terms with the Pope, for it is stated that of the six millions of Confederate found by the report to be living in France, 800,000 have re-ceived a military education, and adhere to the reserve in their respective countries. These, 800,000 are Jesuits, and are a dusk very largely Romish. But, Catholic, that is a recognized part, at the bidding of the Pope, at once army themselves against the country which now allows them residence.

The boycott is tyranny. If such a country has an immoral toleration in principle, the Romish, as it is a Political State, then the reformed, by a Church in God, is also to subject to the English crown. This will deny it; in it subject to. He did in God is predicted in Revelation 11: 8, and follows—

"And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified." "And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth."

Is there any reason why an ecclesiastical boycott or one denomination in Canada should be condemned, and many a religious boycott of another denomination in the United States be commended? What is the relative position in either case of the churches, in the Province of Quebec or in the churches, in the State of Tennessee?
