Just as this paper is being closed up, we are in receipt of news of the arrest of two Seventh-day Adventists in Gainesville, Ga. These men, one of whom is a minister, were doing some work on Sunday inside the new Seventh-day Adventist Church, when arrested. The city has no Sunday ordinance, and so they were charged with disorderly conduct. They were fined $50 each and costs, with the alternative of ninety days on the streets. They refused to pay the fine and were locked up, but friends, one of whom was a lawyer, interfered, and their cases have been appealed and they released on bond. Proceedings have also been instituted against them under the statutes of the State for "Sabbath-breaking."
