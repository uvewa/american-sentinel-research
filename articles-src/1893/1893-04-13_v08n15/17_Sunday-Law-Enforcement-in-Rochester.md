THE agitation for the enforcement of Sunday laws has reached Rochester in this State. Rev. Ferdinand L. Anderson, of that city, took advantage of the week of prayer for Sunday observance to preach to an audience of two thousand people on the "Enforcement of the law in Rochester," the law being the Sunday law. Notice has been given in the newspapers of Rochester that the law will be enforced. What a parody on proper civil procedure, if criminal proceedings are in progress to give due newspaper notice that they must be suspended, for on a given day investigation will be made. That such a thing should be soberly done is enough to brand with the mark of everlasting ridicule the law under which such a course is thought fit.
