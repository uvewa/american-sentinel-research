IN an old volume of "Dialogues," published in London about a century ago, the Rev. John Macgowan sets out in the quaint style of the period the inconsistency of mingling civil and religious things. The author, who died in 1780, was minister of a London dissenting church. Of the difference between truth and orthodoxy, he writes as follows:

> I readily grant, and none can honestly deny it, that the Scripture is the standard of truth; but truth and orthodoxy are two things very different, and sometimes diametrically opposite to one another. Bible doctrine is the same in all ages and nations, but orthodoxy in one nation differs, at least, as much from orthodoxy in another nation, as the several climates do from one another. To go no farther than Britain, you see what is south of the Tweed accounted the purest religion in the world, is, upon traveling farther towards the pole, deemed corrupt, superstitious, and antichristian. So it is vice versa. Moreover, what has been orthodox and apostolic in one age, has had the misfortune to become quite heterodox and damnable in the next; so that there is no certain standard of orthodoxy in any nation, but truth it always the same and knows no standard but one.

Again, in answer to the question, "Has any sect besides the papists been found to persecute those who differed from them?" he says:

> Yes, every sect who has, at any time, been happy enough to grasp the reins of government for the time being. The worthy papists bore the bell of orthodoxy for the space of twelve hundred and sixty years, during which time much blood was shed by open massacres, secret assassinations, pretended judiciaries, acts of bloody faith; and at last to finish the bloody reign of antichrist, England, France, the Netherlands, and the valleys of Piedmont swam with the gore of such who would believe the Bible sooner than the voice of the priests. Queen Mary's reign furnished the orthodoxy in her day, with a fine opportunity of discovering their zeal for the church, by murdering those who believed and obeyed the Bible; but her reign being short, and Elizabeth ascending the throne upon her demise, the other scale rose uppermost, and the Protestants, in their turn, became orthodox, i.e. got the government into their hands.
>
> O, the violence of reputed orthodoxy! Those same gentlemen were no sooner emerged from prison than they also let the world know that they were not to be differed from with impunity; that the formula of their faith and worship must be regarded with as implicit obedience as that in the former reign imposed by the papists. Now the Presbyterians, Independents, and other Congregationalists felt the weight of their rage, or, if you please, zeal for orthodoxy and the good of the Church. Now the prison-keepers and their friend, Master Ketch, had pretty near as good a run of trade as in the reign of Mary. And now the wilds of America began to be well peopled with English Protestants who oppressed dissenters; and the good Episcopalians at home, kept the fleece to themselves and had all the good of the Church before them. But those said Presbyterians and Independents had no sooner crossed the ocean for conscience' sake, and found themselves secure from Episcopalian rage, than they themselves commenced orthodox, and set up their own formula as the standard of religion, to which they required as implicit submission from others as the good bishops of England had ere while done for themselves; and now the poor antipedo-Baptists and Quakers were taught, that a mittimus is a mittimus whether it is signed by a papist, an Episcopalian or a Presbyterian, and that sentence of death is to be dreaded as much from the mouth of the latter as of the former. These same disorders who had so lately found Old England too hot for themselves, by the glowings of priestly zeal for orthodoxy, soon made New England too hot for the poor Quakers and antipedo-Baptists; who, to escape the rage for presbytery, fled, the one to Pennsylvania and the other to Rhode Island, that they might not be compelled to worship God according to other people's consciences and contrary to their own.

Another century has gone, and we see unmistakable indications that many of the children of those who fled from the Puritan persecutors of New England have now fallen away from the principles which their fathers championed, and are joining those who are working in the old way for present-day "orthodoxy." Of such as these, Edmund Burke once uttered, in the House of Commons, the scathing words:—

> It is not the proud prelate thundering in his commission court, but a pack of manumitted slaves with the lash of the beadle flagrant on their backs, and their legs still galled with their fetters, that would drive their brethren into that prison house from which they have just been permitted to escape.

So the old order of things goes on and on, because the great majority of men choose to remain the slaves of human nature, rather than to lay hold of that new life, the fruit of which is "love, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith." W. A. SPICER.
