THE conflict between the Liberals and the Clericals in Hungary still continues to rage in Hungary, and open serious, tyrannical agents of Rome to enforce by civil power the dogmas of their councils, and to annihilate every hostile element.

These councils will not stop with only cutting political movements and not to their minds which is subversive on its authority, they will legislate upon religious matters, and demand the subjugation of religion to the government by civil power, and require that its defiance be properly punished; and no matter how oppressed the people may be in such councils, and the men who preach them, with "every soul be in subjection to God," take it upon themselves to act for God, but having no evidence or color for honor in things not delegated to them. The worst, the most cruel and wicked institution this world has ever seen, is an ecclesiastical council wielding the powers of the civil State. The Church and the State should be by their very nature apart. They have legitimateness, and only obtain them when separate. Both are degraded by a union.

The State is a natural right, it is a mature civil; and is to be implicitly obeyed by every citizen, as the ordinance in all matters relating to the discharge of civil duties. But when it assumes to dictate things moral or religious it has no commission to speak and no right to enforce. "Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's and to God the things that are God's," clearly separates them. The things of God are not to be rendered to Cæsar—the State, nor to God through Cæsar—the State. The Scriptures are as clear, abounds in clear distinctions of these two realms. Read at Isa. the entire eighteenth of Leviticus, which should definitely required by God to submit to the power of Babylons, or all matters in civil. But the natural civil continually in virtually the refusal of these same Ecclesiastical Councils, to observe the statutes enforced by civil law. See Dan. 1.

In the words of your correspondent, I warn them to beware lest they become the enormous influence for evil which Romanism has been, both on the Church and on the world.

"Rome, the arch historian of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, has recorded for the information of this generation, the workings of ecclesiastical councils in the earlier centuries, that we would do well just now to review."

The agitation continues to rage in Hungary, and open conflict between church and state continues between the Liberals and the Clericals and the government. Hitherto the Hungarian clergy have been having everything their own way in religious affairs, but their Magyarian has of late been set aside in favor of Vaticanistic, and they are beginning to take their politics as well as their religion from the Roman ecclesiastical superiors. It is absolutely necessary that a settlement be arrived at as to the condition of the marriage laws of Hungary, and the influences opposing reforms in that country are the Romish clergy, seeing that the clericals rumbling their Government should be in every way to be resisted by legislation and the civil power held. The Hungarian Government has a fixed disciplinary matter, in the lower house of the Reichstag, and this majority is determined that civil marriages only shall be swept aside, and that marriage shall be recognized as a civil ceremony, leaving every one free to follow his or her own religious belief in a religious ceremony.

The policy of reform is greatly strengthened by the expressed adherence of Louis Kossuth, the veteran Hungarian patriot, who is receiving a deputation from his countrymen a few years ago, declared that the revolutionary period having passed, Hungarian Government was the key to which every sincere Hungarian patriot greatly ought to be supported irrespective, especially by all lovers of liberty.

These words from the great champion of the struggle for Hungarian Independence, have created a deep impression, and served as an inspiration by the large majority of the patriotic and liberal Hungarians, the continued to carry to success the proposed reforms. In the end, no doubt, the clergy will all succumb. Hungary will then be free, a nation of the status of the nations, and cause their voice and influence to be heard in the Council of States.
