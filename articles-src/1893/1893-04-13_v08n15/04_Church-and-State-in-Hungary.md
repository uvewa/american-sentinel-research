The contest between Church and State continues to rage in Hungary, and open war has been declared between the bishops and the government. Hitherto the Hungarian clergy have been fervent patriots, but their Magyarism has of late been set aside in favor of Vaticanism, and they are beginning to take their politics as well as religious commands from their ecclesiastical superiors. It is absolutely necessary that some order should be brought into the confusion of the marriage laws of Hungary, and the influences opposing reform will doubtless be overcome, notwithstanding that the clericals number among their supporters the leading magnates of the land. The Hungarian Government has a well disciplined majority in the lower house of the Reichstag, and this majority is determined that the existing trammels shall be swept aside, and that marriage shall be recognized as a civil contract, leaving every one free to follow his or her inclinations as to a religious ceremony.

The policy of reform is greatly strengthened by the expressed adherence of Louis Kossuth, the veteran Hungarian patriot, who, in receiving a deputation of his fellow countrymen a few days ago, declared that the ecclesiastical programme of the Hungarian Government was the key to Hungary's future, and that this programme ought to be supported unconditionally by all lovers of the country. These words from the venerable leader in the struggle for Hungarian independence, now in his 91st year, will be received like an inspiration by the large majority of his countrymen, and will fortify their resolution to carry to success the programme which Kossuth so cordially approves. In the end, no doubt, the clergy will accommodate themselves to the desires of the nation, and cease their futile opposition to the dictates of modern enlightenment.—*New York Press.*
