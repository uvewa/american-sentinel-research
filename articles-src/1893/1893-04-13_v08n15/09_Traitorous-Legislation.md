THERE seems to be a widespread feeling among the toiling millions of this country that they have been cheated out of the opportunity for them to visit, on the only day available for most of the industrial classes, the most stupendous and magnificent exposition of the wonders of human genius that have ever been collected in the history of the world. . . . There is absolutely no valid reason for such a measure of tyranny. Every Christian scholar and every well-posted layman knows that Sunday is not any more holy than Monday; they know that it was established as a day of rest to meet the requirements of fashion; they know that there is no command to keep it holier than any other day in the Bible; they know that all that refers to the Sabbath in the Scriptures refers to Saturday. . . . But the most frightful thing about the matter is, that the Sunday-closing law for the World's Fair, practically inaugurates a fusion of Church and State in this country.

There is no reason now, taking that legislative enactment as a precedent, why the Government should not pass laws making it a misdemeanor to neglect church service; or to make it a crime to be a freethinker.

But the most painful thing of all is the enormous multitude of fresh enemies these sectarian bigots have made for Christianity in general. They have set the hearts of millions of working people dead against religion as it is managed by the churches. It has not made them less religious but less tolerant of professional religionists. They see the hand of the tyrant peeping from beneath the sacred robe, and they are fleeing from it from one end of the land to the other.—*The Jury.*
