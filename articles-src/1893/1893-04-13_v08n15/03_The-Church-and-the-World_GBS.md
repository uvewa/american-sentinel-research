[*The following reprint is from the New Zealand Herald, Auckland, New Zealand. This article is very interesting as showing a movement towards Church union and religious centralization, in advance of the great effort which is to be made for that end in the international religious council at the World's Fair.*]

UNDER the above heading your correspondent of the 11th instant commends the organization of the Council of Churches in Victoria, and in high praise recommends a similar organization for New Zealand, and inquires "which of the Protestant churches in Auckland will be first to take the lead?" To all of which we wish to offer our solemn protest, and call the attention of your readers to a few of the dangers of such an organization, and to the fact that the first Protestant church that moves forward in this direction will be the first to step down from the exalted platform of Protestantism, "the Bible, and the Bible alone, and the entire freedom of the individual conscience to receive or reject its teaching," to the position of the papist, "the ministry and the ecclesiastical council."

In the Victorian Council each church is to be represented in proportion to its numbers, and the primary object of the council, it is stated, is "to review the various political measures as they are brought forward and judge them by a moral standard. If they decided that any proposed measure is morally right, the churches will support it; if not, they will oppose it with all their united strength." In other words, we have the spectacle of ministers of Jesus Christ, commissioned only to preach the word of God to the people, forming themselves into a political caucus, and instituting a religious boycott against any party or measure not in harmony with the mind of the council. Is this a proper use for the ministry to make of the influence given them by their call to the gospel ministry? Is an ecclesiastical union any better than a secular union? Is an ecclesiastical boycott any holier than any other boycott? For shame! Have the ministry forgotten the statement of Christ, that his "kingdom is not of this world;" and that, "ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them; but so shall it not be among you"? And so it is not among the ministers of Jesus Christ when they are attending to their ministry.

Persuading men, preaching the Word faithfully, accompanied by the power of the Holy Spirit,—these are the agencies, and the only agencies for good, put into the hands of the ministry of God. But in all ages, as the ministry have neglected these, have they sought for civil power, and obtained and used it, not for holy ends, but to most unholy. Men who might once have been able to have given sound counsel upon moral questions, because of their relations to God, become hard, exacting, tyrannical agents of Satan to enforce by civil power the dogmas of their councils, and to anathematize every honest dissenter.

These councils will not stop with boycotting political movements not to their minds, which is a sufficient evil; they will legislate upon religious matters, and demand the enforcement of religious institutions by civil power, and require that offenders be properly punished; and so the Inquisition is the legitimate child of such councils, and the men who preach that "vengeance and recompense belong to God," take it upon themselves to act for God, and become very zealous for his honor in things not delegated to them. The worst, the most cruel and wicked machine this world has ever seen, is an ecclesiastical council wielding power over the civil State. The Church and the State should be kept forever separate. Both have legitimate ends, and only attain them when separate. Both are degraded by a union. The State is ordained of God in matters civil, and is to be implicitly obeyed by all citizens,—Christian or otherwise—in all matters relating to civility, the relations of man to man. But in things moral or religious it has no dominion whatever. The statement of Christ, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's," clearly separates them. The things of God are not to be rendered to Caesar—the State, nor to God through Caesar, but directly to God. The Bible abounds in clear distinctions of these two powers. Daniel and his fellows were definitely required by God to submit to the power of Babylon in all matters civil. Jer. 27. But the same God sustained by mighty miracles the refusal of these same persons to submit to religious requirements enforced by civil law. See Dan. 3 and 6.

In the words of your correspondent, slightly changed, we say: "It is difficult to foresee the enormous influence for evil that this council will exercise both on the Church and on the world."

Gibbon, the able historian of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, has recorded for the profit of this generation the workings of ecclesiastical councils in the earlier centuries, that we would do well just now to review.

G. B. STARR.
