THE following report is from the New Zealand *Biblical Research Society.* This article is very interesting as showing a movement towards church and state union in Australia and New Zealand, also the position of the principal body in that land on the international religious contest as well:

Under the above leading your correspondent, president of the 11th annual formation of the organization of the Council of Churches in Victoria, and its eight yearly presentations, made a similar organization for New Zealand with the important—"what of the Protestant churches in Auckland will be first to take the lead." To all of whom we wish to offer our solicitations, a few remarks upon each resolution for the readers' consideration of the following reasons, and to the fact that the first Protestant church that will be first of this institution, this will be the first to step away from its earlier standards of Protestantism,— "the Bible, and the Bible alone, and the entire freedom of the individual conscience to receive or reject the teaching," to the position of the papist, "the State, the country and the ecclesiastical council."

In the Victorian Council each church is to be represented in proportion to its numbers, and the primary object of the council, as it stands, is "to review the various political meanings as they are brought before Parliament, so that the churches supporting it may pass their resolutions at. If they decided that any proposed measure was in harmony with God's will, they will support it; if not, they will oppose it with utmost influence and vigor. In other words, we have the spectacle of ministers of Jesus Christ ecclesiastical only to preach the word of God to the people, forming themselves into a political caucus, and instituting a religious boycott against any party or measure as out of harmony with the mind of the council. In this a purpose can for this ministry is to enforce the influence given them by their call to preach the gospel, and in fact in order to do so more effectively.

In an ecclesiastical boycott any holler than one organized in a political caucus? Have the ministry forgotten the statement of Christ, that it is "kingdom is not of this world;" and that, "ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them; but so shall it not be among you"? And is it not time for the reminder that Jesus Christ when they are attentive to their ministry—

No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. Tim. 2:4.

That man that has been called of God to preach the Gospel, and yet who joins and appeals to the Government to enforce certain things which are wholly religious,— when ministers plead for Sunday laws, so that they can have "a rest day once in the week," they thereby admit that the gospel which they preach has not the power of God. The form is there, but they deny it. Is human power they the power of God; for no one but an instrument of the God of God to back human eyes, and who knows in his own spirit that power is worth nothing to God by asking for human power to supplement it?

Again: we have read that there is one lawgiver and one judge, namely, Christ and God; but what right have men in the exercise of their own consciousness, to be really sitting in judgment on the law, and judging the laws of God as to their fitness for human judgment upon what they shall be required to do? To put the laws of God into human codes, is to put, in the place of the divine lawgiver, a man, to represent his place as judge. But this is the characteristic of "that man of sin." It is the arroyo of apostacy, for the apostle said that the man of sin—

Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that in his day will culminate in the man of sin, who not only sets up the man of the papacy and exalted himself against all that is called God, and so sitting in the temple of God, that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God. 2 Thess. 2:4. Daniel, the prophet says of this power—"little horn of the fourth beast of the seventh chapter, Dan. 7:8, that it is described: "And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws." Dan. 7:25.

The Roman Catholic Church is the result of the attempt to build up Christianity by means of the State. Whatever legislation asked for and received by the church, made the Papacy. Therefore wherever any man, professed Protestant, looks to the law, and by the legislation be asked of religion, no matter to what degree, they are simply following the steps of the Papacy.

Nay, they are doing more than simply following in the steps of the Papacy; they are joining it, and becoming a part of it. And they are denying the very essence of the Papacy. And this is still further emphasized by the fact that it was legislation upon the Sunday that made the Roman Catholic Church. It is that which is the Catholic Church's boast, made at this day. Read a "Plain Talk about the Protestantism of To-day," from the *Front of May. Rev.'s* and find the following:—

While it will be remembered that there claim that a Church of God changed the day is not the Protestant worship, consists—not may be—the Protestant institutions wholly depend, we mean on Baptism, "Sunday is our mark of authority; the Sabbath, which is Thursday. It was the Catholic Church which by the authority of Jesus Christ, has transferred this rest to the Sunday in remembrance of the resurrection of our Lord. Then in the observance of the Sunday they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of the Catholic Church.

Any amount of history might be quoted, if we said just now, to show that the observance of Sunday instead of the seventh day as the Sabbath, is the distinguishing mark of the Roman Catholic Church. Therefore when professed Protestants not only keep it themselves, but call upon the law to compel others to keep it, they distinctly fall into line and enforce its observance by means of the State, they are joining hands with the Papacy.

In the words of your correspondent, I warn them to beware lest they become the enormous influence for evil which Romanism has been, both on the Church and on the world.

"Rome, the arch historian of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, has recorded for the information of this generation, the workings of ecclesiastical councils in the earlier centuries, that we would do well just now to review."

G. B. STANE.
