THE first week in April was observed by the adherents of the American Sabbath Union as a week of prayer for Sunday observance. The topics which were suggested for ministerial attention during this week were:—

First:—That the influence of the World's Fair may be on the side of Sabbath observance, morality and righteousness.

Second:—That the tide of Sabbath desecration may be stayed.

Third:—That the value and beneficence of the Christian Sabbath may be better understood and appreciated, and pastors and people be faithful in maintaining it.

Fourth:—That the right of the great armies of employes in railroad and postal service to a Sabbath of rest may be protected.

It is noticeable that while this is intended to be in the interest of Sunday observance the term "Sunday" nowhere appears, but instead the word "Sabbath" is used, which distinctly applies to another day. It should be remembered that this is addressed to ministers who are well read and well-informed men. What a strange discrepancy for intelligent men to fall into in addressing an all-wise Deity! Who is deceived by this? Themselves, or God, or no one?
