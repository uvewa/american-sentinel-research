THERE seems to be a growing determination on the part of the Sunday-closing element to boycott the Fair in any case— whether open or closed. If it is open on Sunday they will boycott it from a misguided taken idea of religious duty; if closed they will boycott because the management may have been willing that Sunday opening should rule.

It is noticeable that while the interest tended to be in the Interest of Sunday observance a form in the "Sunday Sabbath" appears, but instead the word "Sabbath," which, entirely defunct applicable to Sunday by the advocates of the day. And this is addressed to ministers who are supposed to know "the Scriptures." What a strange discrepancy for intelligent men to make! From the *Herald's* own *Wis.*Daily: Who is deceived by this? the advocates or the People?

We publish it for our readers.
