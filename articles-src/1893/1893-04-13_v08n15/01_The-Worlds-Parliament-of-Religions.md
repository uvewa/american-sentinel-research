THE chairman of the General Committee on Religious Congresses of the World's first Parliament of Religions has given for publication a general programme of the sessions of the parliament, which continue from Monday, September 11 to Wednesday, September 27. The influence which this assemblage of religionists will have on the formation and advancement of a generally accepted religious formality throughout the world, will make the convening of this parliament one of the marked events in the world's history.

THE first day is to be set apart for addresses of welcome and fraternal fellowship. The subject for the second day is "God," in history, in the theistic teachings of the various historic faiths, in modern science and modern theistic thought,—with a presentation of the doctrines and history of the Catholic Church.

The third day the subject is to be "Man,"—his nature, dignity, imperfection, place in the universe, nature of life, spirituality, immortality and perfectibility;—various views of future life, human brotherhood, relations and duties to God. In the morning, afternoon, and evening, respectively, the Christian Church (Church of the Disciples), the New Jerusalem Church, and the Jewish Church, are to present their doctrines and history.

THE Hebrews have accepted an opportunity to be heard in the Congress with satisfaction and have organized their committees of preparation already. In the report of a meeting of prominent Hebrews, from all over the United States, called at Chicago to arrange and perfect plans, it is said:—

> An appeal will be sent out stating that since the existence of their religion, no such opportunity has ever been extended to the Hebrew to set himself right before the world, and that the time is opportune to correct many grievous misconceptions regarding Judaism. A committee was appointed to name the speakers and the subjects for discussion.

These subjects have not yet been published. It would be a dramatic incident, indeed, if some Rabbi, full of the beauties, glories, and terrors, of Sinaitic lore would give an exposition of the fourth commandment.

THE subject for the fourth day is "Religion Essentially Characteristic of Humanity," as shown by, and in the essential expression of the relations between God and man,—the supreme end and office of religion,—religion and religious worship represented by various faiths,—religion as distinguished from moral life,—spiritual forces in human progress, and certainties in religion. The United Brethren Church presents its history and doctrine in the morning and the Reformed Episcopal in the afternoon.

The fifth day is to be occupied with the consideration of "Systems of Religion,"—importance of the serious study of all systems of religion,—rules and conditions of such a study,—history and present state of the study,—dead religions and what they have bequeathed,—to what degree has each religion justified the God of all the earth in the historic evolutions of the race,—the vital, practical, deficiencies of each religion; these deficiencies to be set forth in each case by some representative of the religion discussed. In the morning of this day the doctrines of the Universalist Church are to be set forth and in the evening the Jewish Church has the time again.

THE study for the sixth day is "Sacred Books of the World,"—the sacred books as literature,—religion interpreted by the poets,—what the Jewish, Christian, and other sacred literatures have wrought for mankind,—the penitential psalms of all races a revelation of common needs. The Unitarian Church in the morning and afternoon, and once more the Jewish Church in the evening.

The seventh day of the session, Sunday, September 17, the subject is "Religion and the Family,"—the marriage bond,—education of children—the religious home,—need of a religious rest-day. In the afternoon and evening the Presbyterian Church presents its doctrines.

From this it will be seen that the exhibit of religions is not to be closed on any day of the week, but continues without rest or cessation throughout the seventeen days. To be independent of the Sunday closing of the Fair, the meetings are all to be held in the new Art Palace on the lake front.

THE subject for the eighth day is "The Religious Leaders of Mankind," the incarnation idea,—incarnations claimed by different religions, their history and worth,—the sympathy of religions.

The ninth day, "Religion in its Relations to the Natural Sciences and to Arts and Letters,"—can the knowledge of religion be scientific?—how philosophy and the natural sciences can give aid to the science of religion,—how the science of religion gives aid to other sciences,—religion and music. The Evangelical Association presents its doctrines in the morning, the Friends Church in the afternoon, and the Protestant Episcopal Church in the evening.

THE tenth day the subject will be "Religion in its Relation to Morals,"—essential oneness of ethical ideas among all men,—agnostic notions of conscience, duty and right,—relations of religion to the chastening and perfecting of human nature,—ethical systems and ethical types produced by various historic faiths,—different schemes for the restoration of fallen or faulty man,—general belief in the need of vicarious sacrifices. Morning, afternoon and evening the Protestant Episcopal Church continues the presentation of its doctrine and history.

"Religion and Social Problems" occupy the eleventh day with a discussion of religion and labor,—religion and wealth, religion and purity,—religion and temperance,—purity, the erring and criminal classes,—comparative benefits conferred upon woman by the different religions. The Reformed Church in the United States presents its doctrines in the morning and afternoon.

THE twelfth day is given to a consideration of "Religion and Civil Society,"—love of country,—observance of law,—loyalty to institutions and rulers,—perils of great cities,—is present day religion adequate to meet the requirements and dangers of modern life?

The evening will be occupied with a presentation of the religious mission and needs of the African race; in the morning, the African Methodist Episcopal Church; in the afternoon, the Orthodox Friends.

The thirteenth day "Religion and the Love of Mankind," the fraternity of peoples,—duties of European and American nations toward China,—international justice and amity,—arbitration instead of war,—religious mission of English-speaking nations. Morning, afternoon, and evening, the Society of Christian Endeavor presents its history and work.

The fourteenth day of the session, Sunday, the 24th, "The Present Religious Condition of Christendom,"—what religion has wrought for America. In the afternoon the Society of Christian Endeavor again occupies the time, and in the evening, the Evangelical Church of North America.

The subject for the fifteenth day is "Religious Reunion of Christendom,"—its desirability, principles, obstacles, and encouragements.

In the morning the Evangelical Church of North America continues its presentation, and the afternoon is given to the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant in America.

On the sixteenth day the entire range of thought is brought to a focus in the consideration of "The Religious Union of the Whole Human Family,"—the world's religious debt to Asia, Europe and America,—and the points of contact and contrast between the different religions disclosed by the conference.

The Baptist Church occupies the day for the presentation of doctrine.

The subjects for consideration the seventeenth and last day sum up the whole matter, "Elements of Religion as recognized and set forth in the Different Historic Faiths,"—"Characteristics of the Ultimate Religion,"—what is the center of the coming religious unity of mankind?

Immediately following this will be the Missionary Congresses, the Congresses of the Evangelical Alliance and other religious organizations. Farther time is also to be given to denominations not assigned to the period of the parliament for the presentation of doctrine and history.

From a human and intellectual standpoint, the consecutive and cumulative plan of the subjects to be treated in this parliament are remarkably adapted to attain the end sought, that is a consensus of thought and opinion upon a common center for the establishment of a universal man-made religion. That which is expressed here is a philosophic religion. The coming religious unity of mankind, according to this, will be a philosophy, and not the gospel of the Son of God by whom alone there is eternal life, and through whom only we may keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

This is not true religion, but it is full of a lofty enthusiasm. It is the highest development of self-worship to which the human mind has yet attained. It is the flowering of the religio-philosophic thought of the ages. It is the realization of the dream of the Indian Emperor, when twenty centuries ago he called together the magi from all the then known world to his city of Patalipostra. In this age they will do well to emulate the free spirit of King Piyadasa who enjoined upon all in their discussions and lives to revere their own religion and abstain from reviling others. As a lineal delegate from this ancient Parliament of Religions, the Buddha Gaya-Maha-Bodhi Society of Calcutta sends its Secretary. If the mystic white-robed Buddhist represents faithfully the thought that has come down to him through the centuries it would be interesting indeed to hear his views upon "The Observance of Law" in reference to "The Need of a Religious Rest-day." Will this last Parliament of Religious remember and advocate the brotherhood of man, or only the sisterhood of religions?
