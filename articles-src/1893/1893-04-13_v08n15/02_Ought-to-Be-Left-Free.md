THE utter confusion of ideas that prevails in the minds of those who advocate the teaching of the Scripture concerning Sunday, is well illustrated by the following reference made by the Boston Sunday *Herald*, to a petition being circulated by the Sunday Protective League of Massachusetts to the National Commission asking that the railroads of that State be restricted in the matter of Sunday traffic.

Under our construction of the Mosaic law it applies to everybody.

It ought to be understood by everybody that there is no such thing as any "Mosaic law" applying to Sunday. Sunday is a day entirely unknown to the Scripture by that name, and as the institution known by that Scriptural name is one of the working days. The only law for its observance is ecclesiastical. The commandment which says, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work," is obeyed this is the very way in which the Sunday is desecrated; and by the desecration of every other Sunday league in the world, and every other ecclesiastical mandate requiring its observance.

But while the *Herald* does not appear, and have a doubt of the application of the Mosaic law to Sunday, still it has the common, but very, very erroneous idea that Sabbath rest, upon that day. It says:

It is eminently desirable, both upon moral and physical grounds, that one day in seven at least should be accorded a day of rest, and we imagines that all reasonable persons, even those who are disinclined to look upon the matter from a religious outlook, that this shall be secured. It is its conservation as a day of rest which presents the problem. . . . The problem of the rest day is now a more difficult one than it has ever been before . . . under the conditions as they existed some forty or fifty years ago it was an easy matter. . . . Since then there has grown up and developed an enormous system of transportation and modern times, and to our densely populated cities.

There is an inconsistency to many of the petitions against Sunday opening of the Fair, and alleged purpose the suppression of Sunday work. Their signers never raise their voices against other forms of Sunday work in many of the cities, even a Sunday newspaper is performed before 12 o'clock to satisfy these very Sunday-closing people, against which annihilation has not been demanded at the hands of the law. The largest circulation in many cities is the Sunday paper. In the principal city in the world from which these objections have been sent to the Congress some years ago, though not recently, the morning newspaper used to be published on Sunday. A Boston paper was a city where the ordinary decencies of Sunday was in this regard as in any great polity within our national borders.

Having organized one inconsistency by the matter of enforced Sunday rest, our friends consistently continue:—

Instance of inconsistency in these terms is the case of the railroad. Its opponents to the rest day do not seem to have included the post-office as among those that should be reformed. With the steam railroads enforced to rest on Sundays, the electric roads would be running, as some of the roads the Sunday trains are the best paying, and their discontinuance simply means that, so far as the railroads go, business that is in its open other days, and we simply have a different state of things, to wit, that horse-cars is greater than during the week days? But this is not correct. The steam railroad companies, unlike the post-office, are not into strong relief,—we will not say that the inconsistency is any greater in the one case than it is in the other.

In view of the difficulties which our contemporary acknowledges, hear what the *Herald* concludes that:—

We should say at once by the author, who tries to put up a claim for Sabbath reform or the putting of obstacles in the way of its observance, and so as to deprive anybody,— rightly prohibited, and we would include a few other things now permitted while the Sunday zealots see no evil in them, such as giving away of society papers as well as the sale of food. But even we believe that the effort to secure Sunday rest, in the fullest sense of the word, is to be kept up; for, if we are to withdraw with the conduct of the railroads we must also face the question of the post-office, and that brings us to the matter of legislation. We believe that while such a construction may be put on the State law as to require Sunday rest from employers of labor—

This is not bad from the standpoint of one who believes in paternalism in government. But with the rest-day spirit seeking to use its own inconsistency, proceeds to another paragraph to express a most liberal sentiment, as follows:—

We should say also that nothing is more important than the proper convenience of their patrons and in connection with, as some of the roads run trains open Sundays during the summer months exclusively, the idea of giving the overworked businessmen and clerks—"give to the trains a plea of charity." There is an inconsistency in this. This is also in favor of the individual having time to thus enjoy themselves. The national holidays when special excursion trains are run on roads as in Chicago, New York, Portland and San Francisco, are in the same category, an instance of inconsistency that ought to face the advocates. We should say that if there was any first law of Sunday rest it should be general. To be consistent the advocates of enforced Sunday rest say they did not raise so many voices in opposition to the running of Sunday newspapers, and in the interest of true consistency any change made should be in the direction of allowing the individual to determine his own action in respect of Sunday, rather than in the direction of enforcing upon him a compliance with the wishes and desires, for most of the law of any religious body. Manifestly this is the more American policy of the two.

As between running more Sunday trains than there should be or attempting to restrict the railroads to fewer, more Sunday trains than there should be or attempting to restrict the railroads to fewer, we think that the public sense would be inclined to meet the demands of the patrons of the roads, rather than attempt by stringent regulation, that the people should be permitted to ride on Sunday. Now, as to the railroads, —in the matter of using steam and street car on Sundays. They are more used in the cities than in other matters." It is difficult to say just what this amounts to.

The whole thing resolves into this: "What is the purpose of Sunday? Is it a sacred day, it is the keeping of the commandment of God? If so, how is it to be kept?" The answer is, the Bible says by the World's Fair, practically reproducing the American Sabbath. If, however, it was to be regarded by the people, then to consider the various interests affected, and legislation in the matter at all. But if so such obligation is only religious, it has no place at all in the civil law.
