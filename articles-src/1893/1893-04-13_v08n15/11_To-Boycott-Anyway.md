THE St. Louis Globe Democrat has these paragraphs from Terre Haute, Indiana:—

> The Rev. R. V. Hunter, of the Central Presbyterian Church of this city, who represented the American Sabbath Union and the Young People's Society for Christian Endeavor before the committee of Congress in opposition to the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, says it has been fully determined to test the legality of the action which the directory is reported to be in favor of taking.
>
> The sentiment of opposition, he says, is as strong now as ever it was. He believes that from a financial standpoint the Fair management would be unwise in having an open Fair, even if they could do so legally. He has been in correspondence with the editors of thirty religious newspapers, and without exception they are not only opposed to open gates on Sunday, but believe Christian people win all refrain from visiting the Fair at any time if the gates are open. Several of these editors are squeamish on the boycott phase, but express their intention to advise their readers of their own views on the subject. Mr. Hunter says the boycott idea is repulsive to him, but that the action of Christian people in this direction does not come under the description of a boycott. It would be no more a boycott than is observed by Christian people who conscientiously refrain from going to saloons or gambling houses. He is of the belief that should it be decided to open the Fair an expression of opinion will be made by religious bodies that will cause a falling off in attendance more than enough to offset the receipts on the twenty-five Sundays.
>
> He remarked that the management no longer discusses the Sunday question from the standpoint of its being an accommodation for wage earners, but that it is treated solely with reference to the debit and credit side of the ledger. His estimate is that not more than 100,000 persons will attend on each Sunday who would not pay the same admission money on other days. This would not $1,250,000 for the twenty-five Sundays. He is confident that 1,500,000 or 2,000,000 persons who would have visited the fair not less than three days, will remain away. The minimum loss of receipts, therefore, would be $2,250,000.

There seems to be a growing determination on the part of the Sunday-closing element to boycott the Fair in any case—whether open or closed. If it is open on Sunday they will boycott it from a mistaken idea of religious duty, if closed they will boycott because the management have been willing that Sunday opening should rule.
