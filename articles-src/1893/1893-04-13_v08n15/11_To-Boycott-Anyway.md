THE *St. Louis Globe-Democrat* has these paragraphs from Terre Haute, Indiana:

The Rev. R. V. Hunter, of the Central Presbyterian Church, yesterday urged the matter before the Society for Christian Endeavor before the committee. He spoke in behalf of his church, and said that a boycott of the Fair had been determined to test the loyalty of the action within their conference.

The sentiment of opposition, he says, is as strong among the church people as ever, and, while it was in having an open Fair, even if they could do nothing more, and while the members would not with exception they are not only opposed to any member of their society visiting the Fair, but will refrain from visiting the Fair at any time if it is open on Sundays. He urged the members of the society and the different congregations to advise their readers of their own views on that question.
