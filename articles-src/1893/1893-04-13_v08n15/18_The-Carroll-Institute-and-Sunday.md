THE Carroll Institute, a Catholic club of Washington, D. C., has lately built and moved into a fine new club-house, with all the luxuries, conveniences, and useful adjuncts of library, gymnasium, billiard room, bowling alley, etc. Now comes a faction which wishes these privileges of the club-house closed to the members on Sunday. This club numbers nearly six hundred men of the Catholic Church, and is a notable assistant to the church, Georgetown College, and the Catholic University. The question has been referred to Cardinal Gibbons and the Presidents of Georgetown and the Catholic Universities before presenting it for a vote of the club. There is an intense interest in the matter among the members. The students of Georgetown College are in the habit of indulging in out-door games on Sunday with the approval of their superiors, and Bishop Keane, of the Catholic University, is reported to have said that the only question was one of good policy, in view of the sentiment of a part of the people in the matter. It remains to be seen now in this exigency how an authoritative Roman Catholic position on the question of "Sunday observance" is to be avoided.
