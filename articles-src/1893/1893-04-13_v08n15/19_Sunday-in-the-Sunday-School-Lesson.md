In the International Sunday school lesson for March 5, on "Keeping the Sabbath," as published in the New York Examiner, the writer says: "Christians, as a rule, observe another day for rest than the Jews did. For this change there is no direct specific statement in the New Testament. Sunday is here and has to be accounted for." This is done in these words:

> Some have traced to Constantine's edict the change in day. But all who are students know Constantine's character. He was ever politic rather than positive. And the early Christians were not easily turned from principle. Persecutions had been prevalent and men had died for their faith. The reasonable view is that Constantine tried to unite the Christian worship on Sunday with the heathest worship on the same day. He was not the man to revolutionize. If we had no other historical proof of the observance of Sunday before his day his edict would show its existence in its spirit of adopting existing customs.
>
> Christmas and Sunday have a common basis. Why should they not have a similar observance?
>
> Enforced Sunday observance is very properly deprecated; he says, "Law can not enforce observance. It can and ought to protect observers."

But this acknowledgment of the derivation and claims of Sunday to sacredness is a just one. They are all based on the desire of Constantine, and those like him still earlier, to adapt their observance to the popular heathen custom which was practiced around them. The parallel as to Christmas is correct. Both are the continuation of pagan holidays. Sunday is therefore not the Sabbath, and has no claim to be so-called or observed.
