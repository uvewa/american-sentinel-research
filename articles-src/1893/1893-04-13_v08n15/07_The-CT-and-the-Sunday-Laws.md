THE agitation of the Sunday laws before the Pennsylvania legislature is bearing its practical correspondence of the local press.

The quiet and staid borough of New Brighton has been discussing the questions of enforced Sunday closing of certain enterprises not included in the usual category of licensed liquor resorts, there has been a good deal of discussion in regard to the place of religion in our Commonwealth. We believe that the question is more important in its broadest applications than many persons, and among them a correspondent of the Times, has the air of being thoroughly in earnest, and deserves credit for thoroughness in his position, even though his position may be wrong, with emphasis on such as teach a compulsory observance of Sunday as a matter of religion.

There have been large petitions sent before it, but no action has been taken by the organization of the local press.
