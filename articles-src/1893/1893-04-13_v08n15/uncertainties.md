## OCR Transcription Issues

### Page 2 — "Ought to Be Left Free"
- OCR reads "13 o'clock Saturday night" (line 115) — this is almost certainly an OCR error for "12 o'clock" (midnight). Transcribed as "13 o'clock" to preserve what the OCR captured, but this is likely a scan/recognition error for "12."
- **Confidence:** LOW for "13 o'clock" — likely "12 o'clock" in original.

### Page 6 — "Civil Government and Religion" (Scripture quotations)
- The scripture quotations contain unusual verb forms ("judge," "receiveeth," "judgment") that appear to be OCR artifacts or archaic usage in the original. Transcribed as found.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — these may be intentional archaisms or OCR errors.

### Page 7 — "Fast-day in Massachusetts"
- OCR reads "sinon-pure puritanic mind" — likely "simon-pure puritanic mind." Transcribed as found in OCR ("sinon-pure").
- **Confidence:** LOW — "sinon-pure" is almost certainly an OCR error for "simon-pure."

### Page 8 — Health Foods and Railway Advertisements
- Pages 7-8 contained extensive advertisements (Battle Creek Bakery Co. Health Foods, Grand Trunk Railway, book advertisements for "Complete Dictionary of Synonyms and Antonyms," "Sacred Chronology") that were skipped per instructions. The price table for the Health Foods advertisement was heavily garbled in OCR (lines 488-497) and not transcribed.

### Article 21: "That $1.50 Watch"
- This short item is more of an editorial notice about a past advertisement than a substantive article. It is included as its own file per instructions to give every item its own file. The categorization under "Religious Liberty / Freedom of Conscience" is a best effort; the item has no clear connection to the publication's main themes.

## Masthead Note
- OCR reads "ALONEO T. JONES" for the editor's name — clearly an OCR error for "ALONZO T. JONES." Corrected in masthead.
