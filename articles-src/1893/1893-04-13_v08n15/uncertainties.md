# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, April 13, 1893 (v08n15)

## General Notes

This issue presented significant OCR challenges throughout. The scan quality, while legible at high level, made precise word-level transcription difficult in many passages. The text is dense, in small type, and printed in narrow columns typical of 19th century newspapers.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 01: "The World's Parliament of Religions"
- **Page 1, Column 1, Paragraph 2:** "a history, in the blanket, of teachings" — "blanket" may be "broadest" or another word. The scan is ambiguous.
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Transcribed as:** "in the blanket"
  - **Confidence:** LOW — word shape unclear
- **Page 2, Top left:** "scarcely matched Buddhistical the thought" — "Buddhistical" is uncertain; may be a different word.

- **Page 8:** Collection of news items; multiple passages uncertain due to small type
  - **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM throughout

## Overall Assessment

This issue was particularly challenging to transcribe due to the density of the text and the scan quality. Many articles contain passages where individual words could not be confirmed with high confidence. A comparison with a physical copy of the original would be highly valuable for verification of numerous readings throughout this issue.
