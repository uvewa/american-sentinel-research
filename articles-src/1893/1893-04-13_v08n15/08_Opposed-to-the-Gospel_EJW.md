WHERE there is legislation in regard to matters of religion, there must of necessity be the use of force, of law and there is a penalty to no law at all. Now, in legislating in regard to religion, that is, in legislating upon what is religious, is directly opposed to the spirit of the gospel, but because those do not know it we want to make it clear to them.

Truer. When men are brought to think that the State has a right to legislate upon matters of religion, to enforce its observance, and to punish for acts of disobedience, then religion is brought down to a merely human level. The State thus teaches them that there is nothing more to religion than it can enforce. But it can not reach a man's heart, and therefore the idea is spread that religion—

"All that the civil power can do is in regard to religion is to command a man to believe. Faith works by love. But that which is of love is not of force, therefore that which is not of love is sin, and religion and force when compelled and forced is sin. So then, when Government control, and it does nothing when it comes to matters of religion it is simply using its power to compel people to sin. Religion legislation is therefore directly opposed to the gospel."

Now 3 Tim. 2:1, "This know also, that in the last days who have 'a form of godliness,' but deny 'the power thereof.'" Tim. 2:4. The gospel is the power of God; in the case of those who make an appeal to the Government to enforce certain things which are wholly religious,— when ministers plead for Sunday laws, so that they can have "a rest day once in the week," they thereby admit that the gospel which they preach has not the power of God. The form is there, but they deny it. Is human power they the power of God; for no one but an instrument of the God of God to back human eyes, and who knows in his own spirit that power is worth nothing to God by asking for human power to supplement it?

Again: we have read that there is one lawgiver and one judge, namely, Christ and God; but what right have men in the exercise of their own consciousness, to be really sitting in judgment on the law, and judging the laws of God as to their fitness for human judgment upon what they shall be required to do? To put the laws of God into human codes, is to put, in the place of the divine lawgiver, a man, to represent his place as judge. But this is the characteristic of "that man of sin." It is the arroyo of apostacy, for the apostle said that the man of sin—

Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that in his day will culminate in the man of sin, who not only sets up the man of the papacy and exalted himself against all that is called God, and so sitting in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God. 2 Thess. 2:4.

Daniel, the prophet says of this power— "little horn of the fourth beast of the seventh chapter, Dan. 7:8, that it is described: "And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws." Dan. 7:25.

The Roman Catholic Church is the result of the attempt to build up Christianity by means of the State. Whatever legislation asked for and received by the church, made the Papacy. Therefore wherever any man, professed Protestant, looks to the law, and by the legislation he asked of religion, no matter to what degree, they are simply following the steps of the Papacy.

Nay, they are doing more than simply following in the steps of the Papacy; they are joining it, and becoming a part of it. And they are denying the very essence of the Papacy. And this is still further emphasized by the fact that it was legislation upon the Sunday that made the Roman Catholic Church. It is that which is the Catholic Church's boast, made at this day. Read a "Plain Talk about the Protestantism of To-day," from the *Front of May. Rev's* and find the following:—

While it will be remembered that there claim that a Church of God changed the day is not the Protestant worship, consists—not may be—the Protestant institutions wholly depend, we mean on Baptism, "Sunday is our mark of authority; the Sabbath, which is Thursday. It was the Catholic Church which by the authority of Jesus Christ, has transferred this rest to the Sunday in remembrance of the resurrection of our Lord. Then in the observance of the Sunday they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of the Catholic Church.

Any amount of history might be quoted, if we said just now, to show that the observance of Sunday instead of the seventh day as the Sabbath, is the distinguishing mark of the Roman Catholic Church. Therefore when professed Protestants not only keep it themselves, but call upon the law to compel others to keep it, they distinctly fall into line and enforce its observance by means of the State, they are joining hands with the Papacy.

In the words of our warning against doing such a thing, and against in any way recognizing such laws when they are made. He who will read the whole of the fourteenth chapter of Revelation will see that it deals with this line reaching down to the coming of the Lord. It prefaces the last proclamation of the gospel:

And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and of the Lamb; and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever; and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

This warning against the worship of the beast and his image is a denunciation of any professed Protestantism with the gospel, because as we have shown in this article, the making of and the enforcing religious legislation is the directly deny the very essence of Protestantism, it is to deny the power of God. It is the denial of the Creator. God is the Creator of the earth, and as the Creator, by that He is the Rightful Owner, and the Sovereign of all. Therefore wherever there is any law calling upon man to observe by law the Church along in its own work, the power of God preserved in its purity the proper and sufficient motive to act in respect to the manner for those days. It is to persuade the individual—"I am the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ as the only righteousness before the Lord will send it, and say, "Thy faith hath saved thee." Then when the Lord shall send forth, the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory." E. J. W.
