THE chairman of the General Committee on Religious Congresses of the World's first Parliament of Religions has given for publication a general programme of the session of the parliament, which continues from Monday, September 11 to Wednesday, September 27. The elaborate scope which this assemblage of religionists will have and the freedom and advancement of a generally accepted religious fraternity throughout the world, will make the convening of this parliament one of the marked events in the world's history.

The first day is to be set apart for addresses of welcome and formal organization. The subject for the second day is "God," a history, in the blanket, of teachings of the various historic faiths, in modern terms and modern thought therewith,—and a consideration of the doctrines and history of each faith.

The third day the subject is to be "Man,"—his nature, dignity, inseparateness, place in the universe, nature of life, spirituality, immortality and perfectibility;—various views of futures of life, human brotherhood, relations and duties to God.

In the morning, afternoon, and evening, respectively, the Christian Catholic Church (of the Disciples), the New Jerusalem Church, and the Jewish Church are to present their doctrines and history.

The Hebrews have accepted an opportunity to be heard in the Congress with satisfaction and have organized their contributions of preparation already. In the report of a meeting of prominent Hebrews, from all over the United States, called at Chicago to arrange and perfect plans, it is said:

An appeal will be sent out stating that since the existence of the race, no such opportunity and honor has ever been extended to the Hebrews to set forth to the world at the same time with an opportunity to correct many grievous misconceptions regarding Judaism. A committee was appointed to make the syllabus and the subjects for investigation.

These subjects have not yet been published. It would be a dramatic incident, indeed, if some Rabbi, full of the beauties, glories, and terrors, of Sinaiitic lore would give an exposition of the fourth commandment.

THE subject for the fourth day is "Religion and Humanity," as shown by, and in the material expression of the relations between God and man,—the purposes and offices of religion,—religion and religious worship represented by various faiths,—religion as distinguished from life,—religion as organic in human progress, and certitudes in religion. The United Brethren Church presents in the latter part of the day its doctrines, and the Reformed Episcopalians in the afternoon.

The fifth day is to be occupied, with the consideration of "Systems of Religion;" the experiences of the serious study of all systems of religion,—rules and conditions of such a study,—history and present state of the study,—dead religions and what they have bequeathed,—to what degree has each religion justified the God of all the earth in the historic evolution of the races—the vital, practical, definite principles of each religion; those deficiencies that are to be set right by modern representatives of the religions discussed. In the morning of this day the doctrines of the Universalist Churches are to be set forth and in the evening the Jewish Church has the last session.

On the sixth day the day's subject is "Sacred Books of the World,"—the sacred books and scriptures of the world—their purpose,—what the Jewish, Christian, and other sacred literatures have wrought for mankind,—the peerless psalm of all races a revelation of common needs. The Unitarian Church in the morning and afternoon, and once more the Jewish Church in the evening.

The seventh day of the session, Sunday, September 17, the subject is "Religion and the Family,"—the marriage bond,— education of children—the religion of the home—the faith of a religious community—its influence in the afternoon and evening the Presbyterian Church presents its doctrines.

From this it will be seen that the exhibit of religions is not to be closed on any day of the week, but continues without rest or cessation throughout the seventeen days. To be independent of the Sunday closing of the Fair, the meetings are all to be held in the new Art Palace on the lake front.

The subject the eighth day is "The Religious Leaders of Mankind," the intellectual idea,—internationalism of the different religions, their history and worth,—the sympathy of religions.

The ninth day, "Religion in Its Relations to the Natural Sciences and to Art and Labor,"—are the kingdoms of biology and religion in scientific?—how philosophy and science relate to belief and knowledge—the science of religion—how the science of religion gives aid to other sciences—science and morals. The Evangelical Association presents its doctrines in the morning, the Friends' Church in the afternoon, and the Protestant Episcopal Church in the evening.

The tenth day the subject will be "Religion in Relation to Morals,"—argument on content of ethical ideas among all men,—agnostic notions of conscience— the chastenings and perfecting of conscience,—natural systems and ethical types professed by various historic civilizations,—reformed schemes for the restoration of faulty morals,—organized belief in the need of vicious and vain sacrifices. Morning, afternoon and evening the Protestant Episcopal Church continues the presentation of its doctrines and the presentation.

"Religion and Social Problems" occupy the eleventh day,—the church as liberator of religion and labor,—religion and wealth, religion and party,—religion and benevolence,—property, the erring and criminal classes,—comparative benefits conferred upon women by the different religions. The Reformed Church in the United States presents its doctrines in the morning.

The twelfth day is given to a consideration of "Religion and Civil Law,"— religion to institutions and rulers,—perils of great creeds,—is present day religion fitted to meet the requirements and necessities of modern life?

In the presentation of its subjects on the thirteenth day the culmination of the congresses of the religious mission and influence of religion is approached, including the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

The thirteenth day "Religion and the Love of Mankind," the fraternity of peoples,—union of Europeans and American nations toward China,—international and all nations,—arbitration instead of war,—religious mission of English-speaking nations. Morning, afternoon and evening, the Society of Christian Endeavor presents its history and work.

The fourteenth day of the session, Sunday, Sept. 24th, "The Present Religious Condition of Christendom,"—what religion has wrought for America. In the morning, the Congregational Churches deliver again occupy the time, and, in the evening, the Evangelical Church of North America.

The subject for the fifteenth day,— "Religious Reunion of Christendom,"— its desirability, principles, obstacles, and encouragements.

In the morning the Evangelical Church of North America continues its presentation, and the afternoon is given to the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant of America.

The Baptist Church occupies the day for the presentation of doctrine.

And so on through the sixteenth, seventeenth and last day. The seventeenth and last day sum up the whole congress, the subjects of which are determined and set forth in the Different History Faiths,"—"Ideals and practical methods of the coming religious unity of mankind ? Missionary Congresses, the Congresses of the Evangelical Alliance and other religious organizations. Further time is also to be given to denominations not assigned to the period of the parliament for the presentation of their doctrines.

From a human and intellectual standpoint, the connective and cumulative plan the subjects to be treated in the parliament are remarkably adapted to obtain the end sought, that is a consensus of thought and opinion upon a common center for the establishment of a common religious fraternity. The thought expressed here is a philosophic religion. And a philosophic religion would be, according to this, will be a philosophy, without a center, for men are mortal, by whom alone there is eternal life, and through whom only we may keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

This is not true religion, but it is full of vast significance. It is the logical development of self-worship to which the human mind has yet attained. It is another evidence of the character of the thought of the age. It is the realization of a philosophy almost parallel to that when twenty centuries ago he called together the most from all the then known world to his city of Pataliputra. In this age they will do well to emulate the free spirit of King Piyadama who threw it open to all to their tolerations and lives to sever their own religion and abstain from condemning the creeds of others. Aside from this ancient Parliament of Religions, there is not on record any such Ecumenical Councils as this. The great Catholic councils in Secretary Barrow's opinion, scarcely matched Buddhistical the thought that has come down to him through the centuries. It would be interesting indeed to hear his views upon this topic, "The Need of a Religion of Buddhy." Will not that Parliament of Religions remember and advocate the institution of man, or only the man of God?
