THE Sunday closing movement has evidently captured New Orleans. The *Mail and Express* publishes the *Mail and Express* that there was a wave of moral reform sweeping over the entire country. A movement for the suppression of gambling and the enforcement of the Sunday closing law in that city has been inaugurated in New Orleans. The Ministerial Association of New Orleans is to be in earnest in this matter. An association entitled the New Orleans Sunday Closing League, consisting of 400 of the most reputable citizens, have collected about $6000 for the purpose of procuring guardsmen and for the maintenance of the buildings. It is to be hoped that the tidal wave will increase in volume until the whole country is inundated by pure moral reform.

Is it this fusion of Sunday closing with proper reformatory measures, which has enabled it, to obtain in the ears of the popular mind, outside of the comparatively small element which directly favors Sunday legislation? If this is a good motive for reform which should be civilly enforced, because it is thought to be in conformity with the law of God.

Proposals for the enforcement of Sunday laws has reached Rochester in this State. Rev. Ferdinand L. Anderson, of that city, took advantage of the week of prayer for Sunday observance to press it upon his people. Among some remarks on the "Enforcement of the law in Rochester," he not being the Sunday law. Notice has been given in the newspapers of Rochester that the law will be enforced. What a parody on proper religion, to sell of nominal proclamation by a prayer to give due newspaper notice that they must be suspended, for on a given day investigations will be made. That such a thing be shortly done is enough to brand the whole proceeding as a violation of the law under which such a course is thought justified!

The Carroll Institute, a Catholic club of Washington, D. C., has lately built and moved into a fine new clubhouse, with all the luxuries, conveniences, and useful adjuncts of library, gymnasium, billiard room, bowling alley, etc. Now comes a faction which wishes those privileges of the club-house closed to its members on Sunday. This club numbers nearly six hundred men of the Catholic Church, and is a notable assistant to the church, Georgetown College, and the Catholic University. The question has been referred to Cardinal Gibbons and the Presidents of Georgetown and the Catholic Universities before presenting it for a vote of the club. There is an intense interest in the matter among the members. The students of Georgetown College are in the habit of indulging in out-door games on Sunday with the approval of their superiors, and Bishop Keane, of the Catholic University, is reported to have said that his only requirement was one of good policy, in view of the sentiment in a great many people in this matter. It remains to be seen now in this respect how an authoritative Roman Catholic position on the question of "Sunday observance" is to be avoided.

In the International Sunday school the set for March 4, or "Keeping the Sabbath," as published in the New York *Examiner,* all who remember Christ as a Jew, a rabbi, observe another day for rest than the Jew does. For this change there is no direct proof whatever in the New York *Examiner.*

Sunday is here and has to be accounted for." This is in line there is trouble with some have traced to Constantine's edict the Christian Sabbath. The fact was there an ecclesiastical creation, has been rather more negative, rather than positive. And the early Christian Church had accepted this new creation which had been professed and ours had had for 3,000 years. These have been facts which, we believe have not been sufficiently considered in connection with the heathen worship on the sun day. We believe that if a man could be taken back just before his day his edict would show the observance of the Lord's resurrection day by the Christians and Sunday have a common basis that should not have been a matter of ecclesiastical creation.

Reformed Sunday observance is very properly depreciated, by easy, "Can we not enforce observance. It can and ought to be enforced."

But this acknowledgment of the denomination that Sunday has no divine basis, is a just case. They are all based on the desire of Constantine, and those like him still earlier, to adapt their observance to the popular heathen custom which was practiced around them. One position of its Christian is incorrect. Both are the continuation of pagan Sunday. Sunday is therefore not the Sabbath, and has no basis in the Scriptures.

Christians referred to notice the flood of petitions from the labor organizations of the whole country in reference to the repeal of the legislation closing the World's Fair on Sunday. So far as the apostolic and others' sharing of this petition was concerned, as appeared in the Congressional Record, the contest lies between the socalled orthodox churches on one side and the labor organizations on the other. Congress recognized the voice of the Church and bowed to it. No attention whatever was paid to the request of the organized workingmen. Their voice was ignored entirely. A remarkable result of this now appears in Chicago. The Central Labor Union, supported by a committee of the Board of Directors of the Fair, has decided that, in case the Fair is closed on Sunday, organized labor will work on Sunday that on the six days of a week's labor may be filled, and take the Sabbath as a holiday in which to attend the Fair. This is poetic justice. Were it not upon too serious a subject for lightness and jest to appeal ironically to the sense of humor of every one who can appreciate the bantings of the subject. This proposition of the labor union, that if the Fair is closed on Sunday they will secede in a body from the Sunday-closing party, abstain from visiting the Fair as a matter of religious rest, and abstain from labor on the true Sabbath, evince about themselves apart from the Sunday-closing movement.

A Chicago clergyman cries out, "if the Union is in earnest let them try it. Then we will see if there are to be any in this country!" This preacher should be the Parliamentarian of Religious "Religious Liberty," and "Religion in Relation to Labor," and "Relations of religion to the Government," preferring of human to divine. In connection with this he might well profit the address of Thomas Morgan, representative of organized labor in Chicago, who recently said before the House of Representatives at the last hearing on the Sunday closing of the Fair.
