THE *Intelligencer,* of this city, was first in the post-office in this country among the large daily journals of the country to give the full facts in the interest of the Sunday-law work we have taken place. The letter is written by a man who is not a Seventh-day Adventist, but merely an observer who sees the merits of a clear statement of their case—refused admission June 1890.

*To the Editor of the Post-Intelligencer:*

As a consequence of the trials of the Seventh-day Adventists in the last term of the Circuit Court, considerable interest has been awakened in the public mind, much more it seem to than by any previous trials of similar nature. One evidence of this fact is to be seen in the interest that our county paper is taking in the matter.

We know the public mind in this country being aroused in regard to the just character and standing of the old United States compulsory Sunday observance as receiving much attention by the friends of that day; and also those who oppose the enforcement of Sunday-keeping by the civil law are not silent.

That their cause has been connected with the indictment and prosecution of one people that are of very careful thought. When a class of people or persons is misrepresented, as a natural consequence, others wish to know more about it. That the facts in the case of such is the case in this matter. Now, that the Seventh-day Adventists are misrepresented (unintentionally), by those who might be expected to know better, cannot be denied by any one who knows anything about the true character and principles of a Seventh-day Adventist. We have no spirit of animosity toward those who would place wrong estimations upon our character and organization, but a natural few reasonable facts to be presented. We have rights and it becomes us to assert them when invaded. The constitution of Tennessee, Art. I, under the title of "Bill of Rights," declares thus:—

Section 3, all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no human authority can in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship.

As we contemplate this provision of the fundamental law of Tennessee, we cannot but admire the correct principle of justice it contains. A more profound and explicit guarantee of religious liberty is nowhere found in the constitution of any legislative body. What kind of liberty is here guaranteed? Is it freedom for one religion only? Why no! It guarantees every man the natural and indefeasible right, with the right of human authority to interfere with that liberty. Now, of this famous declaration was thoroughly inculcated upon the minds of all the people of our country, intolerance and bigotry would forever be exiled our country, and this was the mind of the framers of our constitution and of its various amendments. But Mr. Editor, and readers of the *Intelligencer,* after a few considerations of Seventh-day Adventists down here in the twentyfifth district, who observe and keep Saturday as their day of rest, and just as quietly go about their vocations on Sunday—which is their right—have been arrested, tried, imprisoned and worked in the public roads like common felons. Our constitution has been overridden! We maintain our innocence as our right and our belief, and while we submit to any authority inflicted upon us because we do not meet the requirements of the Sunday law, we ask the question: Is it right, is it just? Under the constitution we are strictly right.

The passage of February 17, that the State has a right to legislate upon Sunday, seeking to abolish all legislation having to govern matters of religion, to enforce its observance, and to punish for acts of disobedience of the people; and to destroy the sanctity of the Sabbath. Mr. Editors, the members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and its sympathizers, compass as a part of their organization, and are quite well acquainted with the principles taught by it. The former accusation we deny; for the latter, it would be impossible, from its very nature. We see no more sanctity about Sunday than there is about any other day. And that the keeping of the seventh day, the Sabbath of God and morality, and that it tends to its preservation as a period of labor.

The charge of "Sabbath desecration" by the *Intelligencer* is absolutely a misrepresentation. Every man has a right to keep Sunday if he chooses, but we deny the right of any one to compel us to keep it, for it is the duty of the Government to protect civil, and no more: nor matters in religion. We ask our honorable critics if it is just to deprive us of that right that our charter gives their right to profess Christianity; or, has one has ever testified to that.

And again we ask, where are our judges, juries and witnesses to prevent it from the word of God? We are unable to find such after diligent search, but are forced to the conclusion that it is a manmade institution and a diversion right to dissent from it if we choose. If it were divine institution, would Divinity need the assistance of an earthly court to order that it might be kept holy? Can the civil power make a period keep a day in the way that the Lord commanded? The answer is found to be in the negative. Even though the civil power could command a man to refrain from his civil labor, it day, it could not make him keep it holy.

But it is urged upon us that the letter of the law is concerned Sunday is a civil rest day, and that all Sunday workers can and should be compelled to keep a civil sabbath. It would do them good.

The answer to this argument of the late memorials presented to the public vindicating this State, that Sunday is merely a civil day of rest, has been the assertion as we contemplate any observance of that, are based on the Christian idea of what rest ought to be. To learn the truth in the divine law is of vast value.

To us its true what right that civil authority which makes Sunday laws, laws that is wholly to be repudiated. These civil laws include things wholly religious. Those civil laws are solely between the individual and his God. As such, we are compelled to avoid the jurisdiction of civil government. Christ himself taught the same doctrine and he said those words: "There is a higher than law—the higher law comes directly from heaven for the Adventists. All we want is the first truth we are satisfied, in the world that people shall teach, in the most of all other churches, that we accept no standard as given. Before God, we are assured that Christ of a couple of people on earth would have stood with that any against the laws of an earthly ruler, as were demanded during the Dark Ages. Ask the descendants of the Waldenses in England when the Quakers and Roger Williams were persecuted for dissent, ask Christ himself was prosecuted to death, and we have no alternative but to obey the law and by our law he ought to die."

We read further in the same article in which Christ's sermon to all his people: "Take your offers to to repeal, until this is done, it is the duty of every member of the State to withhold active countenance." And in keeping with this statement, the early Christians instead of surrendering their allegiance to Caesar, should have been working for the repeal of the Roman legislation that invaded their religious belief; and until they succeeded, it was their duty to countenance it. We see the fallacy of such arguments as these and reject them as unworthy of notice, but if there is any authority in the Bible to keep Sunday, we respectfully ask: Where is it?
