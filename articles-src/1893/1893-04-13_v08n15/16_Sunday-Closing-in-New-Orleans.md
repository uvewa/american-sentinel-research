THE Sunday closing movement has evidently captured New Orleans. The Mail and Express publishes this editorial item:

> There seems to be a tidal wave of moral reform sweeping over the entire country. A movement for the suppression of gambling and the enforcement of the law for the preservation of the Sabbath has been inaugurated in New Orleans. The citizens of that too long vice-cursed city appear to be in earnest in this matter. An association entitled the Sunday Closing and Anti-Gambling League, consisting of 450 of the most reputable citizens, have collected about $30,000 for the purpose of prosecuting gamblers and for the maintenance of the Sabbath law. It is to be hoped that this tidal wave will increase in volume until the whole country is inundated by this moral reform movement.

It is this fusion of Sunday closing with proper reformatory measures, which has enabled it to obtain control of the popular mind, outside of the comparatively small element which blindly believes that Sunday observance should be civilly enforced, because it is thought to be in conformity with the law of God.
