A FEW weeks ago, contrary to our usual custom, we admitted to the columns of the AMERICAN SENTINEL an advertisement for a firm in this city in which said firm offered a genuine American-made watch, warranted a good time-keeper, for the small sum of $1.50. No sooner had the advertisement appeared than we were severely taken to task by numerous readers for advertising what they termed "an evident fraud." But the watch is not a fraud, either evident or otherwise. It is a genuine time-keeper, well worth, in our judgment, the price asked for it. This watch is somewhat larger in size than a three-ounce Waltham, being one quarter of an inch broader and also a quarter of an inch thicker than a Waltham. It has an imitation gold case. How well it will hold its color we can not say, but inasmuch as an imitation gold collar button can be purchased for five cents that will wear for months, or even years, it is not unlikely that this watch will, with care, preserve its appearance indefinitely. These watches are too large to be really neat in appearance, but no one who desires a serviceable and fairly accurate time-keeper at a very low figure is likely to be disappointed if he gets one of them. The same watch in nickel case is for sale by jewelers in this city for $1.75. We regret that the harsh criticism of some of our readers has made this notice necessary.
