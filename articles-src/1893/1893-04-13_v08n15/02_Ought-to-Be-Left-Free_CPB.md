The utter confusion of ideas that prevails in the minds of many relative to the teaching of the Scriptures concerning Sunday, is well illustrated by the following reference made by the Boston Sunday Herald, to a petition presented by the Sunday Protective League of Massachusetts to the Railroad Commission asking that the railroads of that State be restricted in the matter of Sunday trains:—

> Under any construction of the Mosaic law of Sunday observance, the running of trains is an offense which should not be tolerated.

It ought to be understood by everybody that there is no such thing as any "Mosaic law of Sunday observance." Sunday is a day entirely unknown to the Scriptures by that name, and is wholly unknown to the Bible except as one of the six working days. The only law for its observance is that part of the fourth commandment which says, "Six days shalt thou labor." This includes Sunday. But this is the very way in which the Sunday Protective League of Massachusetts, and every other Sunday league in the world, is determined the day shall not be observed.

But while the Herald does not apparently have a doubt of the application of the divine law to Sunday, it does not think it necessary, nor even wise to arbitrarily forbid work upon that day. It says:—

> It is eminently desirable, both upon moral and sanitary, as well as upon religious grounds, that those who are in constant active employment should be accorded a day of rest, and we imagine that corporations as well as private individuals having persons in their employ arrange, with rare exceptions, that this shall be secured. It is commonly the case that this is granted on Sunday, not only because of divine injunction, but also because of greater convenience. But a plan of allotting work as to time which would serve its purpose under the conditions as they existed some hundreds or thousands of years ago, and in sparsely settled communities, has little applicability to modern times, and to our densely populated cities.

Growing bolder, the Herald continues:—

> There is an inconsistency to many of the petitions that have been advanced having for their alleged purpose the suppression of Sunday work. Thus it is urged that Sunday newspapers should be prohibited, and yet the greater part of the work upon a Sunday newspaper is performed before 13 o'clock Saturday night, and it is the Monday newspapers, against which anathema has not been declared, that calls chiefly for work during the twenty-four hours of each Sunday. As far as we remember, the only city in this country where the people have been in any way consistent on this newspaper question is in San Francisco, where years ago, though not recently, the morning newspapers appeared every morning except Monday morning, although, curiously enough, this at the time was a city where the ordinary observance of Sunday was as little regarded as in any municipality within our national borders.

Having unearthed one inconsistency in the matter of enforced Sunday rest, our Boston contemporary continues:—

> Another instance of inconsistency in these petitions is found in the fact that the defenders of a Sunday rest do not seem to have included the street car service within the scope of their condemnation. With the steam railroads there is a decided difference between the number of trains run upon week days and those run upon Sunday; in fact, on some of the roads the Sunday trains are run at embarrassingly infrequent intervals. But the street car service is substantially the same on Sundays as it is upon other days, and we dare say that on pleasant Sundays in summer the number of cars in service is greater than during the week days. To ask that these should be prohibited—and this is what consistency would require—would bring out into strong relief—we will not say the absurdity, but the impossibility of such a demand.

In view of the difficulties which surround the question of Sunday regulation, the Herald concludes that—

> the rule that should be laid down by the authorities in acting upon matters of this kind is the sensible one that all productive work, or work that may be termed incidental to production, might be rightly prohibited, and we would include also the sale and purchase of merchandise when the latter operations were not essential to the immediate welfare of society—such as the sale of food. But even this line should be drawn with broad liberality, so as not to interfere with the comfort and well-being of the people. Sunday in this way would be made to serve men as a day of rest and reasonable recreation. But while such a construction would prevent the opening of workshops and wholesale and retail stores for purposes of trade, and would also put an embargo upon the general running of freight trains on Sunday, it would prohibit the carrying of passengers either by steam or street cars.

This is not bad from the standpoint of one who believes in paternalism in government; but the Herald, without seeming to see its own inconsistency, proceeds to show that even this limited regulation of railroads is not necessary. It says:—

> This is in effect the limitation that the railroads already observe. They run no more trains on Sunday than the proper convenience of their patrons require, and the special trains which are run upon Sundays during the summer months—a service that the protestants before the railroad commissioners ask to be cut off as constituting "cheap and coarse excursions"—give in the main a pleasurable, healthy and reasonable change to many thousands of people who could not otherwise find the time to thus enjoy themselves. The railroad companies run a few trains on Sundays to distant points such as Chicago, New York, Portland and the like, but the other Sunday trains that they run are intended almost entirely for suburban travel, and afford opportunities for transportation which could not be cut off without serious detriment to all classes of our people, church-goers as well as others. We should say that if there was any fault to be found with the railroad companies with respect to their suburban train service on Sunday, it was that they did not run quite as many trains as the convenience of their patrons required, and that any change made should be in the direction of improving in this respect their facilities. There has been very little desire shown on their part to set Sunday rules at defiance, for most of the new trains that have been put on have been so placed at the earnest solicitation of those who were regularly to use them.

The argument is that there are now no more Sunday trains than there should be because there are no more than are required to meet the demands of the patrons of the roads. This amounts to about this, namely, that the people should be permitted to do as they please upon Sunday—in the matter of using steam and street cars. This is correct; but why in that more than in other matters? Why limit any legitimate business upon any day? The whole thing resolves itself into this: If Sunday is a sacred day, and if it is the duty of the State to see that it is sacredly regarded by the people, then no considerations of convenience ought to enter into the matter at all. But if no such obligation rests upon the State, then every man ought to be left free to spend the day as he sees fit. There is absolutely no reason why it should be, so far as the law is concerned, different from other days. The only reason that it is different is that it is by many regarded as a religious day; but that is a reason with which the State ought to have nothing to do. The people ought to be left just as free in the matter of Sunday observance as in all other religious practices.
