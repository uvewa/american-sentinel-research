THIS communication is to Sunday closing of the World's Fair, that was sent to the "Pearl of Days" column of the *Mail and Express.*

Washington, D. C., March 29, 1893.

*Mr. Secretary:*

*No. 20 Broadway, New York City.*

As a National Commissioner and one of several and other gentlemen of March 10 with respect to the World's Fair opening. If with the intent of the commission and congress, and the general swearing of the sentiment of the entire body would be to have Congress appropriate a sum more upon the people permanently and impressively than what will be done by saying it will shut upon a day. I have been on a journey from Chicago, the character of the day could not be more manifestly observed than it was.

In every city, town or village, from which, by which, or through which I passed, on my return home to a day, every character of business save the church and some residences and places of business were fully occupied. Now, the Sabbath day, in all that radius of country, would not have been so generally observed if those doors were shut, the very doors, and in many ways. That would result in keeping open every character of Sunday amusement and provide the probability of advancement, in running every other character of business. With these doors closed, you drive the idle thousands around the Fair from it into life from which it would never recover. The question before them is, whether by keeping those doors open there will be any fair proportion of Congress. In the first place it keeps a population of 300,000, who are out of work, employed, to come into contact with clean hands by having something else. There would be somewhere all of the two and a half million sojourners come appropriated for us, and to open the Fair on Sundays: Our people, and the great majority, I am sure do not do in with them to repudiate any obligation under their own conscience, and do the same for the good of the community, as any other dollar. Yours truly,

National Commissioner of the World's Columbian Exposition.

This Dr. Knowles hopes and believes to be the sentiment of the majority of those having control of the question in the interest of the Republic.
