The agitation of the Sunday laws before the Pennsylvania legislature is bearing fruit already in that State, as is shown by this special correspondence of the Pittsburg Leader:—

> The quiet and staid borough of New Brighton is to have an infliction of the Blue Laws. Since the action of the court in refusing to grant a number of coveted licenses, there has been considerable dissatisfaction. The work is to be pushed by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and there promises to be a wailing and prushing of teeth. A reporter called upon Mrs. Taggart, superintendent of that organization in the north ward. Mrs. Taggart is an elderly lady, intellectual, of prepossessing appearance, and has the air of being thoroughly in earnest in whatever work she takes up. When asked if it was true that the Woman's Christian Temperance Union intended to stop the illegal sale of merchandise on Sunday, the reply came, with emphasis on each word: "We intend to do all that we can." When asked, "Has any action yet been taken," she replied, "No action has been taken by the organization of which I am superintendent. There is another organization in town known as the New Brighton Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and I am unable to say what action has been taken by its members. I am a teacher of a Sunday-school class in the Presbyterian Church, and my children tell me that they can buy all the candy they want on Sunday afternoons at the restaurants. I told them that it was a violation of the law and the constables must enforce the law, but they replied the constables buy too, so they consider themselves secure from that source. But we will compel them to enforce the law."

> When asked if the Sunday newspapers would be included in the list of illegal acts she replied: "Certainly. We propose to enforce the whole law." She further explained that no arrests would be made until notices had been served to merchants to cease their illegal proceedings. Mrs. Thomas McKinney, superintendent of both the county and New Brighton organizations, and president of the Committee on Sabbath observance, was then seen. She stated that it was the intention of the organization to proceed with the work as soon as fully equipped for it. She said that the only action yet taken was a discussion among the members and a sending for copies of the law to be enforced. When these arrived copies would be sent to the keepers of restaurants and notice served that they must be observed. She said that they must be fully informed before acting so that no mistakes would be made. The copies of these laws were sent for some time ago and action is expected immediately. Mrs. McKinney was very emphatic in her condemnation of the Sunday paper but hoped that it would not be necessary for the local organization to act on that matter. Mrs. McKinney was a delegate to the Sabbath Observance Convention which met at Harrisburg recently, and praised Governor Pattison highly for his action.

This "earnest" and "intellectual" Sunday-school teacher certainly gave an exhibition of much zeal and force in the management of her pupils, but is it a zeal well directed, and force properly applied, to threaten a class of children with the constable and the court for the infraction of a supposed moral precept?
