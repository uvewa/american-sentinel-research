CONGRESS refused to notice the flood of petitions from the labor organizations of the whole country in reference to the repeal of the legislation closing the World's Fair on Sunday. So far as the superficial showing of the petitions was concerned, as appeared in the Congressional Record, the contest was between the so-called orthodox churches on one side and the labor organizations on the other. Congress recognized the voice of the Church and bowed to it. No attention whatever was paid to the request of the organized workingmen. Their voice was ignored entirely. A remarkable result of this now appears in Chicago. The Central Labor Union, supported by a member of the Board of Directors of the Fair, has decided that, in case the Fair is closed on Sunday, organized labor will work on Sunday that the six days of a week's labor may be filled, and take the Sabbath as a holiday in which to attend the Fair. This is poetic justice. Were it not upon too serious a subject for lightness and jest it would appeal irresistibly to the sense of humor of every one who comprehends the bearings of the subject. This proposition of the labor union, that if the Fair is closed on Sunday they will secede in a body from allegiance to that day as a day of religious rest, and abstain from labor on the true Sabbath, excites almost frenzied opposition from the Sunday-closing faction.

A Chicago clergyman cries out, "If the Union is in earnest let them try it. Then we will see if there is any law in this country!" This preacher should study two subjects to be presented at the Parliament of Religions—"Religion and Labor," and "Relations of religion to the chastening and perfecting of human nature,"—in connection with this he might read with profit the address of Thomas Morgan, representative of organized labor, before the World's Fair Committee of the House of Representatives at the last hearing on the Sunday closing of the Fair.
