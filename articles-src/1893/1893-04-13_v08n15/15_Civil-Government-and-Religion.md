We will not, at this point, discuss the question as to whether or not Sunday is the Lord's day, and whether or not there is any reason why anybody should regard it at all, any more than Monday or Tuesday. It is a fact that it is regarded as a sacred day, and the matter which first demands consideration is this, Has the State any right to legislate either for or against religion? If it be claimed that the Government has a right to make religious laws, then it must follow that it is right to use force in matters of religion; for laws are nothing unless enforced. And when this is admitted, then religious persecution is justified; for in every age persecution has been nothing but the enforcement of the law upon those who dissented from the form of religion which the Government recognized. We will let the Scriptures settle this matter.

> Jesus cried, and said, . . . I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me and receiveeth not my words, hath one that judge him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. John 12: 44-48.
>
> Speak not against one another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judge his brother, speaketh against the law, and judge the law; but if thou judgment the law, thou art not a doer of the law but a judge. One only is the lawgiver and judge, who is able to save and to destroy; who art thou that judgment the neighbor? James 4:11, 12, Revised Version.
>
> For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; he will save us. Isa. 33:23.

Note those three texts. If there was ever anybody on earth who had a right to judge men for their beliefs, it was the Lord Jesus Christ. But he said, "I judge no man." Although he was the truth, and came as the light of the world, to bear witness to the truth, he declared that men might disbelieve him if they wished. He would not condemn them, but they would have to meet his words in the judgment of the last day. Surely, then, there is no man in this earth who has the right to sit in judgment upon another for a matter of religion. Even though we should allow the claim of the Pope to be the vicar of Christ, that would not give him the right to judge men for their faith, for Christ did not do that when he was on earth in person. "The servant is not greater than his Lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him."

So the Apostle Paul writes, "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up, for God is able to make him stand." "But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at naught thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not therefore judge one another any more." Rom. 14:4, 10-13.

> Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise of God. 1 Cor. 4:5.

Whoever, therefore, sits as a judge concerning matters of religion, is usurping the place of the Lord. He is moreover, doing that which the Lord does not do; for God does not use force to compel any man either to believe the truth or to practice it. It is the goodness of God that leads men to repentance. Rom. 2: 4. Those who think by the use of force to any degree to lead men to do right, thereby show that they are ignorant of the goodness of God, and of its power. Christ said that if he were lifted up he would draw all unto him. John 13:30. It is drawing power, not driving power, that makes men Christians.—*Present Truth, London, Eng.*
