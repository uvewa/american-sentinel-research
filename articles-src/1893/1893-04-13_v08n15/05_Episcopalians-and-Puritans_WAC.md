Episcopalians reign, then they themselves controlled, and set up their own established church, and their first act—the very first act—was to legislate persecution against the members, to negotiate submission from others as the price of their lives. The most intolerant, the most tyrannical, and now the poor scriptless Indians could not escape their established state—"Come and be a Puritan or a Presbyterian, and that sentence of the courts of the Colony and all will be well." "But any who had so lately found Old England too hot for their purer lives, were to learn that a State orthodoxy, even made New England too hot for those of their own number who were purer than themselves." The other is the story of Pennsylvania and the other to Rhode Island of Roger Williams as a haven for the persecuted from which they had just been permitted to go.

America has been good to us, and we see unmistakable indications that many of the descendants of the old intolerant Puritan persecutors of New England have recovered much of the love of that liberty which their fathers championed, and are joining those who are now working for toll and right for present-day "orthodoxy." Of such as these, if Human force could succeed, in the House of Commons, the seeking world.

It is not the proud prelate thundering in his cathedral at the head of the nation, nor the shaved and belled monk, not kings and their legs still guilted with their fetters, that are in the forefront of this battle for freedom from which they have just been permitted to go.

The old order of things goes on and the people of those same colonies that chose to remain the slaves of human nature than to lay hold of the great new life, the fruit of which is "love, peace, joy, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith."

W. A. C.
