This communication as to Sunday closing of the World's Fair is published in the "Pearl of Days" column of the Mail and Express:—

Washington, D. C., March 29, 1893.

To the General Secretary American Sabbath Union, No. 203 Broadway, New York City:

My Dear Sir:—I have received the circular letter, of yourself and other gentlemen of March 23, with reference to the Sabbath opening of the World's Fair. I am opposed to such opening. Aside from the general lowering of the sentiment of the entire country, and aside from the many and injurious influences upon the people permanently and temporarily assembled in Chicago during the Fair, it has seemed to me that, within the radius of a day's journey from Chicago, the character of the day and its accompanying morality would be disastrously disturbed.

In every city, town or village from which, by rail or boat, the people could reach Chicago and return home in a day, every character of business would necessarily be opened. It would be quite impossible to move such great masses of people on the Sabbath day, in all that radius of country, without feeding and moving them, and otherwise caring for their physical wants in all the usual ways. That would result in keeping open every restaurant and every character of business, and probably of amusements, in running every character of vehicle, etc. It has seemed to me that the idea of the American Sabbath would receive a blow from which it would never recover.

I do not, however, understand how the local directory can claim exemption under the late appropriation of Congress. In the first place it is a gift and not a contract. In the second place, if it were a contract, it would be necessary for the local directory to come into court with clean hands before they could ask for relief. They have received all of the two and a half million souvenir coin appropriation except the $570,000 held back as security for awards. In long as they retain that money it does not lie with them to repudiate any obligations, because the congressional condition attaches to one dollar of the appropriation quite as much as to any other dollar.

Yours truly,

A. T. BRITTON.

National Commissioner of the World's Columbian Commission for District of Columbia.

This, Dr. Knowles hopes and believes to be the sentiment of the majority of those having control of the question in the interest of the Exposition.
