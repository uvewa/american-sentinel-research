EDITOR SENTINEL: For some months past the writer has been a casual, and recently has become a regular, reader of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, in connection with general reading and study of history, secular and biblical, ancient and current.

Observing the present trend of legislative enactments and the lethargic indifference with which the American people allow their rights to be invaded, the demand for religious legislation which encroaches the domain of conscience and individual rights, and leads to the subversion of the very principle for which the Pilgrim Fathers contended—"freedom to worship God"—the position taken by the SENTINEL to resist this invasion, is brave and timely. The realm of conscience and individual liberty is sacred, and guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, but it is threatened by enactment of civil laws, which abridge the rights of individuals and of conscience.

The faithful SENTINEL raises the alarm and points out the danger in a style of concise, forcible statement, supported by cold, stubborn facts and advocated with such clear, logical, convincing arguments, that it is patent to the thoughtful that its position is entirely tenable.

Only a few days ago, a Catholic priest said, regarding the fitness of a candidate for a political office, who is not an orthodox believer, "It is altogether wrong for such men to be put up for office, the law ought to be changed so that such a man could not hold office." When it was suggested that a man's religious belief is non-belief should not disqualify him for the administration of civil law, the priest replied, "It is ridiculous to think of such a thing," that "a man who does not believe in a God [according to his creed, I suppose] ought not to be tolerated, much less elected to a public office." There it is, a demand for the union of Church and State, pure and simple.

Change the law, so as to require a religious qualification to hold office. What next? Establish an inquisition to determine who is eligible? How else could it be determined? Then what? Weed out of the public service all who might disturb its harmony, using the secular power to enforce the ecclesiastical decrees, the Church being the dominant party. The unerring pen of impartial history records on its bloodiest pages the results of such a combination. Are the citizens of this American Republic prepared for such consequences? The common public is not seem to apprehend any danger, but, on the contrary, are nursing and fondling the power that would strangle their liberties.

Speak out, brave SENTINEL! Shout louder! Some will hear and heed the warning, even though the thoughtless throng pass swiftly on in multitudes to the valley of decision.

D. E. LYON.
