THE fact that the historic legislative fast-day of Massachusetts has degenerated into a holiday, used almost entirely for games and revelry, has led to an attempt to repeal the statute, requiring the governor to set apart the day by proclamation. The presentation of the bill for repeal created not a little discussion among the clergy of the State, and considerable influence was brought to bear upon the legislature to retain the statute in reference to the observance of the day. In deference to this the legislature refused to pass the bill for repeal. The governor, accordingly, has issued a proclamation which must seem to the sinon-pure puritanic mind to be couched in rather singular terms. The proclamation reads:—

> WHEREAS, Our pious ancestors established the custom of setting apart, by public authority, a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer to God, that the whole people might thereon, in public and private, unite in such holy service and devotion to their Creator, as the day, alike in its name and purpose, suggested: and,
>
> WHEREAS, Long continued usage now requires the annual appointment of such a day, although it has ceased to be devoted generally to the purpose of its origin, but is appropriated and used as a holiday, for purposes as variance with its origin, its name and its solemn character; and,
>
> WHEREAS, This day is recognized in the statutes of the commonwealth and set apart as a holiday, and recent legislative action has decided that no change is to be made in regard to it; it therefore becomes my official duty now to appoint a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer. Accordingly with the advice and consent of the council, I do hereby appoint Thursday, the 6th day of April next, as the day to be devoted to such purposes. It is for the people of the commonwealth to determine whether this day shall be observed in conformity with the high and holy purposes for which it has been instituted and appointed, or whether it shall be a formal fast by proclamation, to which the great body of the community of a Christian State gives neither heed, support or service.

It is evident that in this particular, at least, the governor of Massachusetts has little faith in the efficacy of legislative or official religious formality.
