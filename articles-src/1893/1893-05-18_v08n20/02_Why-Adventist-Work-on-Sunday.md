The Sunday cases in Maryland have again revived the question of how Adventists regard the fourth commandment of the Decalogue; not that it is a proper question for any civil authority, as the State of Maryland, as a Tennessee, courts of justice, or any civil functionary whatever, functions or so assumes to declare that his religion of the Adventists does or does not require them to work on Sunday.

The fact is that the Adventists do regard it as a sacred duty to habitually devote Sunday to secular purposes, and this because they understand that the fourth commandment establishes a difference between the Sabbath and the six other days of the week, and that a part of the command is to work six days and to respect that difference. To ignore this distinction between the Sabbath and the other days of the week, is simply to discard the object of the divine law, and to set up merely a human arrangement instead. They are ordained to keep in remembrance the seventh day by keeping it holy. The seventh day is the Sabbath—not the first day—and the earth.

The view of the Adventists is that physical rest for man is not the primary object of the Sabbath; for it was appointed "six days" before the fall, at a time no "man" before the fall, as our Lord himself declares, and therefore any human being should be in need of rest from wearing labor. The intent was then, as it is now, it was equally exercise man's loyalty to God as the Creator. As our own positively teaches upon this—the Fourth of July and Washington's Birthday—designed to fan the flame of patriotism in the American breast. Viewed from the standpoint, it will be seen that Sabbath observance not only enjoins the keeping of the true Sabbath, but the working on each of the six working days.

Every first day must show in some way the authority by which it was enacted, and this the Decalogue only in the fourth commandment. In that precept it is declared that the Giver of the law in six days created the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh. It is this fact that gives the Sabbath its memorial character. The Sabbath commandment is in fact the seal of the divine law, because it is the precept that designates the authority to require obedience.

The mark of any power or institution is the seal or mark of a rival power. It is a fact, as stated in the Catholic "Abridgment of Christian Doctrine," page 58, "Question: How do you prove that the Church has power to command feasts and holy days? Answer: By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church.

A *Because by keeping Sunday they acknowledge the Church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin; and by not keeping the rest by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power.*

Another Catholic work called, "Doctrinal Catechism," offers the following as proof that Protestants are not guided by the Scriptures:—

*Ques.* Have you any other way of proving that the Church has power to institute festivals of precept?

*Ans.* Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural authority.

Believing the Papacy to be antichrist, and the badge of its power, it is evident that Sabbath observers regard what they consider would be equivalent to rendering homage to the papal power, and would be disloyal to God. Hence, the Adventists are required to obey Sunday laws, and their refusal to do so is not in any sense the outcome of stubbornness, or even disloyal interference that too much an appeal to have Sunday observed as anything more than a common working-day is to throw so much influence on the side of the Papacy. It is simply a matter of the conscience of a few, maybe a matter of obedience to God, as is simply a matter of the relation of things, directly affecting their salvation.

Some months since the *Defender*, the organ of the Adventists, had an editorial printed at the time, but which from particular the attention of many readers. It was headed:—

Does a man have a right to work on Sunday?

We say that he does, and so do all the people of this country who ride on trains and street cars on that day.

But the language of the commandment imports more than that the man has a right to work. It says he shall work. "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work." The commandment is as explicit in the nature of an obligation.

It is not said, six days thou mayst labor, or, six days we permit you to labor, but six days thou *shalt* labor. And the commandment, it has been observed, is just as much a matter of obligation, to be kept distinct and separate from all other days—the Sabbath being used for worship, and the other days for secular business—as the distinction would be lost.

In the fourth commandment we have the Sabbath distinct in character from each day that follows or precedes it.

"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

It is not said the first day of the week or any other day, for the fact must not be overlooked that there was an acknowledgment of the choice of the day by any person, or set of persons, or power in law. In what other way could any such observance keep the Sabbath against the institution of any other power. It would be impossible to honor a day that we could not distinguish from the other days of the week. When there is an acknowledgment of the choice of a day by any person, or set of persons, or of any power which seeks to enforce such rest. He may the day of the week, as the seventh day or the that he may call "the Sabbath." But if his Sabbath—his observance of it may be one of a working day in opposition to the claims of God, and his working may be on the day that is called the Sabbath, in opposition to the claims of man. The real Christian in any work or rest cannot examine the thoughts and intents of his heart. He may keep the right day, but out of wrong motives; and, on the other hand, he may keep the wrong day, but in the conscientious belief that it is the right one.

"Our object in referring to this matter is not to encourage or advise the violation of any law of any State requiring rest on Sunday; but the Adventists who are being prosecuted for Sunday work, are as consistent as are those who demand their prosecution; and the Adventists are right.
