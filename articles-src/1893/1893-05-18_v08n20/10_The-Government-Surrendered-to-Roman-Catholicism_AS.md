It is a subject too well understood to need elucidation in this connection, that the Roman Catholic Church is exerting her utmost power to obtain control of our Government. This, however, she could never succeed in accomplishing single-handed or by direct attempt; but Protestantism, so-called, under the guise of a National Reform organization with its numerous allies, losing sight of proper methods of evangelization, has itself eagerly sought to obtain control of the Government (the very thing she detests in the Romish Church) in the interests, and for the enforcement by national authority of the so-called Christian Sabbath or Sunday, an institution which she has received as a heritage from Rome.

Seeing in that church a possible ally of great power on the question of Sunday observance, she has made overtures of a union on that basis, has been accepted, and they have become consolidated. In that act she has surrendered herself to Catholicism, has ceased to be Protestant, and is become an ally of the Roman Catholic Church. In other words, the daughters have become reconciled to the mother. Rev. 17:5. This Fago-papal-protestantism having obtained control of the Government in the year 1892, Rome will be quite content to stand aside and smilingly view the genuflections of the so-called Protestant multitudes to the tinsel-bedecked image of herself, and to see them all receive and wear a badge of her authority, knowing, according to her own tenets, that such adoration is equivalent to worship of herself. The following quotation is a brief statement of Roman Catholic doctrine upon this point:—

Question. What is the doctrine of the church with regard to pictures or images of Christ and his saints?

Answer. . . . That there is a relative honor due to them, by reason of the persons whom they represent.

Q. What do you mean by this relative honor?

A. By a relative honor I mean an honor which is given to a thing, not for any intrinsic excellence or dignity in the thing itself, but only for the relation which it has to something else, which it represents or brings to our remembrance.—Catholic Christian, pages 230, 231.

All the people of this land are very soon to be brought to the point of deciding as to whether they will surrender loyalty to the Constitution as our fathers framed it, and to the law of God, or maintain their integrity and suffer the loss of property, of personal liberty, and it may be, consignment to the dungeon, to the chain-gang, or to torture for a time until the Son of God, descending in his glory, will have set the captives free. Thus the Word of God declares:—

And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, [the ten horned beast or papal Rome] whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

And he [the two horned beast, or the United States Government] had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark [of the ten horned beast. See Rev. 14:9.] in their right hand [the symbol of labor] or in their foreheads [seat of their minds]. And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Rev. 13:8, 15-17.

But the issue is not doubtful, for from the Isle of Patmos John in prophetic vision declares: "And I saw, as it were, a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God."
