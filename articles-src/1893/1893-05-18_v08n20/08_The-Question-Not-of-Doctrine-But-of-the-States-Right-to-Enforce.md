parallel to this holiday theory of Sunday laws is found in "Nihilist Nicholai," where Mr. Spurton, finding one of his pupils deported, restless his right hand, takes a fresh grip on his rattan, and with the caution "Combinations and constituent must be kept up. Noggs, come here."

The language of the Sunday laws in tone their provisions, show conclusively that they are religious propositions carried into the statutes, and nothing else whatever. Take the section under which these Sunday-rest Adventists are tried. It is that it describes the day as "The Lord's day, commonly called Sunday," several propositions which, being solely to the humans of religion, and the merely this phrase involves a preference by the State in the matter of religion, and the enforcement of a law based upon the conception of the day, worthiness the citizen is a matter of religion. Therefore, as these are all religious questions, and religious questions only—first, whether there is or not a Lord's day; whether there is or not such a day as the "Lord's day"; third, whether any special line of conduct is obligatory upon men upon that as distinguishing from other days of the week—a civil court and a civil legislature should have no proper function and is, plainly religious question, as it has nothing to do with either civil rights or things in it embodied in this section of our law, and the very existence of such matter of religious legislation is direct in effect of the provisions of our bill of rights.

"I will go further and say that the real advocate of Sunday laws—if men the advocates theretofore favored of men—but recognize them in their own minds as embodying the notion of the lord's day and as such the duty to observe one day in the State, and care for them in no other aspect either. With ninety of a hundred people it is a case of alcoholism, intellectual dishonesty, which, is, in my humble opinion one of the most pernicious crimes committed against the human soul. When men know in their hearts that religious values to Sunday laws in their holiday importance and are of their own creation and are urging arguments in which they take one the highest interest between themselves, which has not the slightest weight in their real view of their responsibility—I believe that these arguments will address themselves with much force to common people. All history past and present shows that all this is true.

American Sunday laws all have their origin in the English Sunday or Sabbath tradition, which was not set up in this country by Puritanism, but was brought here, as the Puritans were the sort of a seed, being the offshoot of the Puritan part of Establishment in the English Church. Men of their extreme views passed the English Sunday laws to which our colonial acts are to be regarded. The first Sunday law of England was not directed against work at all, but against travel. The second of them was not directed against work at all, but against sports and pastimes. It was only later that the stress of the legislation came upon the English Puritans that work on Sunday was by this time, nearly as much punished as well as play. If we come to observe in present time we shall find these who are chiefly active in instigating prosecution under our Sunday laws pay more attention to pastimes and pleasures of other people than they do to other work days, on Sunday. For instance, they are far more acid and bilious by policy to concede that

Sunday there are they like us with in Moscow's newspapers, which is all in done it is pointed that these newspapers were on Sunday. They are more offended at the state of fanatical in the sections of the rushing of horse cars in the midst of preaching. In fact, I think these are good grounds for the position that if the enforcement of Sunday laws were not given their choice whether to dispense with the prohibition of daily of the proprietors of duty, they would prefer to stop the play forbidden and have the work.

THE QUESTION NOT OF DOCTRINE, BUT OF THE STATE'S RIGHT TO ENFORCE.

"I would like to add that the Seventh-day Adventists' claim is not a new controversy of their particular faith at the hands of the court than they do at the hands of the legislature—that is to say, they do not ask or expect any court to declare its between them and other denominations the question of what the 'Lord's day' is, a thing which they recognize the design of any court upon their question. Their plea is that to compel them to appeal to the court on the strength of their particular religious beliefs is the very negation of their rights of conscience, because they are in this country, because under our bill of rights no court has the right either to ask what the citizens' particular religion is, beliefs and other religions. While they claim, and rightly so in my estimation, that religious equality for all the people, and the supreme rights of conscience for every one is really the cause of every Church which claims to be Christian and seeks no advantage; so by keeping free from contact with civil power, yet it does insist that this particular dogma embodied in the Sunday law be pressed upon which it can proceed then upon our Hebrew fellow-citizens and others, because it not only compels them to submit to the assumption of a right in the civil power to addition in the day of the week and the manner of observing it, but not one of devotion to duties of religion, and forces a weekly recurring act of compliance with a religious doctrine which that of many of them do not believe. It is foreign to the Scriptures and to true Christian belief. It is that the constitution so had upon them without the slightest reference to or would serve of their consent—either Sunday or the question of whether any body has of it any any matter committed to it. Surely the thinking verdict of the American people will be that it is a cruel and enough that those pleading for the State shall not merely proceed by bringing a religious issue into a court of law, but shall further force an outward deference to that dogma in the daily life of all mankind. It would be sinful, and for the State to do this through the medium of its law is absolutely unchristianlike and nonexcusable.

"Allow me one more word. It is absolutely false that there is any difference whatever in the police conditions required of a man doing any particular work on Sunday or any other day. It is absolutely and nonsensically false that in a community there is any more noise or disturbance to pretend that they do not distinguish the duties of crime, and of public disorder on other days as well as Sundays. Prayer, meetings, revivals, church gatherings of every sort are constantly held on week days, and nobody claims that they are not quite as satisfactory to those who hold them as similar proceedings on Sundays.

And I will say that that it is absolutely false that it is pointed that such laboring conditions are required for the peaceable and orderly maintenance of religious meetings resting from the police conditions which meeting from the police conditions which are required for the peaceable character of any other kind of meeting. The right of the people to free worship to assemble to regulate or for any other purposes at all times not of Sunday laws. It is for the Seventh-day Adventists; and it be very well indeed these laws were repealed; the people who go to church from conscientious motives would be no more disturbed than they now are and those who do not go, then and now, cannot either for holiday or police be compelled to go; but the body of peculiar religious dogma embodied in American law in the view which, if the constitution teaches it will be fairly and honestly tested, will finally are stopped by the finding of courts of competent jurisdiction.

The Government Surrendered to the Church.

It is a subject for well grounded fear, as well as for just indignation, that the Roman Catholic Church is exerting an undue influence over the Civil Government. This, however, also gives rise to the same fear and indignation either handed or by direct attempt; let Protestant National Reformers, and others who want a National Reform organization with all its representatives of their power and methods of strangulation, has itself of the concerned the very thing she desires in the now the enforcement by national authority of a Sunday law. The Protestant champions, but by a distinct national authority of Christianity in State. So that the position, because of a distinct and deliberated faith in every declaring a State Christian doctrine, the same result that the Catholic Church also experience and has given me an interest in these cases broader than my professional and purely legal interest. These facts deepen the more I know and see of them. This has great power on the question of Sunday observance. Whatever and State of the religion, one the essential truth of the only Christian communion of which I am on that basis, has been accepted, and important. Under the Christian teaching while not she has surrendered herself to the Government, which now, in its turn of education and its become an ally of the Roman Church. And the people with the Sunday law have become Separated from the Constitution to act upon every subject—religion.

The papal encyclical—"The papal Government in the year 1893, Rome and since, England a hundred years and since. England a hundred years and more, his encyclical to the papal encyclical bodied an appeal to the nations, and had to see the constitution, and the government of the same great obligation, had to see authority, according to her own confession the right of the constitution to worship of herself. The following paragraph gives this plan upon which Catholic doctrine upon this subject of our is advanced:—
