To the majority of the citizens of the United States there seems little or nothing to fear from the attitude of Catholics towards the free institutions of our country. The masses observe with amazement the change that has apparently taken place in the removal of church censure by which Catholics have been, in a great measure, deterred from sending their children to the public schools. Knowing what Rome has uttered and attempted in reference to these institutions in the past, it would seem as if there were now a mighty concession towards the final acceptance of the features of our school system in the education of Catholic children. To the student of history and prophecy this "now you see it" and "now you don't see it" policy of Rome brings no deception. One might as well think the leopard could change its spots as to believe that the Church of Rome has changed its principles. Well has Bishop Ireland said that—

> the most foreseing liberal mind in the world today is that of Leo. The most gentle and generous heart is his. Neither Catholics nor Protestants of America know him sufficiently. It is the duty of all to study him.

These lullaby statements of this Jesuitical priest are uttered to allay the fears and soothe the troubled minds that have felt alarm at the settled principles that have issued from the Vatican. Pius IX. said that—

> public schools open to all children for the education of the young should be under the control of the Romish Church and should not be subject to the civil power nor made to conform to the opinions of the ages.

And the greatest organ of Romanism in this country, the Catholic Review, says the right of the State to foist upon its citizens a school system without consulting their religious convictions on the one hand, and their rights as citizens on the other, is one that must be rejected totally—always denied and thoroughly pounded as long as it asserts itself. And farther, in reference to the province of the State in education says:—

> Its assumption of the right to tax a powerful minority to support a school system which it will not use must be resisted.

All this has seemingly been set aside by a stroke of pen policy to soothe the ruffled elements that were scurrying to the defense of our justly popular free institutions of learning. Monsignor Satolli, in deciding the right of Catholic parents as to allowing their children the privilege of public schools, without incurring the censure of the church, has successfully hoodwinked the masses, and to that extent that leading journals have said:—

> The effect of this decision will be revolutionary, as far as the parochial school is concerned. It marks an epoch—the epoch of decline in the history of sectarian common school education. Indeed, it is the beginning of the end of parochial schools.

Thus the old tattered rag of charity for Rome's incursions receives a goodly patch and is drawn so easily over the prostrate figure with the hydra head. Let none be deceived. This apparent concession is only the "possum" state of the animal and the danger signal to those who put no trust in the arm of flesh, but rely upon the sure Word. C. A. WYMAN.
