# Uncertainties — v08n20 (1893-05-18)

## Masthead

- **OCR reads:** "ASSOCIATE EDITORS, CALVIN P. BOLLRES." — The OCR appears to have garbled "BOLLMAN" as "BOLLRES." Transcribed as "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" based on known associate editor name. **Confidence: HIGH** (well-established name from other issues)

## Page 1 / Article 01 (World's Fair Sunday Question)

- **OCR reads:** "superstitions Sabbatarianism" — likely "superstitious Sabbatarianism." Corrected silently in the transcription (likely OCR error, not original text). **Confidence: HIGH**

- **OCR reads:** "religionistical guardians of Sunday sacreinees" (Article 05, page 2 area) — likely "sacredness." OCR corruption. Transcribed as "sacreedness" based on context. **Confidence: MEDIUM**

## Page 3 / Article 03 (Why Adventists Work on Sunday)

- **OCR reads:** "Iea. 58: 13" — clearly a garbled OCR rendering of "Isa. 58:13" (Isaiah). Corrected in transcription. **Confidence: HIGH**

- **OCR reads:** "Iea. 30:1, 2" (in Article 04) — same pattern, garbled "Isa. 30:1, 2." Corrected in transcription. **Confidence: HIGH**

## Page 4 / Article 06 (Great Is the Sunday of England)

- **OCR reads:** Opening paragraph begins with "[refer especially to Sunday trains..." with a bracket, suggesting this may be a continuation of a block quote from the previous page (the Bishop Ryle booklet quotation). The bracket "[" in the OCR likely indicates a passage that began on a prior column or was set off typographically. Transcribed without the bracket as it appears to be a continuation of the Bishop's quoted text.  **Confidence: MEDIUM**

## Page 7 / Article 10 (Government Surrendered to Roman Catholicism)

- **OCR reads:** "tinselbedecked" — likely "tinsel-bedecked" (hyphenated). Transcribed with hyphen. **Confidence: MEDIUM**

## Page 7 / Article 11 (All Political Efforts for Uniformity)

- **Attribution:** Reprint from *Truth*, London — confirmed by "—*Truth*, London." ending.

## Page 8 / Article 12 (World's Fair Sunday Financial Question)

- **ALL-CAPS text:** Page 8 OCR text is entirely in ALL-CAPS, suggesting this is the typographic style of the page (smaller type, condensed notes section). Transcribed preserving the ALL-CAPS for quoted newspaper excerpts; running editorial text converted to normal case as is standard for this section. **Confidence: HIGH**

- **OCR reads:** "MIGHT THE HASTENED" — likely "MIGHT BE HASTENED." OCR corruption. Left as-is in direct quotation block, as original wording cannot be confirmed. **Confidence: LOW**

- **OCR reads:** "IT IS FORED THAT" — likely "IT IS FEARED THAT." OCR corruption in direct quotation. Corrected to "IT IS FEARED THAT" in quoted block. **Confidence: HIGH**

- **OCR reads:** "A large force of electricians and wжemens were at work" — OCR corruption, "wжemens" is clearly "workmen." Corrected in transcription. **Confidence: HIGH**

## Page 8 / Article 13 (Stundists)

- **OCR reads:** "EXPRIEDER TO EMPLOY" — likely "REQUIRED TO EMPLOY." OCR corruption. Corrected in transcription. **Confidence: HIGH**

- **OCR reads:** "CERCICAL GUARDIANS" — likely "CLERICAL GUARDIANS." OCR corruption. Corrected. **Confidence: HIGH**

- **OCR reads:** "SEPARATE" (in "employ Orthodox Separate in their meeting-houses") — likely "SERVANTS." OCR corruption. Corrected. **Confidence: MEDIUM** (context strongly supports "servants")

- **OCR reads:** "assertion or inducement of the injury" — unusual phrasing. May be "infringement of the injury" or similar. Left as-is pending review of original scan. **Confidence: LOW**
