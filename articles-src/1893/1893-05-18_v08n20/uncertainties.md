# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, May 18, 1893 (v08n20)

## General Note

This issue presented significant OCR challenges due to the very small text size in the 300 DPI page images. Multiple passages across all articles contain readings that are uncertain. The text was transcribed with best-effort judgment, but many individual words and phrases may contain errors. A thorough review against higher-resolution scans or physical originals is strongly recommended for all articles in this issue.

## Article 01: "The First Sunday of the World's Fair"

### Page 1, Column 2
- **Obstruction:** Very small text, difficult to distinguish individual words
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Issue:** The quoted passage from the New York *World* about the boycott contains several phrases that were difficult to parse. The phrase "Christians by rote of dissemblance" is uncertain; could read differently.
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Column width and font size make many individual words ambiguous

### Page 1, Column 2, bottom
- **Issue:** The sentence about "controlling the late decisions of the courts the same principle does not equally apply" may be garbled; the logical flow is unclear, suggesting possible transcription error.
- **Confidence:** LOW

### Page 1, Column 3
- **Issue:** The quoted passages from the *Sun* and *Tribune* correspondents contain multiple uncertain readings. Phrases like "turnstiles and cashier boxes" are best guesses.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 2, top left (continuation)
- **Issue:** The continuation text on page 2 was extremely difficult to read. Multiple sentences may contain word-level errors.
- **Confidence:** LOW

## Article 02: "Why Adventist Work on Sunday"

### Page 2, middle columns
- **Issue:** Several passages about the Adventist position on the fourth commandment contain uncertain readings. The phrase "functions or so assumes to declare that his religion of the Adventists" may be garbled.
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Very small text in dense columns

### Page 2, Catholic catechism quotations
- **Issue:** The Catholic catechism quotations ("Abridgment of Christian Doctrine" and "Doctrinal Catechism") are standard well-known texts and were transcribed from known sources where the image was unclear.
- **Confidence:** HIGH for the quoted catechism passages

### Page 2, final paragraphs
- **Issue:** The concluding editorial paragraphs about Adventists' consistency contain uncertain readings.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

---

## Article 03: "Sunday and the World's Fair" (T. E. Bowen)

### Pages 2-3
- **Issue:** This article was particularly difficult to transcribe due to flowing across page boundary and very small text. Multiple sentences likely contain word-level errors. The theological argument about "coverings" (spiritual vs. earthly) may have inaccuracies in specific word choices.
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Small text, page boundary, theological language requiring precision

---

## Article 04: "Right to Work on Sunday"

### Pages 3-5
- **Issue:** This interview article with counsel Mr. Jas. T. Ringgold spans multiple pages and columns. While the general arguments are clear (constitutionality of Sunday laws, First Amendment, religious liberty), many specific sentences contain uncertain word readings.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for main arguments, LOW for specific wording

### Page 3, right column
- **Issue:** The names "Jas. T. Ringgold" and "Isaac Baker" are read with reasonable confidence, as is "John W. Judefind" and "Arlington Hotel."
- **Confidence:** HIGH for proper names

### Section heading "HOW THE SUNDAY LAW STANDS..."
- **Issue:** The full heading "HOW THE SUNDAY LAW STANDS IN THE UNION CODE OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND" may not be precisely correct.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

---

## Article 05: "Sunday Trains and the Bishops" (Frances Horpe)

### Page 4, left column top
- **Issue:** This short contributed piece from Belfast, Ireland was difficult to read. The name "Frances Horpe" is a best reading; could potentially be "Francis Horpe."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for the name, LOW for body text

---

## Article 06: "The Dallas Pulpit"

### Page 4, left column
- **Issue:** The Texas legislature debate about the chaplain's prayer was transcribed with moderate confidence. The names "McLemore," "Sebantion," "Sewell," "Fagan of Lamar," "Turner," "Fields," "Peck," "Graham," and "Pennington" are best readings.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for the debate structure, LOW for specific word-for-word accuracy

### Page 4, right column (continuation)
- **Issue:** The editorial commentary following the debate transcript contains multiple uncertain readings.
- **Confidence:** LOW

---

## Article 07: "Tweedledom and Tweedledee"

### Page 5, left column
- **Issue:** This article about Catholic-Protestant education disputes was very difficult to read. The argument about papal policy on public schools and Monsignor Satolli's decision contains uncertain readings.
- **Confidence:** LOW

---

## Article 08: "The Question Not of Doctrine, But of the State's Right to Enforce"

### Pages 5-6
- **Issue:** This lengthy article (appearing to be a continuation of the interview from article 04, or a related editorial) contains extensive discussion of Sunday law theory, Puritan history, and constitutional principles. Multiple passages are uncertain.
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Dense legal and historical argumentation in very small type

### "Nihilist Nicholai" reference
- **Issue:** The reference to "Nihilist Nicholai" and "Mr. Spurton" in the opening paragraph is uncertain.
- **Confidence:** LOW

---

## Article 09: "The Government Surrendered to the Church" (A. Smith)

### Pages 6-7
- **Issue:** This article about papal influence on civil government contains biblical references (Revelation 13:8) that helped confirm some readings. The closing quotation about "political efforts for uniformity" attributed to *Truth, London* provides a clear endpoint.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for biblical quotations, LOW for connecting prose

---

## Article 10: "Editorial Notes"

### Page 8
- **Issue:** The editorial notes on the final page discuss World's Fair finances, Sunday closing/opening debates, and religious liberty news from Romania. Multiple specific figures (attendance numbers, financial amounts) may contain digit-level errors.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for general content, LOW for specific numbers

### Romania note
- **Issue:** The note about "Sanitalia in Romania" is uncertain; "Sanitalia" may be a different word (possibly "Stundists" or similar religious group name).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Unfamiliar proper noun in small type

### "Mr. Hrock"
- **Issue:** The name transcribed as "Mr. Hrock" near the end of page 8 is uncertain; may read "Mr. Houck" or similar.
