ALL political efforts for uniformity are antagonistic to the gospel. A prominent man has recently stated that unity of religion is essential to the existence of a nation. That is what the Czar of Russia thinks, and the result is the most cruel and oppressive tyranny. That idea, which is seizing the most enlightened nations at the present day, is the foundation of the Inquisition. Christ desires unity, but he does not try to force it, because the unity which is essential is the unity of growth into Christ, and growth can not be forced. The religion of Jesus is love, and force kills love. Where there is no love there is no righteousness; and therefore since "righteousness exalteth a nation," it is evident that the surest way to debase a nation is to attempt to produce perfect uniformity in matters of religion by means of law.—*Truth*, London.
