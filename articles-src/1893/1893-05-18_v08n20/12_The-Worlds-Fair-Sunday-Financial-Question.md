THUS FAR THE WORLD'S FAIR AT CHICAGO HAS BEEN CLOSED ON SUNDAY, BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT YET DEFINITELY SETTLED. THE *Mail and Express*, THE GREAT CHAMPION OF SUNDAY CLOSING, SAID IN ITS ISSUE OF MAY 8:

> IT IS SAID THAT 150,000 PERSONS CROWDED AROUND THE GATES OF THE CHICAGO EXPOSITION YESTERDAY AND WERE DENIED ADMISSION TO THE GROUNDS. WE SHOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS DENIAL WAS DUE TO A DETERMINATION ON THE PART OF THOSE IN CONTROL TO RESPECT THE SABBATH AND TO KEEP IT HOLY. BUT WE ARE AFRAID THE DEMONSTRATION WAS ORGANIZED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADDING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE SABBATH BREAKING MOVEMENT, AND THAT THE GATES WERE KEPT CLOSED IN ORDER THAT THE WORK OF PREPARING THE EXHIBITS MIGHT THE HASTENED. IT IS FEARED THAT THERE IS A PLAN ALL ARRANGED FOR OPENING THE GATES EVERY DAY AS SOON AS THE EXHIBITS ARE ALL INSTALLED.

That the surmise of the *Mail and Express* is probably correct is strongly indicated by two facts: first, the working people of Chicago and neighboring cities demand Sunday opening; and second, the Fair threatens to be a financial failure in any event, and will certainly be such if the possible receipts of the twenty-six Sundays are lost to it.

Concerning the financial prospects of the Fair the New York Sun of the 8th inst., published the following interesting facts:

> During the first six days at Chicago, including the opening day with its abnormally large attendance, the number of paying visitors has averaged 43,600. Leaving the opening day out of account, the average has been about 26,000. But the weather has been bad, and the widespread knowledge of the true state of affairs in Jackson Park has more than balanced the attraction of novelty. The average daily attendance at Philadelphia during the month of May was about 28,000.
>
> In order to pay the six per cent. debentures due on the first day of next year, and the bonds securing the city of Chicago's five million loan, and the stock subscriptions amounting to about $5,500,000, the management of the Exhibition needs to take in at the gates more than $15,000,000 over and above running expenses. The running expenses are estimated at $45,000 a day, and the management vaguely estimates that the receipts from the various concessions will take care of that item.
>
> Supposing that this hope is well founded, and that not a dollar of gate money will be needed for operating expenses, it appears that in order to return the money already invested in the beautiful buildings of the White City, the average daily paying attendance at the Chicago Fair at fifty cents a head will have to be from 150,000 to 200,000, or from 50,000 to 75,000 more than the average work-day attendance at Paris in 1889.

These figures furnish a strong argument in favor of Sunday opening of the Fair, for without the Sunday gate receipts it is impossible that the Exhibition shall be a financial success. The average daily attendance at the Paris Exhibition of 1889, was 125,000 on work days and about 300,000 on Sundays. In Chicago probably the difference in favor of Sunday would be much greater, for in Chicago Sunday rest is more general than in Paris, and so more people, in proportion, would be free to attend the Fair on that day in the former than in the latter city. These facts make it certain that those who have money invested in the Fair will leave no stone unturned to secure the opening of the gates upon the day that would yield probably three or four times the amount of gate receipts that the management can hope to realize on other days. But however the question may be finally settled it is likely that no serious effort will be made to open on Sunday until the exhibits are in place and the whole Fair in better condition than it is at present, for that day affords a very convenient time for doing work that could not be done so well when visitors are present. And for this sort of "Sabbath observance" there was great rejoicing in the Chicago churches on the 7th inst. The *Mail and Express* of the following day, says:

> Many sermons expressing the gratification of the Christian element of Chicago, in its victory, were preached by ministers of the various denominations yesterday.

And the correspondent innocently adds, not apparently seeing any incongruity in it:

> The total number of admissions of employes yesterday [Sunday] was about two thousand. Considerable work was done in the Mining and Manufacturers building. A large force of electricians and workmen were at work repairing the apparatus for the grand illumination to night.

And that is how the World's Fair is observing the "Christian Sabbath"!

On the outside the day was no better observed. It is estimated that one hundred and fifty thousand people sought admission to the grounds but were turned away. "Finding that they could not gain admission," says the World, "the crowd filled up the 'Wild West Show,' and overflowed every side-show and fakir attraction within sight of the grounds. The saloons and the less reputable resorts were likewise thronged. There is no evidence that the churches had any more attendants than would naturally have sought them had the Fair gates been open. . . . On the financial side the Sunday closing of the Fair will be disastrous to the enterprise. From a moral point of view it will be no less a failure."

Evidently the words of Hon. J. C. Houk, of Tennessee, to one of his constituents, are being realized: "So far as Chicago is concerned I believe the closing of the Fair on Sunday will be the worst thing that could happen to her, for the reason that such closing will keep the great tide of visitors within the city which will offer thousands of inducements to groggeries and other dives to keep either the front or back door open." Nevertheless Mr. Houk was one who voted for the Sunday-closing proviso.
