The Dallas News of the 21st of March last, gives an account of a spicy discussion in the Lower House of the Texas legislature, touching a vital point as follows:—

At the conclusion of the prayer, Mr. McLemore offered the following:—

> Whereas, the prayer which appears in the house journal this morning is an unjust and unwarrantable reflection on certain members, therefore be it
>
> Resolved, that the portion of the prayer which reads, "O, God, open the eyes of those who have allowed the love of money to be balanced against virtue that they may see that purity is above rather and that is their hands is placed the power to save those against whom the false standard of the duty has closed the churches and all avenues of reformation," be expunged from the journals of this house.

Mr. Sebastian moved to table the resolution.

The house refused to table by a vote of 59 to 63.

Mr. Dills offered a substitute that the entire prayer be expunged from the journals, and hereafter the prayers of the chaplain be not printed in the journals.

At the end of an hour and ten minutes this matter was disposed of.

Mr. Rowell spoke indignantly against being accused of placing money above virtue. It referred to the vote of members against the bill making an appropriation to establish the home for fallen women, and insisted it was out of place for the chaplain to criticise members and their motives in his prayers.

Mr. Davis questioned the right of an opponent of the fallen women's bill to conclude that the prayer was directed specially in his behalf. It might be construed from his reading of it to mean that advocates of the bill were aimed at. The gentleman, anyway, has no right to object to being the special object of prayer. "Almost every member needs to be made the object of special prayer. The real question at issue is whether this body shall instruct the chaplain how he shall invoke the throne of grace. Now, I ask what individual member can feel that he is persuaded by the chaplain, unless he appreciates that he loves money more than virtue?"

Mr. Fagan, of Lamar, contended that the printing of the prayers in the journals is an innovation. It had no precedent in this country. He was opposed to all tendencies toward uniting Church and State and to the jumble of prayers and records, mixing up house action with chaplain criticisms on such action. No one can say it is not a direct thrust at members who opposed the appropriation for the fallen women's home. I am opposed to such attempts of the chaplain to dictate to this house. It seems to me the prayer is capable of no other construction than that these poor, heathen members of the house opposed to the fallen women measure place money above virtue. That is an insult to members. This prayer ought to be stricken out and in future should not be printed in the journals.

Mr. Turner.—Dr. Pennington is here in the house, and since he is attacked it is nothing more than right and just, if he wishes, and he does wish it, that he be given an opportunity to express himself. He is debarred any explanation unless the house grants him the privilege, and I move he be granted the privilege.

Mr. Fields.—The whole affair is unprecedented and I object to it.

The Speaker.—I have informed the chaplain, when he asked me for permission to explain, that I could recognize no one but a member, but it is competent for the house to grant him the privilege.

Mr. Peck.—The chaplain ought to have the right to explain. When the gentlemen who voted against the fallen women's bill hear the chaplain explain they will be perfectly satisfied. The tendency of such resolutions is to muzzle the chaplain. He has made no personal allusion to the motives of any member. He may have used words as members do that he would not use on reflection and there should be forbearance for him as well as for members.

Mr. Graham.—Why may he not put his explanation upon the journals?

The motion to give the chaplain his turn was adopted.

Chaplain Pennington.—I have no explanation to make. I simply wish to say that I had no individual member in my mind and meant to cast no reflection, but that I had in my mind the great importance of virtue and the salvation of souls in comparison with the love of money. You will remember in the debate on the bill it was said that the reclamation was the work of the Christian people and preachers and I wished only to say that the false standards of society prevented the preacher from engaging in the work. You know I could not go into those dens under the ideas which govern and control society. On mature reflection I might change my language somewhat. I meant simply that consideration of the cost of the good work might deprive a great many of being reclaimed. I meant to reflect on no member. They are all patriotic, honest and honorable gentlemen, but if I have not the right to pray that members' eyes be opened, then I must have my prayers dictated. I thank you for your attention.
[Applause.]

Mr. Alston.—When a chaplain comes here and offers up prayer proposing merely to please the members of this body, we should have no chaplain. Without prayer and much prayer you are gone and gone forever. There is nothing that transpires here that does not need prayer and more prayer. To-day there are members criticizing the prayer who are steeped in vice and folly and need prayer. There are members who oppose the prayers of the chaplain who would not dare to let in the sunshine upon their daily transgressions.

The Speaker.—The gentleman must avoid personal reflections.

Mr. Alston.—I am not personating any member.

Mr. Dill disclaimed any desire to reflect upon the chaplain in this matter or any other. He indorsed him as a godly man, and earnest Christian gentleman, but objected to printing prayers in the journals.

The previous question closed the debate and the resolution and substitute were both rejected.

The chaplain's statement that if he have not the right to pray that members' eyes be opened then his prayers must be dictated, forces from one who has ever given such matters sufficient thought, the very pertinent inquiry, Why not? As he is paid by the State to pray for its lawmakers, why has not the State the right to dictate, through its representatives assembled, for whom the prayers are to be offered—as to how the chaplain shall pray? True, it divests the petitions of the real essence of prayer, extracting from them every element of virtue, and reduces them to empty utterances of a State-paid functionary, whose hollow deliverances of man-pleasing eulogies are offered for a stipulated sum and called prayer. But what matters that? It is the State's prayers. It has paid for them, and certainly the man who accepts the job of offering them for what the State proposes to give, is not the one to object to whatever the State might require him to pray, so long as he holds on to the job and receives the pay. And this illustrates, not only the injustice of imposing a tax on people to pay for such prayers when they do not believe in them, but also shows the mock that is made of such sacred things. It is a parody upon religion. Chaplain Pennington is simply an employé of the State, as are all State chaplains. It is a principle well understood everywhere that the employé is subject to the dictation of the employer as to his work, and it would be an impeachment of Dr. Pennington's common sense and intelligence to say that he does not understand this as well as anybody. Then, in accepting of this employment and receiving the pay for it, he but accepted of the dictation on the part of his employer with it. Why, then, should not the State dictate his prayers? Again we ask, why not?

"When a chaplain comes here and offers up prayer, proposing merely to please the members of this body, we should have no chaplain," says Mr. Alston, in defense of the chaplain. Mr. Alston has exactly the correct idea of the work of a minister in this respect as regards a minister of Christ and his gospel, but not when he is a minister of the State. When he is simply and only a minister of Christ, a freeman indeed, hampered by no State salary and State supervision, he can, and must, if he does his duty, pray without reference to pleasing or displeasing anybody save his Master whom he is serving. But when he is a minister of the State—hired by it and a beneficiary of it—why, then, what else is to be expected than that he should pray to suit its representatives? And if he does not, why should they not demand it? Again the ever present and sometimes troublesome interrogatory presents itself—Why not?

We have no inclination to undertake the unquestionably difficult task of proving that the moral status of some of Mr. Alston's colleagues is not as he represents it, and that therefore his remark to them, "Without prayer and much prayer, you are gone and gone forever," may be strictly true and not bad advice to them, but the question is then, are they and he going to depend on praying by proxy, and it State paid at that, with which there is a remote possibility that the five dollars per prayer has something to do? Yet that is just what this chaplain system encourages in people.

Mr. Fagan sees, in such things as the printing of the chaplain's prayers in the journals, "tendencies toward uniting Church and State" to which he is opposed. It were immeasurably better that he and all others should go to the root of the matter and see these "tendencies" in the offering of these prayers by State support, and not alone in their publication in its journals; that the whole system of State chaplaincies, and their maintenance by State support, is a flagrant violation of the American principle of complete separation between the Church and the State. It is not merely a mild suggestion of "tendencies toward uniting Church and State," but a positive proof of the existence of relics of the system yet remaining. And this is the thing to protest against, and not merely the publication of the prayers, as "tendencies" in that direction. Let us be glad that this much is seen by one of the members, but why not take a deeper view of the matter and go to the beginning of it. A tree is never killed by merely picking the green leaves from its boughs, but must be struck at the roots. So in this matter. Why not be consistent here? Why not? W. A. McCUTCHEN.
