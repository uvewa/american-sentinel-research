THE attitude of Roman Catholicism towards the free institutions of our country is one which naturally excites alarm for the change that has apparently taken place in the remnant of directly active which Catholics have been, in a great measure, deterred from sending their children to the public schools. Knowing that Rome has entered and attracted a reference to these institutions to the past, it would seem as if there were a very slightly towards the final result together the outcome of the features of our school system in the education of Catholic children. To the student of history and principle this is a change only in method. No one does in "policy" of Rome changes and the policy change of the same is. But the leopard could change its spots as to the color, and that such a change would not in changed its principles. Wall has Bishop Keane said,

the most fanatical Ritualist mind in the world to read our history or to understand the consistency of our laws. Neither Catholics nor Catholics ever believed that Americans are satisfied of the laws of 1829 to be of the country.

These lofty statements of Justification and protest are uttered to allay the fears and mollify the brotherly trust which has fallen all the settled principles that have issued from the Vatican. Pius IX. declared

public schools open to all children for the education of youth, are not under the authority of the Roman Church and should not be subject to the arbitrary will of the civil authority.

And the greatest organ of Romanism in this country, the *Catholic Review*, says the right of the State has to claim its role, educate a school system without consultation, that religious instruction on the one hand or prohibiting it on the other is one that must be rejected totally and absolutely, since it is wrong and as long as it asserts itself. And further, as reference to the professor and the value in education says:—

the liberty of the right to tax a powerful minority to support a school system which it will not use.

All this has seemingly been set aside by a stroke of policy to concede that

rufflest elements that were scurrying to the defense of our parlay popular free institution of learning. Monsignor Satolli, in deciding the right of Catholic parents to allowing their children the privilege of public schools, whether, exercising the censure of the church, has accordingly broadened the means, and to teach acceptance that leading journals have said:—

The effect of his decision or its counterpart, whatever they have been in particular instances or upon particular matters, is to emphasize that as its main result, as spoken—the epoch of desire in this country that Rome was retreating on this point, is the beginning of the end of parochial schools.

This old tattered rag of charity for Rome's intentions receives a goodly patch manifest in such a record here. Let us examine the figures with the hydra head. Let some be warned by the appearance of the head which shows only the "possum," state of the animal and the disappearance of another head, and trust in the arm of flesh, but rely upon another covering.

many prominent people went to Washington for this purpose, but when they arrived there it was found from some source that the demand was such that Congress had undergone a change of sentiment, and so far as to lay to the question any further argument of the constitutionality of the action. These facts are well known.

They are, as stated, Congress had complied, being coerced and terrorized and the manly, righteous thing to have done was for Congress to have reversed its action, but that was not done.

Now as I look at it the Constitution is clear on one religious question, it can take up neither one and so in this matter of the Sunday law we have the laws let down and the gate opened to every religious question that the clergy desire who are also waiting for the Saviour to do and to ask for it, for their leaders have got something tangible and plain, and should have learned that was held, the Constitution stands right in the end. By public opinion here is overwhelmingly in favor of opening the World's Fair.

Evangelical Alliance composed mainly of Protestant clergymen, and to which the foremost, at St. Louis declared in a resolution that the Catholic Church was to be considered their main ally. We will go there addressed one:—

Mr. Editor, we have in this matter thing like character from any power that bind those who, and hang Quakers, and burn witches, and chain men to the pages of all history with the worst record of any power in the past.

Reader therefore unto Great God the things that are God's; and keep for yourselves, and for the churches, and for God things that are Christ's. "And things that are God's," and believe, truly, some may rest on every day and believe, truly. Some say that man an rest every day and believe, keeping to a duty that man owe to his God. But the American Sabbath does not interpret to force a man Sabbath does not interpret to force a man to keep Sunday any more than to force him to observe do to go to any civil law that merely recognizes religion. The American Sabbath, as it were, to keep the glass dome over the matter and not interfere with the "advertisement of the American Sabbath" of Mathew P. Deady, "M. J. R. for us.

CHRISTIANITY AND RELIGIOUS EQUALITY.

"It seems to me that results more important than the decision of any trial, or any number of trials, for breaches of the American law are likely to pass out of this
