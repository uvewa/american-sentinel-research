The Case of Seventh-day Adventists Continued.—An Interview with Their Counsel.

The case of the State vs. Isaac Baker, the Seventh-day Adventist who is charged with violating the Sunday law, was continued Tuesday morning on motion of the counsel for the defense, Mr. Jas. T. Ringgold, of the Baltimore Bar. The State made no opposition to the continuance, the ground upon which it was asked being that the law points involved were precisely the same as those in the case of John W. Judefind recently convicted at Chestertown on the same charge, and a brother of the same communion. Mr. Ringgold was seen at the Arlington Hotel by a reporter of this paper and asked to explain the extraordinary interest in the Seventh-day Adventist trials which had led to his appearing as counsel in behalf of these cases. Mr. Ringgold spoke substantially as follows:—

"I represent an organization known as the International Religious Liberty Association which has recently undertaken to test the constitutionality of all American laws which in the belief of its members represent a union of Church and State. The Sunday laws are by no means the only survivals among us of this English system, but they are by far the most conspicuous and dangerous to American liberty. Heretofore the resistance offered to them has been passive rather than active. It has come chiefly from our Hebrew fellow-citizens and from some who expressly repudiate all religious belief and obligation. It is only recently that a body of believers has undertaken to oppose these laws, because they are Christian believers, and as such find that not only is their civil liberty abridged by Sunday laws, but that they are constrained thereby to a line of conduct which their belief as Christians teaches them is wrong. These people are known as the Seventh-day Adventists, and the International Religious Liberty Association has espoused their cause most gladly and proposes to fight their battles to the utmost wherever they may be attacked.

CHRISTIANITY AND RELIGIOUS EQUALITY.

"It seems to me that results more important than the decision of any trial, or any number of trials, for breaches of the Sunday law are likely to grow out of this position taken by the Seventh-day Adventists, and their faithful adherence to it. One of the most important of these results will be forcing of American people to consider the extent to which religious dogmas are embodied in the governmental system of every State. This will be followed, as I hope and believe, because I believe in the American people, by eradication of all traces of such dogmas in the fundamental law of the States and also in the statutes. Another result will be to concentrate the minds of all Christian people upon the teaching of the Founder of Christianity, that no union between His Church and the State is possible. This ought to lead all who profess and call themselves Christians to strenuously oppose not merely union with the State of other churches than their own, but even more strenuously, if possible, the union of their own church with the State, leading, as they must perceive, to the total destruction of its character as a Christian Church.

"Without going into the question of the dogmatic teaching of the Seventh-day Adventists, I may say that they are the only Christian communion of which I am aware, which adheres rigidly to this all-important teaching of the Founder of Christianity. You will understand then that while they deprecate Sunday laws as embodying recognition by the State of a religious doctrine held by other people, they would not accept Saturday laws of like character from any State, and would not accept them for the very reason that from a Seventh-day Adventist standpoint all such laws would identify their church with the State and thereby destroy its Christian character. To find the professors of a clearly defined religious faith even declining a State preference for their religion over another is a remarkable experience and has given me an interest in this extraordinary people which deepens the more I know and see of them.

HOW THE SUNDAY LAW EMBODIES THE UNION OF CHURCH AND STATE.

"It is a fact, strange as it may seem, that every one of our State constitutions contains a more or less explicit inhibition on any preference by the State of one religious belief over another and any recognition by the State of any religious dogma, and that in spite of all this the early Sunday law cases dared to sustain these statutes upon the express ground that the Christian religion was to be preferred above all others, and that these laws embodied a recognition by the State of the Christian religion as the right religion, and the repudiation by the State of all other religions as wrong religions. It was only after a number of years and repeated efforts that the courts were driven from this untenable position, and of late they have retreated to what is known as the holiday theory of these laws, claiming that they are 'police regulations.' This position, however, is, if anything, more untenable than the other. A holiday law enforced by a penalty would certainly never be passed outside of bedlam. Moreover nearly all Sunday laws contain a prohibition of play as well as work, so that the State under the holiday theory says to the citizen in the Sunday law, 'You must be cheerful and enjoy yourself on Sunday, and to encourage you to do so I will forbid you to attend to your regular occupation, and fine you if you undertake to amuse yourself.' The only parallel to this holiday theory of Sunday laws is found in 'Nicholas Nickleby,' where Mr. Squeers, finding one of his pupils depressed, moistens his right hand, takes a fresh grip on his rattan, and observes, 'Cheerfulness and contentment must be kept up. Moggs, come here.' The language of the Sunday laws no less than their provisions, shows conclusively that they are religious dogmas incorporated into the statutes, and nothing else whatever. Take the section under which Mr. Baker has been prosecuted; you will see that it describes the day as 'The Lord's day.' Now this phrase embodies several propositions which belong solely to the domain of religion, and the use of this phrase involves a preference by the State in the matter of religion, and the enforcement of a law based upon this conception of the day, constrains the citizen in a matter of religion. For instance, these are all religious questions, and religious questions only—first, whether there is or is not a Lord; second, whether there is or is not such a day as the 'Lord's day;' third, whether any special line of conduct is obligatory upon men upon that day as distinguished from other days; fourth, the most important of all to my client, the plainly religious question, What is the 'Lord's day'? All these things lie embodied in this section of our Sunday law and stamp it with the character of religious legislation in direct defiance of the provisions of our bill of rights.

"I will go further and say that the advocates of Sunday laws—I mean the extreme fanatical advocates of such laws—recognize them in their own minds as embodying the union of their Church with the State, and care for them in no other aspect whatever. With many of these people it is a case of shameless, intellectual dishonesty, which is, in my humble judgment, one of the greatest crimes being committed against the human soul. When they pretend that they attach the slightest value to Sunday laws in their holiday aspect they are guilty of false pretenses and are urging arguments in which they take not the slightest interest themselves, which have not the slightest weight in influencing their position, because they believe that these arguments will address themselves with some force to other people. All history past and present shows that this is true.

"You must bear in mind that our American Sunday laws all have their origin in the established Church of Brownism, which was set up in this country by the Pilgrim Fathers. The Brownists were the sect of a sect, being the offshoot of the Puritan school of ecclesiastics in the English Church. Men of their extreme views passed the first Sunday laws to which our colonial acts are to be referred. The first of these laws in England was not directed against work at all, but against travel. The second of them was not directed against work at all, but against sports and pastimes. It was only after a number of years that it dawned upon the English Puritans that work on what they called the Sabbath ought to be punished as well as play. If we come down to present times we shall find those who are chiefly active in instigating prosecutions under our Sunday laws pay more attention to pastimes and pleasures of other people than they do to other work on Sunday. For instance, they are far more excited and inflamed by a Sunday excursion than they are by the work on Monday's newspapers, which is all done on Sunday. They are more offended by a game of baseball in the suburbs than by the running of horse cars in the midst of the city. In fact, I think there are good grounds for the position that if the extreme advocates of Sunday laws were given their choice whether to dispense with the prohibition of play or the prohibition of work, they would prefer to have the play forbidden and have the work go on.

THE QUESTION NOT OF DOCTRINE, BUT OF THE STATE'S RIGHT TO ENFORCE DOCTRINE.

"I would like to add that the Seventh-day Adventists desire no more recognition of their particular faith at the hands of the court than they do at the hands of the legislature—that is to say, they do not ask or expect any court to declare as between them and other denominations the question of what is the Sabbath, nor would they recognize the decision of any court upon that question. The point is that to compel them to appeal to the court on the strength of their particular religious belief is to infringe upon their rights of conscience, because they are responsible to no court for that belief, and no court has the right either to ask them what it may be or to decide between it and other religions. While they claim, and rightly claim to be the champions of religious equality for all the people, and claim, and rightly claim that their cause is really the cause of every Church which claims to be Christian and wishes to keep so by keeping free from contact with civil power, yet it does happen that the Brownist dogma embodied in the Sunday law presses upon them with greater hardship than upon our Hebrew fellow-citizens and others, because it not only compels them to be idle on one day at the command of the civil power in addition to the day which they observe, not as one of idleness but one of devotion to duties of religion, but it also demands of them an outward compliance with a religious doctrine which they believe to be expressly contradictory to the Scriptures and to true Christian belief. And this constraint is laid upon them without the slightest reference to any social aspect of their conduct upon Sunday or the question of whether anybody else is in any way interfered with by it. Surely the ultimate verdict of the American people will be that it is a cruel and wanton proceeding for the State not only to embody in her statutes a religious dogma but to use the police power to enforce an outward deference to that dogma by citizens who believe such deference to be sinful, and for the State to do this when it is not demanded by any social consideration whatever.

NOT NECESSARY AS A POLICE MEASURE.

"Allow me one word more. It is absolutely false that there is any difference whatever in the police conditions required on Sunday and the police conditions required on any other day. It is absolutely false as well as insulting to all pious persons to pretend that they do not discharge the duties of private and public devotion on other days as well as Sundays. Prayer meetings, revivals, church gatherings of every sort are constantly held on week days, and nobody claims that they are not quite as satisfactory to those who hold them as similar proceedings on Sundays.

And I will say also that it is absolutely false to pretend that any different police conditions are required for the peaceable and orderly conducting of a religious meeting from the police conditions which are required for the similar holding of any other kind of meeting. The right of the people peaceably to assemble for religious or any other purposes at all times will be protected by the police independent of Sunday laws. If, therefore, all such laws were repealed the people who hold religious exercises upon Sunday would be no more disturbed than they now are. And as these laws are evidently not passed either for holiday or police purposes, it follows once more that they are religious dogmas embodied in American statutes, and nothing more or less. This is the view which, if possible, the International Religious Liberty Association will finally see adopted by the American courts."—Centerville (Md.) Record, May 6, 1893.
