THE first Sunday of the World's Fair has passed. The Fair has been closed, and still the question of whether it shall remain closed is apparently as far from being decided as ever.

THERE is no abatement in the zeal of the American Sabbath Union, in its alliance with this telegram from its secretary to the Attorney General of the United States:—

The American Sabbath Union, a national society of the supporters of the American Sabbath laws, representing fourteen denominations of Americans, appeals to you to have the Columbian Exposition, enjoined from opening the gates on Sunday.

This has been re-enforced by many similar telegrams from different parts of the country, emanating from the Sabbath unions.

THE Christian Endeavor societies of the world are preparing to engineer a mammoth boycott of the Fair, if it should be open on Sunday. Of this the *Mail and Express* says:—

The Executive Committee of the Christian Endeavor Societies made in Cincinnati, and in Monterey a motion to withdraw a telegram from Chicago asking for the immediate closing of the Fair on Sunday, the previous day. Every Christian Endeavor Society in the world will be notified, and further steps will be made at once to carry the boycott into effect. This will mean an extensive counter movement. To this religious society belongs a membership of 1,500,000, and besides its influence, similar forces in the form of boycott promises can influence. This will influence similar forces in other religious denominations.

It was the Ohio National edition which was about to spring an ironclad boycott pledge, in case the World's Fair opened its gates on Sunday, at the great Christian Endeavor convention in this city in 1892, when they were forestalled by the presentation and passage of a set of resolutions conciliating, which evaded the question of boycotting, and did not attempt to commit the attendance of the members. The boycott is now revived, and every effort is evidently to be used to make it general.

It is also said that the Parliamentarians of Religions will prove a failure in case the Fair should be open on Sunday, as many clergymen who have promised to take part would remain away altogether. Of this the organized opposition, as cited by the New York *World* says:—

The boycott, as a weapon of compulsion in labor disputes, has come home upon capital with native force, and it is occasionally harder to argue out opponents uses. It was never expected that it would be used as an ecclesiastical weapon to enforce an outward conformity to superstitious prejudices. But the clergymen who have united as a combination, as superstitious as any who may have proposed in respect to the World's Fair, propose to make a failure of the Parliament of Religions altogether if it is opened on Sundays. We trust that the Fair will be open nevertheless. It is high time to defy the solidarity of the modern sort of the Pharisees. True, Christians by rote of dissemblance would challenge their opponents without in the name of the law. True Christians, the interpretation of the commandment by the doctors of divinity to-day, and when surprised affirmed that "the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." He did not and he made the Church for *Laws* of *Christians*, but for men.

Consider what these ministers claim. They claim the right not rest upon their individual right to refrain from Sunday amusement—no one disputes that right. They seek to enforce their scruples upon the whole community.

Those who are now so ready to organize a stupendous boycott for the injury, and, if possible, the complete financial disaster and destruction of the World's Fair, if it opens on Sunday, are equally as capable of controlling the late decisions of the courts the same principle does not equally apply to the World's Fair and the Christian Endeavor Society as to railroads and the locomotive engineers.

THE World's Fair correspondent of the New York *Sun*, after saying that the Fair was to be closed on the first Sunday, continued as follows:—

President Higginbotham had nothing to say about the second Sunday. He is evidently considering to say, however, after the Board of Finance meets on next Friday, the council will come up by then and be thoroughly discussed. The question will come in hot fight and the chances are in favor of its being voted to open the gates.

Several members of the Directory predict that the decision will be in favor of an open Fair on Sunday. Even the element which originally to remove the first Sunday in order that public sentiment against Sunday, which is of course still to be aroused, will be as great so as to clearly show that

Charles W. Clingman, who represents ten thousand shares of stock in the Columbian Exposition Company, to-day served notice in writing upon the director to open the gates of the Fair and that he chooses to go to the Fair on any succeeding Sunday. If the gates are closed he will commence legal proceedings.

Now, whichever way the gates are turned, the matter threatens to go into the courts for discussion and adjudication. All of these will only tend to awaken the popular mind to a consideration of the subject, and an investigation of the principle upon which its decision should rest.

The Chicago correspondent of the *Tribune* says:—

Unfortunately the local Board and the National Commission disagree on the Sunday opening question. A majority of the members of the National Commission are against it. But a motion to close the Fair on Sunday will be in the nature of a new order, and will require a two-thirds vote. Some of the national gentlemen talk about getting an injunction, to prevent any one from opening the turnstiles and cashier boxes. It is argued that this body does not really care whether the turnstiles and cashier boxes are open or not. There is no vote on record as voting against opening them.

Whatever the decision of the courts on the case that is to be taken into the higher courts is not yet settled. It is willing to throw all further responsibility on the courts and Congress. If action upon the gates and the National Commission are satisfied, they will not stir up any doubt, they are not going to say anything. But in the meanwhile they want to know whether he had been notified that any such actions are to be brought by the Local Board. That is why they have been holding back. It is understood that they will not be in a permanent session here until the Fair closes.

The facts of the case are about these: Congress provided that the Fair will open every Sunday in two or three weeks; or the local Directory will decide that it is not to be opened to anyone. But the probabilities are all in favor of its being opened to offend the National Commission.

Public opinion here is overwhelmingly in favor of opening the gates on Sunday. Even the clergy, almost without exception, favor it—some of them "open the gates with the liberality of thought up."

The World's Fair authorities who belong to the localistic management, obviously seem to be in favor of the opening, but because of the pains congressional affiliation and are subject to political influence shown the attitude of the clergy with a sufficient following of Congressmen imposing the Sunday-closing condition.

The Board of Lady Managers has put itself on record as favoring Sunday opening of thirteen Chicago churches voted
