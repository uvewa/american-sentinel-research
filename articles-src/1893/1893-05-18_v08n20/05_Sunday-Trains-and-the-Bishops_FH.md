I refer especially to Sunday trains on railways, besides manuscripts for me, and excursions of which the bishops should speak fearfully, especially I refer to the daring efforts which many do take in the Sunday and the Sabbath, in such places as the British Museum, the National Museum, and the like.

But which tries the bishops most is the fact that many of our own clergymen are taking and advocating these most shameless affiliations with the English Society. And worse yet they speak most ministerially about in the authenticity. To use the bishop's own words: "They proclaim that it is the Sabbath! It is to themselves; his Lord's day rests upon nothing but Church authority, and on no other foundation, the word of God." Now, this is purely very timid. It is all very well that the clergy commend themselves to know that Sunday has no Bible support, but there is too much to know and try it is, on the whole, a sad too bad. The bishops then given vest to it.

That layman of high position and education, and devotion, and of deep conscience that should send the attempt to break down the old Sabbath as a duty of religion and of the State, and pray for them. "They know not what they do." A member of the board of laymen, in the churches of England, and reading the fourth commandment from the Decalogue, but to faithfully proceed the Sabbath being kept holy, if they were consistent—upon every seventh day is a solemn observance of the seventh day. They are amazed, puzzled, involved, grieved, and astonished.

Unfortunately the day was changed. It was changed by the pope of Rome, instead of God; Lord's resurrection, instead of the seventh. But I do not want to go into this further now; it is enough for me to make the statement and to make no public alarm about it. Page Mr.
