ALL human laws for the enforcement of religion have a common origin, their development has been consistent from the beginning; all their different manifestations show this to be so, and none the less at this time than then. The evil principle involved in a legal religion and its enforcement is about to reach its high-water mark and be carried to its furthest extreme, in this country. That under it all the tortures of the Inquisition of the past are not to be practiced, will not be the fault of the inquisitors of the nineteenth century, but by the mercy of God.
