WHILE people in America are hearing much about the "American Sabbath" we, here in England, are hearing a great deal about "the old English Sunday." And our patriotism leads us to think that our old English Sunday is as good an article as the American Sabbath. It is certainly more antiquated. However, a great cry is now being raised that the old English Sunday is in danger, and worst of all, it is being hurt in the house of its friends. They are saying nasty things about it. But Bishop Ryle, of Liverpool, has championed its cause and has just come to its rescue with a booklet entitled "Thoughts about Sunday," in which he pleads for "the strong arm of the law." Here are some of his utterances:

> I am persuaded that one half of English Christianity is bound up with the maintenance of "the old English Sunday."

> In a word, Sunday is the barometer of every so-called Christian nation.

> It is no light matter, we must remember. It is a question which effects the very life of English religion. I can imagine no greater disaster to the cause of Christ, in this island, than the introduction of a continental Sunday. From such a disaster, good Lord deliver us!

I refer especially to Sunday trains on railways, Sunday steamboats on the river, and excursions to tea gardens and places of public amusement, and especially I refer to the daring efforts which many are often making in the present day to throw open such places as the British Museum, the National Gallery, and the Crystal Palace on Sundays.—Page 36.

But that which tries the bishop most is the fact that many of his own clergy are taking and advocating these most shameful liberties with the old English Sunday. And worse yet they speak most disrespectfully about its authenticity. To use the bishop's own words: "They proclaim to the world that the observance of the Lord's day rests upon nothing but Church authority, and can not be proved by the word of God." Now, this is surely very unkind. It is all very well for the clergy themselves to know that Sunday has no Bible support, but for them to tell the "common people" about it is certainly too bad. The bishop then gives vent to his harrowed feelings:—

> That laymen of high position and education, noblemen, philosophers and scientific lecturers, should assist the attempt to break down the old English Sunday, is a matter for deep regret. I can only suppose they do it in ignorance. I pity and pray for them. "They know not what they do." But how any clergyman holding office in the Church of England, and reading the fourth commandment every Sunday to his congregation, can lend his aid to movements which must infallibly prevent the Sabbath being kept holy, if they succeed, is one of the mysteries of the nineteenth century which passes my understanding. I am amazed, pained, troubled, grieved, and astounded.

The idea that Sunday has no foundation in the Bible is demolished with one blow. This is how the worthy bishop does it:—

> Undoubtedly the day was changed. It was made the first day of the week in memory of our Lord's resurrection, instead of the seventh. But I believe the apostles were divinely inspired to make that change and at the same time wisely directed to make no public decree about it. Page 15.

That is all, and is it not sufficient? Why not? Is not the word of a bishop enough? But, unfortunately for clericalism, the people now need something more than an "I believe" of a clergyman, and bishops are losing their power. This Bishop Ryle deplores and attributes it to "the morbid love of liberty and letting every one do as he likes." Page 57.

Liberty, however, is the gift of God to every man.
