THE first Sunday of the World's Fair has passed. The Fair has been closed, and still the question as to whether it shall remain closed on Sundays is apparently as far from being decided as ever.

THERE is no abatement in the zeal of the American Sabbath Union, as is shown by this telegram from its secretary to the Attorney-General of the United States:—

> The American Sabbath Union, a national society for the preservation of the American Sabbath, and representing fourteen denominations of America, appeals to you to have the Columbian Exposition enjoined from opening the gates on Sunday.

This has been reinforced by many similar telegrams from different parts of the country, emanating from the Sabbath Union.

THE Christian Endeavor societies of Ohio are preparing to engineer a mammoth boycott of the Fair, if it should be open on Sunday. Of this the Mail and Express says:—

> The Executive Committee of the Ohio societies is now in session in Cincinnati, and on Monday morning will receive a telegram from Chicago informing them if the gates have been open on the previous day. Every Christian Endeavor Society in the world will be notified, and efforts will be made at once to carry the boycott into effect. This will extend, not only to the several million young people of the society, but to all the persons whom these members can influence. This will doubtless seriously affect the World's Fair gate receipts.

It was the Ohio delegation which was about to spring an ironclad boycott pledge, in case the World's Fair opened on Sunday, at the great Christian Endeavor Convention in this city in 1892, when they were forestalled by the presentation and passage of a set of simple resolutions which evaded the question of boycotting, and did not attempt to control the attendance of the members. The boycott is now revived, and every effort is evidently to be used to make it general.

Religions will prove a failure in case the Fair should be open on Sunday, as many clergymen who have promised to take part would remain away altogether. Of this organized avoidance of the Fair the New York World says:—

> The boycott, as a weapon of compulsion in labor disputes, has never been regarded with entire favor, and it is notoriously liable to unjust and oppressive uses. It was never expected that it would be employed as a weapon of "Churchianity," to enforce an outward conformity to superstitious Sabbatarianism. This is what some American zealots have proposed in respect to the World's Fair. They have announced a purpose to boycott the Fair altogether if it is opened on Sundays. We trust that the Fair will be open nevertheless. It is high time to defy the authority of the modern sect of the Pharisees. True, Christians by tens of thousands would challenge their oppressive dictations in the name of Him who . . . violated the interpretation of the commandment by the doctors of divinity of his day, and when reproved affirmed that "the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." He did not say it was made for the Church or for Jews or for Christians, but for man. . . . Consider what these mistaken and despotic religionists propose. They do not rest upon their individual right to refrain from visiting the Fair on Sundays for conscience' sake. They seek to enforce their scruples upon the whole community.

These who are now so ready to organize a stupendous boycott for the injury, and, if possible, the complete financial disgrace and destruction of the World's Fair, if it opens on Sunday, are capable of comprehending the late decisions of the courts in boycott cases. What is the reason the same principle does not equally apply to the World's Fair and the Christian Endeavor Society as to railroads and the locomotive engineers?

THE World's Fair correspondent of the New York Sun, after saying that the Fair was to be closed on the first Sunday, continues:—

> President Higinbotham had nothing to say about the second Sunday. He will probably have something to say, however, after the Board of Directors meets on next Friday. The question will come up then and be thoroughly discussed. The question will cause a hot fight, and the champions of both an open and a closed Sunday will be out in force.
>
> Well informed members of the Directory predict that the decision will be in favor of an open Sunday. They also say that the gates will be closed to-morrow (the first Sunday) in order that public sentiment against closing, which it is expected will be aroused, will be so great as to show clearly that the demand for an open Sunday is general. . . .
>
> Charles W. Clingman, who represents ten thousand shares of stock in the Columbian Exposition Company, to-day served notice in writing upon the Directors that the gates of the Fair must not be closed to-morrow or any succeeding Sunday. If they are Mr. Clingman threatens to begin legal proceedings.

So, whichever way the gates are turned, the matter threatens to go into the courts for discussion and adjudication. All of this will only tend to awaken the popular mind to a consideration of the subject, and an investigation of the principle upon which its decision should rest.

THE Chicago correspondent of the World says:—

> Unfortunately the Local Board and the National Commission disagree on the Sunday opening question. A majority of the members of the National Commission are against it. But a motion to open the Fair on Sunday would win in the Local Board. The National Commission, with all due respect to the honorable gentlemen composing it, is given a little to demagogism. There are United States senators and others upon it, and they fear their rural constituents. It is the general opinion here that this body does not really care whether the gates are open on Sunday or not, but it wants to put itself on record as voting against opening them. If with that it can wash its hands of the matter it will be satisfied. It is willing to throw all further responsibility on the Local Board. If the latter open the gates and the National Commission can not be held responsible by country constituents they are not going to say anything. But in the meantime they want to know whether they can be held accountable for any such action on the part of the Local Board. That is why they have been holding so many meetings this week and are to go into permanent session here until the Fair closes.
>
> Nine out of every ten persons here are convinced that the Fair will open every Sunday, in two or three weeks. Indeed the majority are surprised that it is not to be opened to-morrow. But the Local Board moves slowly because it does not want to offend the National Commission.
>
> Public opinion here is overwhelmingly in favor of opening the gates on Sunday. Even the clergy is divided on the point. Nearly all those ministers who are noted for their liberality of thought say, "Open the gates on Sunday."

The World's Fair authorities who belong to the immediate management seem to be in favor of the opening, but those who have congressional affinities and are subject to political influences show the same spirit which influenced Congress in imposing the Sunday-closing condition. The Board of Lady Managers has put itself on record as favoring Sunday opening.

Out of thirteen Chicago clergymen interviewed by a reporter for the Chicago Evening Journal, six, for various and widely differing reasons, expressed themselves as favoring Sunday opening. But those who advocated Sunday closing did so with such an abandon of virulence and so open an appeal to force as to show clearly the growing intensity of feeling on this subject.

Dr. Bolton, of the Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church, was asked:—

> Granting that the Christian Church, as a whole, declares for such an observance of Sunday as might be considered oppressive by a very large element, would you still enforce your views upon them?

To this the reply was made:—

> We propose to stand by the Sabbath. Congress, representing all the people of the United States, has settled that matter.

The possible inquisitorial terrors of all the centuries of religious persecution are bound up in that reply. The question of equity, right, and justice does not seem to have entered into the mind from which that answer came. The only thought seems to be,—Have we the power to enforce our views? We have. Then they shall be enforced, irrespective of how large an element may be oppressed by them!

Dr. Herrick Johnson expresses similar thoughts and cites the religious precedents in the military and civil life of the Nation, and points to the fact that the dictum of the Supreme Court has established the claim of this as a "Christian Nation."

Rev. F. A. Noble, of the Union Park Congregational Church, was asked:—

> If Sunday observance, as you advocate it, is considered oppressive by a majority of all the people would you still enforce it?

The unhesitating answer to this was:—

> Exactly as I would enforce the law in any other respect.

By which he seems to mean to say that he would enforce law at all hazards, however oppressive it might be to even the majority.

Dr. Fawcett says in reference to the plea of the workingmen that they can not afford to take a week day off,—"I have no sympathy with their talk," and counsels that they add an hour or an hour and a half to their working time five days in the week, and take Saturday to see the Fair.

These things all mark the intensity of feeling which is growing on this subject, and emphasize the dangerous possibilities which are lying in wait. The question of all the ages since sin came into the world is before the people,—it will not down. Fealty to God or obedience to man, which? Loyalty to God is not on the side of either of the contesting parties who struggle for the mastery, but in allegiance to the abstract principle of equal justice to all men without exception or reservation.
