The new law for the suppression of Stundists in Russia provides that all children of Stundists are to be placed under clerical guardians, and are to be baptised in the Orthodox Church. The Stundists are further required to employ Orthodox servants in their meeting-houses, while their graves are to be kept apart from those of members of the Orthodox Church. Finally, their passports are to be so marked as to show that they belong to the Stundist sect. This is something after the manner of dealing with observers of the Bible Sabbath in this country; in some States they are "permitted" to observe the seventh day, but must keep the first day also. In others "conscientious observers" of the seventh day are exempt from the requirement to keep Sunday, but are liable to arrest, when they must set up their religious practice as a defense, to be passed upon by the court. The principle is the same; it is in either case an assertion or inducement of the injury.
