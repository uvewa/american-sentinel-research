integrity and suffer the loss of property, of personal liberty; and it may be, consignment to the dungeon, to the chaingang, or to fortune for a time until the Son of God, descending in his glory, will have set "the captive free." Then the Word says,—

And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

And he (the the two horned beast, or the United States Government) had power to give life unto the image of the beast (church and state combine) should both speak and cause that as many as would not, worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark (of false religion, that is, Sunday-keeping, as a mark, false the symbol of labor) or in their foreheads (that of their belief). And that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Rev. 13: 8.

But this name is not doubtful, for from the face of Patmos John in prophetic vision declares: "And I saw, as it were, a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, stood on the sea of glass having the harps of God."

ALL political efforts for uniformity are antagonistic to the gospel. A prominent man has recently stated that fully of religious in essential to the existence of a nation. That is what the Czar of Russia thinks, and the result is the most cruel and oppressive tyranny. That idea, which is neither the most enlightened nation at the present day, is the foundation of the Inquisition. Christ desires unity, but he does not try to force it, because the unity which is essential in the unity of growth into Christ, and growth can not be forced. The claims of Jesus is love, and faith kills love. Where there is no love there is no righteousness; and therefore since faith and love are inseparable, it is plainly evident that the surest way to debase a uniformity in matters of religion by means of law.—*Truth, London.*
