ANY idea that the American Sentinel has any interest antagonistic to the best interests of the World's Fair is altogether a mistake. Exposure alone is not its aim but rather the preservation of that liberty which our fathers have so long enjoyed. It is not because there was ever greater reason to expect and to hope that their devotion to the common welfare of the State would save the State from ruin.

THAT the World's Fair at Chicago is not yet a paying financial institution is not yet definitely settled. The *Mail and Express*, the great champion of Sunday closing, and in the issue of May 8 says:—

It is said that 150,000 persons crowded around the gates of the Chicago Exposition yesterday and were denied admission to the grounds. We submit that if any man has paid a premium for the admission on the part of those in control to repair the Sabbath and so keep it holy. But to say that the demonstration was organized for the purpose of adding to the strength of the Sabbath-keeping cause and that the gates were kept closed in order that the work in progress for the exhibition plan the next 5 preparing the exhibit buildings that all plans were perfected, the plan all arranged for opening the gates every day of the week—exposing the contents to the visitors.

That the surimi of the *Mail and Express* is probably correct is strongly indicated by two facts: First, the working people of Chicago and neighboring cities refused Sunday closing; and secondly, that Fair threatens to be a financial failure and any event, and will certainly be such in its possible receipts of the twenty-six Sundays are lost to it.

CONSIDERING the financial prospects of the New York Stock Exchange of May 8, also published the following interesting facts:—

During the first six days at Chicago, including the opening way by an abnormally large amount since, the number of paying visitors has averaged 48,000. Leaving the opening day out and account, the average has been about 30,000. For not whether the sun has, and the widespread business depression prevail or not. But there is no doubt that whatever financial the attendance has been thus far, in the financial situation. The statistics for month ending the month of May was not 80,000.

From this and the six per cent. dividends due on the first day of next year, and the books are the city of Chicago; for fifty million and the stock subscriptions amounting to about $5,000,000, the expenditure of the Exhibition is seen to be, as at its gates more than $110,000 over and above running expenses. The running expenses are estimated at $8,000 a day, and the management expects rigidly estimated the receipts from the admission will take care of this.

Supposing that hope is well founded, and that the running expenses are met by the pay of operating expenses, it appears that in order to rebuild the original cost of the magnificent buildings of the White City, the average daily paying attendance at the Chicago Fair at fifty cents a head will have to be from 13,000 to 9,000, or from 30,000 to 50,000 more than the average work day attendance at Paris in 1889.

These figures furnish a strong argument in favor of Sunday opening of the Fair, for without the Sunday gate receipts it is impossible that the Exhibition shall be a financial success. The average daily attendance at the Paris Exhibition

of 1889, was 125,000 on work days and about 300,000 on Sundays. In Chicago probably the difference in favor of Sunday would be much greater, for at Chicago a Sunday rest is more general than in Paris, and as more people, in proportion, would be free to attend the Fair on that day is the former than in the latter city. These facts make it certain that those who have money invested in the Fair will be very slow to attempt to secure the opening of the gates upon the day that would yield probably three or four times the amount of gate receipts that the management can hope to realize on other days. But however the question may be finally settled it is likely that to serious effort will be made to open on Sunday until the machinery is in place and the whole Fair in better condition than it is at present, for that day affords a very convenient time for doing work that could not be done so well when visitors are present. And for this sort of "Sabbath observance" there was great petition in the Chicago churches on the 7th, inst. The *Mail and Express* says:—

Many sermons expressing the gratification of the working citizens of Chicago at the victory, were preached by ministers of the various denominations.

And the correspondent innocently adds, not apparently sensing any incongruity in it,—

In the several instances of employ on the grounds of admission, not less than 20,000 employed (Sunday) watchmen re-examined. Construction work was stopped, except upon two of the exhibition buildings. A large force of electricians and wiremen were at work stringing wires throughout for the grand illuminate to-night.

And that is how the World's Fair is observing the "Christian Sabbath"!

On the outside the day was no better observed. It is estimated that one hundred and fifty thousand people sought admission to the grounds but were turned away. "Finding that they could not gain admission," says the *World*, "the great crowd filled up the Midway Plaisance and wandered every side-show and fakir exhibition within sight of the grounds. The saloons and the less reputable resorts were likewise thronged. There is no evidence that the churches had any more attendance than would naturally have result from the Fair gates been thrown open." On the financial side the Sunday closing will prove extremely disastrous to the enterprise. From a moral point of view it will be no loss to a failure."

Evidently the works of Hen. J. C. Houk, of Tennessee, to one of his constituents, are being realized: "So far as Chicago is concerned I believe the closing of the Fair on Sunday will be the worst thing that could happen to her, for the reason that such closing will keep the great tide of visitors within the city which will offer thousands of inducements to dissipation and other drive to keep sober

the front or back door open." Nevertheless Mr. Hrock was one who voted for the Sunday-closing proviso.

The new law for the suppression of Sanitalia in Romania provides that all editions of Sanitalia are to be placed under district guardians, and are to be baptised in the Orthodox Church. The Sanitalias are further forbidden to employ Orthodox servants—for these who have desecrated their graves are to be kept apart from those of good members of the Orthodox Church. Finally, their properties are to be so marked as to show that they belong to the sanctioned families of the section. This fact. This is according after the manner of dealing with dissenters of the Bible Sabbath in this country; in some States they are "permitted" to observe the law around, but not to perform other observers" of the seventh day are exempt. But the requirements to keep Saturday, but are liable to arrest, when they must sit and try their religious practices for them to be passed upon by the court. The principle is the same in both cases; it is an assertion of a right of the civil power to supervise and regulate the religious actions of its citizens.

As valuable a pocket dictionary as we have seen is the "American Pocket Dictionary and Parliamentary Manual," of 64 pages, 16 cents, published by Olmsted and Company, 61 Congress Street, Hartford, Ct. This dictionary is self-pronouncing and contains over forty thousand words, with the correct definition of each. The combination of foreign words and phrases commonly full and available.
