The world is fast dividing itself into two classes—one class acknowledging and loving the power of the eternal God who made heaven and earth, the other owning and loving the power of earth. There will be, finally, only the two parties. The former class are Christians and will be owned and accepted of Christ when he comes; the latter are antichristian and will be rejected. Both parties are seeking a covering, that is, both desire to be clothed with power, and each class will have their prayers answered. One covering will be obtained by faith, the other by sight or intrigue. The covering received by faith will be obtained from heaven, in face of every earthly element against the petitioners; but that covering means eternal life, for it is the covering of God's almighty and eternal Spirit. The covering the other class obtain can be received with much less difficulty, in that it is by sight,—it being popular—and earthly elements are in the seekers' favor, but when received it will only prove their confusion and eternal ruin.

All this is truth because it is what God says. Please read Isa. 30:1, 2. "Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin; that walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt."

They who thus walk to go down to Egypt are those seeking the strength of civil power in whatever age they may live. The truth applies in the nineteenth century as forcibly as when Egypt was the mightiest nation of earth. Those who thus descend from God to secure earthly power are adding sin unto their sin already committed of turning their backs upon Jehovah and rejecting their Maker. They may obtain the covering of the civil arm, but God says it shall prove their shame (verse 3) and their trust in earthly power shall be their confusion.

Shall we, by seeking just now for earthly power, throw aside this counsel of the Lord, and instead of being covered with the precious and all-powerful covering of his Spirit, seek the covering of sinful man? The covering of the civil arm may seem pleasant for a season, but when the burning wrath of a just God begins to fall upon the heads of the guilty inhabitants of earth, it will change to indescribable woe. Civil power will prove no shelter in that awful day, but those who are shielded by the covering of Jehovah, those who have had the covering of his Spirit drawn over them, will be safe. Reader, which covering will you choose?

T. E. BOWEN.
