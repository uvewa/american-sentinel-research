Church does not demand of its members not to patronize or to abstain in its against of law. Its power was acquired to act not within an arena as an act of worship to-day, but as an instrument of the civil authority. And to cut down before the world to a level with the superstitions of the Dark Ages, the Inquisition, by admitting entirely the act of resting upon the day of worship. To acknowledge and put on a fair basis the Sabbath of the Lord, Seventh-day Adventists demand that we should worship and rest on the seventh day; and not to do so, while the rest of the time, and knowing that we are not doing so, we are giving the same opportunity to all. We do not think also that any person has any right to compel us through civil law to be idle upon the first day and surrender our employment in every week. He who surrenders a vital principle to a popular clamor can be trusted to obey any earthly power, merely to save himself from trouble, and this is just what the world who are not Christians do—they conform in compliance with all observers of the true Sabbath, and who are also thus waiting for the Saviour to come.

The fact put very mildly, but it is none the less positive; it expresses the view of less positive principles the subjects, and every Seventh-day Adventist who has studied of how Adventists regard the claims and the authority of the commandment. It is not a matter of which the courts can have any proper jurisdiction. No court would be so judges the conscience of any civil jurisdiction over the consciences of the people; but the fact that shows most conclusively that Sunday laws do at least interfere with the religious rights of the Adventists, by requiring of them to do that which their consciences are accustomed to render. This is in addition to the obligation to work during each of the sixth of the time divinely allotted to them for work.

The world is fast dividing itself into two classes—one class acknowledging and loving the power of the eternal God who made heaven and earth, the other setting and loving the power of earth. These two classes are becoming more distinct. The former class are Christians and will be persecuted by the latter. But the final and the crown whose the latter are authorities and governments to compel what they observe as placing a covering, that is, both desire to be clothed with power, and each one will have their prayers answered. One covering will be obtained by faith, the other by sight or intrigue. The covering received by faith will be obtained from heaven, in face of every earthly element against the petitioners; but there will be eternal life, for it is the covering of God's almighty and eternal Spirit. The covering gotten by sight, that is earthly, and will not endure—neither can it be received with much less difficulty, in these human organizations. Both human and earthly elements are in the seekers' favor, yet each, when it is only partly prove their confusion and eternal ruin.

All this truth brought to man in what the Sabbath means to man. Consider Prov. Isa. 30:1, 2. "Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin; that walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt."

They who thus walk to go down to Egypt; who look for the protection of civil power in whatever age they may count. How Egyptian, when used in the same century as forcibly as when Egypt was the mightiest nation of earth. Those who

thus demand from God to secure earthly power are placing sin upon their sin already committed of turning their backs upon Himself and rejecting their Maker. They may obtain the covering of the civil; but God says it is that they obtain shame (verse 3) and their trust in earthly power shall be their confusion.

There are those also who, having earthly power, throw aside his counsel of wisdom and self-reliance; if they can, with the precious and all-powerful covering of his Spirit—what can weak, sinful man? The covering of the civil power of this country will soon, too, be a covering of shame to those who trust in it; when the burning wrath of a just God begins to fall upon the heads of an guilty inhabitants of earth, it will change to ashes about them. Civil power will prove no shelter in that awful day, but those who are now having "the covering of the Spirit," the meek, and persecuted, patient, those who have had the covering of its Spirit over their claim, will be safe. Reader, which covering will you have?

T. E. Bowen.
