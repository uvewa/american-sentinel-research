THE *Dallas News* of the 1st of March last, gives an account of a spicy discussion in the lower house of the Texas legislature, touching a vital point as follows:—

At the conclusion of the prayer, Mr. McLemore said:—

WHEREAS, The prayer which appears in the House Journal of January 26, last, tendered by the chaplain, Rev. W. B. Pennington, is a reflection on the members of this body; therefore, be it

*Resolved*, that the Sergeant-at-arms be directed to erase the objectionable portions of the chaplain's prayer from the records, and hereafter all prayers must be submitted in writing to the Speaker before being incorporated in the Journal.

Mr. Sebantion moved to table the resolution.

At the end of an hour and ten minutes this motion was lost.

Mr. Sewell spoke indignantly against being associated with the chaplain's remarks. The appropriation to establish the home for fallen women was then under fire, and the chaplain had, it seems, made use of the object of it as the special object of prayer. Almost every member who spoke declared that no chaplain shall instruct the chaplain how he shall pray, and that no man had the right to dictate the prayer, or say what shall be prayed for by the chaplain, unless he appreciates that he loves it.

Fagan, of Lamar, contended that the print of the prayers in the journal was themselves necessary. The chaplain was employed to conduct an endeavor toward uniting Church and State, or to provide for the religious instruction of the members, was no necessity for such action. No one can say it is not a direct encouragement to this result. The home for the fallen women's home. I am opposed to anything that tends toward a union of Church and State. I am further opposed, on the other conviction that these poor, forlorn creatures, the fallen women, should be held up as a byword and have their names published to insult to numbers. This prayer ought to be expunged from the record.

Mr. Turner—Dr. Pennington is here in the dual capacity of citizen and minister. He has a right and just, if he wishes, and he does wish to pray for the passage of the bill. The Constitution grants him the privilege, and I move he be sustained.

Mr. Fields—The whole affair is unprecedented in my experience of eight years.

Mr. Peck—I distinctly disagree with members, when he asked me for permission to explain, that Mr. Pennington is a citizen and has a right to pray and express his prayers.

Mr. Peck—The chaplain ought to have the right to pray as he likes. The resolution offered is against the fallen women's bill hour the chaplain of this House is engaged to pray for. Both sides of the question are now presented. If by the chaplain he has made no personal allusion to the malice intentions of anyone, which is the case here. There should be forbearance for him as well as for us, at any rate.

Mr. Graham—Why may he not put his explanation, in his written prayer, how our time should be occupied?

Speaker Pennington—I have no explanation to make. I came here to pray. The unsaved were not members in my mind and meant to cast no insinuations upon any member. My prayer in the pursuance of virtue and the salvation of souls in the State of Texas was entirely in keeping the women in there for the purpose of being reclaimed. The reclamation was the work of the Christian denomination. My prayer had nothing to do with legislatures. My position is that it is wrong for a preacher from engaging in the work. You know and the religious people of the State demand that which govern and control society. On matters that the good night deprives a great many of people of the State of their just rights. Now the good work night deprive a great many of people of the State of their just rights. Now if the chaplain is employed to pray for us as gentlemen, but if I have not the right to pray that laws be passed in your interests. I'll resign. I think I have the right to pray your attention.

All that is needed here is to reflect on who offers up prayer proposing merely to please the members. His prayer is not addressed to them, for he is addressing a superior power. It comes and goes forever. There is nothing that could be more calculated to convey a false and mischievous impression than for the chaplain to object to the prayer. It implies that the speaker who objects to it cannot and fully said such prayer, and the objection is thus virtually to the prayers of the chaplain who would not dare to let such a thing pass unnoticed. It implies besides, in the hearer's mind it is a plea for and an exercise of authority and reflection.

At the same time I am not persecuting any member of this body. I have no quarrel with the chaplain in this matter or any other. His intention is strictly in the line of a servant of the Lord, but objected to praying prayers in the legislature.

The two points of dispute involved in this wrangle and confusion were both exposed by the chaplain.

The chaplain's statement that if he has not the right to pray that members have no special interest in his prayers must be dictated, forces from one who has ever observed its relations sufficient thought to

very pertinent inquiry. Why was I sent to preach by the State to pray for the lawmakers, why has not the State the right to say for whom the prayers of the men assembled, for whom the prayers are to be offered, shall be offered? And if so, who shall pray? True, it diverts the particular petition of the chaplain to the wishes or religious sentiments of the members, and away from every elements of sincerity, from every reality. His prayer must be cut to pattern.

Shall any of these man-pleasing and standards of man-pleasing prayers be continued? The Bible says, "Continue in prayer. But what matters that? It is not the sincerity of the man who accepts the job of doing the State's praying, and the State's prayers to give, is not the one to object to his being told what he may or may not pray to, so long as he holds on to the job.

But the most serious charge against this resolution, not only the injustice of imposing conditions of dictation upon ministers to pray as themselves and for his constituency when they do not believe in, but the assumption of the right to employ a minister to pray too much the fact that it is made the business of anybody to pray for a ministry of the State. Chaplain P. is employed to simply pray for the State; he must pray according to his employers' orders, and he is subject to the chaplain. It is a principle well understood in church work that the minister is subject to the dictation of the employer in regard to the nature of his work. In the establishment of Dr. Pennington's contention that the State has the right to employ and understand this as well as anybody, and for the purpose of praying for himself and receiving the pay for it, he but advocates for the employment of a minister of religion and the right of the State to employ with it. Why, then, should he not object to have his prayer dictated to him, as well as his salary? I say, why not?

When a chaplain comes here, and offers up prayer, proposing merely to please and to instruct the members of the two, in defense of the chaplain. Mr. Turner says, "Dr. Pennington is the work of a minister in this respect as in any other, to let a minister take his part, or work with them at any post, but not when he is a minister of the State—employed by the State as a minister of Christ, a freeman indeed, who is privileged to pray when and for whom his Lord directs without any reservation, he can, and must, if he does not wish to forfeit his right, resist any editing or displacing anybody any his prayers as the free intercession of free ministry. And when a chaplain comes to be a minister of the State—hired by it, paid by it—it must certainly follow that the State has the right to tell him what to pray to suit its representatives? And if it has the right to tell him what to, does it not equally have the right to tell him what not to pray? And if the State has this right, does not each member have it? Again the ever present and sometimes bewildering question appears, in such a connection too.

Has a minister any obligation to undertake the unspeakably difficult task of praying at one time to suit each one of Mr. Alleto's colleagues in not as he represents himself. What it amounts to is this:

"Without much and prayer, you cannot come at the truth. When at last, but the question at then, are they had by any means of saying, 'I know that my minister said State paid at that, with which there came the right of the State to say what the prayer has something to do? Yet I see no reason for not giving this point a encourages in people.

There is much in such things as the printing of the chaplain's prayers in the course of "independence," hereafter, uniting Church and State " to which he be
