The case of the State vs. Isaac Baker, a Seventh-day Adventist, who was arrested for violating the Sunday law, was continued Tuesday evening in an analysis of the counsel for the defense, Mr. Jas. T. Ringgold, of the Baltimore Bar. The State made no opposition to the continuance, the ground upon which it was asked being that the law points involved were precisely the same as those in the case of John W. Judefind recently convicted at Chancery on the same charge, and a brother of the man acquitted.

Mr. Ringgold was seen at the Arlington Hotel by a representative of the *Sun*, who asked him to explain the extraordinary interest he is taking in the defense of these men. He referred to his appearing as counsel in behalf of Mr. Baker and the other cases, and stated substantially as follows:

"I appear for the defendants through the International Religious Liberty Association, because I believe that the constitution, the fundamental law of all American law which is the bulwark in this land of liberty, represents a union of Church and State. Sunday laws are by no means purely civil, only survivals among us of the English laws, but they are by far the most conspicuous and dangerous to Americans in this country. Heretofore the resistance offered them has been passive rather than active. It has come chiefly from Hebrew influences, for the very reason the Jew was able truthfully say, 'our State is absolute secular.' I maintain that the first amendment to the Constitution declares that 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' and in the second article of the treaty with Tripoli, the following statement is made, 'The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.'

"I also, this shows the act of Congress to be unconstitutional, and when the question is fairly presented to the people, a great many of the most learned members of both houses took that very view; and a majority would have voted against it, but for the combination of petitioners and protests and boycott that came from the religious political gentlemen of Sunday movements, 'Christian lobbyists' as they are called, and finally yielded, establishing the notion on the ground that 'it would be unreasonable to do otherwise,' 'Congressman themselves admitted that it had been done, and realized how shameful—but that does not alter the fact.' Then there came a demand for a hearing on the question of constitutionality. The American law is here likely to pass out of this

position taken by the Seventh-day Adventists, and their truthful adherence to it. One of the most important of these methods be that the American people begin to consider the extent to which religious dogmas are embodied in the governmental system of every State. This will be followed, as I hope and believe, because the Adventist people, by every well directed effort to free the State's the removal of all traces of creeds dogma in the statute books, and to remove all obstructions to the purely secular character of the station. Another result will be to fix public attention permanently and invincibly upon the teaching of the Founder of Christianity in regard to the relation of His Church and His State in the people. This regards to lead all followers of the Lord Christian Americans to strenuously oppose not merely one or two edicts of Church power, but to oppose the establishment of other churches than their own, nor any connection whatever between the Church of their own church with the State, lead them to demand the total and complete distinction of the character as a Christian nation.

"The most important of all distinctly Christian teaching of the Seventh-day Adventists, and I believe the most important application and the essential truth of the only Christian communion of which I am aware that proclaims clearly the most important teaching of the Founder of Christianity in this regard—a teaching which the churches repudiating by the State of his and while they deprecate Sunday laws as religious doctrine held by other sects imposed upon their members by the State, like character from any State, I say this much to show to the community that from a Seventh-day Adventist standpoint I cannot understand why they do not with the State and thereby destroy its Christian mission. I state the position, because of a distinct and deliberate faith in a view declaring a State Christian doctrine, the members and adherents of that body to present also experience and has given me an interest in these cases broader than my professional and purely legal interest. These facts deepen the more I know and see of them.

HOW THE SUNDAY LAW STANDS IN THE UNION CODE OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND.

"It is a fact, strange as it may seem, that every Sunday law now on our books contains a more or less explicit inhibition on any part or performance of that conviction or any particular day—some of the most explicit belief over one another and say recognizing no distinction beyond custom, and that in spite of all this the early Sunday. Many statutes were all based upon the express ground that the observance of Sunday is a duty to God, to be enforced by the civil authorities in Maryland, and the repetition by the State of all these old statutes, some of which contain penalties, however, as they are of the exact same type as that by which the Inquisition produced its results upon those who only after a number of years and are repeated, however differently, and there is from this untenable position, out of late they have replaced it with to works in the holiday theory of these laws, casting aside as far as possible the religious positions, however, is, if anything, more untenable than the others. It involves the position that no criminal statute could be enforced by a penalty would enforce recognition of play or a penalty of conduct. More than that, a holiday theory applies quite as well as work, as well as play. It says to the citizen in the Sunday law, 'you shall not work at your daily occupation, on Sunday, and to encourage you to rest I will fine you if you attempt to follow your regular occupation, and fine you if you
