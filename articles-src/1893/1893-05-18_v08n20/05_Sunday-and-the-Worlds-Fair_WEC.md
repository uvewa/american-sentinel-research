MR. EDITOR:—I have read with no little interest what you have had to say in a late issue of the Times regarding the closing of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday. Personally, whether the Fair is closed on Sunday or not, I care not a fig, but in the matter as it now stands there is involved a principle that is far-reaching in its consequences.

Let us look at it a moment. The closing of the gates on Sunday is in the interests of religion, and the question is a religious one pure and simple. Those behind the movement are with hardly an exception ardent religionists,—men who feel that the only safety there is for this Nation is in its acknowledging Christ as its ruler. But the closing of the gates on Sunday is practically settled, and that by the Congress of the United States, when it attached to the $2,500,000 appropriation the Sunday-closing proviso. Here we have the Government assuming to legislate upon a purely religious question,—a thing it has no business to do, for as you truthfully say, "our State is absolute secularization." This was the idea of its founders, for the very first amendment to the Constitution declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," and in the second article of the famous treaty with Tripoli, the statement is made, "The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion."

This shows the act of Congress to be unconstitutional, and when the question was before the legislature for discussion, many of the most learned members of both houses took this very view of it, and would have voted against it, but for the flood of petitions and protests and threats of boycott that came from the religionistical guardians of Sunday sacreedness, "Christian lobbyists" as they are called, and finally yielded, explaining their action on the ground that "it would be unwise statesmanship to do otherwise." Then later when the people awoke to what had been done, and realized how shamefully their real desires had been perverted there came a demand for a hearing on the question of the unconstitutionality of the action, and such a hearing was arranged for, and Chicago's mayor together with many prominent people went to Washington for this purpose, but when they arrived there it was found that from some unknown cause the chairman of that committee had undergone a change of sentiment, and so far as lay in his power shut out every argument on the unconstitutionality of the action. These facts are familiar to all.

They are, as stated. Congress had committed itself to an unconstitutional act, and the manly, righteous thing to have done would have been to repeal the whole thing, but that was not done.

Now the point, if Congress can legislate on one religious question, it can legislate on another and so in this Sunday-closing proviso we have the bars let down and the gate wide open for the entrance of legislation on every religious question that the Church may demand. All the Church has to do now is to ask for it, for their leaders have declared through their representative, "I have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands." By public resolution only a week or so since the Evangelical Alliance composed mainly of those behind this Sunday-closing movement, at St. Louis declared in a resolution that "Our next fight will be to stop Sunday mails. We will go before Congress on that issue."

So, Mr. Editor, we have in this matter the germ—and it is alive too—of that which hung witches, and hung Quakers, that whipped the Baptists,—in short, reddened the pages of all history with the blood of martyrs to religious principle. "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's," and again, "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not." The matter of Sabbath keeping is a duty that man owes to his Creator, and if Christ the author of the Sabbath does not interpose to force a man to keep the day, why should any set of men undertake to do it by civil law? Those who are now moving heaven and earth, as it were, to keep the gates closed in the name of Christianity, and as an "advertisement of the American Sabbath," should know that there is not a particle of Christianity in it.—W. E. Cornell, in Madison (Wis.) Times.
