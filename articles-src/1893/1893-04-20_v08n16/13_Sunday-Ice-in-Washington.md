The question of the possibility of Sunday deprivation of ice in Washington, raised by the Sunday-ice bill, which passed the House during the first session of the last Congress, but which failed to be reported to the Senate, will not down. The matter comes up in another form. The fact that it can be so raised shows how unnecessary was the legislation that was asked for. The Washington Post says editorially:—

> It is understood that the Medical Society of the District proposes to take some action relative to the non-delivery of ice on Sunday or to sound public sentiment on the question. It is a movement in which the society ought to be heartily sustained. It will no doubt be found that a large majority of the citizens of Washington agree with the gentlemen of the medical profession that on sanitary grounds if no other the ice supply should be regular and continuous for every day in the week.
>
> The announcement of the ice combine that there will be no Sunday delivery to retail consumers during June, July, August and September, the hottest and unhealthiest months of the year, must not be submitted to without at least a protest from the people out of whom the ice companies make big money.
>
> To say that this policy is adopted out of consideration for the feelings of the "poor drivers" is but a pretense. Drivers enough can be found to perform the Sunday service and be glad of the chance. Let the ice combine offer them a little extra compensation and see how many of the boys will jump at it.
>
> The "poor people" have some rights in this matter as well as the "poor drivers" and the poor ice dealers. It will be a much greater hardship for the people to do without ice on Sunday than it will be for the companies to deliver it.
>
> To be brief and plain, it will be an outrage on thousands of citizens to be subjected to this deprivation or be compelled to store a double stock from Saturday to Sunday, for which so many people are not provided with the proper conveniences, or, worst of all, in cases of sickness or other urgent contingency, be required to make an early morning pilgrimage of several miles to the wharves for their supply, as the combine condescendingly suggests they may do.
>
> The combine is all wrong in this matter, and in some way or other it ought to be forced to a proper recognition of public opinion and the public needs.
>
> There are certain things essential to human health and happiness, the enjoyment of which should be as free on one day as another. Instead of circumscribing the enjoyment of these blessings on Sunday the law should see to it that no undue restrictions are authorized or permitted.

Why is not this a legitimate conclusion from the bill for the prohibition of Sunday delivering of ice, or the sale and delivery of any commodity on Sunday. If under these bills prohibition is proper then under opposite conditions enforced sale and delivery is proper. If the reasoning is right in the one case it is in the other, and the municipality has a right to make it a condition precedent to granting articles of incorporation to an ice company that it will deliver ice on Sunday.
