Now that the whole machinery of the Government, in its legislative, judicial, and executive departments, is in the hands of a religious hierarchy, we may expect to hear them speak. And why not? Having learned that they hold the Government in their hands and that they can secure just such legislation as they desire—and there is no end to their desires—why should they not speak? Mr. J. M. Foster, a National Reformer of long standing, in speaking of their success in regard to the World's Fair, said:—

> But one danger lies in this. The Church does not speak as a church. . . . The denominations have spoken. But the voice of God authoritative, official, is through his Church. . . . They should, it would appear, appoint a joint committee to speak for God, and properly and courageously done, with a plain recital of judgments which will follow upon refusing to hear, there can follow but the best results. Much is lost by the Church failing officially to speak at the right time and in the right place. She can and ought to utter the voice of God in the halls of Congress and as an organized church.

Did the Papacy ever put forth any more audacious claims? Was presumption ever more presumptuous? As though God could not speak for himself! In the name of the rights of the people, we demand their credentials. This is but exalting man above God? And the next thing will be to recognize the American—no—the un-American pope! But all this was by anticipation. They say, "We have spoken." How and when? In their demands to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. And they say, "We shall be heard from much oftener in the future." Now, what did we hear last winter? At the congressional hearing which was appointed to hear arguments again upon this question, the unconstitutionality of the act was not denied. But the committee was, by this religio-political combine, reined up before death and the judgment, and threatened with the wrath and the judgments of God if they did not do so and so. And they did meekly bow and refuse to hear any more arguments from those who would oppose this and all other religious measures upon constitutional grounds. We have a work published seven years ago which says: "To secure public patronage, legislators will yield to the demands for a Sunday law." Are not these words true to-day? Then where is the Constitution? Do we have any? Its principles are subverted and overridden in the name of religion. We protest against the whole thing. And let the people all protest. It is their right. Say, more, if the Government is to be preserved, it is their solemn duty to protest. Then protest.
