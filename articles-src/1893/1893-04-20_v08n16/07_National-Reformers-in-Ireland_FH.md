IT may be of interest to the readers of the SENTINEL to know that the peculiar mania of religious intolerance is not confined to the United States. We have just had in this city of Belfast the annual meeting of the so-called Lord's Day Observance Society, and many things were said clearly showing the trend of religious thought. Here the National Reformer appears in his true character and comes out plainly, being in blissful ignorance of any such thing as the "civil Sabbath." Archdeacon Seaver in addressing the meeting said that their object was not a humanitarian but a religious one. Their desire was to enforce the observance of God's day. It was a holy day and should be kept holy, and the only way to do that was to go to God's holy house. From this plain statement it seems that the ultimate object of these "reformers" is to compel men to go to church on Sunday and to worship God. This, of course, would mean the establishment of a religious despotism as great as Rome or the Puritans ever had.

The archdeacon then went on to state that their work was also in the interests of what he termed "the poor workingman." If it was, the "poor workingman" did not appreciate it in the least, for not a single workingman was present although the meeting was well advertised and held at noon. One man only had somewhat the appearance of a mechanic, and when the vote was put he bellowed forth a "No" that would have done justice to stage thunder. The majority were clergymen, sleek, fat, well dressed and high-toned preachers, and everything said showed that the whole movement was in the interests of "clericalism" and nothing else. The insincerity of this plea was further shown by the strong expressions used to denounce the pleasure parties, excursions, dinner parties, etc., of the working classes. One reverend gentleman depicted his holy horror at seeing children at the seaside actually enjoying themselves with their buckets and spades on Sunday. Another spoke of "the dreadful continental Sunday" which in Switzerland had become to be known as the "workingman's festival." So that really the interest that these men have in the "poor workingman," is not so much to stop their work as it is to stop their play and get them to come to church. And the archdeacon stated that "by gradual watching and teaching they should be able to keep *their* population within bounds in this particular." All seemed to take it for granted that the entire population was the rightful property of the clergy.

Rev. Dr. Kane, grand master of the orangemen, said he believed in applying a "thorough boycott" to anything that tended to violate this day. This was received with great applause, for considering the vast political influence of Dr. Kane it meant something.

Frequent and bitter allusions were made to the way the Roman Catholics abused the "Lord's day." One preacher said that in Galway he had seen them working in the fields after mass, which sight he said "was very *injurious* to the Protestants." Consequently they must have a law to stop it. When it is remembered that two-thirds of the Irish are Catholic, surely it is the height of bigotry that a small minority should want to run the whole country.

The secretary stated that they had appointed a standing committee to insist on the closing of small shops. This committee had applied to the police, but as the police would not do anything, they were now going to take the matter in their own hands and "resuscitate an old Act of Parliament" and prosecute under that. Some one suggested trying moral suasion first. Whereupon the secretary said they had tried moral suasion and it was a failure, the law was the only thing.

In conclusion the chairman stated his sorrow on hearing that "a proposal had been made to have the Chicago Exhibition open on the Lord's day from 12 o'clock, but 'he hoped' that would not be carried out. If such a thing were done it would mean an English-speaking people going back on the history and traditions of the mother-country in the matter of opening exhibitions on Sunday." (Applause.)

The rest of the time was taken up with mutual admiration, compliments and reciprocal votes of thanks, the reverend gentlemen then dispersed feeling highly satisfied with each other in general and themselves in particular.

FRANCIS HOPE.
