The Chicago Herald under the head "First Blow at Chicago," has this to say editorially:—

> The short-sighted fanatics who shut the Chicago Fair on labor by inducing Congress to order that the gates be closed on Sundays have struck the first material blow the country has witnessed on "the sanctity of the Sabbath." They are to be hoist with their own petard. The rest of Sunday is to be broken in the most radical and sweeping manner if the work of the fanatics remain the order of the directory of the Exposition.
>
> As already stated in the Herald, organized labor has resolved to work Sunday and to see the Fair one of the days the fanatics allow it to be open. Many employers have already agreed to shut down Monday and let their men go to the Fair the second day of the week, on condition that they work the first day, so that contract orders shall be finished on time. The Central Labor Union prefers Saturday as the rest day, but is equally ready to work Sunday in order that the men and their families shall have a day at the Fair. It is absolutely certain that Sunday work in Chicago during the summer is going to become a fact if the decree of fanaticism abutting labor from the Fair, its present day of rest and recreation, be held binding by the directors.
>
> The new board of directors must settle this question. On that board rests a grave responsibility. Is Sunday work to be witnessed in the factories and foundries, the carpenter shops, the tan yards, the lumber yards the machinery works, the ship yards, the coal yards, the mills of this city? It will be indeed a humiliating and shocking spectacle. Which will honor Sunday more—these places now silent, Sunday resounding with the roar of labor, the Sabbath heavens darkened by their smoking chinners, the children of the city taught an incredible lesson of broken rest and disturbed Sunday quiet—or the noble sight of these tens of thousands of wage earners in Jackson Park Sunday with wives and children, educating themselves in all that tends to elevate to refine and to make better? Chicago is now face to face with the first real blow at Sunday rest. Will the directors of the Fair rise to their duty and throw away the insolent and selfish command that, by reason of the broken pledge of Congress, no longer binds them in law or in morale? Can they conscientiously consent that Sunday in Chicago shall become a day of labor?

This is indeed a Nemesis. It is a new problem for the Sunday-closing advocates to solve; this, of course, they will not attempt to do. It is too knotty a problem for them to untie, they will cut the Gordian knot with the sword of the law. The Law and Order League will immediately discover the mission to which it has been called. The gospel of coercion as preached by the league, prompted and supported by the American Sabbath Union, the Church, and the clergy, will make a marvelous object lesson at the Parliament of Religions, of the "Brotherhood of Man."
