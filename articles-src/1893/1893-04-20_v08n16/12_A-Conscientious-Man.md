WE meet all sorts of people and ideas, and people without ideas. Below is an extract from one of our subscribers:—

I had not thought of stopping my paper till you began to publish the advertisements for the Sunday *Sun.* As it is, please stop it, as I am on principle opposed to all forms of Sabbath desecration, especially as your paper goes into the hands of many who might be led to take a Sunday newspaper.

The above is his say. Now, please hear our side. 1. We fail to see any more harm in the name, Sunday *Sun,* than in that of the extensively read *Sabbath Reading,* and several other Christian publications of similar names.

2. If our esteemed critic will take the trouble to inform himself, he will find that nearly every Sunday newspaper is worked on by a separate force of help, by compositors and pressmen all through the week, just as if the paper itself were a weekly. The entire management and work, even to the subscription list, is kept precisely as a weekly, and it is dated on Sunday so as to give a paper bearing date for each day in the year. A calendar bears date of every Sunday; will our exacting brother soon refuse to hang one over his desk for fear of "desecrating" the first day of the week?

3. If he would be so precise, we will inform him that his Monday morning paper is the one for him not to buy. Nearly all the work of a Monday morning paper is done on Sunday. Yet if we should publish the advertisement of any daily, our esteemed friend would innocently drink it in without complaint.

4. By the way, he is a minister. Does he not do considerable work himself on Sunday? Does he approve of paying the janitor for heating up his church on the first day of the week?

5. We hope the advertisement did bring subscribers for the paper. We want advertisers to get the worth of their money when they patronize us.

6. If this gentleman will take one of his denominational publications and show us a cleaner collection of "ads" than those we carry, we will be greatly obliged. We have not yet advertised a rum shop under the head of "Wine for Sacramental Purposes," and he probably knows this church papers has caused young men and church hypocrites to buy wine and other cursed drinks for her.

7. The "ad" which was so offensive, was not to run for three issues, and before the complaint it had been dropped.

8. But when he put down to solid facts, can he or any one to give any biblical authority that could be desecrated by anything done on Sunday, the first day of the week. Our Bible speaks of the Sabbath as being the day God has blessed and sanctified, and that is Saturday, the seventh day. If the Bible, then the Bible, does not contain all the law, we would like an account of it. Perhaps our reverend brother can inform us.—*Our Rest, Newfane, Vt.*
