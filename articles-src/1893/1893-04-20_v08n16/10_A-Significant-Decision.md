Perhaps the most important question that Archbishop Satolli has been called upon to decide since his establishment as a representative of the Pope, in America, is that which is known in the newspapers as the Westchester, Pa., school case.

The circumstances are these: It seems that some six years ago a Mr. Bowen, a Catholic, refused to send his son to a parochial school at the command of the priest, but persisted in keeping him in the public school. For this obstinacy he was excommunicated, and denied the sacrament. Things then rested until Satolli arrived, when the case was appealed to him, with the result that the decision of the priest was reversed, Satolli holding that Catholic children were not compelled to be educated in Catholic schools; and last Sunday for the first time in all these years, Mr Bowen entered his pew and partook of the sacrament, while his son remained in the public school.

This is significant. It establishes the fact that it is the idea of the Pope that there shall be more of a fraternizing spirit on the part of Catholics with American institutions than there has been in the past.

No sooner was this decision announced, than from all over the country went up a note of rejoicing, one paper stating that "now the great barrier that has stood in the way of a union of Catholics with our institutions is removed," and the New York Herald says editorially that—

> the wisdom of such a policy can be seen by every one who is not a rank partisan. It is broad, generous, and in its largest sense, strategic. It shows that Leo XIII understands the temper and the temperament of the American people. . . . and can not fail to bring about a very desirable harmony of action.

Exactly; and the very effect designed by this "strategic" act has been secured; viz., the allaying of the fears of those who have regarded with suspicion the encroachments of Rome. But this broad and generous policy is just what will throw, and already has thrown, the people off their guard, and caused them to fail to note the insidious advances of this foe.

Right at this time, when the Supreme Court of our land has decided that this is a "Christian Nation," that it is constitutional to legislate on religion, as witness the Sunday-closing proviso of the World's Fair, and has utterly ignored the consideration of the constitutionality of these unconstitutional acts,—how fitting it is that Rome should immediately show her hidden hand, and seek to "bring about a very desirable harmony of action," by establishing, as she has, a second pope at our national capital, founding the greatest university of the denomination at this point, and ingratiating herself into the good feelings of the legislators, which means that before they know it they will be powerless to withstand her demands. Indeed, now the startling statement is made that those who would, "are powerless to stay the incoming tide."

How easily can come in along these lines a fulfillment of the words that have come to us with such significance: "Protestantism is now reaching hands across the gulf to clasp hands with the Papacy."

Where is the student of prophecy who is watching the unfolding of these events who can not see in them that which is most thrilling? How it should stir the very soul of every one who knows them, to the greatest activity.
