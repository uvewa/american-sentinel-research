# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, April 20, 1893 (v08n16)

## Article 04: "The Dormant Seed Is Sprouting"

- **Location:** Bill text, Section 1
- **Issue:** OCR produced "Georgetown Absoloness" — likely an OCR error for an institution name ("Georgetown Almshouse" or "Georgetown Absolutes" or similar). Context is a list of DC charitable institutions.
- **Transcribed as:** "Georgetown Absoloness" (preserved as OCR rendered it)
- **Confidence:** LOW — original institution name unclear from OCR

- **Location:** Bill text, Section 5
- **Issue:** OCR produced "universal staff" — likely "custodial staff" or similar. The sentence structure suggests an instruction to officers to cooperate.
- **Transcribed as:** "universal staff" (preserved as OCR rendered it)
- **Confidence:** LOW — original wording unclear from OCR

## Article 10: "A Significant Decision"

- **Location:** Attribution
- **Issue:** The article ends with "—W. E. C. in Review and Herald." This is W. E. Cornell (WEC), one of the American Sentinel's own associate editors. It is thus treated as a reprint from the Review and Herald, attributed to W. E. C. therein, rather than as an explicit authorship in this issue.
- **Decision:** Classified as `reprint` with `original_publication: "Review and Herald"`
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the attribution pattern matches a reprint, but Cornell is a known Sentinel contributor

## Article 15: "Editorial Notes Page 8" — Signs of the Times paragraph

- **Location:** End of article, final Signs of the Times excerpt
- **Issue:** OCR completely failed on the remainder of the Signs of the Times paragraph after the second "Resolved" clause. The original contained additional resolutions and commentary, but the OCR produced meaningless repeated text ("long, broad, long, long, long..."). The content was truncated in transcription.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the OCR source file confirms total corruption of this passage
- **Transcribed as:** Two "Resolved" clauses preserved; remainder omitted (corruption too severe)
- **Confidence:** LOW — original text after the second resolution is entirely unrecoverable from this OCR source
- **Note:** The original PDF scan should be consulted to recover the complete Signs of the Times quotation and any concluding editorial comment.

## Article 12: "A 'Conscientious' Man"

- **Location:** Item numbering
- **Issue:** The original article jumps from item "7" to item "9" — item 8 is missing. This appears to be in the original (not an OCR error), as it is consistent across the OCR rendering.
- **Decision:** Preserved as printed (no item 8)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — likely an original typesetting error or the author simply omitted item 8

## Masthead

- **Location:** Editor/Associate Editor lines
- **Issue:** The OCR rendered the editor and associate editor lines as dot-leader rows only ("EDITOR. • • • •...") without capturing the names. Names have been supplied from known publication data (ATJ as editor, CPB and WHM as associate editors for 1893).
- **Confidence:** HIGH — consistent with all other 1893 issues
