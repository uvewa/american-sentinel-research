# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, April 20, 1893 (Vol. 8, No. 16)

## General Notes
- This issue was transcribed from B&W 300 DPI scans. Text was generally legible but some passages in the gutter (column edges) were partially cut off or difficult to read.

## Article 01: Editorial Notes
- **Page 1, left column, paragraph 1**: "FOREIGN advices" — first word could be "FOREIGN" or "FONTIUS" but "FOREIGN advices" makes grammatical sense in context (foreign news reports).
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Transcribed as:** "FOREIGN advices"
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — letterforms are consistent with "FOREIGN" and context supports it

## Article 02: Civil Grounds of Religious Intolerance
- **Page 2, left column**: The quotation from Adams about Wheelwright's sentence is long and complex. Several phrases in the middle of this passage were at the edge of the column and partially obscured.
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — assembled from clear portions; some connecting phrases may have minor word-level errors
  - **Specific concern:** "from the lax religious and moral tone which had gone over" appears to be repeated. This may be a typesetting error in the original or a misread.

## Article 03: A New Problem
- **Page 2, right column**: The quoted text from the Chicago Herald editorial was partially at the edge of the column on the left side, making some words in the middle of the quotation difficult to read precisely.
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — general sense is clear but some specific words in the Herald quotation may have minor errors

## Article 05: The Doctors Dislike Their Own Medicine
- **Page 3, left column, lower portion**: The article's text near the bottom becomes less clear as it approaches the gutter. Several phrases about the boycott and political consequences were partially obscured.
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM — the last several paragraphs about cross-firing, political machines, and drifting were difficult to read precisely

## Article 06: In Gear
- **Page 3, right column**: The opening quote from L. A. Maynard and the surrounding commentary involved text at column edges that was partially cut off on the left side.
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the general argument is clear but specific phrases in the first paragraph may have minor errors due to column edge issues

## Article 09: They Have Spoken
- **Page 4, right column**: The quote from J. M. Foster about the Church speaking is partially obscured. The ellipses in the middle of the quoted passage were in the original.
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — some phrases in the Foster quotation may have minor errors

## Article 11: An Open Letter
- **Page 5, right column**: This very long article contains extensive historical and theological argument. Some passages about the Reformation, Roger Williams, and constitutional history were at column edges.
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — overall argument is faithfully reproduced but some connecting phrases may have minor word-level errors

## Article 12: A "Conscientious" Man
- **Page 6, left column, items 6-8**: Some of the numbered response items were partially obscured.
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — responses 6-8 may have minor errors in wording

## Article 13: Sunday Ice in Washington
- **Page 6, right column**: The beginning of this article and the transition from the previous text was somewhat unclear in terms of where the article starts.
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the article beginning and quoted material from the Post is assembled from partially visible text

## Article 15: Editorial Notes (page 8)
- **Page 8, left and right columns**: Several short items contained text at column edges. The Methodist Conference item and the Reformed Church resolutions were partially obscured.
