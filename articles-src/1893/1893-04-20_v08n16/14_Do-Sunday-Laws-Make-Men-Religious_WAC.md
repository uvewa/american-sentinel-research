We now have a national Sunday law—the act of Congress closing the World's Fair on that day. This was secured by the Church managers through the influence, by petitions and threats, which they were able to bring to bear on Congress. One of the arguments used by the managers of this Sunday movement in compassing their object was that the great masses of laboring men were violating their consciences every week by working on Sunday at the dictation of their employers. How groundless is this claim, and how much respect for Sunday as a sacred day the average laborer in this country has, the following preamble and resolution recently passed by the Central Labor Union, and printed in the Chicago Times of April 4, 1893, under heading "Work Sunday and Play Saturday," quite well show:—

WHEREAS, The ministers of the gospel have insisted that the gates of the World's Fair be closed on Sunday, and

WHEREAS, The workingmen represented in this union can not afford to lose more than one day in the week for either rest or recreation, and

WHEREAS, In order to improve ourselves we are anxious to take advantage of the great educational facilities which will be offered at the Exposition; therefore be it.

Resolved, That we make a formal request upon our employers that we be allowed to begin work Sunday as the first day of the week, and take Saturday as a day of rest and recreation, in order to be able to visit the Fair grounds and obtain the instruction which will otherwise be denied us.

This is certainly a fitting comment on how much Sunday legislation influences men to regard Sunday as the Sabbath. In this instance it has resulted in a whole labor union requesting their employers to allow them to work on that day. The theory of compelling men to act religiously is repugnant to every sense of true religious feeling and manliness. God compels the conscience of no man. As Luther says, "Whosoever believeth let him draw nigh, and whoso believeth not stand afar off. Let there be no compulsion. Liberty is of the very essence of faith." The whole Sunday-law movement is simply an attempt to make men better by law, by the gospel of force. It is papal in principle through and through.
