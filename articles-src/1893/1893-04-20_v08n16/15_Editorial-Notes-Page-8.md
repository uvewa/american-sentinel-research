ISAAC BAKER, of Kent Island, Md., a Seventh-day Adventist, was arrested and fined five dollars, on April 12, for plowing on Sunday.

A CORRESPONDENT writes from Belfast, Ireland, "To-day I attended a meeting of the Lord's Day Observance Society. There were about thirty ministers present, and they were very enthusiastic in their proceedings. They had tried moral suasion and it had failed, now they would try the law." These associations for the enforcement of Sunday observance are possessed of the same spirit the world over. When concerted action is had the world will see such a general outburst of frenzied bigotry as has never previously been known in history.

A VERY significant paragraph from foreign news is this:—

Rome, April 4.—Pope Leo has just completed an examination of the question of the study of the Scriptures, having devoted inquiry especially to the diverse opinions of savants on great biblical questions. He will indict a letter to the bishops requesting them to enjoin upon their people a more profound study of the Scriptures. The Pope urges the necessity of keeping in the track of modern progress and discovery in order to adapt Catholicism to the needs of the day.

Is it as true as it has always been supposed that "Rome never changes"? If it is, what is the meaning of this new departure?

THE Duluth Evening Herald, of April 6, contains several accounts of arrests of merchants in Duluth, Wis., for listening to the pleadings of a "Sunday sleuth," in other words an American Sabbath Union detective, who had an insatiable desire to buy blue neck-ties on Sunday. It might be a question for the moralists worthy of discussion as to who committed the greater sin, or the most heinous crime—the man who bought many neck-ties on Sunday or the man who sold one. Does the end justify the means? Has the Sabbath Union so far returned to Roman Catholicism as to accept that doctrine? Should not the judge in these cases fine both parties equally,—both the buyer and the seller?

AT THE METHODIST CONFERENCE AT DANBURY, Conn., April 10, the conference expressed the sentiment that an appeal should be sent to every religious organization in America to help carry out the movement for Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and advising that the Fair has boycotted if it opened on Sunday. The Methodist Conference, of the same date, at Holyoke, Mass., failed to show as intense a fervor on this subject. The Committee on Sunday Observance reported resolutions of congratulation upon Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and also offered a resolution that railroads should be requested to reduce Sunday traffic as much as possible. This was objected to on the ground that Methodists themselves set the example of Sunday traveling, and writing articles for Sunday newspapers. There was also some division of opinion as to the wickedness of Sunday trains. The resolution, however, was adopted. A suggestive item in the business of the conference was the mildness of the report of the committee on Romanism which in former years has been in the habit of stirring up a breeze. It seems either that discretion is felt to be the better part of valor or that the ties of kindred are beginning to be recognized.

THE Signs of the Times, of April 10, has this paragraph:—

The Reformed Church at Royersford, Pa.,—the great reform State, by the way,—finds it necessary to adopt the following resolutions as part of the by-laws of the Church:—

Resolved, That no member of this congregation is permitted to engage in the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquor as a beverage.

Resolved, That no member is permitted to aid, directly or indirectly, to obtain licenses to sell intoxicating liquors as a beverage.
