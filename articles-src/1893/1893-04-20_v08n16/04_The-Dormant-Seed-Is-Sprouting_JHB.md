The Washington Post publishes the following communication and appends the bill to which reference is made:—

> Editor Post: The Christian public will certainly sympathize with the heroic effort of Rev. Dr. Parson to awaken in the mind of the unfortunate man at the United States jail, during his last hours, some realization of his religious condition. This effort was brought about, according to report, because the victim was once a boy in Dr. Parson's Sabbath school; that is, the doctor thought on the basis of some slight acquaintance he might influence him for good. But is it not unfortunate that any such necessity exists; that there is no official connected with the jail, workhouse, or any other penal institution in this District, whose duty and privilege it is to become thoroughly acquainted with every inmate, and help every one to a better life; not by spending an hour in worship on Sunday afternoon, but every day in the week, coming in contact with them, and acquiring information? Is it not a strange fact that no well-regulated penal institution in the United States, except those here in the District of Columbia, is without a chaplain, whose business it is to do all that can be done to save men? Punishment is necessary, but not reformatory. Police, judges, jailors, etc., are all well enough in their places, but is the whole duty of the public to men, women, boys, and girls accomplished when they are detected in crime and punished?
>
> From 3,500 to 3,000 persons annually are poured out upon this city from these various institutions; and yet so far as the United States Government is concerned not a hand is raised to save to better manhood or to reform one of them. I do not say that police, judges, and keepers may not exert some moral power, give good advice, etc., but they do that as individuals, not as officials. Their duty is in the line of justice, not reformation.
>
> Nearly ten years ago there was introduced into both houses of Congress a bill for the establishment of a chaplain to these thousands of incarcerated persons, pronounced by those who introduced it "a first rate bill," but it slumbered to death in a committee who never would take the pains even to have a hearing on the subject.
>
> There is an opportunity for some philanthropist who has some faith in Congress and a belief that if such an office was created it would not be one more "plum" to some politician, to revive the long-neglected opportunity and to cultivate this wholly uncultivated field of usefulness.
>
> It is said the Government does not pay for religious work. The reply is, that in the ten years since that bill was introduced the United States has paid $10,000 for an average of less than one prayer a day, and that offered in the presence of few people who have any interest in it.

The following is the bill referred to, H. R. 5515, Forty-eighth Congress, first session:—

A BILL to establish a chaplaincy of the jail and institutions of charity and reform of the District of Columbia.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled:

That there be established a chaplaincy to the institutions of charity, reformation, and so forth, within the District of Columbia, be follows, under the United States Act, the Washington Asylum, the Reform School, the Georgetown Absoloness, and the Industrial House School.

Sec. 2. That the appointment be made by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, and be for the term of four years.

SEC. 3. That the compensation of said office be $2,000 per annum.

SEC. 4. That the chaplain shall have charge of the religious exercises of each and all of the above-named institutions, and shall hold services in each of them, from time to time, to be may arrange; shall invite volunteer effort from the clergy and laity of the District and elsewhere; shall attend the funeral services from these institutions, unless the same shall be otherwise provided for by friends; shall inquire into the history of the inmates, and shall extend to persons discharged from said institutions, and residing in the District of Columbia, such counsel and act as may be consistent with his other duties. He shall keep such records as shall enable him to report to the President, for the use of Congress, facts bearing upon the religious and moral condition of the inmates of these several institutions, and shall report annually in October.

SEC. 5. That the officers and those having control of the universal staff, who shall render such material and aid and information in their power to enable him to pursue his work. He shall have access to all reasonable hours to all inmates, and to records regarding them.

SEC. 6. That nothing in this act shall be construed to present any inmate from receiving religious instruction from the teacher of his choice.

These bills in reference to chaplaincies in the army, navy, etc., have been sown broadcast in every Congress, and it is now natural that in the early spring-time of State religion in this country some should begin to germinate. Of course it is logical and consistent with the existence of a State religion, promoted by Congress, that Congress should pass just such bills as this. It is a sad commentary, however, on the performance of duty by the ministers and professed Christian people of the District of Columbia that there should be any opportunity for the services of a prison chaplain.
