"WHAT we need most," says L. A. Maynard, managing editor of the *Christian at Work,* in an address delivered and reported in the *Christian Statesman* of March 4, "is to gear our Christianity on to the wheels of our political machines." And when they are thus geared they will be one and the same machine—working together for a certain purpose. That that is the design we quote Mr. Maynard's own words further: "As it is, we are trying to run the two separate machines simultaneously. We keep our religion for our homes and churches and let the devil and our politics." Here we see the motors of the two machines—put them in gear and Tammany Hall run as we would have. Now specify the operating machines specified. Put what a combination we would have! What kind of a machine would "the devil and Tammany Hall" run? Now that and what have we if they are in gear with one another—harmony with one another? Will turn the crank of a political machine? The politicians' garb, or the Churchman with the professed Christianity? Whichever way the result of this gearing produces both machines. It strips Christianity of its sacredness and thereof with the garments of earth. It covers, on the other hand, naked iniquity and hypocrisy with the robes of Christianity.

But professed Christianity seems to have run wild of late in its frantic efforts to get in gear with "our political machines" and Tammany Hall." Their efforts have been successful. They have geared "our Christianity on to the wheels of our political machines" both in the national and State governments. The Supreme Court of the United States put the machines in gear Feb. 29, 1892, when it declared this to be a "Christian Nation." And the churches turned the crank so effectually that they led the Congress of the United States off on an effort to compel the citizens of this "Christian Nation" and of other "Christian nations" to stay away from the World's Fair on the so-called "Christian Sabbath" by offering a $2,500,000 bribe to the World's Fair Commissioners to exhibit the "American Sabbath" by closing the gates on "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

But this is not the only thing that will result from this gearing. Just such a scheme has been tried before. The Church in the early centuries of this era put itself in gear with the political machines of that time, and the combination produced that which has been a curse to all ages since—the Papacy. This was, and is, a system in which the Church claims the right to use the arm of civil government to enforce her dogmas upon all. Like causes produce like results. This modern gearing produces an image of the Papacy. And again the world is to see the evil of this system of gearing. Again will the effort be made to coerce the consciences of men. The machines are in gear.

H. V. ADAMS.
