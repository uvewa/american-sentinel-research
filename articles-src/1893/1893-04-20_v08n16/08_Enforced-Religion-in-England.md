OVER two hundred summonses have been issued against Sunday traders in Birmingham. At last accounts thirty-five small tradesmen, chiefly tobacconists and sweet-sellers, had been fined a reduced penalty of one shilling, without costs. The prosecutions are carried on under the old Act of Charles II. The prosecutors are a "Watch Committee," whose self-appointed duty it is to spy out who are doing work on Sunday, which the law does not sanction, even though such watching of others obliges themselves to do that which would be a violation of the Sabbath if Sunday were the Sabbath.

The Birmingham Sunday agitation presents some of the absurdities of Sunday legislation. The tobacconists claim that the law does not sanction their closing operations on Sunday, and they contend that they have as good right to sell tobacco on Sunday as the publicans have to sell liquor, and here is where the beauty of Sunday legislation comes in. It seems that the law of Charles II. admits of their selling cigars during prescribed hours on Sunday, but not tobacco. They have a store, and if they are legally open, they may sell cigars, but not the latter as the former; and now the Watch Committee proposes to test at what legal point can be established, so that tobacconists will be prosecuted for selling cigars on Sunday. The non-smoker may have some difficulty in seeing the justice of prosecuting a man for selling cigars, when he may sell beer unmolested, but there seems is the necessary discrimination to establish justice and vindicate the sacredness of the sun.

In the House of Lords, Thursday, the Bishop of Salisbury introduced a bill "to provide for better freedom for religious instruction in Board Schools." He said that there are ninety-one Boards which allow no religious instruction whatever; a few allow the Bible to be read without note or comment, and some allow hymns without any Bible reading. What the bishop means by "freedom for religious instruction," the compulsory instruction doubtless.

If anybody can tell us the difference between this and compulsory attendance at church, we should be glad to learn. The children must of necessity attend school, and religious instruction in the schools is not merely optional, but compulsory. The only object of the church is to give religious instruction, and so the schools are really churches, in a way. Many people who would exclaim against compulsory church attendance on Sunday, see no inconsistency in demanding the same thing every other day of the week.—*The Present Truth, London, Eng.*
