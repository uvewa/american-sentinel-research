Over two hundred summonses have been issued against Sunday traders in Birmingham. At last accounts thirty-five small tradesmen, chiefly tobacconists and sweet-sellers, had been fined a reduced penalty of one shilling, without costs. The prosecutions are carried on under the old Act of Charles II. The prosecutors are a "Watch Committee," whose self-appointed duty it is to spy out who are doing work on Sunday, which the law does not sanction, even though such watching of others obliges themselves to do that which would be a violation of the Sabbath if Sunday were the Sabbath.

The Birmingham Sunday agitation presents some of the absurdities of Sunday legislation. The tobacconists admit that the law does not sanction their trading operations on Sunday, but they claim that they have as good right to sell tobacco on Sunday as the publicans have. And here is where the beauty of the law comes in. It seems that the publicans' license admits of their selling only liquor in the prescribed hours on Sunday, and not tobacco. They have assumed that, being legally open, they might as well sell the latter as the former; but the Watch Committee proposes to test the matter. If the point can be established, then the publicans will be prosecuted for selling cigars on Sunday. The non-legal mind may have some difficulty in seeing the fine point of prosecuting a man for selling cigars, while he may sell beer unmolested, but such it seems is the necessary thing in order to establish justice and morality, and vindicate the sacredness of "the venerable day of the sun."

In the House of Lords, Thursday, the 16th, the Bishop of Salisbury introduced a bill "to provide for better freedom for religious instruction in Board Schools." He said that there are ninety-one Boards which allow no religious instruction whatever; a few allow the Bible to be read without note or comment, and some allow hymns without any Bible reading. What the bishop means by "freedom for religious instruction," therefore, is doubtless compulsory instruction.

If anybody can tell us the difference between this and compulsory attendance at church, we should be glad to learn. The children must of necessity attend school, and religious instruction in the schools is to be not merely optional, but compulsory. But the only object of the church is to give religious instruction, and so the schools are really churches, in a way. Many people who would exclaim against compulsory church attendance on Sunday, see no inconsistency in the same thing every other day of the week.
