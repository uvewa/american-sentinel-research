FOREIGN advices gravely tell us that the Pope has lately completed an examination of the Scriptures. It seems that he has in his old age taken to the study of the Bible, and more than that, he has written a letter to his bishops urging them also to devote more time to scriptural study. But it may be a matter of doubt whether he has yet advocated an open Bible for the laity.

WHILE this subtle suggestion of unity and fellowship proceeds from the Vatican the encroachments of Rome on the schools, the family, the Church and the State increase everywhere. In this country secret and oath-bound organizations avowedly inimical to Rome multiply continually. On the other hand, and seemingly almost in response to this, Roman Catholic societies organise and drill, and weird rumors are bandied about of coffins full of arms and munitions of war detected in transit, consigned to Roman Catholic cathedrals.

THE forty-fifth anniversary of the inception of modern spiritualism has just passed. It was celebrated by manifestations which are declared to have surpassed previous demonstrations. But principally it has been marked by the promises that have been made that within five years open exhibitions of supernatural power would be made in the light of day and in public assemblies such as will convince every witness of their reality beyond a doubt.

THE dread tornado hurled by the "prince of the power of the air" across the country through village and farm, is doing its devastating work. The earth shivers, as in fear, where such tremors are new and unaccustomed. The pestilence gathers its forces at the home of its birth awaiting its appointed hour to come forth. While crying "Peace! Peace!" the nations are building navies and equipping armies, and European coffers are filling themselves with American gold; and all this is for what purpose? What does it portend? Or does it mean nothing? The word of the Lord by his holy prophets has been fulfilled in the past. God's plans for this world are not yet complete. If they are not yet completed they must be in the course of fulfillment. If that be so what is the portion of the prophetic word applicable to this time? If these events now passing are in the line of prophecy, as they must be, then what comes next in the necessary sequence?
