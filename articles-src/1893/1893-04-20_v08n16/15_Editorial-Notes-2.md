ISAAC BAKER, of Kent Island, Md., a Seventh-day Adventist, was arrested and fined five dollars, on April 12, for plowing on Sunday.

A CORRESPONDENT writes from Belfast, Ireland, "To-day I attended a meeting of the Lord's Day Observance Society. There were about thirty ministers present, and they were very enthusiastic in their proceedings. They had tried moral suasion and it had failed, now they would try the law." These associations for the enforcement of Sunday observance are possessed of the same spirit the world over. When concerted action is had the world will see such a general outburst of frenzied bigotry as has never previously been known in history.

A VERY significant paragraph from foreign news is this:—

Rome, April 4—Pope Leo has just completed an examination of the question of the study of the Scriptures, having devoted inquiry especially to the diverse opinions of savants on great biblical questions. He will indite a letter to the bishops requesting them to enjoin upon their people a more profound study of the Scriptures. The Pope urges the necessity of keeping in the track of modern progress and discovery in order to adapt Catholicism to the needs of the day.

Is it as true as it has always been supposed that "Rome never changes"? If it is, what is the meaning of this new departure?

THE *Duluth Evening Herald,* of April 6, contains several accounts of arrests of merchants in Duluth, Wis., for listening to the pleadings of a "Sunday sleuth," in other words an American Sabbath Union detective, who had an insatiable desire to buy blue neck-ties on Sunday. It might be a question for the moralists worthy of discussion as to who committed the greater sin, or the most heinous crime—the man who bought many neckties on Sunday or the man who sold one. Does the end justify the means? Has the Sabbath Union so far returned to Roman Catholicism as to accept that doctrine? Should not the judge in these cases fine both parties equally,—both the buyer and the seller?

AT the Methodist Conference at Danbury, Conn., April 10, the conference expressed the sentiment that an appeal should be sent to every religious organization in America to help carry out the movement for Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and advising that the Fair be boycotted if it opened on Sunday. The Methodist Conference, of the same date, at Holyoke, Mass., failed to show as intense a fervor on this subject. The Committee on Sunday Observance reported resolutions of congratulation upon Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and also that railroads should reduce Sunday traffic as much as possible. This was objected to by the Methodists themselves on the ground that Methodist Sunday traveling, and the reading of Sunday newspapers, caused a division of opinion on the use of Sunday trains. The resolution, however, was adopted. The mildness of the report was attributed to the business of the Romanism which in it seems either that the better part of those of kindred are bemazed.

THE *Signs of the Times* has this paragraph:—

The Reformed Church of Royersford, Pa.,—the great reform State, by the way,—finds it necessary to adopt the following resolutions as part of the by-laws of the Church:—

*Resolved,* That no member of this congregation is permitted to engage in the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquor as a beverage.

*Resolved,* That no member is permitted to aid, directly or indirectly, to obtain licenses to sell intoxicating liquors as a beverage.

*Resolved,* That no member is permitted to aid, directly or indirectly, in making laws to aid the liquor traffic as a beverage.

A "reformed church" that needs such by-laws to keep its members from doing such things is a fitting factor in a great Sunday-law State. "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his," and all the church resolutions and State enactments within the power of man can not make him so.

This is the state of mind and heart which may be expected to be found among those who look to God for the precepts by which to regulate their lives.

EASTER Sunday, in Chicago, was a bright and beautiful day; the warmth and spring sunshine conspired with the churchly festivity of the day to make it an enjoyable holiday. It was so utilized by many thousands more in Chicago than elsewhere. The Chicago *Times* says:—

Every line of transportation from all parts of the city to and from the World's Fair site was crowded with persons who paid their money and entered Jackson Park, and no outrage was thereby done to any one. No police supervision was necessary. Everybody who went for this outing of a Sunday afternoon went with a purpose of education and recreation. Jackson Park was crowded, yet the grounds are unfinished, the Fair is far from completion. No protest is made because of this use of Sunday at this time. No harm is done to any one because Sunday is thus employed. If one did not care to go to Jackson Park he was understood to have absented himself. If his fancy directed his steps thither there was no one to say him nay.

But the first Sunday in May is to see the inception of a new dispensation, according to present expectation. Why should the gates be closed then any more than immediately before? Certainly not. The only purpose of this congressional Sunday-closing is to establish the religious domination of the civil polity, and the union of Church and State.

STATE SENATOR SALOMON, of Illinois, has presented a bill in the Illinois legislature of which the Chicago *Herald* speaks as follows:—

Senator Salomon's bill for protecting a weekly day of rest is as unnecessary as it is fantastic. It proposes that all people shall have a weekly day of rest, which, unfortunately, is impossible for all the people; and it insists that, whether the weekly day of rest be Sunday or some other day, it shall be duly protected from disturbance or intrusion, a provision full of contradictions and not susceptible of enforcement except by rational public opinion acting voluntarily. The bill requires that if any society attempt to interfere with this day of rest, secular, Sabbatarian or Sunday, the governor shall denounce such society by proclamation—a proceeding wholly uncalled for, as such societies are sufficiently posted as un-American by their own character.

Every attempt to legislate upon this question only shows more clearly and proves more fully, what every citizen ought to be able to see at the first glance, that this is a question upon which no affirmative legislation can be consistently had. All that can rightfully be done is to preserve peace and order on Sunday precisely as on all other days.

IN the April *Arena* the cause of the Chinaman is upheld in an interesting sketch by Allan Forman on "Celestial Gotham," and the negro finds a strong champion in the editor, who discusses the recent Paris tragedy in a paper in which Mr. Flower seeks to be just to both white and black, while he points out the injustice and the evil consequence bound to follow lawlessness. Hamlin Garland has a brilliant paper on "The Future of Fiction in America." Dr. Alfred Russell Wallace, W. D. McCracken, Eva McDonald Valesh, Chester A. Reed and Victor Yarros discuss social and economic problems. Psychical Research is represented by B. F. Underwood, who writes on "Automatic Writing;" and Metaphysical Thought finds an able exponent in Katharine Coolidge. There are many other papers of interest in this issue.
