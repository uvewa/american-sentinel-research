The would be religio-political doctors of the Nation's "moral cancer" have of late had a little taste of their own medicine, and their apparent discomfiture calls vividly to mind the wry faces and protestations incident to our grandmother's boneset tea.

Let us see. What they have clamored for as a remedy for the "existing evil" is governmental recognition of God—practically of their religion. Well, they have it. The highest authority in the land has decided in so many words that this is a "Christian Nation," which is equivalent to saying that the Christian religion is the true religion, and that all others are spurious, all of which we believe to be true, but which no civil government has any business to say. Then to show its authority, at the behest of the Church, it has officially recognized a religious rest-day, which in turn is equivalent to saying that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that no other day is, which is false, for Sunday, the first day of the week, is not the Bible Sabbath, and Saturday, the seventh day, is.

But in our land there are two bodies of religionists claiming to be Christian, yet whose fundamental principles are diametrically opposed to each other, we mean Protestants and Catholics. Nevertheless, these both claim to be Christians, and as this is now a "Christian Nation," it must of course recognize all Christians, and so it did at the late dedicatory services of the World's Fair. But in this recognition it so happened that the "uppermost seats" were accorded to the Catholics, and now the buried "hatchet" is resurrected, and the "battle of the creeds" begins. Ministers in various parts of the country, particularly those who have been the most urgent in their demands for governmental recognition of religion, have loudly protested against this encroachment of the Catholics, and publicly passed resolutions of boycott of the exercises if the Catholics were allowed such prominent places. And by the way, this boycott plan seems to be a favorite one with the ministers nowadays, and its influence is felt and seen even in the halls of our national Congress.

A bitter enmity is thus evidently being engendered, and if we are to judge from the spirit of the "cross-firing" that is carried on even in the secular papers, particularly of Chicago, the seat of war, we know that it is intense. With this feeling there can never be harmony, and the very next thing that must be done, and which, in the logical order of events and in perfect keeping with the decision of the Supreme Court, is bound to come, is an official decision as to which one of these two divisions of Christianity is the true one. And this is just as sure and certain to come, as that Constantine when in the fourth century he adopted Christianity as the religion of the empire, was afterward compelled to decide which of the contending factions was the "legitimate and most holy Roman Catholic Church."

And we are fast hastening to that eventful day. Public sentiment is ripening for just this very action. Congressmen now consider it "wise statesmanship" to listen to the voice of the Church, and even vote contrary to their convictions, knowing full well to do otherwise means political death. The Church, on the other hand, is boasting that "we can have just what we ask for," and it looks as though they could.

Whither are we drifting? The answer is found in the 13th and 14th chapters of Revelation. Every one who reads and understands these can know if he will; and every one can likewise know and understand for himself what is his individual duty for this time.

W. E. CORNELL.
