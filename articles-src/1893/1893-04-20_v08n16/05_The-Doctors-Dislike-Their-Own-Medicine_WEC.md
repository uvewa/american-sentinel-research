THE would be religio-political doctors of the Nation's "moral cancer" have of late had a little taste of their own medicine, and their apparent discomfiture calls vividly to mind the wry faces and protestations incident to our grandmother's boneset tea.

Let us see. What they have clamored for as a remedy for the "existing evil" is a governmental recognition of God—practically of *their* religion. Well, they have it. The highest authority in the land has decided in so many words that this is a "Christian Nation," which is equivalent to saying that the Christian religion is the true religion, and that all others are spurious, all of which we believe to be true, but which no civil government has any business to say. Then to show its authority, at the behest of the Church, it has officially recognized a religious rest-day, which in turn is equivalent to saying that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that no other day is, which is false, for Sunday, the first day of the week, is not the Bible Sabbath, and Saturday, the seventh day, is.

But in our land there are two bodies of religionists claiming to be Christian, yet whose fundamental principles are diametrically opposed to each other; we mean Protestants and Catholics. Nevertheless, these both claim to be Christians, and as this is now a "Christian Nation," it must of course recognize all Christians, and so it did at the late dedicatory services of the World's Fair. But in this recognition it so happened that the "uppermost seats" were accorded to the Catholics, and now the buried "hatchet" is resurrected, and the "battle of the creeds" begins. Ministers in various parts of the country, particularly those who have been the most urgent in their demands for governmental recognition of religion, have loudly protested against this encroachment of the Catholics, and publicly passed resolutions of boycott of the exercises if the Catholics were allowed such prominent places. And by the way, this boycott plan seems to be a favorite one with the ministers nowadays, and its influence is felt and seen even in the halls of our national Congress. This evidently being the order of events and thus we are to judge from the "cross-firing" that is carried on in the secular papers, particularly those close to the seat of war, we sense. With this feeling there must be harmony, and the conclusion is that it must be done, and with the decision of the order of events and with the decision of the bound to come, is an issue as to which one of these forms of Christianity is the true one, just as sure and certain as it was in the days of Constantine when in the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as the religion of the empire, was afterward decided which of the contending factions was the "legitimate and holy Roman Catholic Church."

And listening to that eventuality, sentiment is ripening for it. Congressmen now consider it "wise statesmanship" to listen to the voice of the Church, and even vote contrary to their convictions, knowing full well to do otherwise means political death. The Church, on the other hand, is boasting that "we can have just what we ask for," and it looks as though they could.

Whither are we drifting? The answer is found in the 13th and 14th chapters of Revelation. Every one who reads and understands these chapters, and every one can likewise know and understand for himself what is his individual duty for this time.
