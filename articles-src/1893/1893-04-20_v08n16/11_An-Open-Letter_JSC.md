[This open letter is to a clergyman who returned a copy of the pamphlet "The National Sunday Law" unread, because he was, as he said, situated like Nehemiah when he made the reply, "I am doing a great work so that I can not come down."

The supposition from the scriptural connection here is that some harm was supposed to be concealed in the pamphlet, for Nehemiah would not come down for the reason that he feared Sanballat and Goshem would do him harm. This is an unreasonable fear. There is truth in this pamphlet. "Prove all things, hold fast that which is good."]

Holyoke, Mass., April 7, 1893.

My Dear Friend: I was very glad indeed to receive your letter of a few days ago, and to get so full and frank an expression of your sentiments on the question of enforced Sabbath Observance; still, I must confess that I was very sorry to discover, from the tone of your letter, that you had not yet taken in the great principle of religious liberty which was first enunciated by our Saviour, and practiced by the Apostolic Church up to the time of the beginning of the great apostasty, when, as Paul predicted, there would "come a falling away," and the "man of sin" be revealed, etc., and he told how this would be accomplished. He told the Church that there would arise from among themselves men teaching perverse things to draw away disciples after them.

So long as the disciples of Jesus Christ walked in the simplicity of the gospel they were attended by the power of the Spirit of God to such an extent that, as the record shows, there were added to the Church daily of such as should be saved, and in one case, at least thousands were converted in a single day. But when believers began to exalt themselves, and strove to draw away disciples after themselves instead of after Christ, then the power of the Spirit left them, and then it was that they found it necessary to call in the aid of the civil law to enforce their interpretation of the word of God. And to just the extent that the civil authority was used to enforce the teachings of these leaders of the Church, to just that extent was the union of Church and State established; for the union of Church and State was never anything more than the enforcement of Church dogmas by the civil power; and it was only the logical outgrowth of this principle of enforced religion by the civil power that formed the Papal Church, and led to all its tyranny, and finally, to the Inquisition itself. Religious liberty was smothered and religious tyranny prevailed until this monstrous beast, which was nothing else than this iniquitous system carried out, had literally fulfilled the prophecy of Daniel 7:25, and had "worn out the saints of the Most High," but for the elect's sake those days were shortened. God raised up Martin Luther and inspired him with the Spirit of Christ, and caused him to stand forth as the exponent of the great truth, that in spite of public sentiment and in spite of the commonly accepted mode of religious observances, all men are of right, and ought to be, free to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences.

Religious liberty was the keynote of the Reformation, and the following out of that righteous principle laid the foundation for every advanced step ever taken in the Christian religion.

But man is as prone to error as sparks are to fly upward, and the devil is always ready with plausible arguments; he soon persuaded the Church leaders that they were the only repositories of the truth of God, and impressed upon them the Christian duty of compelling everybody—by law—to conform to their views. Another religious tyranny was set up, and our forefathers were driven to Holland, and from thence came to this country to escape persecution, and the anthem which they first struck up when their feet rested upon Plymouth Rock was one of praise for freedom to worship God. But even before the echoes of that heaven-born strain had died away in the wilderness they began to make and enforce religious laws. The result was a blot upon the early pages of our history, the horrid details of which are familiar to you.

The only man of those times who dared to stand for liberty of conscience in Massachusetts was Roger Williams, and he was banished for that grave offense. Wherever religious bigotry and tyranny prevailed, there this system of enforced religion prevailed, and wherever the spirit of enlightened Christianity prevailed, there religious freedom prevailed. But God had a part for this country to play in his great plan. You will find it all written out in Rev. 13:11-13; and so he led this people through just those experiences which were calculated to develop love of freedom and a spirit of independence. Liberty became their watchword and their theme. For the sake of civil liberty they endured all the hardships and perils of the Revolutionary War. This was the way in which God led and disciplined them that they might attain to some just idea of what true liberty was; and even then the most advanced thinkers hardly rose to a conception of it, for it was only after prolonged and stormy debates that Washington, Jefferson and Madison were able to secure the insertion of a clause in our Constitution which prohibited a religious test oath as a qualification to office. Some of the speeches of these great men upon this topic are among the grandest productions of human genius, not only as examples of rhetoric, but also for the grand principles and sublime truths which they embodied, and which we have heretofore delighted to honor. But even the best efforts of such men as these could only secure a slight recognition of these principles. After prolonged agitation, however, the country was so worked up to the point that an amendment to the Constitution was passed by the first Congress of this country, which declared that Congress should never make any "law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" and our country emerged with a just claim to the title of land of civil and religious liberty—the two characteristics represented by the two horns of lamb-like appearance brought out in Rev. 13. I said that our country emerged with a just claim to the title of land of civil and religious liberty, and that was true so far as the fundamental law of the land was concerned; but so far as the practical workings of the Government were concerned it was always, to a greater or less extent, false. The failure of the first count cost us our civil war; that of the last, I fear, will cost us the ruin of our country.

Very few have ever had any just conception of what that title meant; they have not realised that that was a recognition of a God-given right to every man on earth. But so it was; and just so long as that principle was observed there could never be any persecution, for "where no law is there is no transgression." Rom. 4:15.

But, as I have said, the people did not understand that, and so as early as Oct. 27, 1789, there was complaint made about that clause of our Constitution which guaranteed to us religious liberty. Again in 1811, 1812 and in 1819; but these were only individual complaints. But in 1863 an organization was effected for the avowed purpose of changing our Constitution so that it might be lawful to legislate upon religious questions. The advocates of this movement at first worked covertly, taking advantage of the religious sentiment of the country for the furtherance of their ends. They professed the same piety and zeal for God's cause as did the early bishops, and sought to remedy the evils of the times in the same way. They lamented the lack of piety in others, but instead of laying hold of the promises of God for the power of the Spirit to convince men of sin, they have sought to lay hold of the power of the civil law to compel men to be pious, and they have so far succeeded in this that our national guaranty of religious liberty has been entirely swept away.*

Religion has now become a phase of politics, and politics is fast becoming a phase of religion. As it was in the days of Constantine, so now there is mutual intrigue going on; the churches seeking to use the State to further their ends, and the politicians seeking to use the churches for their own advancement. Thus far the churches have been the winners. They have gained control of civil affairs to such an extent that they are able to

dictate to the Government and enforce their decrees, and now they openly boast through their leaders, that they hold the Congress of the United States in their hands, and that their demands will be much more frequent in the future than in the past. If this is not a union of Church and State, I would like to have you tell me what would be. Not only that, but it is exactly such a union of Church and State as was consummated in the fourth and fifth centuries. If this country has not made an image to the papal beast, tell me what feature is lacking. Looking at the current events of the day in the light of the prophecy of Rev. 13:11 and onward, with the history of the development of the Papal Church before us, I cannot comprehend how any intelligent person who has the good of humanity and the glory of God at heart can advocate the enactment of religious laws. Jesus Christ established the principle of complete separation of Church and State when he said: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars, and unto God the things that are God's," and you may search the Bible from its alpha to its omega and you can not find any different doctrine taught on this subject. Indeed the doctrine of religious liberty is one of the fundamental doctrines of the Bible. When a man is willing to concede to every other person all those rights which he claims for himself he can be said to love his neighbor as himself, and to be living out the Golden Rule; but when he assumed to dictate to his fellow man what his relations toward God shall be, "how dwelleth the love of God in him?"

I believe in the observance of the Sabbath from love to God, but Congress has no more right to enforce Sabbath observance than it has the ordinance of baptism or of the Lord's Supper.

Think on these things, for they are important, and may the good Lord help you to appreciate and apply this great truth to your life and work.

Yours in sincerity,
J. S. COMINS.
