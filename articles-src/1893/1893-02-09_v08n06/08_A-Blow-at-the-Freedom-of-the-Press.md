A Blow at the Freedom of the Press.

Upon the Constitution of the United States, as lately construed by the Supreme Court, Congress possesses the same despotic power of the autocratic control of all communications, written or printed, open or under seal mail, which pass through the mails which was exercised by the Governments of France, of Austria, and of the nation under autocracy, like absolutism in Europe.

In the famous opinion by Justice, of the freedom-of-the-press cases (*In re* Rapier, *In re* Dupre, 143 U. S., 110, 134), in which the rights of the press under the Constitution, the Court ever pronounced its adjudication, it was held that the law; it was expressly provision of "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of the press," does not involve the power or restrain the autocratic power of that body to exclude whatever it sees fit from passing through the mail, and to exclude it, and when thus ruled out by Congress, the intimation was "condemned by its judgment." The United States Government has no right "to refuse the facilities for the dissemination through the mail, Congress to forbid its carriage; the right of mail to "to become an agent in the circulation of the matter which it regards as injurious to the people." Congress may refuse to carry that which it shall "condemn in condemned by its judgment, through its Government departments agencies with respect it.

It is thus clearly and early decided that Congress may exclude from the mail every document, public or private, printed or written of principle which it seeks to the sentiments are "condemned by its judgment." Not only so, but Congress may put any restrictions that rests upon this new power that it chooses, and may effectively "prevent the transportation in other ways, as merchandise, of matter which it excludes from the mails." The Court held the Constitution, guaranteed the people no right whatever to disseminate their ideas through it nor only to send it through Congress. It is only restricted such remarkable episode in or by such.

In the Constitutional Convention of 1789 it was regarded its formidable for controlling freedom of speech and of the press was inserted in the Constitution, simply because it was of the majority deemed unnecessary. But as soon as it was stated that amendments embodying a bill of rights were to be added, the States proposed, in so many words, to make a distinct provision in that which grew the clauses of the First Amendment, prohibiting the Government, by name, from making any law "abridging the freedom of speech or of the press." This was the vital provision in the forefront of our essential bill of rights.

The meaning of this provision was then

known to all men, even to the judges. The State would be understood as denying to Congress that kind of paternal censorship, known as the of panel power from the Crown and to be censure of the press and shall all be ceding to the judges that had of that to control to be judged as they saw fit. The State was easily straightened to uphold a and a guarantee to every American citizen. As the National Government was in the nature of central of despute to repeat was what be pleased, subject only to the commercial of this the the people of in an election.

If the decision lately made by the Supreme Court—in the chief case of a newspaper excluded from the second class mailing, because the mail from the mail when the ideas they expressed were hostile to the Government to the public morals—"be a moot case, a thing the past must needed. Congress may make the act against himself threatening by incorporating into it his every sentiment, the books and papers which behind can abruptly be from the mail by the abandonment of the works of "Voltaire—North British Review."

This Nation Be Baptized?

IT has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that this is a "Christian Nation." But the decision went after the fact in the case is that so it is held that all and baptized shall be a Christian it is to be Christ-like." If this nation is a Christian nation, it has been baptized, for the Apostle declares "as many of us" Rom. 6 : 9. If this Nation professed to be a Christian has corporate capacity by the Spirit of Christ, then it has been baptized and baptism to. Could this be done to the Government by its officials?

Christ commands his followers:— "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, and he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved, he that believeth not shall be damned." And.

A theoretical belief is not what is here required. "The devils also believe and tremble," Jas. 2:19, but a belief that is held to the obedience of the gospel of Christ to the extent, sent up to the secretary of to the end, Matt. 1:21. He that Nation does not profess to believe in Christ—to really truly believe and is baptized legal entity. But how shall it be in the true civil law and who shall comply to the requirements, and what shall constitute the baptismal formula? But this nation has never thus believed, and refuses to be baptized. This nation, therefore, is not a Christian. How can a nation be a Christian which would suffer the fate of the unbeliever, was condemned? Will the Supreme Court venture to make religious laws, and enforce them upon the people? It is the church and not the State that can make such a decree and laws. What right has the State to interfere in matters of religion? No State has rights to make religious laws? God has feared all the consciences of the people of this earth, is equal to govern his people, even in the world, and he is the whole thing about his interests to enforce them.

Millions of people in this country make no profession of Christianity at all, and, according to Christ's own law, belief, only is the evidence of the born again Christian. Not any, or political creed whatever. As he was recognized by Him as his own, is the Kingdom Christian. But it is his laws. But the Supreme Court of the United States last, it is sometimes to it, and taken to reverse the decision of God by law.

The Government has no more right to
