TO-DAY we are an astonished people. Knowing that our Government was founded upon the principles of civil and religious liberty, we rested quietly under the clamor for religious legislation, not believing for a moment that Congress would yield to such demands. Now we awake from our lethargy to find a union of Church and State already inaugurated, and all branches of the Government fully committed to the requirements of a religious hierarchy.

The character of this religio-political despotism which is to take the place of our free institutions, has not yet been fully developed. The particulars are not all arranged. It has not yet been determined which of the two grand divisions of the church shall in the first instance represent the Christian religion, much less have the subsequent struggles for precedence in the favored party itself been anticipated and provided for. That is, in case it should be the Protestant party. If it should be the Catholic party there would not, perhaps, be much discussion. But these questions will soon arise, and their decision will be forced upon the Government.

When Constantine issued the edict of Milan, reversing the decrees of Diocletian, and granting religious freedom to the Christians, it soon became necessary to decide who were the Christians, and who represented the Christian religion. He designated first the Catholic Church as distinguished from all heretics and dissenters. But there were dissensions among the Catholics themselves; and it next became necessary to decide between them.

It was in Africa where the principal division existed, and Constantine gave his decision in favor of the church presided over by Cecilianus. And so rapidly were these questions precipitated upon the Emperor that it was less than four years from the edict of Milan before he was obliged to determine definitely who were entitled to its benefits. It will take somewhat longer to decide who are to be the beneficiaries of the religious legislation of this country. But it will be necessary to decide between the rival religious aspirants for political power. They can not be put aside. The State has lent itself to the Church, and must now become the arbiter to adjust the differences as they arise.

And additional legislation will be required in behalf of the Church. The advances will be insidious, but the demands will be pressed with unrelenting purpose and with ceaseless importunity. This conspiracy against the Republic, having achieved its first triumph, is not to be put down except by a general uprising of the people. We have been basely betrayed by agents selected for other purposes.

What makes the situation more serious and alarming is the fact, that the Supreme Court of the United States, on the 29th of February last, in the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity on the United States, by another Dred Scott decision, laid the foundation for religious legislation, by deciding, in effect, that the Christian religion is a national institution. As Chief Justice Taney went into a history of the country to show that it had been considered that colored people had no rights which white people were bound to respect, so Justice Brewer reviewed the history of the country for the purpose of showing that the propagation of the Christian religion was the principal factor in the settlement of the colonies and in the establishment of the State and Federal governments, and had become so interwoven with our political institutions as to become part and parcel thereof. Though Justice Brewer is not so bold in his utterances as was Judge Taney, yet the logical outcome of the decision is, that disbelievers in the Christian religion have no rights which believers are bound to respect.

We are astonished, and yet we have no right to be if the matter be philosophically considered. Both the Supreme Court decision and the legislation which legitimately followed it are but the development of a sentiment which has been cultivated with wonderful assiduity and success during the last ten or twelve years. The signal success of the movement illustrates, first, the superiority of organized over unorganized activity, and secondly, the advantage of a positive over a negative object in any social or political movement.

Those who were managing this campaign against the Government were thoroughly organized, while we were only imperfectly so; they were conducting an aggressive movement, while we were only opposing it. If the people become aroused to a sense of their danger, and there is now some indication of their so doing, they will see the necessity of organized effort in self-defense. In the reactionary movement which in that case will become general, the American Secular Union will be in the front ranks. It will have no quarrel with any other organization, but will work with them all, and hail with joy assistance from any quarter. We gladly recognize the fact that some religious societies and many clergymen throughout the country are taking a stand for civil and religious freedom. The Seventh-day Adventists especially, form a strong bulwark of defense against the encroachments of religious bigotry. The AMERICAN SENTINEL, their organ in New York, is striking powerful blows in behalf of our free institutions. Not frightened at the thought of consorting with infidels, these people are side by side with us in this contest.

It is with them already, as it will soon be, perhaps, with us also, a life and death struggle. They, believing in the Bible, take it as it reads, and obey the command to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath. Holding the other injunction to be obligatory also, "Six days shall thou labor and do all thy work," they labor on Sunday; not in a noisy or offensive way, but quietly on their farms or in their houses. But though living by themselves and disturbing no one, they are sought out, and even their own children made witnesses against them, in order to bring them to punishment for the great crime of working quietly on Sunday.

Especially is this the case in Tennessee, where they are tried, fined and imprisoned, and in punishment for their contumely in not paying their fines, they are sent out to work upon the road with the chain-gang. This in the nineteenth century, in this boasted land of liberty.

Why now for the first time during the hundred years that have elapsed since the formation of the Government, do the sticklers for Sunday holiness insist upon the aid of the civil power? Where do they find authority for such assistance? Have they discovered in the Constitution powers which have been hidden from all the statesmen, from Adams, Madison, and Jefferson down to the present time? . . .

The State has drawn the sword at the behest of the Church. Tell me not that the age of religious persecution has passed. It ceased for awhile, but will be revived, and is being revived under a revival of State religion. There are some who are hoodwinked into the supposition that this legislation of Congress is not intended to be religious, but only in aid of a civil institution; establishing Sunday as a rest-day only, without any reference to its religious character. And this in face of the fact that a United States senator for his argument, sent up to the secretary's desk a religious book, with the passage marked to be read, which declared the seventh day to be a holy day; leaving it to be inferred, that if the seventh day was a holy day for the Jews, it followed that the Americans might be forced by Congress to keep holy the first day. If this is not a religious movement, why is it headed by clergymen all over the land? When, before, in the history of the world, have the clergy shown so much interest in the working classes, and had so much anxiety lest they should do too much labor? We all know it is a religious movement. None know it better than those who are carrying it on. Senator Peffer said: "To-day we are engaged in a theological discussion concerning the observance of the first day of the week."

When the Sunday condition to the appropriation for the World's Fair was under discussion, then for the first time in the history of the Government, the national legislature eat gravely deliberating over a question of religion. The chaplain of the United States Senate, writing to the New York Independent, said: "During the debate you might have imagined yourself in a general council, or assembly, or synod, or conference." The Bible sent up with a passage marked to be read as the argument of a United States senator, and the debate so conducted that one might imagine himself in a general council or synod of the Church, and yet not a religious question! It was a religious question and a religious law, passed in accordance with a decision of the Supreme Court, establishing a national religion. And yet "no union of Church and State was contemplated"! Oh, no! But sometimes there is a slip of the tongue and more is let out than the leaders authorize.

For instance at the ministerial Union, at Syracuse, New York, the Rev. Charles Ferguson said that "he believed in one organic church, of which the President of the United States should be the head, which church should take hold of every phase of American life."

The Rev. J. D. Sands, in a speech in Pittsburg, declared that "this grand, good action of Congress suggested to the Christian mind that if this may be done, so may other equally needful measures." "The Church is gaining power continually," said he, "and its voice will be heard much oftener in the future than in the past." And H. H. George, who had labored for months to secure this legislation, said: "I have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands."

Thus we stand to-day, facing a great revolution. The struggle is upon us. "Gentlemen may cry, 'Peace, Peace,' but there is no peace, the war is actually begun." We are in a great crisis—the work before us is too momentous to permit us to present any other than a united front to the cohorts of bigotry and superstition. Let us with calmness and in a fraternal spirit discuss the best mode of conducting the campaign, and when we have determined upon it, let us proceed to carry on the work with vigor and tenacity of purpose.

C. B. WAITE.
