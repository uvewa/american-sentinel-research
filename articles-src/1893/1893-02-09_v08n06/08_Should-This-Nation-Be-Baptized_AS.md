It has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that "this is a Christian Nation." But the decision does not alter the facts in the case as to the religious status of the country. To be a Christian is to be Christ-like: "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his." Rom. 8:9. If this Nation, then, is not led and controlled in its corporate capacity by the Spirit of Christ it is not Christian except by a hypocritical profession.

Christ thus commands his followers: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned." Mark 16:13,16.

A theoretical belief is not what is here contemplated (even devils can exercise that, Jas. 2:19), but a belief that will appropriate Jesus as a Saviour from sin. See Matt. 1:21. Has this Nation done that? Then it ought to be baptized; for "he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." But how shall the rite be administered to the Nation, and by whom? and what shall constitute the baptismal font? Suppose the Nation has only a theoretical belief, and refuses to be baptized? Then it would be a hypocrite, and would suffer the fate of the unbeliever.

What fitness would such a nation possess to make religious laws, and enforce them by the lash of civil process? It would be as Satan undertaking to govern the church of Christ. What right has any earthly nation to make and enforce religious laws? God has framed all the laws, and established all the usages necessary to govern his people, even in this world, and he is able without human interference to enforce them.

Millions of people in this country make no profession of Christianity at all; and, according to Christ's own teaching, only a small minority of those who do so profess are recognized by him as his own. See Matt. 7:13, 14; and Luke 13:23-27. But the Supreme Court of the United States has, unwittingly perhaps, undertaken to reverse the decision of the Son of God.

The Government has no more right to attempt to enforce the law of God, or that of Christ, for the government of his church, than it has to do the same thing by the laws of Great Britain, France, or Russia; nor as much, for God and Christ are superior to this Government in the exercise of their divine jurisprudence, while the nations of the earth are only equals.

This Nation is not a Christian nation, and never will be, even though a majority of the people were to become Christian.

It is one of the nations that the devil promised to give the Son of God in exchange for one act of worship. See Matt. 4:6-10. But, lo! National Reformers have undertaken to bring about a state of things in this Nation that was rejected by the Son of God with a scathing rebuke. Let lovers of liberty rebuke it too.

A. SMITH.
