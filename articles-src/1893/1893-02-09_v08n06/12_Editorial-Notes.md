ONLY the Author of religion can impose religion upon irreligious. Human laws enforcing religion are irrelevant substitutes. Unjust laws unconsciously breed anarchism. Sunday laws, with all other civil laws upon religion, are inequitable. They attempt abridgement are very likely to breed civil disturbance. Among those whose financial interests are interfered with or social pleasures curtailed—whose sole interest at stake is a soldier-armed opposition by violence is not at all unlikely.

They who doubt the probability of this do not understand human nature. Such demonstrations as that of the Sunday evening should not Denver are not at all surprising, when unwarranted laws are attempted to be enforced.

PARIS, TENN., is seeking a historical reference. Read the letter on another page headed "The Tennessee Inquisition at Work." Consider what the constitution of such a course must logially result in. These Adventists obey the command of God, nothing more. They bring an harm to no any man. The law under which they are persecuted, is the very antithesis of the original principles of the government as it is opposed to the rights of religious liberty. Which side shall yield? Which must yield? Will God ever give precedence to a demand thus unjust? Will those who oppose him and undervalue the perplexity of his law ever acknowledge a superior authority? Is it not time for the persecutors to stop and consider that God may be found even to fight against God.

A VERY acceptable communication to the *Sentinel* from a new contributor this week, and is published elsewhere under the title, "The American Theory of Government." Such an expression as one in a State where the courts seem, even more than elsewhere, dominated by religious procedure. There is in one sentence in the letter of our correspondent of which perhaps he did not realize the full scope, where he says, "I believe that the Constitution, as laws of every country should embody the fundamental principle of Christianity, and that this is essential to good government." What are some of those fundamental principles? To love God with all our heart and our neighbor as ourselves; to love our enemies; to forgive those who trespass against us as we hope to be forgiven; to do unto all men as we would that they should do unto us. Is it not evident that here are principles which can not be applied in human law for the reason that they are the outward expressions of an inward grace abiding in the individual only.

It is not true that good government can go no farther than when justice gives to handed equity, while the fundamental principles of Christianity are so much above those that as the heavens are above the earth, so God is higher than fallen man's. Christ God to a new attitude. That is the fundamental principles of Christianity. Constitutionalism and laws can not embody the principles of Christianity any more than drops of liquid which the chemist has condensed in his retort can contain the Atlantic ocean.

THE *Republican* of Haven de Grace, M., has the following sensible paragraph. We agree with it entirely:—

The Government of the United States is neither combated nor denied by those who seek to enjoy peacely secure. It has no right, regarded or other Constitutional law is constitutional, regardless of all the constitutional, legal, or any right of Congress. No a citizen could be justified and to laws to the World's Fair on Sunday. Congress has no more right, moral or legal authority, to declare holidays or holy days, to order its servants nor all the citizens as it has to make a religion.

That is sound. It is the whole question in a nutshell, for, as the *Republican* also says, "It is not a question whether the closing of the gates on Sunday would be a monetary injury and loss to the workingman, or a book to the tradesy. Americans must demand of Sunday or whatever, there is no state, damnation, on all citizens of this upon common ground in this respect, and it is enough to say. That it refuses to be meddled in the investigation and investing a religious psyche in the appropriation to the World's Fair.

It is not improbable that Kansas City, Mo., will shortly furnish an instance of a conflict between the civil law and the new divinal consciousness. That city has a claim in the chapter impartial a penalty of $1.00 on every voter who, while a resident of that town, does not vote at each election. Last year 18,371 of its voters failed to perform their duty at the polls, and suits had been entered against of them. R. T. Whipple, a prominent citizen, to take him pay for his neglect. At the end of the trial, if decided in favor of the city, other noncompliance voters will be brought to court until the whole number have suffered the penalty for taking no part in the elections. Possible every probable that in this large number, there will be found some who have conscientious scruples against voting. The Christian Presbyterians very generally held it as a sin to vote under our "godless" Constitution, and there are not a few individuals in other denominations which think it wrong to vote under existing conditions. The

situation will be highly interesting should the event prove that some of these noncompliance voters are such because of conscientious conviction.

A REPORT which a number of copies of the *American* has been most written me as follows to the cast from whom he received the papers:—

DENVER, COL., Dec. 19, 1892.

*Am. Sent. Office.*

"Compliment to you with this. I am taking your paper, and do not care for the papers. I took great daily delighted I find the reading of your paper. The writer entirely sympathy with the spirit of jealousy of the Sentinel in the contention for religious freedom that you and we shall not be subject to or all authority. You will understand how near men are to me. You will understand how so much in full sympathy with the one in mind that I am able to do with the cause. By authority. For the mean one is an father or more grown around the by who has been of long used more largely as. I know more and will so come."

It all judges were of the same opinion, every attempt to enforce religious legislation by judicial decisions thus far is principles and practice and would governs our courts.

A good deal is being said and newspaper controversy for the and against concerning religion, this is quite popular, but some objection to the institution that the law should take of Quebec, in which the Catholic Church, as an organized institution, and originally establishing the principles and the special arrangements guaranteed to it by the treaty under which France ceded that province to England. With this fact as a basis, some of the clergymen, appear to be not satisfied as with Church were accorded to the United States it could be done to do force the observance and the dissemination of those privileges. To this to:—

But why? Certainly not for any reason in this deduction, and I clearly without this fear to declare that "Congress has no moral right to declare holidays or holy days, to order its servants to keep them, to make a religion."

And New Hampshire is not the only State that has an established religious institution, while Pennsylvania Presbyterians, and some of those States, are "Christianity" by decree of their highest courts. Just what that means remains for the courts, or some other of them to be developed, but it will doubtless be decided in its time.
