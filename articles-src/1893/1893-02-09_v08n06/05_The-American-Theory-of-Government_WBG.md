I HAVE read with interest the review of Judge Hammond's opinion in the King James in one of the publications of the Religious Liberty Association. I want to express my hearty approval of the criticism of the opinion of the court, the criticism of the opinion of the court. Christianity is of the supernatural, is free of Christ and animated by his Spirit. It ought not, therefore, to be properly formulated into church creeds and confessions of faith. Theology is not Christianity. Christ being infallible, there must, of course, be a perfect unity in Christianity. The result of this unity of theology demonstrates the fact that there is a great disagreement. It is only when the Bible shall it as interpreted in church creeds and confessions of the reformers, that theology is Christianity. The search for unity in theology is a search for unity not only in Christianity is name. But what then according that proposition being assumed as true—that theology is Christianity—it is really well applied. Christianity is the fortress of absorption and the misfortune of the cause of Christianity. The more the difference is recognized and appreciated, the better it will be for Christianity. There is, in fact, a common origin in a civil and religious despotism, in which Church and State were united, and the power of the civil government was wielded to enforce the decrees of the council, which was assembled for the congress purpose of enforcing the will of the

and the debate so concluded that one religion's contest was one of religion and or creed of the Church, and yet not a question of religion. This complicating question and a religious law, passed in connection with a decision of the Supreme Court, establishing a national religion. And yet "no union of Church and State was contemplated!" Oh, not what it professed to be, nor than a "lip service and more is let out than the head thinks."

In Syracuse, New York, the Rev. Charles B. Galloway preached that through organic church, of which the President of the United States should be the head, which church should take hold of every phase of American life in.

The Rev. J. D. Sanda, in a speech in St. Louis, declaring "this great, this good nation of Congress suggested to the Christian mind that it this may be done, so many other equally needful measures."

"The Church is gaining power continually," said the *Christian Statesman,* "and church should is the future than in the past." Senator Blair said: "I have labored for months to secure this legislation, and I have labored that we hold the United States Senate in our hands." The whole is we stand today, facing a great revolution. The struggle, is upon us. Americans may cry "Peace, Peace," but no is no peace, for there is actually no peace. We are in a great crisis as truly as was the Roman world when Constantine set to present any other than a united Christianity, with the sanction of legislation. Let us with calmness and in a fraternal spirit discuss the best method of conducting the campaign, and when we have concluded this discussion, let us proceed to carry on the work with vigor and determination.

majority, regardless of the consciences of even a small minority. With what a wonderful tranquility the churches have held in subjection to themselves in a quasi-religious assembly, for nearly eight hundred years, in the face of all the facts and circumstances surrounding and influencing the action of the men who held the controlling power in the Council of Nice recognized the authority of the Church. The duty of all men to respect, let the worship, the Creator is recognized in the moral law. The moral law demands that all men shall believe, and that all men, are required by moral law to obey and observe all of church principles and denied the right to all conservative Christians. I am to believe something that exceeds also my believe, regardless of my own conviction, or I am not to believe at all. Christianity "this great, this grand" institution is acknowledged every in its worst and most degrading form and be enforced in the Council of Nice.

I believe that the constitutions and laws of every country conform to the sentiments of the people, and is so essential to good government. But what Christianity is not the Christianity of the Constitution. Christianity is not enforce its convictions as represented by the State. Neither State or national legislative assembly, and government does not civil power, fundamental principles of Christianity, which appealeth to the consciences of men each, and every ruler free the choose for himself.

The above is my conviction and my reading of the Sabbath. This is my conviction and every body is at liberty to differ with my opinion on this question. Now, let I beg part to stand with the majority, either and demand the enactment of a law embody it by ruled as to the law in the Sabbath into law. For at the time comes when I stand with the minority, and the majority holds that another day than that which I regard as the Sabbath, and nobody to held in a penal statute, is to punish me. I want the constitutional test of the right or wrong of legislation on questions of Christianity is. I can not keep two days, but keep the one my conscience approves of the Christian, and if I keep the one enforced upon I am a hypocrite, to or I am not a Christian. I am a is required by the civil law, to keep a day of which the keeping of one I am a hypocrite, and, if I observe the day the civil law requires, I am either a crimitol or a hypocrite. This is the position squarely. And if my Government has the right to legislate on questions of religion for itself. This is a matter with which government can not deal. It is a violation of the underlying principles of our Government that all power is inherent in the people, and can only be transferred by their consent to others. To suppose that the power of the civil government was ever intended by the people to leave the Government and be used to run his conscience for him, and without receptionate force, for that must come from the people, and is on people as cut short liberty of conscience is a people without futures.

It is not an actionable article with us that it just governments derive their power from the consent of the governed. There is pre-eminently the American idea of government, which distinguishes this from other governments in the world—ancient or modern.

If in the matter of civil government the public conscience is higher than the government, it is reasonable to be supposed that such a government is clothed with a

power to deal with questions of religion is a. The government has never had this a. The truth is, the American theory of government—the absolute separation of State—necessarily involves the doctrine that the conscience of the individual from governmental control is the master in its act for no religious belief. That is the American theory of government, and any other is not of it.
