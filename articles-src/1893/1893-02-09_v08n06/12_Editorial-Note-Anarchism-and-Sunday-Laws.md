ONLY the Author of religion can impose penalties upon irreligion. Human laws enforcing religion are inevitably unjust. Unjust laws necessarily breed anarchism. Sunday laws, with all other civil laws upon religion, are inequitable. Their attempted enforcement is very likely to breed civil disturbance. Among those whose financial interests are interfered with or social pleasures curtailed—whose sole interest at stake is a selfish one—opposition by violence is not at all unlikely. Those who think otherwise, or who doubt the probability of this do not understand human nature. Such demonstrations as that of the Sunday evening mob at Denver are not at all surprising, when unwarrantable laws are attempted to be enforced.
