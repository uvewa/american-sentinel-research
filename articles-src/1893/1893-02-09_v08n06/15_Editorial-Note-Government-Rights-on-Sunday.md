THE Republican of Havre de Grace, Md., has the following sensible paragraph relative to the Sunday-closing contest:—

> The Government of the United States is neither religious nor irreligious; it is non-sectarian, and purely secular. It has no right, acquired or otherwise, to regulate the conscience or meddle with the religious belief or unbelief of any citizen. We deny the constitutional, legal, or any right of Congress, to make a bargain with the World's Fair managers or anybody else, for either the opening or closing the World's Fair on Sunday. Congress has no more right to prescribe the religious observance of sabbaths or holy days than to order sacraments and to ordain creeds of faith.

That is sound. It is the whole question in a nut-shell; for, as the Republican also says, "It is not a question whether the closing of the gates on Sunday would be a monetary injury and loss to the workingman, or a boon to the theatres, dance houses and Sunday saloons; there can be no class distinction, as all citizens stand upon common ground in this respect, and demand Congress to repeal its illegal act in meddling with a religious controversy and inserting a religious proviso in the appropriation to the World's Fair."
