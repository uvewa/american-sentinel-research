# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, February 9, 1893 (v08n06)

## General Note

The scan quality of this issue is significantly degraded, with very small type in a three-column layout at 300 DPI. Many words, especially in the middle and right columns, are difficult to distinguish at the character level. This has resulted in a much higher than normal number of uncertain readings throughout all articles. Multiple passes were made on each page, but many passages remain uncertain. The transcriptions represent best-effort readings and should be carefully verified against higher-resolution scans or a physical copy.
