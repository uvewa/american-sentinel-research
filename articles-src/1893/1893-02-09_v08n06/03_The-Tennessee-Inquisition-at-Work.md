SPRINGVILLE, TENN., Jan. 30, 1893.

The Adventist neighborhood was visited this week by the sheriff and grand jury bailiff, who made seven additional arrests on the charge of violating the Sunday law, making a number of witnesses. One of the witnesses summoned, though not subpœnaed, W. D. Dortch, summoned to testify against the Adventists, refused to do so, was at school where the representative of the Wisely was on him Monday at the close of the lesson.
