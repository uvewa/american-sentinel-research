ON JANUARY 17, Representative M. E. Burke, of Wisconsin, introduced into the Assembly of that State the following preamble and joint resolution:—

WHEREAS, By the provision of a statute recently enacted by the Congress of the United States, in connection with an appropriation of five million dollars from the treasury of the United States, the Director General of the World's Columbian Exposition was denied the right, and prevented from exercising the right, of opening said Exposition, which is to be held at Chicago in 1894, on Sunday,

the said Act the having closed the aforesaid Exposition on Sunday imposes a restriction upon the liberty of the large and influential portion of the citizens of this and other States who prefer to visit the said Exposition on Sunday, solely upon religious or individual purpose whatsoever, but on the citizens of this and other States who prefer and to visit the said Exposition on Sundays, thereby such right and privileges of free and law-abiding citizens of this country, and is unfair and unjust to the exclusion of hundreds of thousands of persons whose only opportunity to visit the same is on said day. Said action, having been derived from an inspection of the many arguments made before certain committees of said Congress, where it was clearly established, emanated chiefly from a religious prejudice, which has no legal basis and the support of a majority much in a Memorial law. Therefore, be it

*Resolved,* By the Assembly of the great State of Wisconsin, that said World's Columbian Exposition, in the city of Chicago, State of Illinois, shall on all secular days be open for the admission of the public all days of the week, including Sunday, on which the display of all classes of exhibits and the operation of machinery thereon, on Sunday; as will not impose any restriction whatsoever upon the officers of the World's Columbian Exposition and of said Exposition, and that our senators and representatives in Congress be urged to take such action as is necessary, to either repeal or amend this law, or to cause makes to secure the repeal of the Sunday closing act already in force, and to provide for the opening of the exposition on every day in the week.

*Resolved,* That the Governor and Secretary of State are by this resolution of the assembly, authorized, at once, transmit under their official signature, to each senator and representative in Congress, a copy of the said foregoing resolution.

The resolution was adopted by the Assembly, thus making Wisconsin at this of the first States to put itself on record as declaring in favor of Sunday opening.

Liberty stands out prominent as a characteristic throughout the resolution. The arguments of the first clause are not based upon religious reasons, but, rightly, because Sunday closing is an, "infringement upon the natural right and privileges of free and law-abiding citizens." The Legislature will, on those grounds, express themselves in favor of Sunday opening.

R. G. WILKINSON.

Do the religious laws of to-day foreshadow the persecutions of to-morrow?
