A GOOD deal is being said nowadays about the annexation of Canada, and the idea is quite popular; but some objection has been raised on account of the Province of Quebec, in which the Catholic Church, as an organized institution, still enjoys substantially the privileges and the predominance guaranteed to it by the treaty under which France ceded the province to England. With this fact as a basis, some of the newspapers have argued that if Canada were annexed to the United States it could only be done by stipulating for the abandonment of these privileges. To this the Catholic Review replies:—

> But why? Certainly not for any reason in the Constitution of the United States, which merely declares that the "Congress shall make no law" for an establishment of religion, etc. There is nothing to forbid any State legislature setting up an established religion, and, in fact, as all the American world knows, or ought to know, New Hampshire is by its constitution a "Protestant State."

And New Hampshire is not the only State that has an established religion. The Granite State is Protestant by constitutional provision, while Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and some other States, are "Christian" by decree of their highest courts. Just what that means remains for the courts, or some other authority, to decide; but it will doubtless be decided in due time.
