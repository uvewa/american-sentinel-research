IT has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that this is a "Christian Nation." But the decision went after the fact in the case is that so it is held that all who believed and baptized shall be saved. "A Christian it is to be Christ-like." If this nation is a Christian nation, it has been baptized, for the Apostle declares "as many of us" Rom. 6:9. If this Nation professed to be a Christian has corporate capacity by the Spirit of Christ, then it has been baptized and baptism to. Could this be done to the Government by its officials?

Christ commands his followers:— "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, and he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved, he that believeth not shall be damned."

A theoretical belief is not what is here required. "The devils also believe and tremble," Jas. 2:19, but a belief that is held to the obedience of the gospel of Christ to the extent, sent up to the secretary of to the end, Matt. 1:21. The Nation does not profess to believe in Christ—to really truly believe and is baptized legal entity. But how shall it be in the true civil law and who shall comply to the requirements, and what shall constitute the baptismal formula? But this nation has never thus believed, and refuses to be baptized. This nation, therefore, is not a Christian. How can a nation be a Christian which would suffer the fate of the unbeliever, was condemned? Will the Supreme Court venture to make religious laws, and enforce them upon the people? It is the church and not the State that can make such a decree and laws. What right has the State to interfere in matters of religion? No State has rights to make religious laws? God has feared all the consciences of the people of this earth, is equal to govern his people, even in the world, and he is the whole thing about his interests to enforce them.

Millions of people in this country make no profession of Christianity at all, and, according to Christ's own law, belief, only is the evidence of the born again Christian. Not any, or political creed whatever. As he was recognized by Him as his own, is the Kingdom Christian. But it is his laws. But the Supreme Court of the United States last, it is sometimes to it, and taken to reverse the decision of God by law.

The Government has no more right to attempt to enforce the law of God, or that of Christ, for the government of its Church, than it has to do the same thing to the laws of Great Britain, France, or Russia; to neither of these nations is it either superior to this Government in the exercise of their divine jurisprudence, while the nations of the earth are only equals.

This Nation as not a Christian nation, and never will be, even though a majority of its people were to become Christians. It is one of the nations that the devil presumed to give the Son of God in is changed for one act of worship. See Matt. 4:8-10. But, lot "National Reformers" go on; let them go on to the completion of things in this Nation that was rejected by the Son of God with a scathing rebuke, all lovers of liberty rebuke it too.
