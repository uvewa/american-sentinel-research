ON January 17, Representative M. E. Burke, of Wisconsin, introduced into the Assembly of that State the following resolution:

> Joint Resolution in relation to the management of the World's Columbian Exposition on Sundays.
>
> WHEREAS, By the provision of a statute recently enacted by the Congress of the United States, the American people and visitors from abroad are denied the right, and prevented from exercising the choice of visiting the World's Columbian Exposition, to be held at Chicago in 1893, on Sundays, and,
>
> WHEREAS, said provision, in the opinion of a large and influential portion of the citizens of the State of Wisconsin, and surrounding States, does not serve, promote, or attain any public, private or individual purpose whatsoever, but on the contrary, is an unjust and unnecessary and unwarrantable interference with, and infringement upon, the personal right and privileges of free and law-abiding citizens, and that its enforcement will result in the exclusion of hundreds of thousands of laboring and business people in the northwest from the pleasures, instruction, and other benefits to be derived from an inspection of the many magnificent and instructive works of God and man, which will be displayed at said Exposition, and will also result in a financial loss thereto. Therefore, be it
>
> Resolved by the Assembly, the Senate concurring, that it is the sense and desire of the legislature of the State of Wisconsin, that said World's Columbian Exposition, to be held in Chicago this year, be open for the admission of the public all days of the week, from its commencement until its close, under such regulation concerning the operation of machinery therein, on Sundays, as will not interfere with religious observance on Sunday by people living or worshiping in the immediate vicinity of said Exposition, and that our senators and representatives in Congress from this State are hereby requested and instructed to use every honorable means to secure the repeal of the Sunday closing clause of said act of Congress, and be it further
>
> Resolved, That the Governor and Secretary of State be, and they are hereby authorized and requested to, at once, transmit under their official signatures and the seal of the State one copy of these resolutions to each of our senators and representatives in Congress.

The resolution was adopted by the Assembly, thus making Wisconsin one of the first States to put itself on record as declaring in favor of Sunday opening.

Liberality stands out prominently as a characteristic throughout the resolution. The grounds taken for this action are not based upon religious reasons, but, rightly, because Sunday closing is an "infringement upon the personal rights and privileges of free and law-abiding citizens."

It is to be hoped that all the State legislatures will, on these grounds, express themselves in favor of Sunday opening.

R. G. WILKINSON.
