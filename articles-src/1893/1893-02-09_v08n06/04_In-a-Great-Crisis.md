TO-DAY we as an automatized people founded upon the principles of civil and religious liberty. To-day with voice and the clamor for religious legislation, and the hope that the principles of the Government would yield to such demands. Now we issue from our lethargy to find a union of Church and State already inaugurated, committed to the requirements of a religious character.

The character and character are not fully developed. The particulars are not all settled; the details are not adjusted remind which of the two great divisions of the church shall in the first place, to represent the Christian religion, must into have the achievements struggle for preeminence in the favored party itself shall be determined and provided for. That is the character of the present condition. But it should be the Catholic party there would be no uncertainty about the issue. But those questions will soon arise, and they will demand to be settled.

When Constantine issued the edict of Milan, reverting the decree of Diocletian, great granting religious freedom to the decide who were the Christians, and who should be persecuted of, the Church of the general did first the Catholic Church in regard to itself was but a mass of conflicting interests. But there were dissensions among the Catholic themselves, and it next became necessary to decide between them.

It was in Africa, where the principal division existed, and Constantine gave his judicial decision by banishing the troubler by over Cecilians. And so rapidly were events thence precipitated that it is noted by Emperor that it was less than four years from the edict of Milan before he was obliged to determine definitely who were entitled to the benefits. It was in this what larger to decide who are to be the beneficiaries of the religious legislation of this country. But it will be necessary to decide between the rival religious sects for purposes for political power. May can it end in the established for the that it is so to the church, and must now become to adjust the difference and equalize it.

And additional legislation will be required in behalf of the Church. The advancement be in its institution, but the demands will be pressed with unrelenting purpose and with combined impetuousness. This crusade against the Baptists, having achieved its first triumph, is not to be supposed that it is going to leave the people. We have been barely beginning to deal with the question.

What makes the situation more serious and alarming is the fact, that the Supreme Court of the United States, as the 19th of February last, in the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States, by another David Brewer decided, laid the foundation for religious legislation by asserting that Christianity is not religion is a national institution. As a history of this country is needed to show of the country to show that it had been considered that colored people had no rights which white people were bound to respect, a Justice reversed this and the history of the country for the purpose of establishing the institution of slavery, so religion was the principal factor in the settlement of the colonies and in the formation of both the colonial and State governments, and had become so interwoven with, and so a part of the civic body of the nation, that the two must have in concert and parcel thereof. Though Justice Brewer so put so bold in his authority, as was Judge Taney, yet the logical and natural course of the operations. Our citizens in the Christian religion have no rights which those not believers are called to respect.

We are astonished, and yet we have no reason to be. This combination so long only considered. Both the Supreme Court and Congress have done the most it legitimately followed it are but the developments of a movement which has been cultivated with wonderful assiduity and zeal for the last half dozen active years. The signal success of the movement illustrates, first, the superiority of organized effort over the unorganized mass; and the advantage of a positive over a negative position. We now face a most grave crisis.

Those who were managing this campaign against the Government were themselves confident, while we were sure imperially; so they were conducting an aggressive and we were on the defensive movements to. If the people were content to is some of their danger, and there is no reason to doubt their willingness to, they will see the necessity of organized effort to effectively counteract it. This movement which in that case will be more general, the American Sentinel Union will be in, in the front ranks. It will have to reckon with, not any other organization, but will work with them all, and had will get admission from not any quarter. We are not a representative of any denomination association and many clergymen for civil and religious freedom. The Seventh-day Adventist especially, form a strong bulwark of defense against the entailments of religious legislation. The

AMERICAN SENTINEL, their organ in New York, is a striking powerful force in behalf of our free institutions. Not frightened at the thought of competing with in battles, those people are able by the aid of truth.

It is with them already, as it will soon be, perhaps, with all who seriously take up the struggle. They, believing in the Bible, as it takes it in truth, and they choose not to observe the seventh day after the demands of the customs their consciences and authority. "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work," is the Bible quoted to them, not a s a story or offering such and only to their farms or their in their home if they might be punished. But they trust in God, turning no one, they are sought out, and indictment brought by zealous ones, impatient for the great stride of work against them, to order to bring them to punishment as the great crime of work against Sunday.

The same is the case in Tennessee, where they are tried, fined and imprisoned, and it is practically admitted that the county is not paying their thing nor pay any of the cost to not work upon the work they know God commands. What a state of affairs, in this boasted land of liberty.

But it is only typical. And if the three hundred years that have elapsed since the Puritans tied the Baptists and whipped the stickers for Sunday lollows least upon them, have not taken out of Christians, they find authority for such punishment? Where in the Bible? Where in the Constitution? Adventists whichever have been Italian, where the institutions, from Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and other of the founders of this Republic?

The State has drawn the sword at the instigation of the Church; and the sword, though of religious persecution has passed. It cannot be re-forged, it was still be revised, and is being revised under a revival of religious persecution zeal, it is that is so, it is not bondstormed into the disposition that this thing must be put down.

The fact is, there is no question of distinction, establishing Sunday as a resting day, has not in itself a legitimate religious character. And this in face of the fact, that many ministers of the gospel admit, sent up to the secretary of the Smithsonian, to the committees on Sunday to read, which declared the seventh day of the week, and not the first, that is it, to be a feared, that of this nation day to a day for of the Lord, is follows that is Sunday to the first day of the week, has no claims to keep holy the first day. If this is not a religious character, why is it that the clergy alone are interested? Why is it that the clergy all over the land? When, if the question has not a religious character, the clergy shows so much interest in the day? What have they to do with a rest day, lest they should do too much labor? We apprehend that there is nobody anywhere who has ever noticed any of the clergy overworking it on. Senator Pifer said; "In the last ten years I have not heard a discourse concerning the observance of the Sabbath as a religious duty."

When the Sunday condition to the approach a political, for a part who first set the discussion, then for the first time in the history of the United States, a national legislature as of greatly deliberating over a question of religion. The Chicago *Times Herald* said: The *New York Independent,* said: "During the past year, the question of Sunday as a civil rest or as a religious institution has set afoot. The Sunday law rest day,"

"By Sabbath, or Lord's day." The Chicago paper said: "It is not pretended that it has anything to do with the teaching of morality." The State is a civil institution;
