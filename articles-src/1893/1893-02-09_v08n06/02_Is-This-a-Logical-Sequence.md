As it is perfectly natural, in connection with the enforcement of Sunday observance by law, the question of the imposition of civil penalties for blasphemy is now receiving increased attention. It is an important question, and one that the question should be a.

The Republic are not of England—

Some time ago the suggestion was made to a formal to suppress the growing evil and scandal of

gross profanity. It was generally admitted that English laws were disgracefully pre-eminent in the matter of profanity. It is well known that and that English street lauchers possessed profanity to such an extent that strangers were revolted. The wonder was that it would be an recognize and not attempt remedy. It was explained that the laws so absurd as to meddle with his right to get drunk, the laws of George II. "for the suppression of profanity and immorality," was too old, too worn on Wednesday at Walsham. The set is distinguish between expression more specifically, and was a complete coincidence windowless. Profanes are imposed for the first offense, two shillings for a second, two shillings when the sinner to above a servant, three shillings for a gentleman, and five for a man of rank, with imprisonment in default of payment. The punishment is applicable to all blasphemous and profane language, even in a man's own house, which annonces the principle of legislation; a man may be prosecuted for it. The Walsham case, however, was perfectly in common law, the enforcement of the act is absurd to pay a shilling for each oath and tierce.

It upon this same ancient authority that the statutes stand proceedings on the subject of blasphemy and profanity, and the several States of this country, as is well known by the public historian directly back to this English law. If this be so, the people of this country have still have such life as it has had in this country up to this time, without the law now be gives to it,—now that it is resurrected.

In Germany this subject comes up for legislative action; and of that which a foreign dispatches say in this regard:—

The German Government introduced a bill in the course of the present session in a bill for the reformation of the law of libel. This is in punishment with label before. Neither did it to make blasphemy a penal offence, and, indeed, blasphemy has been punished heretofore as a penal offence in many other European countries, notably in Great Britain and Germany. In England the same is well known as common law offense, and the law of prosecutions for blasphemy have been pretty strongly of the last century. To assume as that blasphemy could be regarded as a penal offence. The significance of the German bill against blasphemy, as of the present proposed American blasphemy bill, may lead to a possible ascendency of ecclesiastical power—always a menace to liberty.

The question really is, what is the extent of the power is there in acting, as the law now stands in this country, which can be pushed against those who are not believers? It would be impossible to speak insanity of the letter of any modern law against blasphemy.

This German law against blasphemy says the inevitable, it will not be enforced. That would be contrary to the inevitable progress of the present course of world events. It is so far a concession to organized religion. It will be seen that blasphemy, whatever may be said of the German the contest is, as so lately shown here, is the reproduction of a feud, of the Sunday opening of the World's Fair, between Protestantism and Catholicism, for supremacy in the State. Just as in this country, the Protestants are now willing to give up Government appropriation for Indian schools entirely, in order that the Catholic clergy may be shut out from sharing in the public treasury. But they are now proposing to try evidence the efficiency of their law against blasphemy because of its use as it should may be put to in the enforcement of Roman

Catholicism. It does not seem to those that by this they impeach the law. No one seems to perceive that blasphemy law be brought has any place in the statute or the common law of a republic; and that blasphemy and profanity are in the statute it, it is of the legislation of England, and to action for their enforcement
