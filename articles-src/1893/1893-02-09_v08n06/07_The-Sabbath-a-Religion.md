the Sabbath a religion. Can the State rightly pass laws compelling men to rest on the Sabbath? Or can it be rightly argued that because the State can not compel attendance upon religious exercises, laws must be passed to make rest on Sunday? Religion is a matter between man and his God, and not between man and the State. Jesus taught this when he was on earth, in the injunction, "Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and render unto the things that are God's."

Were not the apostles justified when the council at Jerusalem commanded and refused to stop preaching Christ and his resurrection? The council sentenced the three Hebrews, years before that, when they refused to worship the image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up? If not, why did God deliver them from the burning fiery furnace? Would he have delivered them had they been doing wrong accordingly contrary to his will? Were they doing wrong when they did as Hus God charged also them? Because the Sabbath is a matter of religion as is the Sabbath, and made a law compelling men to keep it, is it not a violation of the civil, shall any man return to obey, does God do it is right now to forsake the commandments and obey men any more than he did in ages ago? I think not, for in this he hath set and is in.

The troubles is, he is just as wrong to keep the first day of the week as men have been for the three Hebrews to have bowed to the golden image of Nebuchadnezzar. The Adventist in Tennessee has a legal, moral and divine right to work on Sunday so long as it does not interfere with the rights of others, and they are justified in the sight of God in so doing.

Sunday is not the Sabbath, and therefore first chosen to keep the seventh day, have a moral, religious, and a perfect right to do so. No man say, can be forced, to keep the first day of the week, as well as the seventh. Or even if Sartana says he is right to say that all must rest, that day because the Scriptures says so. As soon as the State interfere in such matters, anarchy begins. It always has been so; it always will be so. It was so that brought about the persecution of the three Hebrew children. It brought it two dark ages; in all the crooked ways which brought about the Inquisition; and that same thing will come again of the State interfere in such matters, because humans in this same are now as they were then.

The Oracle says: "It is better for a few to sufferers before. But the for the State to tend to power by the complete destruction of the day." If this is true, then the early Christians were wrong when Christ was on the earth." "It is polition to for one man should do for for the people, and that the whole nation perish not." But it is no wonder that the same thing should be the fall of the Hebrews of Christ, for he told his in a thing is John 15:19, 20: "If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you."

The did the apostles teach and Apostolical Did the apostles teach and put a better, a more appropriate name, he Christians, God's? The apostles, enthralled men to turn to the Lord. They did not use force. If the whole Bible, were compelled by civil law to serve God,

there would be one more true Christian than there is now. The State would have all its laws taken up in prohibition, but it would make them no better; that is, it could not change one heart. It can not help it. They are civil by nature and each robot short of the Spirit of God can change that nature. Why is it that men can not see this, and see the reason that God and his apostles used, to bring men to God? It would be better to have less Christians, than to have a whole State of hypocrites, for that is what a State-bolstered religion would make.
