PARIS, Tenn., is seeking a historical reputation by the side of Salem, Mass. Read the letter on another page headed "The Tennessee Inquisition at Work." Consider what the continuance of such a course must logically result in. These Adventists obey the command of God, nothing more. They bring no harm to any one. The law under which they are persecuted is as contrary to the original principles of this government as it is opposed to the religion of Jesus Christ. Which shall yield? Which must yield? Will God ever give precedence to a human enactment? Will those who serve him and maintain the perpetuity of his law ever acknowledge a superior authority? Is it not time for the persecutors to stop and consider lest haply they be found even to fight against God.
