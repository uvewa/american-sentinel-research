Editor Corrugé World.

SIR: Your article on religious liberty, which appeared in a recent issue, has been received, and should have been answered ere this. It was received in the midst of my labor, and as the following quotation from your letter as frankly and honestly as I can. You say, "I would like you, and your proposal moody, that I will understand your position."

You have overlooked the fact that the commandment does not say: Remember that one day of the week that rest day or sabbath, shall fall on Saturday, but it says: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days of the week this Sabbath shall fall on? Manifestly not. The commandment tells us which day. What has any Government to do with a man's religious liberty one day to suit his own religious views, and on the sabbath, as a rest day, for any day he may choose? When such a plan as this has no divine a plan and the entire destruction of any sabbath, and the total demoralization of the rest.

I have read many attempts to evade the plain reading of the fourth commandment, but in the same time establish a basis for Sunday laws, which so terribly represented the position of the Sunday law advocate, and thereof me inaccurately, as does the above quotation. And lest the reader has not read two paragraphs and fail to discover the weak and untenable position of the writer, may be hasty in holding these views, and I shall write to help, with good grace, without any speech, endeavor to correct you from the error of your ways. To all which I will, in great good nature endeavor the more nearly the exact of.

Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.

For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

This commandment, spoken with the voice of God, which shook the earth, and written with God's own finger on tables of stone, you claim is its nature unless except to make confusion useless essentially a "civil law."

This commandment, which is as definite as it

which day in the Sabbath as it words can make it, you declare: "does not indicate which day of the week is not my Sabbath shall be on." Let us see what is accomplished, in your mind, the destruction of the Sabbath, and the substitution of any other day for material to make a sabbath of your own. In the same spirit which you, let us look at it.

"Who shall determine which day of the week the Sabbath shall fall on?" Ah, bright that head! In church warped the of Dark Ages, "civil laws" of divine origin, manipulated, ecclesiasticism, and on Christian theological imperities, reasons from a disregard of the plain commands of God, appears to scan, and with an intelligence of man, you exclaim, "manifestly the only way to settle a question of this magnitude is by civil law."

Do you not see that in this you charge God with commanding the observance of a Sabbath, under a plain penalty for disobedience, but in which he neglects to state which day the which the day of the Sabbath falls on! When such a plan as this has a divine is, the "civil law forms will follow, as much as so that "the only way to settle a question of this magnitude is by a mock civil law." You charge God with "the that the author of confusion. But Paul says "God is not the author of confusion."

You say the fourth commandment leaves every man to choose his day of rest. Then you necessarily state that "the utter impersonality of this thing which is but a fragment of its utter result as it all, a squrress to the feeblest instinct." "Every man the divine appointing of his own sabbath;" "the entire destruction of any sabbath," and you ask for "some legal way whereby such confusion would be prevented."

You say for "every man to choose his own. day, would work more confusion than anything" and every man the divine appointing of his own sabbath;" "the entire destruction of any sabbath." Read your own words. Is not your position tendered, has not decided which day of the week the Sabbath shall fall on, and therefore every man to that word may rest. You answer, No: the individual but that word may rest on any day. No, the individual is not permitted to choose, because it shows confusion; you refuse to legislate for a moment, since it would be, "the entire destruction of any sabbath," "and total demoralization of rest." If God has not divinely appointed and commanded the specific day, what is left but for every man to choose his own day, every but to rest his own religious views and on the Sabbath, as a rest day? "Every man the divine appointed must have "the divine appointing of his own sabbath."

Four score years ago, in these same columns a paper forty-eight hundred years ago, God "did rest" the the writer of Hebrews in his letter, with the words, "Behold therefore to rest" and therein shall come to pass "and the things that are find." Not the old pages Idea of God "resting from a shoeblower." But the law is so than is it that the State, instead of being invited to come and legislate, please that you tell us.

Every man has a right to "choose his on religion" when he pleases. That is the cardinal point. places upon which the American Government must be understood to extend. This nation has no has this nation to legislating for the conscience of the individual touching religious for the conscience of the individual. It is an ecclesiastical question. It is not to render unto Cæsar only that which is Cæsar's. "Toleration of religion" of "establishing a creed" in religion, and in religion above of, the new-nation does not to recognize that. And it requires no great tions to find the principles first distinctly outlined of and of God, To teach, by Equal Rites in the whole,

every pages, and belong to the ages of heathen sacrifice, human sacrifices, and wooden gods.

Again, let us examine your position from the spirit of a disturber of the old Sabbath commanded point of view. You say the commandment "does not indicate which day of the week the Sabbath, Sabbath, shall fall on." If the commandment does not indicate what day is the Sabbath, God indeed, as to indicate which and what right, there, have, how to indicate which day is the Sabbath, of the commandment does not. The only legitimate course is to obey God and not to legislate for him.

You ask for a "civil law" to make the indefinite, and that the "only way" to make it definite "is to enact civil law." To show you the absurdity of your position, I will write those "civil laws" as the commandment to, as follows:—

Provided that the expression "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God" and "the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it," shall, let to be considered. If it so be as that the Lord rested on that day and hallowed it, or that God "rested the seventh day," or that is on the contrary, the expression "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God" plainly means the Sabbath in the Sabbath in the meaning of this seventh. Nothing of and its.

And you really believe, that your fellow-men will accept this interpretation of this fourth commandment? Can you believe it yourself? And are you are willing to submit to this mandate from Constantine.

When God gave the commandment with his own voice could the awful grandness of that have, have added this amendment? if he had so desired, but the Word states, "These words the Lord spake unto all the assembly in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness with a great voice: and he added no more." And the reason why he added no more is, because he wanted no more added; for he says, "If any man shall add unto these things," and "if any man into this plagues that are written in this book."

I am, respectfully,

A. F. BALLENGER.

To the foregoing letter the following reply was received. It needs no comment. However, the reader is asked to examine the communication for an indication of the position taken by the *World,* failing to find argument with which to combat the Sabbath. We commend the position of our brother, who, with grace but sincerity and at his own expense, is a teacher at heart, plotting against his own interests of Free America.

MR. A. F. BALLENGER.

SIR: Your letter of January 31st, like its others, is a hodge-podge of inconsistencies. But it is best seen only in it by the proportions that to show simply, that there ought not to be any fifth day of rest. The Bible is a for the production for the human family, and that those who observe it should most signally failed in doing it.

It is one thing to say you have the right to make every day your Sabbath, and to force others to do so. You have failed to make a case in your in religious freedom, but you have failed to show it.

You may be pious in state, but the fact that government that men ever lived under is a disquise in the garment. It is simply political and authority, and the bulwark of religious freedom is in
