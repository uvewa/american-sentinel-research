A JUDGE to whom a number of copies of the SENTINEL had been sent writes as follows to the one from whom he received the papers:—

> Decatur, Ill., Dec. 19, 1892.
>
> MR. GEO. TUTTLE,
> Springfield, Ill.,
>
> Dear Sir: Your favor of the 27th ult. came duly to hand as did also the papers. I took great interest in their perusal, for though not agreeing with all the matters promulgated, nevertheless I am in profound sympathy with the spirit of jealousy of encroachment of the civil power upon liberty of conscience, thought, and action in matters religious. I can well understand how men may differ on these points, and I can also well understand how the sacredness of my own right of opinion and action rests on no higher or more secure ground than the right of my neighbor, and as a matter of unquestionable principle, so long as I cherish my own right I must vindicate that of my fellow, however he may differ with me. I regard the increasing watchfulness on this subject as eminently conservative and the duty of every lover of personal, religious liberty. I thank you for your courtesy,
>
> Very respectfully,

If all judges were of the same opinion there would be in this country less religious legislation by judicial decisions than there is; principle and not precedent would govern our courts.
