SPRINGVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 30, 1893.

The Adventist neighborhood was visited again on the 27th instant by the deputy sheriff, who made several additional arrests for Sunday work, and summoned quite a number of witnesses. One of the witnesses subpoenaed was the ten-year old son of W. D. Dortch, summoned to testify against his own father. The little fellow was at school where the representative of the law found him. In the SENTINEL of January 26, it was stated on the authority of a letter from this neighborhood, that this boy had been subpoenaed, and, on the writer's recollection of the boy, that he was eleven years of age. Neither statement was strictly correct; the summons was not served until the 27th, when it was done in the presence of the writer, who was informed by the boy's father that his son was only ten years old on the 11th inst.

Before this reaches the readers of the SENTINEL the trials of these Adventists will have been held and sentence pronounced. What the judgment of the court will be it is of course impossible to predict with any degree of certainty, but it has been stated in Paris, the county seat, that "they are going to be harder with them this time." A business man of that place is reported as wondering "what they will do that will be any harder than the chain-gang."

Before coming into this neighborhood the writer understood that all the indictments for Sunday work, seventeen in number, were against Adventists, but such, it seems, is not the case. Seven out of the seventeen are against negroes in the employ of the Paducah, Tennessee & Alabama Railroad. These inoffensive colored men have doubtless been indicted to break the force of the charge that the prosecution of the Adventists is religious persecution; but not until the law is enforced impartially against all, white and black, Adventist, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, or what not, the people can not be deceived—the prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Henry County, Tenn., has in it all the essential elements of religious persecution, and everybody except those in sympathy with it recognizes it as such.

With the prosecuting attorney who gets two dollars and a half for every indictment and five dollars for every conviction, the Sunday cases may be,—as some who know the man do not hesitate to assert,—a matter of fees; but back of everything else is religious bigotry and intolerance. One of the indicted Adventists is a young man who up until a short time prior to the finding of the indictment against him was rather wild, and did not keep any day, but worked alike on all days or spent the time riding around the country. But nothing was said about it; so long as he did not keep another day nobody seemed to care what he did on Sunday; the first term of court, however, after he became an Adventist, he was indicted, and will probably be in jail by the time that this letter is printed.

There are some exceedingly sad things connected with this persecution, but the courage of the Adventists seems to be good. Persecution has not come to them as a surprise, for it is simply what their study of prophecy has led them to expect for years, and instead of being discouraged by it their faith is simply confirmed.

Since the writer visited this neighborhood last summer a very neat and commodious church has been erected here. It is the best church building in the neighborhood, if not in the county outside of Paris. The old church building is now used as a school house. Just at present it is occupied by the public school, but during several months each year when there is no public school the Adventists maintain a subscription school. They believe in education, and though poor they do not suffer their children to grow up in ignorance.

Additional particulars concerning the practical workings of the Henry County Inquisition and the temper and bearing of the Adventists under persecution will be given in another letter. This one must be mailed just on the eve of the trials in order to reach the reader in good season.
