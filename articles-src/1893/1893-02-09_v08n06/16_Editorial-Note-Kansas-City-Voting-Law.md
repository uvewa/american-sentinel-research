It is not improbable that Kansas City, Mo., will shortly furnish an instance of a conflict between the civil law and the individual conscience. That city has a clause in its charter imposing a penalty of $2.50 on every voter who, while a resident of that town, does not vote at any election. Last year 18,271 of its voters failed to perform their duty at the polls, and suit has been entered against one of them, B. T. Whipple, prominent citizen, to make him pay for his neglect. At the end of the trial, if decided in favor of the city, other non-voters will be brought to court until the whole number have suffered the penalty for taking no part in the election. It seems very probable that in this large number, there will be found some who have conscientious scruples against voting. The Reformed Presbyterians very generally hold it as a sin to vote under our "godless" Constitution, and there are not a few individuals in other denominations who think it wrong to vote under existing conditions. The situation will be highly interesting should the event prove that some of these non-voters are such because of conscientious conviction.
