A very acceptable communication comes to the SENTINEL from Tennessee this week, and is published elsewhere under the title, "The American Theory of Government." Such an expression as this is especially acceptable coming from a State where the courts seem, even more than elsewhere, dominated by religious precedent. There is one sentence in the letter of our correspondent of which perhaps he did not realize the full scope, where he says, "I believe that the Constitution and laws of every country should embody the fundamental principles of Christianity, and that this is essential to good government." What are some of these fundamental principles? To love God with all our heart and our neighbor as ourselves; to love our enemies; to forgive those who trespass against us as we hope to be forgiven; to do unto all men as we would that they should do unto us. Is it not evident that here are principles which can not be applied in human law for the reason that they are the outward expression of an inward grace abiding in the individual heart.

Is it not true that good government can go no farther than exact justice and even-handed equity, while the fundamental principles of Christianity are as much above that as the heavens are above the earth, as God is higher than fallen man? Christ died to save sinners. That is the fundamental postulate of Christianity. Constitutions and laws can not embody the principles of Christianity any more than one drop of water which the chemist has condensed in his retort can contain the ocean.
