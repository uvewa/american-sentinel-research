We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

MR. D. W. MILLER,

Editor Carriage World,

Cincinnati, Ohio.

Dear Sir: Your letter of November 9 was duly received, and should have been answered ere this, and would have been but for the lack of time. The following quotation from your letter so frankly states your position, the dilemma into which it leads you, and your proposed remedy, that I will notice it briefly:

> You have overlooked the fact that the commandment simply enjoins six days of labor and one rest day to follow, but does not indicate what day of the week that rest day or sabbath, shall fall on. True, it is the seventh day following the six days of labor, but who shall determine what day of the week this Sabbath shall fall on? Manifestly the only way to secure the general observance of one day was to enact civil laws.
>
> You claim this interferes with religious liberty. In other words, you would have every man choose his own day to suit his own religious views, and thus every man would have the divine appointing of his own sabbath. The utter impracticability of such a plan and the entire destruction of any sabbath at all is apparent to the feeblest intellect.

I have read many attempts to evade the plain requirements of the fourth commandment and at the same time establish a basis for Sunday laws, but I never before saw a statement of the case which so truthfully represented the position of the Sunday law advocate, and therefore so manifestly blind, weak, and wicked. I can not see how you can read these two paragraphs and fail to discover the fearful errors that contain. However, you may be honest in holding these views, and I shall therefore, kindly, yet with great plainness of speech, endeavor to convert you from the error of your way. To this end I will first quote the fourth commandment, as follows:

> Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
>
> Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work:
>
> But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
>
> For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.

This commandment, spoken with the voice of God, which shook the earth, and written with God's own finger on tables of stone, you declare to be utterly useless except to make confusion unless amended by "civil laws."

This commandment, which is as definite as to which day is the Sabbath as words can make it, you declare "does not indicate which day of the week this rest day or Sabbath shall fall on." Having accomplished, in your mind, the destruction of God's commandment, you very naturally cast about for material to make a sabbath of your own. In the utter confusion which follows, you cry out, "Who shall determine which day of the week the Sabbath shall fall on?" At length that hoary church weapon of the Dark Ages, "civil laws" so often employed to settle unknowable, unreasonable and un-Christian theological mysteries, resultant from a disregard of the plain command of God, appears in view, and with the air of a satisfied man, you exclaim, "manifestly the only way to secure the general observance of one day was to enact civil laws."

Do you not see that in this you charge God with commanding the observance of a Sabbath, under penalty of death, and then leaving men to guess which day of the week the Sabbath falls on? When thus left to themselves, you admit that utter confusion will follow, so much so that "the only way to secure the general observance of any day was to enact civil laws." You charge God with being the author of confusion, but Paul says "God is not the author of confusion."

You say the fourth commandment leaves every man free to choose his own sabbath, and then you immediately state that "the utter impracticability of such a plan and the entire destruction of any sabbath at all, is apparent to the feeblest intellect." In this you charge God with "utter impracticability," "the entire destruction of any sabbath," and with possessing an intellect feeler than the "feeblest intellect."

You say for "every man to choose his own day to suit his own religious views," would be to leave every man the divine appointing of his own sabbath," which course you declare would result in "the entire destruction of any sabbath." Since God, according to your views of his Sabbath commandment, has not decided which day of the week he desires observed as the Sabbath, who, I ask, shall decide? You answer, Not the individual, for that would leave every man free to "choose his own day to suit his own religious views." This you refuse to tolerate for a moment, since it would leave every man "the divine appointing of his own sabbath." If God has not divinely appointed any day as the Sabbath and the individual is not allowed to choose his own day to suit his own religious views, who shall do it for him? You answer, the civil government must have the "divine appointing" of the Sabbath.

This makes the State divine and is the view held by pagan Rome eighteen hundred years ago, against which Christ sent forth his disciples to battle, with the words, "Render therefore unto Cesar the things which are Cesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." But the old pagan idea of government is not the American idea. The American idea is that the State, instead of being invested with divinity, by virtue of which it can interpret the divine will, create sabbaths, make and unmake gods for the people, is, itself, a creation "of the people, by the people, and for the people." The civil government has no more right to "divinely appoint" sabbath days and the manner of their observance, than to compel the people to be baptized.

That every man has a right to "choose his own day to suit his own religious views" is one of the pillars upon which the American Government rests. The historian, Bancroft, bears testimony to this truth in the following words: "No one thought of vindicating religion for the conscience of the individual until a voice in Judea . . . enjoined to render unto Cesar only that which is Cesar's. Vindicating the right of individuality even in religion, and in religion above all, the new nation dared to set the example of accepting in its relations to God the principle first divinely ordained of God in Judea." No, friend Miller, your ideas of the relation of the individual to the State are essentially pagan, and belong to the age of heathen oratice, human sacrifices, and wooden gods.

Again, let us examine your position from another point of view. You say the commandment "does not indicate what day of the week that rest day, or Sabbath, shall fall on." If the commandment does not indicate what day is the Sabbath, God intended it should not, and what right, then, have you to indicate which day is the Sabbath of the commandment by your "civil laws"? It is your place to obey God and not to legislate for him.

You declare that this commandment is indefinite, and that the "only way" to make it definite "is to enact civil laws." To show you the absurdity of your position, I will write these "civil laws" as an amendment to the commandment, as follows:

> Provided that the expression "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and "the Lord . . . rested the seventh day, wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it, shall not be so construed as to teach that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," or that God "rested the seventh day," or that he "blessed the seventh day and hallowed it," but on the contrary, the expression "the seventh day is the Sabbath" and similar expressions, shall be so construed as to teach that the first day commonly called Sunday is the Sabbath in the meaning of this statute.
>
> Provided further that all those who refuse to accept this interpretation of the fourth commandment, shall be placed in the chain-gang and worked on the common highway, until such time as they are willing to submit to this manifest meaning of the commandment.

When God gave this commandment with his own voice amid the awful grandeur of Sinai, he could have added this amendment if he had so desired, but the Word states, "These words the Lord spake unto all the assembly in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness with a great voice; and he added no more." And the reason why he added no more is, because he wanted no more added; for he says, "If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book."

Again hoping that you may see the absurdity of your position, I am

Your friend,

A. F. BALLENGER.

To the foregoing letter the following reply was received. It needs no comment. However, the reader is asked to examine the correspondence carefully, and note that the editor of the Carriage World, failing to find argument with which to silence his correspondent, yearns for the argument of the Dark Ages,—"some legal way whereby such seditious persons . . . could be restrained as dangerous to the welfare of the community and the public at large."

The reader will also notice that a defense of the divine law, as spoken by God himself, is regarded as "open defiance of law, both of God and men," and he who is loyal to the grand constitutional guarantee of religious liberty, bequeathed to us by such men as Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Roger Williams, is to-day, according to the Sunday-law advocate, "a traitor at heart, plotting against the best interests of free America."

Cincinnati, Ohio, Jan. 25, 1893.

MR. A. F. BALLENGER,

Chicago, Ill.

Dear Sir: Your letter of January 23rd, like the others, is a hodge-podge of inconsistencies. But it is not worth your while to try to convince me of the correctness of your views. You are trying to show simply, that there ought not to be any Sabbath as all. You are trying to prove that the Lord appointed Saturday as the Sabbath day, but you have most signally failed in doing it.

You have tried to prove that you have the right to disobey the laws of our country and to incite others to do so. You have failed to make a case. You have tried to show that you are interfered with in your religious freedom, but you have failed to show it.

You have tried to show that the most benignant government that men ever lived under is a despotic one, and because its laws cannot be broken with impunity, and the bulwark of religious freedom in this country,—our Sabbath laws,—destroyed, that you have a reason for branding it as equal in its spirit of darkness to that of the old Roman Empire.

You act as if you did not know that you are a traitor at heart, plotting against the best interests of free America. You talk about bigotry; but there is no bigot equal to yourself.

You talk about wickedness, but there is none equal to your open defiance of law, both of God and men.

You talk about "converting" men from error; you hypocrite, "first cast out the beam out of your own eye, then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of your brother's eye."

You have shown your ignorance about the commonest principles of government, religious toleration, and Christianity.

You quote my words and twist them to mean contrary to their plain sense; you even falsify them. You do not wish to know the truth. You love darkness rather than light.

Your mind is warped and you can not discern between the good and the evil. You make God a liar, by misquoting scripture, and attaching meanings to it which no person in his right senses could possibly attach. The very crimes which you charge upon others, you are guilty of yourself in a magnified degree. There are but two excuses which can account for your attitude. You are either crazy or desperately wicked; and there ought to be some legal way whereby such seditious persons as you are could be restrained, as dangerous to the welfare of the community and the public at large.

Yours,

D. W. MILLER,

(Editor Carriage World.)
