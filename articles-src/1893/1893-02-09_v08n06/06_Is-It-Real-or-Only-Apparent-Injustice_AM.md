IN its issue of Dec. 16, 1892, the Apostolic Guide, published at Louisville, Ky., has the following:—

> It is certainly to be deplored that a few Adventists in this great Republic, should, under the statute regulating the observance in Tennessee of the civil Sabbath, be forced to pay the fine attached to such violation of law. It does appear to outrage justice when for the violation of one law and that in no way affecting the offender's moral integrity, he must wear a ball and chain with negroes convicted of heinous crimes. This hardship assumes the most aggravated appearance, when, according to the Constitution of both Tennessee and the United States, the religious convictions of every man are to be respected and protected.

Does it only "appear to outrage justice, when, for the violation of one law, and that in no way affecting the offender's moral integrity, he must wear a ball and chain with negroes convicted of heinous crimes"? Is it not, indeed, an injustice to put men, who are acknowledged to be honest, upright citizens, in the chain-gang? This hardship does, indeed, assume "the most aggravated appearance, when, according to the Constitution of both Tennessee and the United States, the religious convictions of every man are to be respected and protected." But the day has passed when the rights of men are to be respected in this country. Ignominy has taken the place of respect, that is, to those who do not follow the majority in the keeping of Sunday. Freedom no longer reigns, only for the Sunday-keeper. Keeping Sunday is the test of good citizenship. A man may be ever so good, but if he does not keep the Sunday he is a disgrace to society, and is punished in the same way as those who have committed heinous crimes. Is this justice?

This language must sound strange to loyal Americans, but it is true, nevertheless. Freedom is gone. This is no longer a "land of the free," but a despotic land. The minority have no rights, or if they have, they are not respected. They must suffer because they follow the dictates of their own consciences; because they keep the Sabbath according to the fourth commandment. The State has no right to say how a man shall worship God. It cannot do this, for only God knoweth the heart, and he alone can judge in such matters.

But the Guide evidently justifies the State in passing Sunday laws, for it says further:—

> The abolition of the Sabbath, or Lord's day, will abolish moral instruction. The abolition of moral instruction will ruin the State. The issue, therefore, resolves itself into the balancing of the injury inflicted upon a few men who hold to the observance of the Sabbath against that inflicted upon the whole State. It is better for a few Adventists to suffer, than for the whole State to break to pieces by the complete deservation of the day.

By "Sabbath, or Lord's day" the Guide, of course, means Sunday. Has the State anything to do with the teaching of morality? The State is a civil institution, the Sabbath a religious. Can the State rightly pass laws compelling men to rest on the Sabbath? Or can it be rightly argued that because the State can not exist without moral instruction, therefore, laws must be passed to make men religious, and to compel them to rest on Sunday? Religion is a matter between man and his God, and not between man and the State. Jesus taught this when he was on earth, in the injunction, "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."

Were not the apostles justified when they were brought before the rulers and refused to stop preaching Christ and him crucified when commanded to do so? Or the three Hebrews, years before that, when they refused to worship the image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up? If not, why did God deliver them from the burning fiery furnace? Would he have delivered them had they been doing wrong, something contrary to his will? Has God changed since then? Because man has set up a day in opposition to His Sabbath, and made a law compelling men to worship on that day and rest upon that day, and some refuse to obey, does God say it is right now to forsake his commandments and obey man any more than he did years ago?—I think not, for he is unchangeable.

It would be just as wrong to keep both the first and the seventh day, as it would have been for the three Hebrews to have formally worshiped the image of Nebuchadnezzar. The Adventists in Tennessee, as well as elsewhere, have a perfect right to work on Sunday so long as it does not interfere with the peace of others, and they are justified in the sight of God in doing so.

Sunday is not the Sabbath, and therefore if men choose to keep the seventh day and work on the first, they have a perfect right to do so. No man can, of right, compel them to rest on the first day as well as the seventh. Or even if Sunday were the Sabbath, the State would have no right to say that all must rest on that day because the Decalogue says so. As soon as the State interferes in such matters, persecution begins. It always has been so; it always will be so. It was that which brought about the persecution in the Dark Ages, when millions of martyrs were slain in all the cruelest ways that could be invented. It was that which brought about the Inquisition; and that same thing will come again if the State interferes in such matters, because human nature is the same now as then.

The Guide says: "It is better for a few Adventists to suffer than for the whole State to break to pieces by the complete desecration of the day." If this is true, then it was right for Caiaphas to say, when Christ was on the earth: "It is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not." But it is no wonder that the same thing should be said of the followers of Christ, for we find him saying in John 15:20, "If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you."

Has the Guide an appropriate name? Apostolic! Did the apostles teach such things as this paper teaches? Would not a better, a more appropriate name, be "Pharisaic Guide?" The apostles entreated men to turn to the Lord. They did not use force. If the whole Nation were compelled by civil law to serve God, there would not be one more true Christian than there is now. The State would have all its time taken up in punishing men, but it would make them no better; they would still do evil, for they could not help it. They are evil by nature and nothing short of the Spirit of God can change that nature. Why is it that men can not see this, and use the means that Christ and his apostles used, to bring men to God? It would be better to have a few Christians, than to have a whole Nation of hypocrites, for that is what a State-bolstered religion would make.
