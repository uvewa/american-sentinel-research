I HAVE read with interest the review of Judge Hammond's opinion in the King case, in one of the publications of the Religious Liberty Association. I want to express my hearty approval of the spirit, the truthfulness and the logic of the criticism of the opinion of the court.

Christianity is founded on the teachings of Christ and animated by his Spirit. Theology is only the opinions of men formulated into church creeds and confessions of faith. Theology is not Christianity. Christ being infallible, there must, of necessity, be a perfect unity in Christianity. The want of this unity in theology demonstrates the fact that theology is not Christianity. Those who assail the Bible assail it as interpreted in church creeds and confessions of faith, and assuming that theology is Christianity, the assault is made on theology in fact and only on Christianity in name. But the world, accepting the proposition assumed as true—that theology is Christianity—is easily misled and deceived. This is the fortress of skepticism and the misfortune of the cause of Christianity, and the sooner this truth is recognized and appreciated, the better it will be for all concerned. Church creeds had their origin in a civil and religious despotism, in which Church and State were united, and the power of the civil government was wielded to enforce the decrees of the council, which was assembled for the single purpose of enforcing the will of the majority, regardless of the conscientious convictions of the minority. And with wonderful unanimity the churches have adhered to the beliefs formulated in this quasi-religious assembly, for nearly eighteen hundred years, in the face of all the facts and circumstances surrounding and influencing the action of the men who held the controlling power in the Council of Nice and succeeding councils of the Church. The duty of all men to reverence, if not worship, the Creator is recognized. But the Church is dogmatic. It demands that all men shall believe, and believe as the particular Church believes, or else stand debarred of all church privileges and denied the right to call themselves Christians. I am to believe something that somebody else believes, regardless of my own convictions, or I am not permitted to believe at all. This is slavery in its worst and most degrading form and is enforced in the name of Christianity. I believe that the constitution and laws of every country should embody the principles of Christianity and that this is essential to good government. But when a government undertakes to say what Christianity is and enforces its convictions as represented by the majority in the State or national legislative assembly, such government does not embody the fundamental principles of Christianity, which appealing to the consciences of men leave each and every one free to choose for himself.

I believe in what is known as the Christian Sabbath. This is my conviction and I do not suppose I will ever change my opinion on this question. Now, if I happen to stand with the majority to-day and demand the enactment of a law embodying my belief as to the Sabbath, and the time comes when I stand with the minority, and the majority holds that another day is the proper day to be kept as the Sabbath, and embody its belief in a penal statute, what can I say? This is the crucial test of the right or wrong of legislation on questions of this character. If I can not keep two days, but keep the one my conscience approves I am a criminal, and if I keep the one enforced by law I am a hypocrite; and if I can afford to keep the two days, in the keeping of one I am a hypocrite; so in any case I am forced into the position of being either a criminal or a hypocrite. This is the logic of the proposition that the Government has the right to legislate on questions of religious belief. This is a matter with which governments can not deal. It is violation of the underlying principles of our Government that all power is inherent in the people, and that all the powers of government are derivative. To suppose that the power of the Government is above the conscience of the people is to leave the Government nothing to rest upon as a foundation, and without recuperative force, for this must come from the people, and a people without liberty of conscience is a people without power.

It is an axiomatic truth with us that all just governments derive their power from the consent of the governed. This is pre-eminently the American idea of government, distinguishing it from all other governments in the world—ancient or modern.

If in the matter of civil government the public conscience is higher than the government, is it reasonable to be supposed that such a government is clothed with a power to deal with questions of religious belief? To ask this question is to answer it. The truth is, the American theory of government—the separation of Church and State—necessarily involves the idea of the absolute freedom of the individual from governmental control in the matter of his or her religious belief. This is the American theory of government, and any departure is dangerous.
