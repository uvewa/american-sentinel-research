As is perfectly natural, in connection with the enforcement of Sunday observance by law, the question of the imposition of civil penalties for blasphemy is now receiving increased attention. It is in the logical sequence of events that this should be so.

Foreign dispatches say of England:—

> Some time ago the suggestion was made in one of the London newspapers that a society should be formed to suppress the growing evil and scandal of street profanity. It was generally admitted that English towns were disgracefully pre-eminent in the matter of cursing and swearing in public places, and that English street loafers possessed probably the foulest mouths in all Christendom. The proposal came to nothing for various reasons, one of which was that it would be as unpopular and dangerous to interfere with the English workmen's privilege to curse whenever he felt that way inclined as to meddle with his right to get drunk. This week it has been tardily discovered that the statute book actually contains an act, passed in the reign of George II, "for the suppression of profanity," and the law was put in force on last Wednesday at Wisbeach. The act is delightfully comprehensive, the only defect being the absence of a schedule of oaths and an appraisement of their comparative wickedness. Penalties are imposed according to the social position of offenders. The scale is one shilling per oath when uttered by a laborer, two shillings when the sinner is above a laborer and under the degree of a gentleman, and five shillings when spoken by any one above the degree of gentleman. The punishment is applicable whether the offense be committed in the public streets or in a man's own house, which seems somewhat restrictive of the liberty of the subject and opens up possibilities of domestic complications.

> The Wisbeach case, however, was perfectly simple. The prisoner uttered four wicked words in a public street, and, being a mere laborer, he was ordered to pay a shilling for each oath and thirteen shillings costs.

It is upon this same ancient authority that the statutes and ordinances upon the subject of blasphemy and profanity, in the several States of this country, are based. They can, in every case, be traced directly back to this English statute. If, while the English law was dead, it could still have such life as it has had in this country, how much more activity will now be given to it,—now that it is resurrected in England.

In Germany this subject comes up for legislative action; of that country the foreign dispatches say in this regard:—

> Among the measures with which the Imperial German Parliament will be called upon to deal in the course of the present session is a bill for the abolition of paragraph 166 of the penal code, which makes blasphemy punishable by three years' imprisonment with hard labor. Neither in Belgium, Italy, Holland nor France is it considered necessary to make blasphemy a penal offense, and, indeed, the only three countries of any importance where the offense is still regarded as a crime are Austria, Great Britain and Germany. In England the acts of 1661 and of 1695 have never till this day been repealed, and the New York Tribune says that prosecutions for blasphemy have been pretty numerous during the present century. It is, however, impossible to deny that the time has gone when blasphemy could be regarded as a penal offense. The question has become more one of public order and decency than of right of judgment. In Germany, where the present political maneuvers on the part of the emperor, in connection with the military bill, may lead to a possible ascendancy of the ultramontane party, the repeal of the law is particularly urgent. For when once the ultramontanes are in power there is nothing, as the law now stands, to prevent them from sending to prison for three years with hard labor any person who should venture to speak ironically of the latter-day miracles of the Roman Catholic Church.

This German law against blasphemy may be modified, it will not be repealed. That would be contrary to the inevitable progress of the present course of worldwide legislation for the enforcement of accepted religion. It will be seen that this paragraph marks the fact that in Germany the contest is, as so lately shown here in the congressional hearings upon Sunday opening of the World's Fair, between Protestantism and Catholicism for supremacy in the State.

Just as, in this country, the Protestants are now willing to give up Government appropriations for Indian schools entirely, in order that Roman Catholics may be shut out from sharing in the public treasury, so in Germany they are willing to reduce the efficiency of their law against blasphemy because of a use to which it may be put in the enforcement of Roman Catholicism. It does not occur to them that by this they impeach the law. No law against which such an indictment can be brought has any place in the statute books of any people. But laws against blasphemy and profanity are in the statute books. It is in the logical sequence that active agitation for their enforcement should now arise.
