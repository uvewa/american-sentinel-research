Under the Constitution of the United States, as lately construed by the Supreme Court, Congress possesses the same despotic power of the intellectual contents of all communications, written or printed, open or under seal, which pass through the mail, that was exercised at the end of the middle ages in Europe.

In the judgment lately rendered in the freedom-of-the-press cases (In re Rapier, In re Dupre, 143 U. S., 110-135), the first in which the rights of the press under the Federal Constitution were ever presented for adjudication, it was held that the limitation in the First Amendment, which expressly provides that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech or of the press," does not restrain the autocratic power of that body to look into the contents of all documents passing through the mail, and to exclude all, when the ideas which they seek to disseminate are "condemned by its judgment." The Federal Government has the right "to refuse the facilities for the distribution of matter deemed injurious by Congress to public morals;" it may decline "to become an agent in the circulation of printed matter which it regards as injurious to the people." Congress may refuse "to assist in the dissemination of matters condemned by its judgment, through the governmental agencies which it controls."

It is thus clearly and curtly declared that Congress may exclude from the mail every document, public or private, political, religious, or social, whenever the ideas or principles which it seeks to disseminate are "condemned by its judgment," "as injurious to the people." The only restriction that rests upon this newborn despotism is that Congress can not "prevent the transportation in other ways, as merchandise, of matter which it excludes from the mails." The court holds that the Constitution guarantees to the people no right whatever to disseminate their ideas through the only agency which Congress controls. It is one of the most remarkable episodes in our judicial history.

In the Constitutional Convention of 1787 no special limitation for guarding freedom of speech and of the press was inserted in the Constitution, simply because it was by the majority deemed unnecessary. But as soon as it was settled that amendments embodying a bill of rights were to be added, five States proposed, in as many different forms, the suggestion out of which grew the clause of the First Amendment, which expressly forbids Congress, by name, from making any law "abridging the freedom of speech or of the press." Thus was this vital provision set in the forefront of our national bill of rights.

The meaning of this provision was then known to all men, even to the judges. It was understood as denying to Congress that kind of political censorship which had passed away from the Crown and the Parliament of England a century before; as denying to the judges that kind of judicial censorship which Mansfield had vainly struggled to uphold; and as a guarantee to every American citizen, so far as the Federal Government was concerned, of the right to speak or write what he pleased, subject only to the censorial power which resides in juries alone. . . .

If the decision lately made by the Supreme Court—to the effect that all communications may be arbitrarily excluded from the mail when the ideas they embrace are "deemed injurious by Congress to the public morals"—be a sound one, then at its next session Congress may amend the act against immoral literature by incorporating into it a black list of all the books and papers which have passed under the ban of its censorial judgment, and this may include the New Testament alongside of the works of Voltaire.—*North American Review*.
