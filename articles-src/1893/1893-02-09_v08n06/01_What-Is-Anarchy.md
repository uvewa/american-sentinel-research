WHAT is anarchy? Who are anarchists? These are pertinent questions just now, but they are not all equally pertinent. Most particularly are they apt at this moment because the cry of "Anarchy!" has been raised in almost every congressional committee room. Shrewd and quick-witted men saw their opportunity to manufacture a catchword, a campaign cry, a party shield, and they took it. They not only raised the shout then, but they have echoed and re-echoed it in the public press throughout the country.

In the last hooting before the recent closing of the World's Fair, before the House Committee, a far-seeing woman, of clear intellect and unprejudiced mind, read the Sunday-closing George a lecture which stung him to the quick. This attempt to insult by retaliation by misrepresenting to congressmen and to the country at large, a striking sentence from her address, upon which they thought it possible to fasten a misinterpretation. The very fact that an enormous effort has been made to give publicity to a false construction, which they have put on this sentence, signifies much. It means that an unwelcome truth was brandished, which they must cover up at any cost, by every device.

Bare reception of the false hue which they have thrown upon this sentence will clearly show their animus. In the report of the hearing in the *Political Dissenter,* Rev. H. H. George says:—

"Mrs. Boynton was at one of the hearings at the city of Chicago, and 'if the gates of the Exposition be closed on Sunday there may be justifiable cause for the planting of the red flag in the streets of Chicago.' She was asked to bow that she had announced the tiger, she tried to modify but the reporters said she had voiced the real sentiment that lay behind the organization, and that anarchy underlaid every red handed, murderous sentiment to

Shall Christian America rule America? or shall infidel foreigners and anarchistic socialists rule it? Certainly it little dreaming how furious a bomb it is; certainly, she had drawn the lambskin from off the dragon.

THE same incident is thus reported in the *Christian Statesman,* of January, 1893, Brooklyn, N. Y.:—

America threw up their hands in pious horror. The Washburns, Mrs. Smyth, and Mrs. I. E. Wilson and the whole of them were nonplussed when Mrs. Boynton, of Chicago, made that startling remark. The people gathered in the committee room were stunned for the time being. "Shut the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday and we will give just the cause for the red flag to be raised in the streets of Chicago." This was pronounced with a loud "thus saith" from a brave heart.

On the plea of apologizing for this startling remark to Mr. Boynton, a few moments time in a so afterwards to take the speaker the position she signifies of anarchist. To this Mrs. Boynton, replying, giving entirely the true bearing of her remark:—

But that is just what it is to their interest to consider an occasion to its maxim of life.

THE NEW YORK *Independent,* as wise and just as that is supposed to wish to be in all its relations, said editorially:—

In the hearing on the Sunday Closing Repealer, on Thursday, one of the women sent from Chicago for or by behalf of the movement against opening, the ground, the flag would again appear in the streets of Chicago. Some persons use this as indicating that the advocates of Sunday closing are at fault the part of Congress would be a just reason for the waving of the red flag. This, we say, it was a very foolish remark, and most unfortunately a very indefensible of Sunday opening. Certainly Congress can not be blamed.

Was it a foolish remark? Perhaps those who tell will believe it was or not. But immediate events may prove that as this startling presentiments was observed in those words, and that it would be well indeed legislators and people to hand heed warning.

THREE quotations are enough to show to what sense her opponents wish Mrs. Boynton's words to be taken. She herself explained that she was a resident of Chicago, and had seen the red flag in the streets. She knew only too well its meaning. Her words were the very antithesis of an invitation to flaunt in, or a threat that it would flaunt. They were a warning and an appeal against doing that which might cause dreaded anarchy to again run riot. Has the implication of this unwholesome and unheeded warning been fully shown by immediate events, or not? Ask Dean Hart, of Denver. He will tell you whether or no the interference of the civil in the Sunday contributions of this people has provoked sufficient cause for violence or not. It will not offer to you the thousands of excited and riotous shopkeepers who, when excluded, at the instigation, from their short-handed Sunday night entertainment, surrounded buildings, cottage, broke in his doors and windows, and drove him to in nearly besides and a fled home to escape personal injury.

He will say, Your question needs no reply; facts speak louder than words of counsel will have his opinion, whether he will tell it you or not, as to how "very foolish a remark" Mrs. Boynton's warning was.

If Dean Hart's own testimony is not enough, let the absorbing headlines of some of the newspapers speak for it. Here it is from a Denver paper of January 1:—

"Rev. Dean Hart, of Denver, Colorado, stomped from his pulpit to violence;" "doors smashed in, from the beginning of a desperate conflict;" "Bodily riot in Denver;" "A mob nearly approach the streets, breaking of, Dean Hart's house mobbed;" "A mob nearly surrounds the Duke's Dean's residence with sticks and stones;" "He [Dean Hart] of his grave snatched;"—"clashing down the Taber and Wolcott buildings," etc., etc.

The crusader against Sunday amusements perhaps now begins to feel that a better method of the getting of Mrs. Boynton's as well-timed warning!

What is applicable to those who will so blindly or stubbornly misconstrue and misconstrue her well-timed and red and marvel connect. Let this conduct be considered, and let it be asked whether it be "wise statesmanship" to give cause for such does on what, or whether it be wiser statesmanship to escape the untoward result by avoiding the cause.

ANARCHY is that condition of society in which there is no supreme power. Has this country which was supreme? There has. The Constitution has held supreme power from the first. But that supremacy does not now exist. The Constitution has been set aside. First in the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity, and of Congress in the passage of the World's Fair Sunday-closing proviso have effectively destroyed the supreme power laid. While the question of supremacy is at stake there is no supreme authority. What has brought about this condition? What is the basis to be applied to mold a new supremacy? "Anarchy" is the cry of those Republicans for those who have brought about the condition; this is the best appellation for those who have brought it about.

That our Constitution, as it stands, does not authorize the enforcement of Sunday laws or any other religious laws is not directly adopted, attaching by the *Public Advertiser,* of Portland, published December, of February 1. The editors of that paper, following the lead of the *Christian Statesman,* furnished the logical fallacy for this movement ever since the beginning. They have not been in harmony with the Constitution, and are always religion, that they are not in harmony with the Constitution, and are therefore the fundamental law of the land must be changed. This they have openly sought from the first. Those who have been in harmony with the Constitution, as the State of Illinois, and then Illinois sent it to question and defy the Constitution. And then the State of Illinois would be able to make out a strong case. Congressional religion was in behalf of the Christian Sabbath, and the powers of Congress. Congressional religion on behalf of the Christian Sabbath, or any other Christian institution, is to the Constitution, our Nation, has no adequate legal basis under the Constitution.

In its decision that this is a Christian Nation, the Supreme Court itself declares that the Constitution does not repeal the First Amendment, did not to make Christianity a part of the law. The Supreme Court virtually said: When had amendments been added, had been repealed, in the meantime we shall ignore the Constitution. The laws now take supremacy in question and the supremacy passes to defacto, for that there is no law in this country other than that of a society in which there is no supreme power. What is the correct cause to apply to such a condition of society?

Such occurrences as this widest outlawry, does not this measure conflict as an attempt to enforce illegitimate law. In the respect of illegitimate authority, are you in favor of the constitutional principle? Are they anarchists who are wrongful and attempt to overthrow such a law and reach the ears reach of the enforcement of illegitimate legislation? They do not. What is anarchy? And who are anarchists?
