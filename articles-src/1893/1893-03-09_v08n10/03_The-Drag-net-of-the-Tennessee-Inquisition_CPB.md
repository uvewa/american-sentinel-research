LITTLE by little the iniquity of the Tennessee inquisition is being revealed, and the more light that is thrown upon it the worse it looks. The Statutes of Tennessee provide that when an offense has been committed against the laws of the State, and the same comes to the knowledge of the court, and no one appears to prosecute the offender, the court may appoint the attorney-general, of the judicial district in which the offense was committed, prosecutor ex-officio, to secure indictments against the person or persons supposed to have committed the offense.

When Attorney-General Lewis entered upon the duties of his office about a year ago, he was importuned by a number of citizens to prosecute the Adventists for Sunday work, under the decision of the Supreme Court making it a nuisance to do common labor or business upon the first day of the week. No one was willing, however, to appear as prosecutor, although the offense charged was maintaining a public nuisance; because as they said, "The Adventists are good neighbors and we do not want to offend them!"

But the attorney-general was equal to the emergency. He secured the names of "the five leading members of the Adventist Church" in Henry County, and then got the Grand Jury to sign a petition to the circuit judge praying that he (the attorney-general) should be appointed to prosecute these men against whom their neighbors were ashamed to appear. General Lewis received the necessary authority; hence the prosecutions last summer.

But that did not, as Mr. Lewis supposed it would do, put a stop to the Sunday work. The Adventists were still determined to obey that part of the commandment which says, "Six days shalt thou labor," and so they continued to work on Sunday after having kept "the Sabbath-day according to the commandment." Then the attorney-general determined to crush them at one blow, and so, getting together the names of several of the male members of the Adventist Church in Henry County, he again secured a petition from the Grand Jury asking the Court for authority to prosecute the parties named, and, for fear any should escape, "many other persons to the Grand Jury unknown." Judge Swiggart signed the order for the inquisitorial drag-net, and indictments were found against seventeen persons, eleven of them Adventists; the others being negro laborers on one of the railroads running through the county.

But when the indictments were examined and compared with the order of the Court for the prosecution of the supposed offenders, it was found that the names in the former did not correspond with those given in the latter. For instance, in the order, the attorney-general was directed to secure an indictment against W. D. Ward, but this man, if any such exists, was not indicted; indictments were found, however, against W. G. Ward, Harry Ward and Rufus Ward. The order also contained the name of — Wilson. Upon this very indefinite authority, which would apply as well to one Wilson as to another, indictments were found against John A. Wilson and Charles Wilson. In like manner, the name, — Bollman appeared in the order, and he, she, or it was duly indicted, and the attorney-general has doubtless pocketed, ere this, $2.50 for the service, but no arrest has yet been made upon this indictment. Other like cases there were, but the writer has not the names at hand.

All the indictments upon which arrests had been made, but which did not correspond with the order directing the attorney-general to secure indictments, were quashed upon motion of the attorneys for the defense; the judge holding that he could not confer any such wholesale authority, as it was the evident intent of the statute, that the attorney-general should be appointed prosecutor ex-officio only in certain well-defined cases. It seems probable that His Honor signed the order simply upon the request and representation of the attorney-general without so much as reading it, for while it is very possible that the attorney was ignorant of the law, it does not seem probable that Judge Swiggart was not familiar with the practice of the courts of Tennessee in such cases.

Such are, briefly, the facts in regard to these cases, as learned right on the ground by the writer. They simply afford additional evidence that the prosecution of Adventists in Tennessee is religious persecution.

It is related of the cruel Emperor Adrian that on one occasion when one of his governors wrote to him concerning certain charges against the Christians, he replied, saying, "If the people of the province will appear publicly, and make charges against the Christians, so as to give them an opportunity of answering for themselves, let them proceed in that manner only, and not by rude demands and mere clamors. If any thus accuse them," he continued, "and show that they have committed any offense against the laws, do you decide according to the nature of the offense. But, by Hercules!" exclaimed the impetuous emperor, "if the charge be a mere calumny, do you estimate the enormity of the offense, and punish the calumniator as he deserves."

Such was the command of a heathen emperor, but such is not the law of a professedly Christian commonwealth. As we have seen, the law of Tennessee provides a secret inquisition before which secret charges may be made, the real accusers never being known, they appearing, if at all (and in these cases they have not appeared) simply as witnesses for the State. The charges are made in secret; the accusers never confront the accused; but their own brethren in the church and members of their own families are required to furnish the evidence upon which they are convicted. This is the manner in which the Adventists in Tennessee are prosecuted. None of their neighbors are willing to allow their names to be used as prosecutors; indeed nobody in the county is willing to appear in that capacity, except the attorney-general, and that for the reason that "the Adventists are good neighbors;" nevertheless, residents of the county to the number of forty, so General Lewis says, petitioned him to prosecute the Adventists for Sunday work and compel them to stop it.

Scores of white men in the county who are not Adventists, work on Sunday more regularly and more publicly than do the Adventists; but only the Adventists and a few negroes are prosecuted. As was remarked in these columns a week or two since, so far is the prosecution of these negroes from proving that the prosecution of the Adventists is not persecution, that any one who is acquainted with the status of the average colored laborer in the South will understand the added ignominy that it was expected to put upon the Adventists by condemning them to the chain-gang in the company of "niggers." A few people in the North may be deceived by this pretext, but it will only open the eyes of the people of the South to the enormity of the outrage which is being perpetrated upon an unoffending and conscientious people, by the authorities of Henry County, Tennessee.
