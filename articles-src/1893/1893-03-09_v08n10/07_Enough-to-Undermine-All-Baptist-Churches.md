The *Watchman,* Boston, Baptist, careful, and moderately conservative, gives some views concerning the charge to us which suggest that in advocating the Sundays we are violating the distinctive Baptist principles, of the separation of Church and State, that a word further upon the matter may be called for.

The defense of the *Watchman* is: "For one thing, we are not necessarily advocating religious legislation in advocating measures approved by religion. A measure may have both a religious and a secular aspect. The avails of Sunday are by no means of a wholly religious nature. Religion approves whatever is "incident." It is the source of true morality. But religion, as defined in the matter of legislation, and morals of service to God as distinct from those they owe to their fellow men, is a different matter. That is the issue in Sunday legislation. Society, for such reason, need not be denied, and moral, why men should be forbidden to work on Sunday. True, rest on Sunday rather than on Monday, unless fixed religiously, is because Sunday is to him, a religious day, and the religious day is different from other days."

The *Watchman's* second defense is: "We are not necessarily advocating religious legislation in advocating the course upon the statute books of legislation. The statute books contain measures upon, there is the direct interests of religion, and it makes no difference that they spring from motives which fail to justify them in religious relationship. We have to follow the same relation to with religious institution "practice, custom, or institution" say, since. They may be wise and equitable, though the reasons which led to their passage were such as led our fathers to enact them." But this historic argument is not to be set aside that easily, especially when sixty per cent. or more of the religion the Christian Sunday laws is boldly made in the interests of religion. The United States Senate became a theological convention when the discussion "are we not a Christian nation" was read from the Scriptures a theological last summer. The fourth command was like "bearing" "touching the repeal or modification" of a religious law is "theological convention." The supposed "secular side" of the fourth commandment, if the facts in the matter under consideration are correctly stated, such a man may be restrained from ordinary work, and he can be legally compelled to rest—on Sunday. No avoid creating of hypocritical observance.

The *Watchman* goes on: "Still further, the exercise of the power of civil government given legislation in advocating measures which promote the good of man as tends to good morality."

"This is also an evasion of the real issue. It is not the "good of man," as defined by the "good of man." It covers the entire range of man's relation to God: religious, social, intellectual and physical life. It is the province of civil law to regulate the

The *Watchman* does as well as can be done in seeking a middle ground between the Baptist position of "religious liberty and the Catholic theory of State-enforced religion." But one can easily read between the lines. Whoever may be accusing of championing an illogical position, it is not an advocate of "orthodox Baptist principles," nor of the biblical Christianity of the greatest commission, to make concession in this behalf, to God. There is fallacy enough in the *Watchman's* effort to undermine the entire citadel of Baptist doctrine. It could do better to leave the defense of Sunday legislation to those who do not believe that the Bible is the only rule of faith and practice for Christian men.—*Sabbath Recorder.*
