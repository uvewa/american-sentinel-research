THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, containing the "Solemn Protest and Remonstrance" adopted by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, should receive wide circulation. We hope that every reader will afford for this number at the regular rate of not under ten dollars per hundred, dollars per thousand, cheap-rate for special issues. ORDER IMMEDIATELY.

The information published in this issue is a document to which too much importance can not be attached. The matter is of the widest importance and the condition is pregnant with a tragic depth of import. The appeal is not based on the occasion either in manner or in matter. In loftiness of thought and dignity of expression the protest rises to the exigency of the great situation in public affairs which has called it forth. It is in itself, a protest, and a remonstrance for all the people. It should be spoken in the heart of every one.

Those who oppose the passage of Sunday laws, or desire the repeal of existing religious laws, are persistently accused by religious legislationists of acting from base motives. They say we object to the laws because they judge others by themselves. Their interests and aspirations are enlisted in behalf of Sunday; they, therefore, propose to compel all to serve their interests and aspirations with them. They are unable to conceive of any one acting from other motives: to find the true purpose of the indited is to compel them by law into giving up their religious observance; the intent of the seventh day observer is to coerce them into the observance of the seventh day. So different are conceptions of religious duty respecting Sabbath observance seems to be exerting. Even those who profess no religion have a true sense of justice to render this a grander nation than this. To the seventh day observer nothing could be more absurd, because than enforced seventh day observance. If greater legal blasphemy is possible than exist in Sunday laws it would be seventh-day laws.

At the term of Court which has just closed in Henry County, Tenn., so infamous were found for Sunday work. Speaker for the Adventist work on Sunday. Information has been received from reliable sources that it is probable no more prosecutions, on this charge, will occur here for more time at least. The only case now on the docket held to answer to the charges of Sunday labor is that of Thomas Dortch (Seventh-day Adventist) whose trial was laid over to the next term of court in the plea, made by the public prosecutor, of the absence of material witnesses. There is no especial evidence of any pronounced changes in the sentiment of the community except that the latest laws of justice and opposition to persecution which, until everywhere, has been developed and brought to the surface in this region also.

At the last hearing upon the Sunday closing of the World's Fair before the Breckenridge of the Columbian Exposition, position, had was thrown on the present situation. It was said that there was reason to believe that she had "experienced a change of heart" upon the subject, and was ready to confuse the imperative need of the closing of the grounds as governmental religion. The *Mail and Express* has lost no pains to secure Mr. Willard an expression directly upon that point. This is her letter, from London, of date Feb. 17, 1893:

*To the Editor of the Mail and Express:*

This is my most emphatic address and to all that any one has a right to go upon, and they ought to be rallied for its Sunday opening. It has been said that I have "changed my mind." But this I say, who have certainly done so much accord it. God be with you all.

FRANCES E. WILLARD.

I. P. S. I asked Mrs. F. Every passage of Christianity combine to make the conflict most acute, and while many excellent men and women upon the other side are loyal in the extreme, I am confident that any one who is for Elder Ridgeway in he is here our contestant here of the conflict have made him one more thoroughgoing Sabbatarian, more earnest than ever in his work.

P. S. I asked Mrs. F.

FRANCES E. WILLARD.

"I can read it. I want it with no united effort."

It would be better to stand for right, and justice, and truth, with true religion —neither to what it "stands" for as President of the W. C. T. U." with the "White Ribbon woman," and "with our society," in his view of Mrs. Willard's stronger language, which has shown a lamentable disposition to advocate Sunday rest in the superficial and false religion of State, and civil and cred and social, and sundry, it would not be well to expect. Mrs. Willard, in this letter, renews her profession of the false Sabbatism.

Matthew Saint Quay, United States Senator from the State of Pennsylvania, has advanced from the unenviable position of political trickster extraordinary, which he held one year ago, to that of censor and guardian of the national morals. As Chairman of the Committee on the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, the American Sabbath Union, and stands speaker for the religious legislation which has had in Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday. If these organizations were correct in their views of this legislation; and in the county, Mr. Quay and his unrighteousness would do all that stood between this Nation and divine wrath. The expiring flutter of the halo with which this Pennsylvania senator has surrounded his name during the session of Congress were seen on February 28, when, in the Senate, he presented

petitions asking that Congress forbid the use of any Government building for a religious festivities on Sunday, in view of the fact that it had been intended that the Marine Band should give a concert in the White House on Sunday night.

At this Preston of the Sunday closing of the inaugural ceremonies of President Cleveland. Mr. Quay opposed this on the ground it would be a "national sin," and presented in a resolution, a resolution, which was passed, calling on the Secretary of the Interior for information as to this inauguration matter.

THE "Sabbath Observance Bicycle Club, of Brooklyn," is said to be an established and organized fact. The object of the club, is, in its words, "to publish and to rebuke the increasing abuse of the Sabbath by bicyclists and to offer to counter-acting this influence a circle of friends whose standard of obligation should be "to keep the Lord and dishonor themselves." "The name is printed in the Constitution of the club as given. It is to be noted especially, such a name as this for a Bicycle Club for Sabbath Observance is obviously givenous; meanwhile, pliant to buildings and organizations in Roman Catholic countries. It is natural that it should be so engines, for the purpose the organization is to preserve and perpetuate the false sun worship and the Sunday Sabbath.

Resolved, Sections 5, 7, and 8, of the Sentinel, can still be had by ordering promptly. Numbers 5 and 6 containing a complete exposure to the trial of Seventh-day Sunday labor. The present issue, containing for the solemn and entire memorial for 14 also makes extra values and forwarded to the Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, in order to meet the reaching the several communities of this general reading public. It is hoped in time to those who came as a result to command a general distribution to the most earnest and people of the United States and the world, showing the principles of Seventh-day Adventists in communion with the recent developments. All orders should give the issue a wide circulation.

Wurtsman, the World's Fair is closed on Sunday or not, the *Signs of the Times* and the *Sabbath Recorder*—and if it is closed, that, as a religious question—and it is purely a religious question—in the case—the United States Government has nothing to do with the matter. The First Amendment to the Constitution absolutely forbids it.—*Signs of the Times.*

THE *New York World* characterizes the World's Fair Sunday closing movement as a "union of pious snobbery" and "hypocrisy of piety," "sustained by neither religion nor reason."
