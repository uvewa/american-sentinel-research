WHETHER the World's Fair is closed on Sunday or not, the Signs of the Times does not care a straw; but it does contend that, as a religious question—and it is none other from the A to the Z of the case—the United States Government has nothing to do with the matter. The First Amendment to the Constitution absolutely forbids it.—Signs of the Times.

THE NEW YORK World characterizes the World's Fair Sunday closing movement as a "satire upon sense" and a "parody of piety," "sustained by neither religion nor reason."
