On Thursday, February 23, at a session of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, assembled at Battle Creek, Mich., the resolutions reprinted below were unanimously adopted:—

Whereas, The Supreme Court of these United States, contrary to the principles upon which our Government was established, and contrary to its true character, has pronounced it to be a Christian Nation; and

Whereas, The Congress of the United States following in the same course that the Supreme Court has taken, has violated the Constitution, and invaded the domain of right of the individual citizen, upon the subject of religion, deciding a subject which is essentially religious, namely, the question of the observance of a day of rest as an institution, in the matter of closing the World's Fair on Sunday; therefore—

*Resolved,* That we do hereby submit to the country and people of the United States our solemn appeal and remonstrance:—

As Christians, we appeal on the ground of the divine right which Jesus Christ has recognized and established, the right of every man to be a free man; from the words and the religion of Christ, in the words, "if any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."

As Protestants, we appeal on the ground of the historical right to protest against every interference of the civil power with matters of religion; the solemn charter of Protestantism, the Augsburg Confession, declares:—

"The civil administration is occupied about other things than the Gospel. The magistrate does not defend the soul, but the bodies, and bodily things, against manifest injuries, and constrains men by the sword and corporal punishment, that it may uphold civil justice and peace." "The power of the ecclesiastical power has its own commission, to preach the Gospel and to administer the sacraments." "It is not lawful for the Bishop to erect or institute anything contrary to the Gospel, as... it not transfer worldly kingdoms; ... let not the keeping of the Sabbath-day ... be transferred to the keeping of the other day, as they judged is not of this world." —*Article XXVIII.*

As American citizens, we appeal on the ground of the specifically declared constitutional right to a free exercise of religion, without any interference of the individual conscience, totally free and unimpeded by any act or measure of legislation, finances, or control.

As men, we appeal on the ground of the natural right of mankind to render to the Creator and Lord of all, according to the dictates of each individual's own consciences, that tribute which is payable to him; which right now passes by virtue of the organic law of the land to every person; which was theirs before government was, and which is his after government may be dissolved; a government of all, which is in the interests of all, which gives to all, which is productive of good to all the citizens of civil society, and which would not, if it could, wrest from any human being another power on the earth, which they are each of them owed to none but God, by their right as men, created by the divine power.

And whether as Christians, or Protestants, as American citizens or men, the right of the religious liberty, always and everywhere, is "the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it."

This is our one appeal from the action of the Governments of the United States, and our expression of the principles upon which in the presentation of the action, we adopt (and adopt) the words of Madison, Jefferson, the Protestants, the Baptists, the Quakers and the other good people of other denominations who in and prior to the year 1787-9 began the establishment of the Republic as a government, constitutional and free.

We would expressly represent that the only proper function of the civil government is to protect all men of men in the present states of existence; to maintain civil order and peace; to protect every citizen in the exercise of his civil rights; and to restrain the vicious and criminal elements in every community; this right belongs to every individual. But religion, or the day and manner and means of worship or of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, and not by force or violence; the tribunal of the universal and individual Judge alone is adequate.

To illustrate and finally add, moreover, we beg leave to observe that, to judge for ourselves, especially in matters of religion, is a right which the claims of our own consciences is an inalienable right, which, the principles on which government was first projected, and this Republic was carried on, can never be surrendered to any human tribunal. The right of the exercise of religion no man's right is abridged by the institution of civil society; it is in its very nature an indefeasible right.

at large, much more is it exempt from the authority of the government. The latter is later the assumed and viceregent of the former. Do justice is both derivative and limited. It is limited with regard to the co-ordinate departments of the government, and most necessarily it is limited in regard to the constituents of the nation.

The preservation of free government requires that no department should exercise other powers than such departments of the governmental power be exercised by the same body of magistrates, than either of them be suffered to overlaps the great monopoly of all government by religious rulers. The rulers who are guilty of such encroachments exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are tyrants. The people who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves nor any authority derived from them, and are slaves.

It is proper to take alarm at this experimental course. We hold this prudent and salutary zeal to be the first duty of citizens, and the noblest characteristics of the American Revolution. The freeness of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled itself in precedents. They are the consequences in the principle, and avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere the lesson too much soon to forget it.

Such is the theory that no authority that can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, can give a preference to one particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other sects, and "each in the estimation of their own," and it is the established doctrine of the States to adjudge the right of preference among the sects; as not to establish the Christian faith, without creating a claim of infallibility, which would set us back to the Church of Rome. Who can see or see that the same authority that can require assent to Christianity as the national religion, say with the same propriety, require assent to each particular place and manner and religion; that the authority that can require the observance of "the Christian Sabbath," may by the same authority "practice, custom, or institution" say, since, in the practice and by the history and example, the authority which may require assent to Christianity, may require assent to Mohammedanism, or to any other religion which the shifting policy of legislation may in the future require. We maintain that there is no argument in favor of such a religion of the Christian which may not, with equal propriety, be pleaded for establishing the tenets of Mohammed or for those who believe in the tenets of Buddhism or any other religion by those who believe in such religion.

A daring abstract extreme contains has the equal establishment of "Christianity" been on trial. It has been tested. What has been its history? What have been its fruits? More or less in all the countries of Europe we have seen the fruits of such establishments of Christianity—national creed; clergy; ignorance and servility in the assembly of all the European governments, past and future. Inquiring of the teachers of Christianity, the fact that its only mark is its singular supremacy of power and honor, those of every sect will point to the time, before its incorporation with civil power, whether it be viewed in its first propagation or after its first corruption, as its brightest and happiest era.

On the other hand, what influence, in fact, have established religions had on civil society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of civil authority; in so many instances they have been seen upholding the throne of political tyranny. In no instance have they been seen the guardians of the liberties of the people. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate public liberty, needs them not. Such a government is best supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his religion, with the same equal hand which protects his person and property—by neither invading the equal rights of any sect or individual, nor suffering any

sect to invade those of another or of any individual.

1. This establishment of a national religion has in a sense this departure from that generous disposition of this Government which, offering an asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every race and every clime, promised to all a welcome and all the advantages of the age and the admixture of the world. What an immense melting pot for the fusing of races and generosity? Instead of holding forth an asylum to those of persecuting nations, it degrades itself to those of the governmental authority. Distant nations have in or their powers from the distinction they differ from is only in degree. In one it is the free choice, the other is its bar, in the name of innocence. Reconcile the magisterial malice suffered from the social excess a foreign government must view this action of our Government upon the subject of religion. However important and on earth so baron where he may be secure against this new discrimination.

3. Totally, the equal rights of every citizen to the free exercise of religion according to the dictate of the individual conscience is held by the same tenure as all other rights. If we are to vie in importance, it cannot be less dear to us. If we value our own, we ought to respect that of others, of those rights which pertain to the good people of our country, which can be enjoyed only by virtue of equal authority, but it is reserved with steadied and united efforts.

Either, then, we may say that the will of the legislature is the only measure of their authority; and that in the plenitude of this authority it may sweep away all our fundamental rights, or that it is bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred, because the right that the governmental authorities may contest the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, that they may despoit of our very right and have and country freedoms are not independently determined. The legislature of the United States has no authority to make the declarations and define in the category, and they have gone too far.

What then shall we say? The only thing that this legislature has done is to violate a right that man has no such authority; and in order that is consistent they have gone too far. Having now gotten a usurpation, we oppose it in this appeal and remonstrance.

We, therefore, as Christians, as Protestants, as American citizens, and as men, do appeal to the supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do in the name and by the authority of the natural rights of mankind, of the the constitution of the United States, of the history of of the great republic, and of the rights of the Christian and, solemnly publish and declare that this supreme act of legislation is in violation of the principle of all connection, direction, dictation, interference, intermeddling, or interposition of the government, in matters of religion or religious observance or enforcement; and for the support of this appeal and remonstrance, so far as earthly authority is concerned, we believe full right to the religion of the conscience to be established by the tribunal of heaven alone; and, according to the dictates of our own consciences here make our appeal.

And for the support of this appeal, remonstrance, and declaration, with firm reliance on the protection of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom the earth is the Lord's, and the world, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

To Christian manhood there is given a Christian duty, and for this the privilege to all. "The derivation of but a hair's breadth," may be safely taken to describe the super-structure of character however imposing it rises of itself. Themselves any self may overthrow the whole building, compromise included in the creative of things which spring from men's relation to each other; but it is not therefore the province of the State to dictate and enforce things which arise from men's relation to God.
