On Thursday, February 23, at a session of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, assembled at Battle Creek, Mich., the resolutions reprinted below were unanimously adopted:

WHEREAS, The Supreme Court of these United States, contrary to the principles upon which our Government was established, and contrary to the Constitution of the same, has declared this to be a Christian Nation; and

WHEREAS, The Congress of the United States following in the same course that the Supreme Court has taken, has violated the Constitution, and invaded the dearest rights of the people, by legislating upon the subject of religion, deciding a religious controversy, and establishing a religious institution, in the matter of closing the World's Fair on Sunday; therefore be it

Resolved, That we do hereby submit to the Government and people of the United States this our appeal and remonstrance:

As Christians, we appeal on the ground of the divine right which Jesus Christ has recognized and declared—the right of every man to dissent even from the words and the religion of Christ, in the words: "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." John 12:47.

As Protestants, we appeal on the ground of the historical right to protest against every interference of civil government in the affairs of religion; the grand charter of Protestantism, the Augsburg Confession declaring:

"The civil administration is occupied about other matters than is the gospel. The magistracy does not defend the souls, but the bodies, and bodily things, against manifest injuries, and coerces men by the sword and corporal punishment, that it may uphold civil justice and peace. Wherefore, the ecclesiastical power has its own command, to preach the gospel and administer the sacraments. Let it not by force enter into the office of another; let it not transfer worldly kingdoms; . . . let it not prescribe laws to the magistrate touching the form of the State; as Christ says, 'My kingdom is not of this world.'—Article XXVIII.

As American citizens, we appeal on the ground of the specifically declared constitutional right to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of the individual conscience, totally free and exempt from all governmental connection, interference, or control.

As men, we appeal on the ground of the natural right of mankind to render to the Creator such homage and such only as each believes to be acceptable to him; which right men possess by virtue of being men, and not by virtue of government; which was theirs before government was, and which would be theirs though there were no earthly government at all; which is their own, in the essential meaning of the term; which is precedent to all the claims of civil society, and which would be the same to each man though there were not another person on the earth; which they do not hold by any sub-infeudation, but by direct homage and allegiance to the Owner and Lord of all.

And whether as Christians, as Protestants, as American citizens, or as men, what we mean by religion, always and everywhere, is, "the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it."

Finally, in this our appeal from this action of the Government of the United States, and our remonstrance against the principle, and all the consequences of the action, we adopt (and adapt) the words of Madison, Jefferson, the Presbyterians, the Baptists, the Quakers, and the other good people of Virginia, in their memorable defense from 1776 till 1785 against the establishment of the "Christian religion" there and the making of that "a Christian State."

We would humbly represent that the only proper objects of civil government are the happiness and protection of men in the present state of existence, the security of life, liberty, and property of the citizens; and to restrain the vicious and encourage the virtuous by wholesome laws, equally extending to every individual. But religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, and is nowhere cognizable but at the tribunal of the universal Judge.

1. To illustrate and confirm these assertions, we beg leave to observe that, to judge for ourselves, and to engage in the exercise of religion agreeable to the dictates of our own consciences is an inalienable right, which, upon the principles on which the gospel was first propagated, and the Reformation carried on, can never be transferred to another. We maintain, therefore, that in matters of religion no man's right is abridged by the institution of civil society, and that religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance.

2. If religion be exempt from the authority of society at large, much more is it exempt from the authority of the government. The latter is but the creature and vicegerent of the former. Its jurisdiction is both derivative and limited. It is limited with regard to the co-ordinate departments of the government, and most necessarily is it limited with regard to the whole people.

The preservation of free government requires not merely that the metes and bounds which separate each department of the governmental power be invariably maintained, but more especially that neither of them be suffered to overkeep the great barrier which defends the rights of the people. The rulers who are guilty of such encroachment exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are tyrants. The people who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves nor any authority derived from them, and are slaves.

3. It is proper to take alarm at this experiment upon our liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and the noblest characteristic of the American Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled itself in precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much soon to forget it.

Who does not see that the same authority that can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other sects? And it is impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects that profess the Christian faith, without erecting a claim of infallibility, which would lead us back to the Church of Rome. Who does not see that the same authority that can require assent to Christianity as the national religion, may, with the same propriety, require assent to each particular phase and feature of that religion? that the same authority that can require the observance of the "Christian Sabbath," may, by the same right, require the observance of every other "Christian" practice, custom, or institution? may, more, that with the same propriety and the same right, the authority which may require assent to Christianity as the national religion, may require assent to any other religion which the shifting policy of Government might seem to demand? For it is certain that there is no argument in favor of establishing the Christian religion which may not, with equal propriety, be pleaded for establishing the tenets of Mohammed by those who believe the Koran; or Buddhism or any other religion by those who believe in such religion.

4. During almost sixteen centuries has the legal establishment of "Christianity" been on trial, under a number of different claims and phases. What have been its fruits? More or less in all places pride, indolence, and insolence in the favored clergy; ignorance and servility in the assenting laity; in both superstition, bigotry, and persecution. Inquiring of the teachers of Christianity, for the ages in which it appears in its greatest power and luster, those of every sect will point to the time before its incorporation with the civil power; whether it be viewed in its first propagation by the apostles, or in its revival in the great Reformation.

5. On the other hand, what influence, in fact, have established religions had on civil society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of civil authority; in many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been seen the guardians of the liberties of the people. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate public liberty, needs them not. Such a government will be best supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his religion, with the same equal hand which protects his person and property—by neither invading the equal rights of any sect or individual, nor suffering any sect to invade those of another or of any individual.

6. This establishment of a national religion here is a serious departure from that generous disposition of this Government, which, offering an asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every nation and religion, has made this Nation the glory of the ages and the admiration of the world. What a melancholy mark are these acts of sudden degeneracy! Instead of holding forth an asylum to the persecuted, they are themselves a signal of persecution. They degrade from the equal rank of citizens all whose opinions in religion do not bend to those of the governmental authority. Distant as these may be in their present form from the Inquisition they differ from it only in degree. The one is the first step, the other is the last, in the career of intolerance. Henceforth the magnanimous sufferer from this cruel scourge in foreign regions must view this action of our Government as a beacon on our coast warning him that now there is on earth no haven where he may be secure from religious oppression and persecution.

7. Finally, the equal rights of every citizen to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of the individual conscience is held by the same tenure as all other rights. If we recur to its origin, it is equally the gift of nature; if we weigh its importance, it cannot be less dear to us. If we consult the national Constitution, the grand charter of those rights which pertain to the good people of the United States, it is not only enumerated with equal solemnity, but it is reserved with studied and special emphasis.

Either, then, we must say that the will of the governmental authority is the only measure of that authority, and that in the pleutade of that authority it may sweep away all our fundamental rights, or that it is bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred. Either we must say that the governmental authorities may control the freedom of the press, may abolish the trial by jury—say, that they may despoil us of our very right of suffrage and erect themselves into an independent and hereditary body, or we must say that they had no authority to make the declaration and decision, or to pass the acts under consideration.

What then shall we say? The only thing that men can say; that the Government of the United States has no such authority, and in order that no effort may be omitted on our part against so dangerous a usurpation, we oppose to it this appeal and remonstrance.

We, therefore as Christians, as Protestants, as American citizens, and as men, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the natural rights of mankind, of the Constitution of the United States, of the history of more than eighteen hundred years, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, solemnly publish and declare that we are and of right ought to be, free and independent of all connection, direction, dictation, interference, or control, of the Government of the United States, in matters of religion or religious observance or institutions of any kind or degree; and that, as such, as far as earthly authority is concerned, we have full right to be religious or not religious, to worship or not to worship, to observe a day or not to observe it according to the dictates of our own consciences and the convictions of our own minds.

And for the support of this appeal, remonstrance, and declaration and with a firm reliance on the protection of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, we mutually pledge to each other and to the world, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

To Christian manhood there is given but one course,—equal and exact justice to all. The deviation of but a hair's breadth in the foundation will overthrow the super-structure of character however imposing it may seem. The smallest germ of compromise imbedded in the crevice of the wall may overthrow the whole building.
