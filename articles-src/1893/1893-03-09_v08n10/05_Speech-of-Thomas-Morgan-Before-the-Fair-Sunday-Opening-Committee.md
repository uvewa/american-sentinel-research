I was going to say, Mr. Chairman, that inasmuch as the World's Fair Committee has, as I set forth, I wish to say that we, the working people, most emphatically and earnestly demand this right to be heard with justice. We have demanded Sunday opening as soon as the word went forth that the proposition to have an exposition, a world's exposition, in the United States, the labor organizations everywhere at once applauded with gladness to that proposition; and as soon as it was settled that the World's Fair should be held somewhere in the United States, Chicago withdrew forth their claims to Chicago as the proper geographical point to have a world exposition reached. They backed up their request that Chicago should be the place, by subscriptions reaching millions of dollars throughout the United States, to such an extent that Congress voted that it should to stand up in the Congress of the United States and say, "I build in my hand peti-

tions from organized labor from every State in the Union, except New York, asking that Fair shall be located in Chicago. That Fair was to be open on Sunday. But even before it was located there, the churches started in to have Congress show its authority about the ability to carry out laws of the State. The working put their hands into their pockets, and with the aid of millions of dollars of the religious press sold for millions of her stock.

Who will say that the demands of the Church demand that there should be an amendment to the Constitution to enable man's iniquity? If it did they did it the same as under the Inquisition, in a clandestinal way; and since then they have built the Fair and consecrated it to Sunday work. Hundreds and hundreds of skilled men have been killed and injured in the construction of that mighty work.

Not only that, but giving all due credit to the magnificent results of the Exposition that wonderful exposition—giving them all the credit—the producing societies that the credit—the producing societies—the people clapped his hands. (Here the speaker clapped his hands to illustrate.) But we have not built the Fair, sacrificed our lives in doing so, we have put in our money, our energy and labor in placing there the greatest exhibit the world has ever seen. We invite the other nations; and if there is neither in designing, constructing, nor in working the exhibits sin, why should we come and shut the gate and turn'd the thing over to the preachers? And I ask that is all the minerals pile that they are entitled to have the whole Fair handed over to labor. It is absolutely astounding—how could they risk their variety and call it—they risk their versatile energy in making their pose. I cannot comprehend how they could take such a position. That is all the stock in trade that the preachers have on this question; they have no other stock in trade; and I ask you —how they could risk their variety taking possession of a great work. One of them comes here this morning, telling us that Sunday is the holy Sabbath —a Union in New York City: "What labor organizations?"

Rev. Mr. W. F. Crafts came in at this point.

Mr. Morgan.—Who?

Mr. Crafts.—The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.

Mr. Morgan.—Well, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, that I know something about. They do not display flags. They are not represented here. The representatives of one of the local Unions in the State of Ohio come here and say that they have not got another organization.

Mr. Morgan.—Well, I am not familiar with the details, but this matter is now getting your way of managing these things. This is what the laboring people fear—that because the engineers of the Locomotive Engineers, under the direction of the religious influence, will do this. And those they say are the most intelligent and have the most intelligent membership of any body reputable that statement, if you have any reasons therefor. There is hardly a position held by engineers at this time which prohibits to the same extent, intellectual labor, as that which the religious proposition does. And hence when you know that in presenting their claim to

the respect and reverence for the Church held by the working people in the fact, has been destroyed to such an extent that the Church itself has become alarmed. With a few exceptions, and upon rare occasions, no suggestion to have a working man open or participate in our conventions or mass meetings has met with an enthusiastic response. Tens of thousands of wage-workers who, like myself, have passed their childhood to manhood within the folds of the Church, and in being guided by the principles of right conduct, for the moral principles taught by the caring of our parents, we cannot forget the wickedness embodied in the acts of the church people; and it is not merely the Fair but also understand the effect it will have in yet further disheartening the working classes from, and frustrating their hostility towards, the Church.

Speaking as we do, with this intimate personal knowledge, we respectfully, but most earnestly, urge congressmen who entertain like convictions and like intentions to undo this ill-advised and injurious act of the Church's influence.
