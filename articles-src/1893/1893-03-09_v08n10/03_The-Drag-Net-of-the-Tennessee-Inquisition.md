Begun by the little iniquity of the Tennessee inquisition is being drawn tighter and the mesh light that is thrown over the beautiful State of Tennessee is being made finer and closer. It is not enough that when an offense has been committed and those who believe that their rights have been invaded shall make the same come to the knowledge of the authorities, for the punishment of the offender, the court may appoint the prosecutor. When a man is indicted in a county in which offense was committed and against the person or persons supposed to have committed the offense:—

When Attorney-General Lewis entered the office of his district a short time ago, he was importuned by a number of persons to commence a crusade against Sunday work, under the diction of the old common law and under a Tennessee law on common labor for baseness upon the Lord's day and their supplement, but he, however, to begin a separate proceeding, told the people that the State cannot enter the grounds and prosecute, and said, "The Adventists are good enough people."

But the attorney-general was equal to the emergency in another direction. The leading members of the Adventist Church got together, and then got the Grand Jury to sign a petition; the attorney-general was furnished with the petition and then went about showing that "neighbors" were complaining about the Adventists working on Sunday; hence the prosecution.

But that did not do, as Mr. Lewis expressly told the people before this prosecution that not one person could be found who had complained. So the church people offered to obey that part of the commandment which said "nor thy stranger within thy gates, nor thine hired labor," and so they continued to work, refusing to refrain from their first-day sabbath-day according to the commandment; but when these prosecutions were terminated to crush them at one blow, and when the petition with the names of ninety of the male members of the Adventist Liberty Church in Henry County was signed, a petition from the church was carried to the governor of the State, but the court was partial; the court refused to allow the petition to be filed, and the court signed the order for the inquisitorial drag-net. Indictments were found against all adventist persons, eleven of them Adventists, and a number of them members of one or two of the railroad crosses from Paris.

But when the indictments were brought into the Federal Circuit Court for the prosecution of the suspected persons under the revenue law, the former did not correspond with those in the State court, and when these were compared, the attorney-general was furnished with the evidence that the prosecution was persecution for religion's sake, and was told that this man, if any such exists, was not to be found; but at this trial there were present also Ex-Governor Porter, and Rufus Ward. The order was then carried out by the court.

Following this we have the case of R. M. King which has never been described in the SENTINEL. Mr. King was a Seventh-day Adventist. He was first brought before the magistrate and fined $2.50 for hoeing potatoes, or some such work on Sunday. This fine he paid. He was next indicted by the Grand Jury of Henry County, on two counts,—for doing common work upon the same Sunday and for refusing to observe "said Sunday as a day of rest," and fined $2; and costs on each of the two counts. From this an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court, and this came up in the Tennessee and the other courts of that State; and then to the United States Federal Circuit Court, and again the decision of the lower court sustained. Next Mr. King appealed to the United States Supreme Court, and it was while his case was before this court that Mr. King died bringing on this cause.

A large number of the citizens of Henry County on petition to the Governor, and also to the court in behalf of Mr. King. But the presiding judge in the court, there was little or no persecution, so far as is known, on account of religion; but, when it was finally learned that the United States Supreme Court sustained the decision that he had died before the United States Supreme Court acted, a vigorous and more extended prosecution began again.

Then in connection with the connection of the churches of Tennessee with this new of prosecution under the Sunday laws, on the invitation of the State of Tennessee, the prosecuting attorney of the Sixteenth Judicial District of Tennessee, facts to come. The governor of the State was asked by the Adventists to commute the sentence.

Following this five more Seventh-day Adventists were presented before the Grand Jury and indicted for Sunday labor. Their names were J. H. Dortch, J. Moon, S. M. Lowry, James Stem and W. S. Lowry. They employed no lawyers, believing that if any man will, and not believing the testimony of those witnesses that were brought against them. The Lord promises to speak through his people when they are brought before magistrates. They appeared for themselves, and they were convicted, refusing to pay a fine. They were then placed under guard and taken from their places of residence to the prison there at Paris. The people soon got tired of going to the prison to see them, and work was made to work them, and finally as old laws upon the statute books directed the jail keeper that the Paris jail was a county work house, these they were placed in the chain-gang and worked, had only a few days at their time had nearly expired. I think three of them were in jail over one month and two for six weeks. The time was on the Sabbath, and a resolution to that effect was drawn up. The judge was appealed to in the matter; he said:—"Gentlemen, if you understand me to accept the responsibility, I have nothing whatever to do with the matter," and his attorney offered to allow bail over the matter; his experience of an attempt to force them to work on the Sabbath. They were very much told it would go harder with them if they protested; and so, when they came to trial each one took up his case, and the chain-gang stared them in the face, but he had no authority over them in a civil capacity; might be inflicted to compel them to work on or have Sabbath; but they kept the Sabbath.

Always the one that interested them most, before the last prosecution—and the case which furnished them an opportunity to make their statements on his office more than three hundred times, and in an address before the people—was, among the best means known to the citizens, direct to ministers; almost an equal amount of Seventh-day Adventist literature, besides by other methods. After the Springville meeting, held in an open public building about three and a half miles out of Paris, in the northeast parts of the State, insisted their rights under the law; and they were arrested by the store, and went all over that county, leaving this matter at the several points where these meetings were held.

Paris was our nearest—just before the trial every lawyer in Tennessee has had "Due Process of Law and Divine Right of Religion," "Religious Intolerance in Tennessee," "The Civil Sabbath, Divine Right of Conscience," and "Religious Intolerance." I believe in all the law of the land. Tennessee had the same, every Lutheran minister, and every Congregationalist minister; every denomination—had the same. And I believe it has had a great effect. Many good people have not expressed themselves; if they had been affected by the literature that has been circulated. The prosecuting attorney questioned the witnesses, and also the jury on that point.

Not only did they attempt to get the men this time, but they attempted to get the women as well, when the boys who were before the Grand Jury walked into the Inquisition. The prosecutor was working out the program. The prosecutor was pressing the charge to arrest every one, woman and man; and it has become so that action has become necessary in order to put a stop to this thing.

I send you now a copy of the indictment:

STATE OF TENNESSEE,
HENRY COUNTY, }

*Term, A. D. 1892.*

The Grand Jurors of the State of Tennessee, elected, impaneled, sworn, and charged to inquire into offenses committed, etc., in the County of Henry aforesaid, upon their oath, say that Billy Dollar, John, of and under, Seventh-day Adventist Sabbatarian belief, did on the — day of —, A. D. 18—, the said day being Sunday, and divers other Sundays next before the finding of this indictment, in the County of Henry aforesaid, follow worldly employment, to-wit:—cutlery, joinery, baking, common labor; which said Billy Dollar is a person of good character, and did perform and follow his common avocations, to-wit: cutting fire-wood, sawing boards, butchering hogs, threshing grain, and doing various and divers other kinds of common labor, he, the said Billy Dollar, being a matter of charity, and it was and it is to the great damage, in violation of the peace and dignity of the State of Tennessee, to the annoyance of the moral, and a public nuisance to the citizens of the State of Tennessee, against the peace and dignity of the State of Tennessee.

And the Grand Jury aforesaid, upon their oaths aforesaid, do further present that Billy Dollar, on the day and dates aforesaid, in the State and County aforesaid, being a person of the age of discretion, did follow his common avocations on Sundays to the prejudice of society and in violation of good morals.

W. S. LOWRY, ATT'Y GEN.

Three persons were indicted in accord with this indictment, Was, Dortch, T. F. Hill, J. H. Dortch, W. Ward, W. W. Stem, J. Moon, John, Billy Dollar, M. Lowry, J. E. Finch, Joe Parker—William, Frank Stem. These, with certain members of the gang and certain other parties whose names to the jury are not known.

At rest at Paris, Mr. J. T. Ringgold of Baltimore came in as an attorney for the defense. Mr. Ringgold is there. A local reporter kept notes through the county that three days before any Seventh-day Adventist had arrived from Washington, D. C., and the religious-liberty teaching teacher. They had gone to the church house and court room, waiting for the trials of the brethren.

A gentleman is seen in the hotel or in the barber's shop. Mr. Ringgold who was known only to the reporters, and one man inquired of him—or into the chain-gang if the proved to be the result, whether he was one of the new arrivals.

"I have never had clients before who were willing to go to the chain-gang," he said; "but I were perfectly satisfied to have their cases go either way. That was a new experience." Mr. Ringgold was glad that he had decided to employ or some lawyer to defend. Mr. Ringgold went to Paris because it would put it into the heart of some lawyer to influence the cause; he went there believing that work would be done from a love of the principles to be vindicated, and from no other motive. Personally told him that we then wanted that last case. Let me making him in this way, and could while he felt the situation strongly enough to the jury, believed himself incapable to defend on his own behalf expressly on the ground that it would be simply to bring and to bring on the fact, Your Honor, that is an act of religious persecution.

The first witness was John Dortch, brother of the defendants. He had been in the court on a previous occasion. He said he lived in the Springville district, on a farm; that he and his brother had been Seventh-day Adventists, and that their farms could be reached only by means of private roads, and a man standing in the nearest road supposed that he could make no one uneasy in the world.

The attorney-general here took up the case, again. After questioning him regarding the Adventists, asking a number of questions, he was importuned to testify, and that he might be allowed to make his own statement. And then he said nothing and smiling, stopped; broke off and stopped.

Witness said he had known of no attempt or effort to bring out the true persecution until his son (who is in the penitentiary) had brought a child being ordered by the Nurse to notify that the work of halted the conversation on which matter was dropped, and the trial proceeded.

The second witness was Bolivar Dortch.

The witness bore direct testimony as to the facts. The witness bore likewise, proved of, and stated that the prosecution has the opening and closing argument. The attorney said, the court; ever; remarked to the judges that he had nothing to say, gave a short charge in favor of the defendants. Mr. Ringgold then presented a series of

jury, and was followed by Mr. Carter. Mr. Carter made a very fine speech and was a fair report of the case, that is with reference to the point of disturbance. He said: "These men have disturbed nobody by their work. No man has been forced instantly to a disturbance. My friend here, the attorney-general, has his witnesses, whom he has driven to the station on Sunday, and it disturbs no one. His Honor, when the emergency required him to travel to the place, a judge cannot hold court, remained at home with his court. It has been ruled that a man who ran a train on Sunday. It was not held as a disturbance of the peace."

At this point the judge was seen to wince a little. Notwithstanding all this, the prosecuting attorney made a frantic effort to convict these men. He undertook to give out charges about the morality of the people of Tennessee, and how the Sabbath must be maintained; and that according to Holy Writ, etc. But when he invade Holy Writ, Mr. Ringgold was on to, foot in an instant, and said: "Your Honor, I object. Holy Writ does not come into this case. It is a civil, and these men are indicted for a civil offense." The judge sustained the objection, and for the first time in the history of Tennessee, under a Sunday law prosecution, the case was removed from a religious to a civil basis.

The judge then charged the jury, and adjourned for one hour for dinner. Immediately after the judges charges the jury after some had again conversed, and before the jury had left their seats, the prosecuting attorney arose and remarked, "If Your Honor please, the State confesses a verdict of not guilty." The judge immediately remarked, "Gentlemen of the jury, with your consent I will enter a verdict of not guilty." The jury nodded assent, and the trial of Wm. Dortch was at an end. He was the last, however, in the entering of a verdict of not guilty, for the spectators plainly saw that the prosecuting attorney, seeing that there was no chance to convict, I might mention one interesting point with reference to these cases. Insofar as the facts and evidence go to show that they are Adventists, they will draw out of the county taxes sufficient to cover what might have been lost. Mr. Ringgold, in commenting upon this feature at the close, commented on the situation; and that lawyers and others remarked jocularly that the Adventists simply had come to be regarded as a nuisance for furnishing money in this way to the Seventh-day Adventists for the support of their work.

Before passing further I will say that the case of Thomas Dortch was postponed till the next term of court. The prosecuting attorney knowing that this case would go to the others like it was opened at that time, and realizing that the whole community feeling in the county was with the old man, Ringgold, pleaded a continuance. He claimed that he had witnesses by whom he could prove the points required. Not satisfied with the showing in the court by Mr. Carter and Mr. Ringgold that the Seventh-day Adventist Sabbath was the seventh day Adventist Church, and that it was not at all an uncommon thing for any of us to work on Sunday; there was the merest hope that he could win the case by introducing new testimony; and the court strongly desired the postponement, the judge granting the attorney's request at once.

Adrian that on one occasion when one of his brethren was being tried on these charges against the Christian, he replied, "Go to the proper authorities, and they will express publicly, and make charges against the Christians, or as they give him an opportunity of answering for them." Now, let him proceed to show these are only, and not by rule demands and more chances of it any more abuse, he had continued, "and show that they have committed offenses against the law and they must decide according to the nature of the offense, but, by Heavens," explained as his impatience entirely, "if the charges be the enormity of the offense, and punish the criminals accordingly." "But it is a matter of duty," he said, "it is a duty which I owe my emperor, but such is not the law of a free country, and so far as I can see, so far as I have seen, the law of Tennessee provides against, and the law of Tennessee provides charges be made, the real accusers never being known, they appeared; all in all (and in these cases they have not appeared) simply as witnesses for the State. These are no personal prosecutors, these charges are made in secret; the accusers go before the grand jury in secrecy; but their own brethren in the district and members of their own families are not quite the companions that they are when they are convicted. This is the manner in which the religious inquisition is now prosecuted. None of their neighbors are complainants; none of their neighbors are prosecutors; indeed nobody in the county is willing to appear in this capacity, except the attorney-general, and that for the reason that "the Adventists are good neighbors;" nevertheless, residents of the county to the number of forty, on demand of Lewis are, petitioned him to prosecute the Adventists for Sunday work regardless of their day of rest.

Some of white men in the county who are not Adventists, work on Sunday very regularly and more publicly than do the Adventists, but against such as these not a few surprises are encountered. As was to be expected, and as is always the case, so far in the prosecution of these

indicted, and the attorney-general from doubles pocketed, are this $2.50 for the Sentinel; his arrest has not yet been made upon his indictment. Other like cases there were, but the writer has not the details for them.

All the indictments upon which arrests have been made, both old and new, correspond with the order directing the attorney-general to secure indictments, were quashed upon motion of the attorneys for the defense, the judge holding that he would have to set them aside, hold the case shortly, as it was the evident intent of the order of the court to give effect to the appointed prosecutor ex-officio only in one case upon the docket. But after holding that His Honor signed the order upon the record and reprimands of the attorney-general without so much as reading it, for while it is very possible that the witness was ignorant of the law, it does not seem probable that Judge Swiggart was not familiar with the practice of his own court.

Such, are, briefly, the facts in regard to the prosecution, so far as the facts are known by the writer. They simply afford additional evidence that the prosecution of Adventists in Tennessee is religious persecution.

At the term of Court which has just closed in Henry County, Tenn., so infamous were found for Sunday work. Information has been received from reliable sources that it is probable no more prosecutions, on this charge, will occur here for more time at least. The only case now on the docket held to answer to the charges of Sunday labor is that of Thomas Dortch (Seventh-day Adventist) whose trial was laid over to the next term of court in the plea, made by the public prosecutor, of the absence of material witnesses. There is no especial reason so far in the prosecution of these express from proving that the prosecutions

the Federal Court, and would have brought the Federal prosecutions, not only in Tennessee, but elsewhere. Mr. King's death brought the case to the attention of the United States Supreme Court, which would have been the action of that court; had they received his appeal in time.

William Dortch came up for trial, among the witnesses what went up to see the trial. He spoke him not, and said nothing relating the matter of religion, and advanced as a witness. The attorney, who on every occasion had appeared openly, with Dortch had not a opposed word to say. The Grand Jury advanced and Mr. Carter arose and stated that he had no objection. Ringgold was golden. The little city was stirred to its center.

Following this, the witness bore testimony. The attorney, who on every other occasion had to having seen the defending Adventist teaching, advanced and said he did not care to make any opening speech. Then at rest, after the close of the testimony, the old Mr. Carter arose and stated that he had no further objections.
