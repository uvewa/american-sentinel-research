A paragraph from an article in the *Chicago Herald,* "False Claims Circulating Sunday," is worthy of attention:—

The claim that Sunday is the Sabbath under the law of God is false.

If that commandment continues to govern men, as a specific law, the seventh day and not the first day is the Sabbath. It may be that the argument that its language was accorded, not the law for the seventh but for a seventh day, is sound in ethics, but in law it is not sound. We cannot see its unequivocal condemnation of those who will not observe the day of the command's designation. From Congress does not legislate concerning that day and that class of people; but it does assume to legislate concerning those who observe as sacred the seventh day of the week, "Saturday," and not "Sunday." The fact that at the very last, upon the World's Fair so far, a purpose to force those to rest on Sunday who rest on Saturday, that the religious element in Congress is proving to be a strong factor in American legislation.

This is perfectly clear. It is a fact, that the claim that Sunday is the Sabbath is false. The statement of the evolution of that fallacy, which the *Herald* makes in the paragraph, is so stated that it most suggestively furnishes much food for thought. Consider. What is it to be the result of a system of legislation based upon a falsehood? What will be the essential moral character of such a system? It is that of persecution. Can unrighteousness produce righteousness? Can lying promote the cause done after to be kind?
