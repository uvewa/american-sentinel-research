A PARAGRAPH from an article in the Chicago Herald, entitled, "False Claims Concerning Sunday," says:—

The claim that Sunday is the Sabbath under the fourth commandment of the Decalogue is false in point of fact.

If that commandment continues to govern men, as a specific law, the seventh day and not the first is the Sabbath. That point was so clearly put during the discussion of Mr. Quay's motion in the Senate that his language was amended, lest the law should apply to Saturday, and so defeat the ends which the friends of Sunday sought. This fact is an unequivocal condemnation of those who call Sunday the "Sabbath," "God's Holy Day," etc. When Congress dare not legislate concerning Sunday under the name of "Sabbath" because Sabbath is the biblical and universally recognized name of the seventh day of the week, "Saturday," nothing more is needed to show the false character of the claim that it is a "violation" of "the Sabbath" to open the World's Fair or to pursue "worldly" business on that day. That little episode in Congress is proving to be a strong factor in the indictment which charges false claims at the door of the advocates of Sunday closing.

This is perfectly clear. It is a fact, the claim that Sunday is the Sabbath is false. The statement of the evidence of that falsity, which the Herald makes in this paragraph, is so lucid that the most superficial reader must realize it, and stop to consider. What is to be the result of a legislative course which starts from such a basis? What will be its eventual moral effect? Unrighteous in conception and in execution. Can unrighteousness produce righteousness, or must everything produce after its kind?
