In the *Episcopal Recorder* of December 16, there is an article by Rev. Nathaniel Wardner. He says that in his belief on the Lord, in which he takes ground against the whole current of popular teaching, which may at any moment, and declares that many things may yet be fulfilled before Christ will come. In support of his position, in addition to other Bible testimony, he cites largely from Bishop Martlecou, one of the ablest of the M. E. Bishops. Many of the statements of the bishop are so striking that we feel justified in quoting them. Take, for example, the following:

Yet though it is not so far as in deserving the wrath of heaven by any one people, as gross as the opposition the Church and the world have combined against all these things, the same proportion we have the right to say, and we have to do now more than our measure of the whole duty that God intends us to know, what is evil, but also in relation to God's holy will.

With the above position, Seventh-day Adventists have no controversy whatever. There is probably only this difference, that the Bishop does not see so clearly as we do the relation of the fulfilling of the prophecy to the world and the popular churches combined in the attempt to serve both God and Mammon, to keep the commandments of God, and the fall of death. then all the following then—then the spirit of persecution is let loose, and Christ himself is talking about persecutors, "we have the right to say." The history of the Church at the present age is an abiding pattern and type of its tendency in the future.

Bishop Mallalieu.

We will quote pretty forcefully from the Scripture, that evil must afflict in its supreme manifest evil does overtake us. "By the truth of the Gospel." "We therefore know that eventually will play, and Christendom becomes a combined body. Society will be utterly sunk, of corruption, because false doctrine and socially false practice has permeated every church; and the strong delusion will then appear. In its immense economic, will experience a widespread development of false religion; and when religion (the corrupt, organized hierarchy) will fall." "Christendom will come to be overwhelmed by the social condition of the whole world, culture, and even, even the silence of the apostasy, the condition of this corrupted organization—will form a new religion by strong delusion, into which the whole world will be drawn. Mankind, deceived the love of the truth, a Censorship of the Press, and thus the great delusion—the worship of the image of the beast; a feast from

right now. That prophecy is found in 2 Thes. 2:9, 11,12; God's antidote for it, God's warning against it, is found in Rev. 14:6-12. The mission of the fourth angel is to lead the warning.—*Signs of the Times.*
