In the Episcopal Recorder of December 29, there is an article by Rev. Nathaniel West, D. D., in regard to the coming of the Lord, in which he takes ground against those who believe the Lord may come at any moment, and declares that many things must yet be fulfilled before Christ will come. In support of his position, in addition to Bible testimony, he quotes quite largely from Bishop Martensen, one of the greatest scholars of Europe. Some of the statements of the bishop are so striking that we feel justified in quoting them. Take, for example, the following:—

For though it is not for us to determine the day or the hour, yet we must know that in the proportion as the opposition between the Church and the world resembles what it was in the apostolic age, in the same proportion we have the right to say, "The Lord comes quickly!" for the apostolic age is an abiding pattern and type for us, not only in relation to what is evil, but also in relation to what is good. (Dogmatice, pp. 466.8.)

With the above position, Seventh-day Adventists are in substantial agreement. There is probably only this difference, that we believe that the struggle between the world and the popular churches combined, and the true church, "which keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev. 14:12), is much nearer than the bishop thinks it is. And if the spirit of persecution is let loose, then according to the bishop's own position, "we have the right to say, 'The Lord comes quickly!' for the apostolic age is an abiding pattern and type for us."

We give one more quotation from Bishop Martensen:—

It is decidedly and plainly foretold in the Scriptures, that evil must attain to its supreme manifestation, before the Lord comes. In the last times a great and widespread apostasy from Christianity will take place, and Christendom become a complete Babylon. The churches will be in a state of corruption, because false doctrines and unchristian government will have got the upper hand. Wordily luxury, combined with wealth, trade, and extensive commerce, will exercise a widespread dominion, and ungodliness and debauchery accompany it. But "in one hour," i.e., suddenly, Babylon (the corrupt, organized hierarchy) will fail, a sudden catastrophe will ensue, an overthrow of the social condition of the whole world, culture, and civilization, with its sham Christianity. Then will the anti-Christ and the anti-Christian kingdom come, even the climax of the apostasy, the consummation of evil on the earth. Then will the great tribulation befall believers. Anti-christ will form a new religion by strong delusion, into which the Lord will suffer all to fall who have not received the love of the truth, a Cesaropapy of the worst kind, a world-religion which ends in the worship of the image of the beast, a beast whose culture and civilization are ever more and more tending to bestiality, to rude force, and carral lust."

It is evident from the above extract that the bishop has been studying the book of Revelation, and that he sees some things there predicted which he believes have not yet been fulfilled. He sees that in the last days there will be widespread apostasy, and evil will come to a "supreme manifestation;" the churches will be in a "state of corruption;" a "great tribulation" will "befall believers;" beast-worship will be established, and the image of the beast will also be worshiped. A strong delusion will be manifested, "into which the Lord will suffer all to fall who have not received the love of the truth."—Review and Herald.
