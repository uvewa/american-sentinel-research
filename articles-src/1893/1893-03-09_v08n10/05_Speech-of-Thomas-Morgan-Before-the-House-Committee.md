(Concluded.)

I WAS going to say, Mr. Chairman, that in addition to the authority that I have here set forth, I wish to say that we, workmen of Chicago, particularly and especially demand the right to be heard with more consideration than our opponents. As soon as the word went forth that it was proposed to have an exposition, a world's exposition, in the United States, the labor organizations everywhere responded with gladness to that proposition; and as soon as it was settled that the World's Fair should be held somewhere in the United States, Chicago workmen put forth their claims to Chicago as the proper geographical point to have a world exposition located. They backed up their request that Chicago should be the place, with petitions from labor organizations throughout the United States, to such an extent that Congressman Hawley was able to stand up in the Congress of the United States and say, "I hold in my hand petitions from organized labor from every State in the Union, except New York, asking that the Fair shall be located in Chicago." That Fair was located there. But even before it was located there, the demand was made by Congress that Chicago should show its ability to carry out the Fair by subscribing for ten millions of her stock. The workmen put their hands into their pockets, and with dimes and fifty-cent pieces and dollars subscribed for millions of her stock.

What did the Church do? Did the Church demand that there should be an exposition of the world's products and man's ingenuity? If it did they did it silently. The workmen responded in this substantial way; and since then they have built the Fair and consecrated it with their blood. Hundreds and hundreds of workmen have been killed and maimed in the construction of that mighty work. And I think that because of these reasons what we have to say should have additional weight attached to it.

Not only that, but giving all due credit to the master minds who designed and planned that wonderful exposition—giving them all due credit—the products exhibited there come from this kind of hands. (Here the speaker clapped his hands together.) And after we have built the Fair, sacrificed our lives in doing so, after we have contributed by our ingenuity and labor in placing there the exhibits, these men who had no hand in it, neither in designing, constructing, nor in anything else connected with it, have come and shut the gate and turned the lock on us workmen, and then they come here with the miserable plea that they are instructed, that they are justified in speaking for labor. It is absolutely astounding the assumption these men have in making their plea. I cannot comprehend how they could risk their reputation for veracity, for honesty, and for truth—and that is all the stock in trade that the clergy have, and if that is lost they are gone—how they could risk their veracity and honesty in making these statements. One of them comes here this morning, and says, "I hold a petition from a labor Union in New York City." What labor Union?

Rev. Mr. W. F. Crafts here spoke up and said: "The engineers of the United States."

MR. MORGAN.—Who?

MR. CRAFTS.—The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.

MR. MORGAN.—No. Look here, that claim, that statement that is made that they duplicate things is basely, maliciously false. They do not duplicate things. And then they bring in a single petition from one of the local Unions in the State of New York, and make people believe they have got another organization.

MR. CRAFTS.—Oh no.

MR. MORGAN.—Well, of course my comprehensive faculties are not equal to grasp your way of managing these things. (Laughter.) Another statement is made that because the engineers of the United States speak, that settles the question; that they are the most intelligent of all workmen in the United States. I absolutely repudiate that statement, and I give my reasons therefor. There is hardly an occupation to which man is obligated that prohibits to the same extent, intellectual development, as the locomotive engineers' occupation does. And hence when you assert that in presenting their claim to a closed Fair you set forth the intellect of the laboring men of the United States, you again misrepresent the facts.

Then the plea is made that the opening of the Fair will necessitate extra work upon the part of the engineers. Let me call your attention to this fact, that, if the World's Fair is closed on Sunday, people will be absolutely prohibited from enjoying its privileges on that day. That day will be given to traveling. Men will start on Sunday, reach Chicago Sunday night or Monday, spend the week at the Fair, take the train at the latest hour Saturday night or the earliest Sunday morning.

MR. DURBOROW.—Mr. Morgan, you have been speaking just twenty-five minutes, and have consumed the time allotted to you. I understand that you desire Mr. Askew to follow you, and unless you give away to him, of course you would occupy his time.

MR. MORGAN.—Oh, excuse me, Mr. Chairman; I did not think I had been talking so long. But really I would like to have a little more time. I have a paper here which I would like very much to present.

MR. DURBOROW.—If you have the consent of the other speakers of course it will be all right.

DR. W. H. THOMAS.—I will give you my time.

MR. DURBOROW.—Simply state a synopsis of your paper if you can, and give it as quickly as possible.

MR. MORGAN.—I will read it as rapidly as possible, and you can read it at your leisure.

(Reading)—In regard to the religious side of this matter, I wish to say that the workingmen attribute the action of Congress in closing the World's Fair on Sunday to the activity and influence of the Protestant evangelical church, and that in the accomplishment of its purpose the representatives of these churches assume to be the guardians of the economical and moral interests of the working people and in their name and behalf urge Congress to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday.

We are duly authorized by the only organized and formal movement made by workingmen in relation to the closing of the Fair on Sunday to absolutely deny the right of these churches or their representatives to speak or act for us in this matter, and to prove to you by documentary evidence we present that all such representations made to Congress by these churches are wilfully or ignorantly fraudulent.

In this connection we desire to call the attention of congressmen who may have been influenced by the action of these churches, and who are sincerely interested in the religious side of this question, to the fact that the indifference or active antagonism of the working classes toward the Church is at present, and has been for years past, a subject of the most serious consideration by the clergy. We respectfully represent that one of the principal causes of this latent and active hostility to the Church is due to the fact that its representatives are so far removed economically and socially from the wage working classes as to entirely fail to understand their wants, desires, and aspirations, and hence as a result, when they do speak in our name they misrepresent us, as they have in this case. This has occurred so frequently and universally that the respect and reverence for the Church held by the working people in the past has been destroyed to such an extent that the Church itself has become alarmed. With a few exceptions, and upon rare occasions, a suggestion to have a clergyman open or participate in our conventions or mass meetings would be met with contemptuous ridicule. Tens of thousands of wage-workers who, like myself, have passed from infancy to manhood within the folds of the Church, and in being forced from it have retained a fervid love for the moral principles taught by the carpenter of Nazareth, realize not only the wickedness embodied in the acts of the clergymen in shutting the workers out of the Fair but also understand the effect it will have in further alienating the working classes from, and intensifying their hostility toward, the Church.

Speaking as we do, with this intimate personal knowledge we respectfully, but most earnestly, urge congressmen who have been influenced by religious considerations to undo this ill-advised and injurious act of the Church.
