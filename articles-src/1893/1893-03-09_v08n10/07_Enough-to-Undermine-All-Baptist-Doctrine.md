The Watchman, of Boston, Baptist, careful, and moderately conservative, says: "So many inquiries are addressed to us which suggest that in advocating legislation for closing the World's Fair on Sundays we are violating the distinctive Baptist principle of the separation of Church and State, that a word further upon the matter may be called for."

The defense of the Watchman is: "For one thing, we are not necessarily advocating religious legislation in advocating measures approved by religion. A measure may have both a religious and a moral aspect." This evades the real issue. Religion approves whatever is "moral," since it is the source of true morality. But religion, as defined in the matter of legislation, and as contrasted with moral, pertains to the duties men owe to God as distinct from those they owe to each other, and far above them. That is the issue in Sunday legislation. There is no fundamental reason, religious or moral, why men should be forbidden to pursue ordinary business on Sunday, rather than on Monday, unless God requires it, because Sunday is, to him, different from other days.

The Watchman's second defense is: "We are not necessarily advocating religious legislation in advocating the continuance upon the statute books of measures which were originally placed there in the direct interests of religion. A law may be a wise law, though enacted from motives which fail to justify themselves. We have nothing to do with the motives of legislators who put certain measures upon our statute books. Our concern is with the laws themselves. They may be wise and equitable, though we do not admit the validity of the reasons which led our fathers to enact them."

This historic argument can not be set aside thus easily, especially when ninety per cent. of the pleading for the present Sunday laws is boldly made in the interests of religion. The United States Senate became a theological convention when the Sunday-closing act was under consideration last summer. The fourth commandment was read from the speaker's desk, as the basis of authority in the case. The late "hearing" touching the repeal or the modification of the law was another "theological convention." The supposed case set forth by the Watchman does not fit the facts in the matter under consideration. "The law itself" demands that men be restrained from ordinary work, etc., because it is wrong to pursue business on Sunday. No adroit creating of hypothetical cases can remove this fact.

The Watchman goes on: "Still further, we are not necessarily advocating religious legislation in advocating measures which promote the good of man as made known by revelation."

This is also an evasion of the real issue. Revelation makes known all that is for the "good of man." It covers the entire field of morale, the subordinate fields of social, intellectual and physical life. It is the province of civil law to regulate the duties which spring from men's relation to each other; but it is not therefore the province of the State to dictate and enforce duties which arise from men's relation to God.

The Watchman does as well as can be done in seeking a middle ground between the Baptist position of "religious liberty and the Catholic theory of State-church authority." But one can easily read between the lines the fact that it is conscious of championing an illogical position, which will not stand the test of "Baptist principles," nor of the biblical doctrine concerning man's relation to God. There is fallacy enough in the Watchman's effort to undermine the entire citadel of Baptist doctrine. It would do better to leave the defense of Sunday legislation to those who do not believe that the Bible is the only rule of faith and practice for Christian men.—Sabbath Recorder.
