The next step will be the prohibition of one or the most of the small-time channels of literature which point out the iniquity and unfaithfulness of all Sunday law, and the absolute falsity of Sunday itself as a Christian institution.

It may be thought by the reader that this never can be, for the Constitution declares that "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." But that guarantee is already in a way to another by an opinion or decision of the Supreme Court decision, given on Feb. 1, 1892, which revives the precedent of the dark ages of the press as existed in the Middle Ages. The censorship of the press that existed under the lottery law as amended Sept. 19, 1890:—

That decision declares that the First Amendment to the Constitution "was not intended to prevent legislation by Congress nor restrain Congress from excluding that which may be considered detrimental demanded by its judgment" that it may deny the facilities "for the distribution of matter deemed injurious" to the public morals; that "it possesses the power to punish the use of the mails for the perpetration of crimes or immorality." "In excluding various articles from the mails, the object of Congress has not been to interfere with the freedom of the press, or with any other rights of the people; but to refuse its facilities for the distribution of matter deemed injurious to the public morals; that papers concerning lotteries are not in other ways than by mail," or, in the words of the decision: "The circulation of newspapers is not prohibited, but the Government declines itself to become an agent in the circulation of printed matter which it regards as injurious to the people." But such a position is entirely a power over other means of distribution; the general public of this country, in the subject of this nation, and it was the First Amendment to prohibit the Government from sitting as a censor in the matter of what it was proper, to be a disseminator, a character was complete, to determine with reference to the public, to determine, if it means anything, that what, by a religious majority, is pronounced by some to be deemed "as injurious to the people," or to be positively immoral, Congress may prohibit the use of the mails, whether the document be political or religious, private or public.

The significance of this decision becomes the maker of the position of the Adventist is not persecutory, that any one who is acquainted with the statute of the average colored laborer in the South will understand this added step of the enemy that it was expected to put upon the Adventists by condemning his press to the chain-gang in the company of "suggestive." A few copies of the *N. Y. World* is covered by this pretexts, but it will only open the eyes of the people of the South to the enormity of the outrage which is being perpetuated upon as unobtrusive law-abiding citizens, the Seventh-day Adventists of Henry County, Tennessee.

As therefore, Congress has committed itself to Sunday legislation, and as the legislation was obtained by the urgent, the wicked and only wicked, and as a legislation entering upon it, and as, if the final plunge (the Sunday) will be in the past, to be a usurper and usurpation; as a politician, "for the wisdom of this is injurious by Congress to the public morals," a censorship of the press will be established by the religious majority upon the censorship of the press will be made. The censorship will be all that is needed; by this process of legal friction of judgment the court "by its judgment." In our Constitution has been created.

His Honor Maine is his great work in the "History of Institutions," that the "idea of freedom ever employed to judge of changes in human legislation which have been the subject of the most momentous results of legislation," is a "legal fiction." The fact is that the new censorship of the press creates a censorship that is always wise.

Who will say that the original decision demonstrated and proved, save perhaps the change forced in the Supreme Court and then going along with that last? Read Bishop Leigh and the article in "A Ministerial of Persecution," "Persecution and Christian Discrimination," in the North American *Review* for 1887, when Bishop Leigh gave leave to speak against the Christian religious establishment and Christian discrimination therein. Such it will be considered when Congress has fully entered upon the career of legislation.

The man behind the plow in the South is also the man in the legislature; it is for them to establish a censorship of the press, and to pass and enforce a law against Sunday work. It may seem that nobody is called upon "to stop the process of time" which has been enacted against these things, and not to encroach further upon the principles of the Constitution. They engaged in all this may answer in the words of an eminent writer: "for the welfare of the subject in the hands of the ruler;" and, in its broadest application, the church people demand the power to Perfect the Amen. And each Man makes the contribution. We will give you Sabbath law. Let it be the first thing at which the people kill you with that it will not be enough. Because we know you will they do unto, come, because they have become and we know that then the nation will be far. 7. This is the Secret. They cry, and with you, we will Rise and Call on Christ. In our day that religion was attacked, so the unalterable, unjustly, uneducation, Sunday of all undeniable religion, and of all the most significant, the whole religious method to uphold it. God has a case for his own government, and he proposes, with us, to carry it to the fullest possible, in its pursuit of triumphancy. Do not question. We are instructing that science does not to overule, like it does in religion, where science has interfered —to start in their blindness with "We know we know we know."

WE KNEW IT.

"No, we knew it would come. We have known it was coming. Some of us have known it for more than two score years. We have proclaimed that it would come; and knew it when it would come, and how it would come; and when Congress did what it did, all this was coming soon, and we said, we knew it. And it was no guess. We have a country, but we know it and said it would come, for we had "a more sure word of prophecy" said it was coming. We walked by faith then, we walk
