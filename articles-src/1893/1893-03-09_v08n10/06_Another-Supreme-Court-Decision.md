The next step will be the prohibition of the use of the mails for disseminating that literature which points out the iniquity and unchristianity of all Sunday laws, and the absolute falsity of Sunday itself as a Christian institution.

It may be thought by the reader that this can never be, for the Constitution declares that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." But that guarantee of liberty is already swept away by another judge-made law, another Supreme Court decision, given on Feb. 1, 1892, which makes Congress as much a censor of the press as existed in the Middle Ages. The occasion of the decision was certain cases under the lottery law as amended Sept. 19, 1890.

That decision declares that the First Amendment to the Constitution does not restrain Congress from excluding from the mail all documents "condemned by its judgment;" that it may "refuse the facilities for the distribution of matter deemed injurious" "to public morals;" that it "possesses the power to forbid the use of the mails in aid of the perpetration of crime or immorality." The court contends that this is not a blow at the liberty of the press; that papers may circulate in other ways than by mail; or, in the words of the decision, "The circulation of newspapers is not prohibited, but the Government declines itself to become an agent in the circulation of printed matter which it regards as injurious to the people." But Congress has no power over any other means of distribution than the mail; and it was the intent of the First Amendment to prohibit Congress from acting as a censor in the matter of what it was proper, so far as physical character was concerned, to distribute through the mail. This decision means, if it means anything, that whatever Congress may in its judgment condemn "as injurious to the people," or "injurious" "to public morals," it will prohibit the use of the mails, whether the document be political or religious, private or public."

*For a fuller review of this decision the reader is referred to an article entitled "A Blow at the Freedom of the Press," by Hanna Taylor, Esq., in North American Review for December, or the admirable condensation of that article by the Weekly Review.*

THE RESULT.

As, therefore, Congress has committed itself to Sunday legislation, and as this legislation will be opposed and denounced as wicked and only wicked, and as the very institution over which it has made its fatal plunge (the Sunday) will be shown by the press, as it has been shown in the past, to be a usurper and unchristian, such publications will be "deemed injurious by Congress to the public morals," placed on the "Index Expurgatorius," and prohibited the use of the mails. A censorship of the press will be established, with its necessary inquisition. Thus by this process of legal fiction of judge-made laws, the glorious First Amendment to our Constitution has been wiped out. Says Mr. Taylor:—

Sir Henry Maine in his great work on "Ancient Law," has told us that the most subtile and irresistible device ever employed by judges to change the effect of positive laws and constitutions, without changing their outward form, is what is known to lawyers as a "legal fiction." "The fact is that the law has been wholly changed; the fiction is that it remains what it always was."

And so the First Amendment has been wholly changed save perhaps the clause guarding freedom of speech. But how long with that last? Read Bishop Leighton's article on "Limitation of Religious Discussion," in the North American Review for January, in which he contends that to speak against the Christian religion or its ordinances should be considered treason. Such it will be considered when Congress has fully gathered itself into the tolls.

The men behind all these movements may be honest. It may seem necessary to them to establish a censorship of the mails instead of submitting alleged wrongs to "due process of law." Sunday to them may be a sacred institution, a Christian institution. It may seem blasphemous and treasonable against God to speak against these things, and so treasonable and amenable to law in a Christian nation. The men engaged in all this may be sincere. So was Saul and so were the papists of the Dark Ages when they put to death "the whitest of the saints of God." So were the Jews who put to death the Perfect Man. And that man declared: "Yes, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me." John 16:2, 3. This is the secret. They know not the gospel of Christ, for to know the gospel is to know God and Christ. Though they know it not, the whole thing is uncharitable, unmanly, unchristian. Sunday is unchristian, therefore the unchristian methods to uphold it. God can care for his own government, and is able to punish all transgressors. He deputizes men not to execute his law, but to preach the gospel of peace. God pity them in their blindness. They know not what spirit they are of.

WE KNEW IT WOULD COME.

Yes, we knew it would come. We have known it and said it in various publications for more than two score years. We did not know how it would come or just when it would come, but we knew that all this was coming soon, and we said so. We did not say so because we did not love our country; but we knew it and said it was coming because God's "more sure word of prophecy" said it was coming. We walked by faith then; we walk by sight now. That prophecy is found in Rev. 13:11-17. God's antidote for it, God's warning against it, is found in Rev. 14:6-12. The salvation of the world lies in heeding that warning.—Signs of the Times.
