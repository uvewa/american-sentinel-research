This issue of the SENTINEL, containing the "Solemn Protest and Remonstrance" adopted by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, should receive general and extended circulation. Orders will be filled for this number at the regular price of one dollar per hundred, or eight dollars per thousand, charged for special issues. ORDER IMMEDIATELY.

The remonstrance published in this issue is a document to which too much importance can not be attached. The time and the occasion are fraught with a tragic depth of import. The appeal is not unequal to the occasion either in manner or in matter. In loftiness of thought and dignity of expression the protest rises to the exigency of the grave situation in public affairs which has called it forth. It is an appeal, a protest, and a remonstrance for all the people. It should be spoken in the ears of every one.

Those who oppose the passage of Sunday laws, or desire the repeal of existing religious laws, are persistently accused by religious legislationists of acting from some selfish or unworthy motive. This is because they judge others by themselves. Their interests and sympathies are enlisted in behalf of Sunday; they, therefore, propose to compel all to serve their interests and sympathize with them. They are unable to conceive of any one acting from other motives. To their mind the purpose of the infidel is to compel them by law into giving up their religion altogether; the intent of the seventh day observer is to coerce them into the observance of the seventh day. Their highest conception of religious duty respecting Sabbath observance seems to be coercion. Even those who profess no religion have a truer sense of justice in reference to religious things than this. To the seventh day observer nothing could be more abhorrent than enforced seventh day observance. If greater legal blasphemy is possible than exists in Sunday laws it would be seventh-day laws.

At the term of Court which has just closed in Henry County, Tenn., no indictments were found for Sunday work. Information has been received from reliable sources that it is probable no more prosecutions, on this charge, will occur there for some time at least. The only case now on the docket held to answer to the charge of Sunday labor is that of Thomas Dortch (Seventh-day Adventist) whose trial was laid over to the next term of court on the plea, made by the public prosecutor, of the absence of material witnesses. There is no especial evidence of any pronounced change in the sentiment of the community except that the latent love of justice and opposition to persecution which exists everywhere, has been developed and brought to the surface by these trials.

At the last hearing upon the Sunday closing of the World's Fair before the House Committee on the Columbian Exposition, doubt was thrown on the present position of Miss Frances Willard upon that question. It was stated that there was reason to believe that she had "experienced a change of heart" upon the subject, and was ready to confess the impropriety of congressional enforcement of governmental religion. The Mail and Express has taken pains to secure from Miss Willard an expression directly upon that point. This is her letter, from London, of date Feb. 17, 1893:—

To the Editor of the Mail and Express.

Sir:—The statements in my annual address are all that any one has a right to go upon, and they certainly show that in my capacity as president of the N. W. C. T. U., I stand with the White Ribbon women, who have certainly done as much according to their principles and ability as any other class in America to secure the closing of the Exposition on Sundays.

When the enemies of Christianity combine its friends must unite, and while many excellent men and women who are not enemies have taken the popular view of the question, that very fact leads the White Ribboners to be more conservative than might otherwise have been the case.

I am one of these, and the later developments of the conflict have made me more thoroughgoing than I was at first. Believe me yours with best wishes.

FRANCES E. WILLARD.

P. S. I rabled Mrs. La Fetra, of Washington, president of the W. C. T. U., District of Columbia, to this effect: "I stand with our society."

It would be better to stand for right, and justice, and truth, with true religion undefiled,—than to stand "as president of the W. C. T. U.," "with the White Ribbon women" and "with our society." But in view of Miss Willard's previous language, which has shown a lamentable inability to comprehend any but the superficial and false religion of State, and camp, and court, and society, it would be much to expect. Miss Willard, in this letter, renews her profession of the false faith of the world.

MATTHEW SAINT QUAY, United States Senator from the State of Pennsylvania, has advanced from the unenviable position of political trickster extraordinary, which he held one year ago, to that of censor and guardian of the national morals. He is now the political mainstay of the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, the American Sabbath Union, and stands sponsor for the religious legislation which has been had in Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday. If these religious organizations were correct in their views of this legislation and its necessity, Mr. Quay and his unrighteousness would be all that stood between this Nation and divine wrath. The expiring flashes of the halo with which this Pennsylvania senator has surrounded his name during this session of Congress were seen on February 28, when, in the Senate, he presented petitions asking that Congress forbid the use of any Government building for inaugural festivities on Sunday, in view of the fact that it had been intended that the Marine Band should give a concert in the hall of the Pension Building as a portion of the inaugural ceremonies of President Cleveland. Mr. Quay opposed this on the ground that it would be a "national sin," and presented to the Senate a resolution, which was passed, calling on the Secretary of the Interior for information as to this contemplated desecration.

THE "Sabbath Observance Bicycle Club, of Brooklyn," is said to be an established and organized fact. The object of the club is, in its own words, "to publicly rebuke the increasing abuse of the Sabbath by bicyclists and to offer to conscientious wheelmen a circle of friends whose practices will not lead them to disregard the Lord and dishonor themselves." The name is printed in the Constitution of the club, as given. It is impossible not to compare such a name as this for a bicycle club with the strangely ill-assorted religious nomenclature used to designate streets, stores, public buildings, and organizations, in Roman Catholic countries. It is natural that it should be so suggestive, for the purpose of the organization is to preserve and perpetuate the Sunday which is a Roman Catholic institution.

Copies of numbers 7, 8, and 9, of the SENTINEL can still be had by ordering promptly. Numbers 7 and 8 contain matter in reference to the trial of Seventh-day Adventists in Henry County, Tenn., for Sunday labor. The present issue, (number 10,) also contains an extract from the statement of the Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, at the annual meeting of the association, in regard to those cases, and a reprint of the appeal and remonstrance to the Government and people of the United States adopted at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists in session at Battle Creek, Mich. This remonstrance alone should give this issue a wide circulation.
