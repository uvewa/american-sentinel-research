WHEN the National Reformers and American Sabbath Union orators are claiming that all "evangelical" preachers of the country are in sympathy with their movement, and are putting forth the still worse claim that the Sunday legislation of Congress last July is not in conflict with the Constitution, it is at least a consolation, even some pastors of Presbyterian churches and some pastors of the same, can and can see in the other that such is not the case, as note the following from the Chicago *Herald*, of recent date:—

"Rev. W. A. Bachelder, of the First Presbyterian Church (Colgrove Park, Wis.), was the subject of charges of heresy brought by a number of elders to such a pitch that they have determined the Presbytery also opposed a demand to have him brought before the synod. Several elders, however, who support the pastor,

stand in the way and may prevent any action. Mr. Bachelder's preaching is wholly a protest against all classes. He is opposed to the opening of the Fair Sunday, and said that the clergymen petitioning to provide a proviso for the work of Christians in Chicago, he declared that it be opened on Sunday is unconstitutional and destructive.

Whatever else may be the result of the agitation of this Sunday question in connection with the closing of the Fair, it is certain to lead many to a correct understanding of the proper relation of Church and State.
