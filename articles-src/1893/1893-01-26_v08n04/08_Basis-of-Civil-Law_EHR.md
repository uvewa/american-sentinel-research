THE Christian Patriot asks this question:

If you refuse to base legislation on the moral convictions of the majority of the people, on what will you found it?

The editor of the *Christian Patriot* seems hopelessly bound to a centre stake around which he travels in a never ending circle, *i. e.*, the idea that civil law must, of necessity, be based on the "moral convictions" of the people; and according to his view, moral convictions and religious convictions are synonymous terms. For many years people of a poetic or romantic turn of mind have had the idea, and freely expressed it, that all law is based upon the ten commandments. This all sounds very beautiful, but it has no foundation in fact.

All just, civil laws are based upon the inherent rights of all men. In other words, all just laws are but the development or the expression of rights already existing. Justice is eternal, self-existing and self-evident, and the only province of legislation is to protect rights, not to accord them.

Too many people assume, without a second thought, that Sunday legislation is based upon the moral convictions of the majority of the people, when, in fact, the real basis is the narrow, bigoted opinions of a number of church members.

"The people" have never been consulted in this matter, and were the question fairly canvassed and submitted to them, Sunday laws would be snowed under by an overwhelming majority, and the advocates of the measure know it well, and so they resort to threats of boycott, to fraudulent, padded petitions to bolster up an unrighteous, unholy movement.

It is the moral conviction of the majority of church members in the United States, that sprinkling and pouring, only, are baptism and they exclude immersion. Would these people be justified in forcing their views upon the minority, simply because they, the majority, considered immersion vulgar or immodest? And yet the same principle obtains in regard to Sunday legislation.

One grave mistake made by the editor of the *Christian Patriot* and by many other people, is, in taking it for granted that the "moral convictions" of the majority are necessarily right and true. It is a sad but undisputable fact that in all ages of the world, the lovers of eternal truth and justice have been in the minority, and the very principle advocated by Mr. Converse has invariably led to the persecution of the minority by the bigoted uncharitable majority.

Had *Christian Patriot* views been carried out, we would have had no Luther or Calvin, no Wesley or Roger Williams, for these would have submitted to the "moral (?) convictions" of the majority.

It may be, as the *Patriot* says, that "the State can not do theoretical or exact justice;" but it can do one thing, and that is, attend to its own affairs, mind its legitimate business; turn its attention to affairs within its own jurisdiction.

The editor of the *Christian Patriot* admits that a Seventh-day Adventist or a Mohammedan would have a theoretical right to be protected in his observance of another day than Sunday, but immediately follows it up with the statement that to grant him such rights would be practical injustice. How a thing can be theoretically right and practically wrong, is beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals. Perhaps Mr. Converse can reconcile his paradoxes.

"On what will you found legislation?" asks the *Patriot*.

On the same basis recognized by the founders of our Government, the framers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution—the natural, eternal, self-evident, inherent rights of all men; not the rights of the majority only.

It is an almost worn-out saying that "right wrongs no man," and it is childish and absurd to say, that to grant to any man his natural right, will wrong some other man.

It has yet to be shown that the work of any Seventh-day Adventist has ever disturbed a religious gathering on Sunday. The only thing that ever disturbed Sunday-keepers seems to have been the fact that a mile or so from the church was a man who presumed to have views of his own and preferred the Bible to the traditions of men.

It appears remarkably strange that while the Sunday-keepers of Springville, Tenn., are annoyed, and their "moral sensibilities" are shocked, at the thought of a few God-fearing, Bible Sabbath-keepers working on a day that has no sacredness attached to it, nobody is annoyed or disturbed, or shocked in any manner whatever by the smelting furnaces near Graysville, Tenn., which are never closed on Sunday.

"Mathematical justice is impossible in the political sphere," remarks the *Patriot*.

For over a hundred years, the Constitution has guaranteed religious liberty to the people of this country, and no one complained of any infringement upon their rights; no one felt that they were deprived of any privilege which was justly theirs: then why should not this state of things continue? One reason is that men are becoming selfish, bigoted, narrow-minded; that apostate Protestantism is reviving the spirit of her corrupt mother, Roman Catholicism. Another reason is that the Spirit of God has foretold this movement and it is inevitable.
