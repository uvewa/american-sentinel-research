An invaluable book, a copy of which should be in the hands of every Secretary's Manual. It is a complete compendium of a secretary's duties, from the most simple to the most complex, fully explaining, as it does, about every step of duty that a secretary will be called upon to perform. It is especially designed as a book of reference for secretaries of largely incorporated cities, giving points of law. Never before has a book of this character come under our notice, and we commend it to those who need such a manual as something they will not regret. Issued by the publishers, 244 pages; handsome binding. A complete edition. Price, $1.60, by Pacific a express. For further information also at 43 Bond St., New York, and by the author, W. C. Carnegy, Santa Paula, Cal.
