In the Apostolic Age there was the sharpest possible line of distinction between the Church and the world. "The world lieth in wickedness." "The whole world" was in rebellion against God. The condition of Gentile society is described in Rom. 1:21-32, and that of the Jews in the early chapters of the Acts. The truly frightful condition broadly described is confirmed by Paul in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. The Church was separated by its own code, poets, romancers, satirists, and by its own reforming philosophers.

Tacitus, Juvenal, Epictetus, Apollos, Barnabas, Martial, Lucian, have all left upon record a grand verdict of the same description. And the works of Seneca and of Pliny breathe the same verdict. "The world" and "the Church" were distinct in letter, and in every particular, not only at the first, but through the first and second centuries, Seneca, and Pliny.

But the triumphs of Christianity, which over and against the triumphs of Christianity, the latter's triumph in its identified purity. Through of towards the aspiration and spirituality not only to be shown the inner line of distinction but to widen and deepen. Instead the distinction came to be gradually lost and finally obliterated—"the gates of Christendom" say, while "paganism triumphed practically," achieves its loan upon the Cross, and the position of a losing empire.

But now let us glance at the other side: kingdom; but were victors themselves were vanquished. Now that we have looked at "the variegated rivals." The outward manifestation of the Church's weakness had been to open the door and to admit the world back into the seductions of the world, as the Apostles had foretold. Jude, in his short letter the defense, the hatred, contempt, and persecution of the world, were now to fight; for by her antidote. It may not be justifiable to dwell at too great a length on this side of the question, but it is clear that each victory to unreality and impostors the victory of the Church.

One gives mistake made by the Church; and a corruption of theology I do not here speak, but a corruption of morals. The two words were originally Christianity (the two words were originally almost interchangeable, and were distinguished from each other only in their rank, and since they were placed by their position in the family—one higher than the other.

upon the Cross, and the position of a bishopric became one of.

State, entreats worldly convenience, etc.

In absorbing for the same took its place. Christian bishops lived in splendor and luxury and in hopes abolished, and from joining in the turbulent intrigues of politics and partisans. Those began to flaunt to expect ecclesiastical comforts became a purple and gold and enriched with gems. They reveled in such articial and inflating titles as "Your Eminence" and "Your Sanctity," and when they said a people's right, living in this changed.

2. Like in this changes. If worldly— Like, indeed, so like is the Spirituality fully invaded the ranks of the episcopate, that was hardly surprised to find. The emphasis among the Christian laity. There is enough to show, and to show impressively in the picture of the state of Christianity at Rome itself which is given us by Saint Jerome, who came to it as to a very art in the world's religion, and found it an intolerable Babylon, seething with worldliness, intrigue, lust, murder, and corruption.

3. Another sign of evil pagan influence within the Church was the new literature. The appeals of the early assemblies tell the same story of corrupt morals. Descriptions which sounded like the voice of names of the darker hues of the dark ages afar like thunder. Already in Cyprian's time, much of this similarity had vanished. It had been destroyed by leading familiarities and mutual admiration, the cause of Christ. Christians, as Saint Chrysostom tells us, would go direct from their church to pagan shows; they passed and jostled each other to get first to the Holy Table, they turned the grand festival into scenes of drunkenness; and excess. The bishops of this era told the same tale in the rhetoric of their preacher, but paid no attention to his entreaties, flocked back to the application, and absented themselves from the prayer.

4. But the worship itself—which was a stronghold—had been attacked in two directions assimilated to paganism. If the Church was so debased that in secular life, after a time began to have been charges and to have been made of showy secular and idle displays. Fanatism Manchester through an outward show; and the same charge must be made against the orthodox.

The charge of paganism upon its own Christianity and Christian worship is not semi-idolatry. At first Christianity was utterly opposed to certain rites and certain churches; but they have become current. Bronsdon speaks of what he calls the "Christian idolatry," which was thus gradually introduced.

To this charges of paganized religion in gatherings is also admittedly proved by the reputed admissions of confessedly orthodoxy.

It is nothing less to touch on the prevailing role-worship and cross-worship which had been so often charged on the Catholic with sickness of sub-adore (instructori) and say:—

5. The pernicious influence of paganism showed itself in two other directions—in literature and government. The writings of the Apostolic Fathers are gentle and dignified. In time, however, as in the case of Saint Jerome, controversy was conducted with rabid abuse. In which words and epithets were used, disgraceful to any one, and more especially to holy men and trebly disgraceful to a Christian. Withal Jerome was so much a master of vituperation, that his like controversies—too coarse for translation, and to

this day, I deeply regret to say, their vital and degraded is followed in the course of what are called religious and semi-religious newspapers.

6. Woven hardly to surprised that when to all is man a "pope," and "a sovereign," and "a greater" "an impostor, Daniel, is regarded as a descendant," or a most unjust way of saying that you disagree with him, wield persecuted into and cruel visitation should specially be resorted to for the enforcement of religious opinions.

Paganism had been assimilated in still other directions in which the Church claims, in fact, the point of its connection with the world. These, however, assimilate, and they finished absorbing, breaking the relations of one for the other.

But it is enough for our present inquiry that the Church must renew her vigilance of a forgets that even a nominally Christian world may still be essentially of the world only, civilizations and all.
