*(Concluded next week.)*

IS Sunday being required to join in a measure of Parliament praying that the sale of liquor might not be conducted on the Sabbath? See my answer in the issue of December 29, 1892.—

We are always happy to say anything whatever in the cause of temperance. We do not regard temperance laws as an end, a handmaid of religion, but as being a permanent part of religion. Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, charity, and to the graces, the possession of which the Apostle Peter declares will make men fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Temperance, therefore, is at a high rate; and it means much more than merely letting intoxicating liquors; but that alone does seem to be worthy of much more attention. While nominally a total abstainer from strong drink, real temperance includes the man, and nothing less than that can have any claim upon the civil law. And true temperance really implies the possession of all the Christian graces. In the Scripture temperance is classed with faith, patience. It is the genuine fruit of the Lord Jesus Christ.

The first question to be settled, and indeed the only question, is whether or not the Sunday-closing movement is really a temperance movement. And it must first be admitted that although a movement may have a tendency to promote temperance, yet the most ardent temperance people may consistently oppose it if it is evident that it will not accomplish the purpose of temperance. Much more is this true, if on the other hand it appears that its opponents are really more honest in the matter, and that it really tends to the establishing and strengthening of the liquor traffic. Without in the least questioning the sincerity of those who advocate Sunday closing of public-houses, we are the advocates of the minority also in the interest of intemperance rather than on the memorial and from the *Reporter* are one and the same.

In the argument against Sunday closing last Sunday, we find the following:—

To place Sunday closing at a disadvantage is to place Sunday closing where it has been referred to the inhabitants direct for their decision in every case and defeated. At present there are few districts, probably none, where, if the power of granting or refusing licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors or the privilege proposed to give the temporary powers will be exercised and will succeed. Thus it may safely be assumed that the publican's attempt which in a few districts, Sunday closing might be carried. Even if the authority to pass Sunday closing laws could hardly be better used, were not prepared to vote for closing shut up in a district from prohibition. In such a case the line of conduct demanded by Christian statesmanship seems clear. To make the real issue.

ONLY A QUESTION OF DAYS.

SINCE the above opinion and argument are own. It is clear enough that the stopping of the liquor traffic is not the

object of the proposed legislation. Neither to the movement prompted by opposition to the liquor traffic; is itself "directed." Prohibition is needy to this time when it is carried out. It is a question of days only, and not the selling of liquor. This appears further in the following extract from the same source:—

There are the liquor-selling business and are opposed to the movement for Sunday only, as "they are reproduced even by those who acknowledge the rightfulness of their traffic"—that is, there are publicans themselves, for even one common-man's serious thought of the question will show clearly beyond all argument that the interests of the men that will curtail their own business are greater by far than any motive they have; yet if the balance comes of our Sunday closing, unless there be any looking to the publican direct, the advocates would never be forced to the favoring side of a totally restrictive measure, and thus would diminish by one-seventh the sale of liquor, and temperance people everywhere were found assenting the sale of liquor, by which they get publicans in favor of Sunday closing? Because the publican knows that the closing will not in the least diminish the sale of their commodities.

This will be still more apparent by another extract from the *Reporter*, quoted above. It is said that at the last meeting of the Licensed Victuallers' Association in this district, "Mr. Rowley observed, as an old publican, that, if the people were forced to close, the people would be the closing of the public houses on Sunday entirely. They could spend a few shillings and put in a stock; but if opened with a publican, without disturbance and without any show of disorder, to do, to make their money here in town, and if they have a good home stock, and all their money at the public-houses to buy drink for one or two days together at least even that long, and therefore what is the gain? We lose the custom of seven days for that of six, and for all of Sunday? When the publicans can get their goods in as easily and at as low prices as before, what is the use of their working it. But with every true step in the right direction, we must say yes."

This is therefore the exactly the answer to set to any degree whatever a temperance question: Sunday closing will not diminish the amount of liquor sold and consumed.

On the contrary, it is in a reality to give the liquor trade a new opportunity for greater respectability. We do not mean to say that every one who believes that any such closed is in view; but that will be their result. They go beyond it, and all honest people ought to look at it as it stands; if they are successful, will be to interest the entire country, in fact our whole people, before. It is evident because the very spirit of our National Government has always regarded as a religion—not the right of the traffic to exist, and puts it on the interest and the privilege of all to tempt to stop the sale of liquor on Sunday will not be to stop the liquor traffic, but to sell on any other day of the week. But it does not do so, for purely civil and secular reasons.

AN APT ILLUSTRATION.

A little illustration will make this point clearer than much argument. Suppose a clergyman observed his boy stealing from another. One of them near her little boy out front, another boy stealing an apple and the boy cries out to him, "Willie, you must not steal on Sunday;" would that boy be "wrong?" Would Willie get the idea that it is all to do evil his heart? No; and
