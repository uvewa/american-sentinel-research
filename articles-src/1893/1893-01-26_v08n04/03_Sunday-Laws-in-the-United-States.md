*(Continued.)*

BUT the fact is clear enough without authority that Sunday laws penalize a religious dogma, and that they constitute the law an enforcer of religious duties. "Now let us state, again, to this religious character of Sunday law—the side of the coin sinister and the side of the constituted. So far as the latter is concerned, the real spirit of such legislation has been finally stated by a North Carolina judge, who says that work on Sunday "offends us not so much because it disturbs us in practicing for ourselves the religious exercises or in enjoying the salutary repose or rest of the day, as that it is *in itself a breach of God's law and a violation of the party's own religious duty.*" In plainer truth, one more clearly and fully stated: the law-givers have provided that while they seek to ignore and every duty it was never prescribed for. Thus, all the constrained are concerned, the object of the law is to compel them to perform a religious duty, and to punish all who violate it, though no right or privilege of any citizen is invaded, and no one is injured.

In strict accordance with this view are the New Hampshire decisions on the point of Sunday-closing as a "disturbance" of one person by another on Sunday. At first sight it might seem most unjudicial, to provide that no work should be done on Sunday if the disturbance to others, as is done in New Hampshire. But the value of the qualification is this: It was the novel by the judicial construction.

The court has taken the North Carolina view of the case in the Tennessee courts yet "acts calculated to turn the attention of the citizens from their appropriate religious duties" to matters of more worldly concern, and hence it is settled in that State that business, however quietly conducted, on Sunday, "disturbs" "others," and that a man is "disturbed," though he be willing and anxious to do business on Sunday, by the doing of it, or by any act, however voluntary, which tends to disturb him from religious observance.

The Tennessee courts have taken substantially the same view of the matter of disturbance as the courts of North Carolina and New Hampshire. The "disturbs" and "nuisance" charged in the indictments for Sunday work is the fact that the work is done on Sunday, and it is not necessary to show that anybody has been disturbed. The courts assume that Sunday work shocks the moral sense of the community, and it is not even necessary that any body should see the work done or even know about it being done. If Sunday work is respected and the community does not even know that same family, it is a nuisance under the judicial legislation of the Tennessee courts.

ANYPOINT in Mr. Blaigdell's article worthy of special matter, is that Sunday laws are not necessary to protect religious services from disturbance. Religious meetings of all kinds are held every day and night of the week and no one thinks of being disturbed except on Sundays when work not-on-to, not one hundredth part as much toil is going on. If it is necessary to have a law against disturbing public worship? If asking a law is working itself, it is a law in favor of religious. Otherwise, one will surely be punished for remarking to this committee that the disturbance is "too thin."

The *Industrial World*, of the 3rd ult., has this to say of the imprisonment of Adventists in Tennessee:

The record of the Tennessee courts is the best of a religious reputation. The Sunday closing of this community has proved the proof that the same severe, nonsectarian Sunday laws have been enacted.

If these statements are to the spirit and purpose of the law, and they are; then a judge and jury have it by removing the disturbance and taking out the finger of the Tennessee—. Further, here in America is to be more than the inventing and creating of crime in the courts for the courts there can be no use and no demand for false imprisonment. The claims along that we shall point the hand of all within it for if they are not stricto et of this. An injury to an otherwise old, known to all of such. Make history.

It is the moral conviction of the majority of church members in the United States, that establishing and evening coffee are baptism and they exclude themselves. Would those people be justified in forcing their views upon the minority, simply because they, the majority, constitute them immersion vulgar or immolest? And yet the same principle obtains in regard to Sunday legislation.

One gives mistake made by the editor of the *Christian Patriot* and the same other people, is, in taking it for granted that a "moral" conviction of the majority are necessarily right and true. It

ment of honest, conscientious citizens for doing Sunday work; and also is not yet, in Henry Co. County, Tennessee, on the 30th of this month. Those to be tried are Adventists out of a total church membership of less than twenty members; but they are to answer before the District Court of their faith, and the proceedings of the attorney themselves to prosecute every man, woman, and child if these shall defy the Sunday work.

Others. How the words "to the disturbance of others" came to be inserted in the New Hampshire statute it may not be possible to state, but there can be little doubt that they would have been stricken out but for the constitutional ground by the framers of that statute that such words might be taken to mean that a man might do as he pleased on Sunday, if he only did it quietly. Here is no doubt that the court, as it is duty bound, gave effect to the legislative intent in the view of the object of the Sunday law.

There are other considerations which may be noted here in connection with the subject of "disturbance." Even if the disturbance courts were to come now, and the word was meant to apply to other than the one doing the work, there would be no saving efficacy in the phrase. The question is one of right—not of quantity—who is to determine whether or not man is disturbed or disturbed by the act of another? If the first amendment is to be taken as establishing of the subject, of course there is no use in having such words in the statute; but when we admit that the question of the disturbances of men is one for judicial determination, it follows that a statute with this qualification involves a fatal inconsistency with the very purpose of all Sunday laws. For, without any statute whatever, the existing provision of the legal system jurisprudence protects every citizen from disturbance. Any court which "disturbs" others is infraction of the law. By "disturb," in this part of the law, is to infringe on some right or privilege, not to know a person made aware of it.

When, therefore, the law recognizes no privilege in any citizen to do Sunday what he lets on so other day, and considers that others a Sunday which will not serve to justify disturbance on any other day, we are driven to the conclusion that the basis of Sunday, is which is thus honored, the right to work is not the right which in itself. In every American constitution the right is a guaranteed expressly or impliedly, and it exists at all times. Nor does it matter that the person at once seeing this may be, unless it be limited with respect. Only man has to respect the hour of the day or night, and talk religion or infidelity, or come of observance. What special "right" is it, then, which is attached to the observer of Sunday, and which disturbs no rights any any other day?

There are other rights infinitely associated with the right of exercising which are worth preserving. The right to rear a family with a deserving regard for the institutions of Christianity, and without compelling them to attend showy half-religious of "one of six fundamental laws."

That is to say, Sunday statutes are passed to compel men to observe a "fundamental law" of Christianity for the benefit of another man's children. But a

statute passed for the purpose of enforcing a law, fundamental or otherwise, of any particular religion gives a "preference" to that religion. No such law can ever be accorded to a like law of every other creed.

Thus authorities are adduced for the effort to establish the proposition that Sunday laws embody a preference of one religion over another, *not merely,* as a proper in an article written for a law magazine to show that this fact has, at least in some cases, been frankly stated or applied by the learned courts.

This the writer proceeds to show and quote a fact of it all the courts in the country desired it, and all. All the distinctions of all-fours in law are all disposed of by those which the courts give an evidence of intent. The decision of a court may settle whether or not a city may restrain commerce, and still leave to reflect upon the question of the origin, intent and character of its ordinances. We to the more numerous decisions before us expressing especially among the latest cases will take what is known and we think is by no means what the court has to give us, whatever as evidence of the corrections of due law at all, is of a domestic, ecclesiastical, and in fact, of historic full.

It has been said that it has not been presented fully or clearly enough is that Sunday laws and the principle is that they are not adapted and may not be used to the character as religious or other; it is a principle the operation of which is disregard results from its refusal to act upon, but to recognize the equality of citizens whereby to determine whether a meeting place has been secured.

It is true—and we freely concede it—that the character of a *Spiritual* contiguity was formed by the operation of what they claimed to be a just system: but this is not the point to the jury. The "nuisance" of Sunday work, the real impossibility of settling any rule for establishing a balance of such a plan of life dispute are self evident. It is a question—

An American has the right to labor and to follow or not to follow a calling which everybody else follows. And the question of which Adventist or what day of Sunday or what religion of any judge can decide in this country that the people are "disturbed" by working on a day he called religious. It is a religious, not a civil question.

It is quite a verdict as well as a question, and it exists at all times. Nor does it quite as much a misconception for a judge and a jury to find a verdict against such on such a verdict as it is of others as it was in fact, a "disturbance" to himself, to a jury himself.

But every work in practice is the same as the assembly and any other in the production of its articles. If there is no disturbance whatever exists for attempting such a disturbance of a church service, and the like many other facts, it is to demonstrate from history that fact or this side of the line—that a religious assembly is disturbed by a neighbor who works; and by such work disturb any other assembly, and by no work, under the same conditions, would not at all unite and condition of the disturbance. The orderly and regular work of the farm or the shop is not a disturbance of those present to keep abreast of what the real sense of the community is. Such things require precisely the same things that they are to properly and precisely. This, again, is not matter of law, but fact.
