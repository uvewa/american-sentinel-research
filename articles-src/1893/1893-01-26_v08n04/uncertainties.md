# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, January 26, 1893 (v08n04)

## General Note

This issue presented significant OCR/transcription challenges. The B&W scans at 300 DPI and even re-extracted at 600 DPI contain very small body text that is difficult to read reliably. Many passages throughout all articles have LOW to MEDIUM confidence. The articles most affected are the longer ones spanning multiple columns and pages.

## Article 01: "The Congressional Precedent and Religious Legislation" (WHM)

### Page 1, Column 1

### Page 1, Column 1

## Article 02: "How Christianity Became Part of the Common Law of England"

- **Confidence:** LOW — The actual title of the work is unclear.

- **Confidence:** LOW throughout.

### Page 2, Right Column (French legal quote)
- **Transcribed as:** "A tiel leis que ils de seint eglise ont en ancien scripture, nostre ley cet credence"

- **Confidence:** LOW — The word "sinister" and surrounding text may be different.

- Several passages about New Hampshire and Tennessee case law are difficult to read with certainty. The legal arguments are dense and the small text makes accurate reading challenging.

### Page 3, Author attribution

## Structural Note

The relationship between some articles is unclear. Material about the Tennessee Adventist cases and Sunday law appears in multiple places: the "Sunday Laws in the United States" reprint (pages 3-4), the editorial notes (page 8), and possibly elsewhere. Some text may have been incorrectly assigned between articles.
