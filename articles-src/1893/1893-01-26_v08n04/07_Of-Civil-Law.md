The *Christian Patriot* asks this question:

Is there no basis in legislation on the moral convictions of the majority of the people, so what is it?

The editor of the *Christian Patriot* then immediately found by a course state around which he travels in a never ending circle, i. e., he, this that civil law and law of morality, be based on the "moral convictions" of the people, and according to his view, moral convictions and religious convictions are practically one. For many years people of a positic or romantic turn of mind have had this idea; and I freely expressed it, that all law is based upon the two commandments. This foundation in fact—

All just law, and all laws based upon the inherent rights of all men. In other words, all laws are based in nothing else; it is only justice—the expression of rights already existing. Justice is inherent, self-existing, and self-evident, and the only province of honest men to guard.

Too many people assume, without a thought of investigation, that "morality" is based upon the moral convictions of the people. The fact is, however, that the real basis is the narrow, bigoted opinions of a few lawyers and half-read bishops.

"The people" have never been consulted in this matter; and when the question fairly canvassed and submitted to them by an overwhelming majority, and the advocates of the minority also as well, and so they exact to threats of boycott, to fraudulent, packed juries, etc.

It is the moral conviction of the majority of church members in the United States, that sprinkling and pouring, coffee are baptism and they exclude immersion. Would those people be justified in forcing their views upon the minority, simply because they, the majority, constitute them immersion vulgar or immodest? And yet the same principle obtains in regard to Sunday legislation.

One gives mistake made by the editor of the *Christian Patriot* and the same other people, is, in taking it for granted that a "moral" conviction of the majority are necessarily right and true. It

is a sad but indisputable fact that in all ages of the world, the lovers of deceit and justice have been in the minority, and they were in general allowed by Mr. Converse has invariably led by the persecutions of the majority for by the bigoted ecclesiastical majority.

Had Christian belief views been carried out, we would have no Luther or Calvin, no Wesley or Roger Williams; for these would have suffered—as the "moral" convictions of the majority. A "moral conviction" of the majority of the citizens of a State does not establish a religion. State has not do theoretical or exact justice to every citizen, but that it has no right to attend to its own affairs, mind its own business and make room for its citizens to make their own in its own jurisdiction.

The editor of the *Christian Patriot* objects that a Seventh-day Adventist in Montana maintains that it would be a right to be protected in its observance of the Sabbath according to his conscience, and boldly follows it up with the statement that to grant this man rights would be theoretically right and practically wrong, because, in his opinion, every citizen has rights.

Perhaps Mr. Converse can see it now.

"What will you find coming?"

On the same basis recognized by the framers of our Constitution, and of the Declaration of Independence and none at all, we hold that all men are created equal, self-evident, inherent natural right; we hold the rights of the majority only.

It is an absolute wrong, and no majority can rightfully do wrong, to take the right of any man who has not, without his own act, forfeited his natural right, and wrong most assuredly to do it.

But yet to be shown that the work of Tennesseeans be allowed the same rights; and by a judge and jury, to disturb a religious gathering on Sunday.

A bishop—even keeps to be a man who pretended to have views on justice—and the court, and a man who pretended to have views on justice, and his honor and his court.

It is apparent remarkably strange that the people of the United States, at the Twenty, one, are annoyed, and their "moral sense" is shocked by the quiet, every-day work of a few God-fearing, Bible Sabbath-keepers! and then with religious show with religion attached to it, to boldly is annoyed or disturbed by the smallest this that makes whatever by the smallest and dullest of human agencies.

"Mathematical justice is impossible in the following."

For a few hundred years, the Question of the right has been, as it were, the Magna Charta of the country, and to one has the right to the whole of more than the people, of this country, and to one their right; no one felt the right of others and they were the stronger by far.

The religion of Jesus has not at all sufficient vitality to stand, independent of human law, then let it fall.—*Joseph Gleason.*
