[Upon being requested to join in a memorial to Parliament praying that the sale of liquor might be stopped on Sunday, the Present Truth, published in London, Eng., made the following response in its issue of December 29, 1892:—]

We are always glad to see any advancement in the cause of temperance. We do not regard temperance as an aid to or a handmaid of religion, but as being a necessary part of religion. Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, charity, are the graces, the possession of which the Apostle Peter declares will make one fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Temperance, therefore, is not a light matter. It embraces total abstinence from all intoxicating liquors; but that alone does not constitute the whole of temperance. While nominally a total abstainer from intoxicating liquor passes for a temperate man, and nothing less than that can have any claim to be called temperance, true temperance really implies the possession of all the Christian graces. In the Scriptures temperance is classed with righteousness. It is the outgrowth of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

The first question to be settled, and indeed the only question, is whether or not the Sunday-closing movement is in reality a temperance measure. It will readily be admitted that although a movement may profess to be for the promotion of temperance, yet the most ardent temperance man is bound to stand aloof from it if it is evident that it will not accomplish anything for temperance. Much more is this true, if on the other hand it appears that its supporters are wholly deceived in the matter, and that it really tends to the upbuilding and strengthening of the liquor traffic. Without in the least questioning the sincerity of those who are laboring so earnestly for the securing of Sunday closing of public-houses, we are bound to say that the movement is in the interest of intemperance rather than of temperance. A few points taken from the memorial and from the Reporter will make this appear.

In the argument against Sunday closing by local option, we find the following reason:—

It will place Sunday closing at a disadvantage in relation to other questions. If the matter could be referred to the inhabitants direct for their decision there would be less objection to it, because there are few districts, probably none, where, if the people had the power, they would not close public-houses on Sundays. But the bodies to whom it is proposed to give the necessary powers will be elected on many issues, and there will be many personal and local considerations. Amongst them, in not a few districts, Sunday closing might be lost sight of and not obtained, though the people would have welcomed it. Even if the authority were elected solely to deal with the liquor traffic, it must be remembered that Sunday closing is quite distinct from prohibition. In such a case the election would turn on prohibition, and Sunday closing might be lost to the district because its inhabitants were not prepared to vote for closing public-houses seven days in a week.

## ONLY A QUESTION OF DAYS.

The italics in the above quotation are our own. It is clear enough that the stopping of the liquor traffic is not the object of the proposed legislation. Neither is the movement prompted by opposition to the liquor traffic in itself. The objection is solely to the time when it is carried on. It is a question of days, and not of the selling of liquor. This appears further from the statement that those who are in the liquor-selling business and are opposed to the movement for Sunday closing "are in a miserable minority," and that "they are repudiated even by their own class." Now anyone who takes time for even one moment's serious thought well knows that no people will favor a movement that will curtail their own business. The drapers would not for a moment listen to any proposition looking toward the limiting of their sales of clothing, the shoemakers would never be found favoring an act of Parliament which would diminish by one-seventh the sale of shoes, and least of all will the publicans ever be found assenting to a proposition to curtail the sale of liquor, by which they get their living. The statement that publicans are in favor of Sunday closing is the strongest proof that Sunday closing will not in the least diminish the amount of liquor consumed.

This will be still more apparent by another quotation from the Sunday Closing Reporter. It is said that at the last meeting of the West Derby Board of Guardians, "Mr. Beesley observed, as an old publican, that the best thing for the people would be the closing of the public-houses on Sunday. Workingmen who had only five or six shillings a week to spend with a publican, without distressing their families, had quite enough to do to make their money last them six days." Exactly. The people can spend all their money at the public-houses in six days, and have hard work to make it last even that long, and therefore what is the use of keeping the houses open on Sunday? When the publicans can get all the money of their customers in six days what is the use of their working seven days to get only the same amount? As the Reporter says, "This is candid testimony." It is indeed; but it is fatal to the idea that the Sunday-closing movement is to any degree whatever a temperance measure, or that it will in the least diminish the amount of liquor sold and consumed.

On the contrary, it is in reality a movement to clothe the liquor traffic with greater respectability. We do not mean that the Sunday Closing Association has any such object in view, but that will be the result. They are beyond all doubt sincere in their efforts, but the outcome, if they are successful, will be to intrench the liquor business more firmly than ever before. This is evident because the very nature of the movement recognizes the right of the traffic to exist, and puts it on a level with "other trades." The attempt to stop the sale of liquor on Sunday is a tacit admission that it is all right to sell it on any other day of the week. It puts the liquor traffic on a level with any legitimate business.

## AN APT ILLUSTRATION.

A little illustration will make this more clear. Here are two ladies who are both very devoted observers of the Sunday. One of them sees her little boy out trundling his hoop on Sunday morning, and cries out to him, "Willie, you must not play with your hoop on Sunday; it is wrong." Would Willie get the idea that it is a sin to roll his hoop? Would he, if requested on Monday to take a run with a playmate, say, "My mother says that it is wicked to roll hoops"? Certainly not. The fact that his mother specified the day of the week, when she bade him not to roll his hoop, showed plainly that the thing itself was not wrong in her eyes, but that she was troubled only for the desecration of the day.

But the other lady sees her boy out in the garden beating a poor, harmless kitten. Will she call out to him, "Jack, don't you know that it is wrong to beat kittens on Sunday? Leave off at once"? Indeed she will not. She will peremptorily command that he stop beating the kitten, and call him to account for cruelty to animals. Not a word will be uttered in regard to the day. And Jack will not get the idea that it is all right to beat kittens provided he does not do it on Sunday. Now why this difference in the way the two ladies reprove their sons? Simply this, that the first boy is doing a thing which is all right in itself, but which would be wrong if there were any sacredness to Sunday; while the second boy is doing a thing which is wrong in itself, no matter what the day, and no more wrong at one time than at another.

From this it will appear that the movement to stop the sale of liquor on Sunday is simply an effort to enforce the observance of Sunday. Indeed, the memorial states that the measure "is based upon the peculiar character and circumstances of the day." It is a movement wholly in the interest of religion, but not true religion, however, for true religion was never aided in any way by civil legislation. Religion is a matter between the individual and his God, with which government has nothing to do. Since the foundation of the world, every attempt to uphold religion by civil law has been a victory for the devil. This seems like strong language, but a few words will show that it is warranted.

True religion is an affair of the heart and life, and not of form. "Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." James 1: 27, R. V. And "if any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his heart, this man's religion is vain." Verse 26. Now it must be evident to everyone that government can not do anything that will in any way change a man's heart. Civil legislation can not in the least degree affect a man's life and character. It can no more make a man religious than it can cure him of consumption. But the effect of all religious legislation is to cause men to think that religion is but an outward form—that he who complies with the civil law has discharged all the obligations of religion. This has invariably been the result. Therefore the inevitable outcome of all religious legislation is to lower the standard of religion among the people.

It is evident, therefore, that the sincere, well-instructed Christian must be the one who is the most opposed to all religious legislation. As lovers of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of his gospel, we could not for a moment admit the right of any government on earth to meddle in any way with religious questions. And our opposition to such legislation would not in the least be diminished if the thing sought to be enforced were right in itself. As a matter of fact, Sunday observance has not the slightest warrant in the Scriptures, but if it had, the principle of the case would not be altered. It is a religious, and not a civil institution, and therefore with it the State has no business to deal.

The fact that men have long been accustomed to regard the day, and that the observance of it is almost universal, does not give the State any right in the matter. Surely it will not be claimed that all the world combined are equal in importance to the Lord Jesus Christ. He alone is a greater majority than all men together. But he did not use force to bring people to his ways. Said He, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." John 13:47. Nay, he prohibited his followers from using force in any way. When the multitude came with swords and staves to take Jesus, and Peter, having a sword, drew it and cut off the ear of one of the men, Jesus healed the wounded man, and said to Peter, "Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I can not now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?" Matt. 26:52-54. Jesus could in an instant have put all those men to flight. He had power enough to compel all men to acknowledge his claims. But then the object for which he came on earth would not have been accomplished. He came to convert men by the power of his own life of love, and not to change their actions only, without their hearts being affected. And even so is the object of the gospel frustrated whenever any of His professed followers think to advance it by the arm of civil law. This question has to do with the very heart of the gospel, and therefore we shall have much to say about it in the future.
