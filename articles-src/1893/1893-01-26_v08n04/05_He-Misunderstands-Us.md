A PHYSICIAN in Tennessee has sent us several copies of the SENTINEL, forwarded to a gentleman in the State of Washington, writes as follows:—

Green River, Tenn., Jan. 6, 1893.

Dear Sir—Enclosed please find some copies of the *American Sentinel* for October 10, 1892, you say: "The whole trouble is at once done away with by letting religion alone and being no part of, or having anything to do with it in the support of denomination, but to be purely civil institutions." Also on same page, that "it being the rule of civil government to say nothing religion and all religious questions alone."

Now it does not seem to me that these positions are confronting the American people as perfectly as our Lord's direction requires; and as this is not the head of "Religious or Political—Which?" it should be "Religious and Political—Both?"

Now, my dear brother, you must allow me to differ with you, for the following reasons. In America in this comes to. Does the Constitution of the United States recognize God? The religious clause of the Constitution seems to say no. Now, what is the rule for all? Nothing of the kind. The Constitution protects every citizen alike, in leaving the citizen to be guided by any Bible or religion or creed; and has he no claim upon the statutes or the laws made under it. A ask of him from the government only to leave him the educational question, or to join with you in the faith, or to go to a meeting, or to do what when you undertake to prove from the Christian

Bible that Saturday is the Sabbath, for I am not a Seventh-day Adventist, though I believe that day is as just as much so as another and a better day. I shall confine myself particularly to asking for the sake partly with leading Protestant clergy, and that they and the government know that in this country is aimed at, and hence want to see it secured. We are glad that we have done.

In this way only can we ride successfully the disturbance thereof.

Our position, THE SENTINEL'S position, is a broad one. THE SENTINEL is an American paper. Our position, THE SENTINEL'S position, is that the Government of the United States is civil, and that all are under obligation to obey the laws of the land. But we deny that any human power has any right in the matters of religion, or to force any one by the Bible. The obligation is to God. The Bible, the rule of life, is purely a matter of obligations, and civil government has nothing to do with it.

Perhaps Mr. Converse can see it now.

On the same basis recognized by the framers of our Constitution, and of the Declaration of Independence and none at all, we hold that all men are created equal, self-evident, inherent natural right; we hold the rights of the majority only.

It is an absolute wrong, and no majority can rightfully do wrong, to take the right of any man who has not, without his own act, forfeited his natural right, and wrong most assuredly to do it.

"What will you find coming?"

The religion of Jesus has not at all sufficient vitality to stand, independent of human law, then let it fall.—*Joseph Gleason.*
