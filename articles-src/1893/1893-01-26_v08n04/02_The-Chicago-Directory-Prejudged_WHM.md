According to the Washington correspondence of the Mail and Express, of January 13, "Hon. John B. Robinson struck terror into the hearts of the Sabbath desecrators of Chicago by introducing into the House of Representatives today a resolution instructing the Attorney-General of the United States to sue for and recover the value of all souvenir coins issued to the World's Columbian Exposition in case the Exposition, from any reason whatever, is not kept closed on Sunday, and giving the United States Circuit Court in the district of Illinois jurisdiction to try the action."

The record of congressional proceedings for January 13 does not corroborate this statement. No such resolution as this anywhere appears, as introduced by Mr. Robinson or any other representative.

The statement, evidently, was premature. The confident way in which it is made, however, shows conclusively that such a resolution was prepared and its introduction intended. For what reason was it withheld? Perhaps because at the last moment it occurred to those having the resolution in charge that no possible interpretation could be put upon the resolution, or the legislation it would ask for, except that of a gratuitous threat. To presuppose law-breaking is contrary to the genius of all law. Shall Congress take it for granted in advance that the management of the World's Fair does not intend to observe the proviso attached to the appropriation, but does intend to keep the money? Would not such a resolution be an accusation of intended bad faith? Such a proceeding would be like issuing an indictment for a man on the supposition that he was going to commit a crime so as to have it in readiness in case he did; in fact prejudging him to be a criminal in intent and at heart. It would be quite another sentiment than terror which such a resolution would naturally inspire at Chicago. Although the resolution was not introduced, it is certain that such measures as this are in the minds of those who have promoted, and now defend, Sunday closing by congressional edicts. What do they mean? To see their intent it is well to recur to their own language.

They say that this resolution "struck terror into the hearts" of—the Chicago Directory, of course, for that is the body which has the responsibility of the business affairs of the Exposition. But the resolution was not introduced. How then could it have "struck terror"? This makes it perfectly clear that the intent of those who drew the resolution was looked forward to as attained, and the result desired was given out as achieved.

This measure and its imaginary results are but the logical continuation of the campaign of threat and boycott which has marked the whole course of this struggle to subvert constitutional principle, and establish congressional precedent for legislation on religious questions. The fact is, the precedent has been established and its supporters are ready to go to any length to maintain it.

But, although it is true that this indictment was not found against the Chicago Directory, and the court fixed in which they should be tried, yet it was true that the preliminary step was taken by the submission and adoption in the Senate of this resolution, offered by Senator Wilson:

Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be directed to transmit to the Senate a copy of the opinion of the law officer of the Government for his department under which he is disbursing the $2,500,000 in souvenir coins in aid of the World's Columbian Exposition appropriated by the Act of Congress, approved August 5, 1892, and conditioned upon Sunday closing; and also to transmit a copy of such regulations relative to the issuance and delivery of said coins as he may have established in pursuance of said opinion.

It will be remembered that the Solicitor of the Treasury was visited by a deputation of the American Sabbath Union present at the late hearings before the House Committee on the World's Fair. What is the opinion which they want from the Solicitor of the Treasury? Do they wish from him an opinion which will warrant the issuance of the indictment which has been withheld? This matter will bear much reading between the lines. It is more and more clearly evident that the end of this is not yet.
