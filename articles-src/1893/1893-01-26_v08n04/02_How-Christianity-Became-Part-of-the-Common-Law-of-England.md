THE following letter from Thomas Jefferson, which was published in the *Gospel Sickle* of October, 1888, page 155, is especially interesting just now in view of the fact that both the courts and the Congress of the United States and several of the States of the Union have, following the lead laid down by Justice Brewer, decided that Christianity is part of the common law of their respective States; while, in the more general line, the Supreme Court of the United States has declared that this is a Christian Nation. Mr. Jefferson's letter, published "in reply to an English work, 'Life and Corresponding' productions of Major Cartwright," is as follows:—

Monticello, in Virginia, June 5, 1824.

Dear Sir—I thank you for the copy of your letter of Feb. 29th, and for your valuable volume on the English Constitution. I have read this with pleasure and much approbation, and I think it has deduced the constitution of the English nation from its rightful root—the Anglo-Saxon.

It has always appeared to me that the difference between the Whig and the Tory of England is, that the Whig deduces his rights from the Anglo-Saxon source, and the Tory from the Norman.

And a very remarkable body of proof it is, of our right to these, in the reign of the Henrys, the Edwards, the Johns, etc., in which the averages who attempted to use the law as a tool of the church were combated, yet it is the same in the case of Christianity, that, in 15 Ed. 3, the commons established a principle which was to endure to all future times; for, though it has been often combated, it was never actually overcome; and it stands confirmed by the organs of all just power! And when I reflect that, between them, they stripped Christianity of all its pseudo-followers, had the origin of all just power, of the rights and powers and their predecessors could not surrender, our self-evident and the only province of honest men to guard the inherent and unalienable rights of man.

You will perceive by these details, that we have a great deal of work still before us. In the meanwhile state we consider them not otherwise than as combatants for the blessings of self-government, and that for that purpose expressly. They are fit men the—

But can they be made unchangeable? Can we pronounce them unalterable? . . . . Rights made the earth for the living, not the dead. Rights and powers can only belong to persons, not to things, not to mere matter unendowed with will. The dead are not even things. The particles of matter which composed their bodies make part of the bodies of a thousand other living beings.

Your of eighty four and some of eight one years, whose long life has been spent in acquiring and using the knowledge of the rights of those who are to follow and succeed, and whose knowledge and character entitled his opinions to what could not, while their fathers were yet living, were the result of the discovery of right and wrong in the social and civic—and thus, which in the course of old and long lives and devotion to study, they had developed. I offer you the assurance of my great respect for your person and character.

THOMAS JEFFERSON.

This letter was not published until after the death of Mr. Jefferson, who died July, 1826. In giving it to the American people, the editor says:—

Anything from the pen of the illustrious statesman of Virginia, is read with interest and attention. The following letter is important as relating to the inquiring mind. With political affairs, too, with safety partial, it is acknowledged in the canon of Mr. Jefferson's works, and therefore one, to, with safety partial is acknowledged in the canon of Mr. Jefferson's authority in matters of conscience and religion. The letter shows conclusively that he believed those privileges in neither.

"Mr. Jefferson has always denied that Christianity was ever a part of the common law. The following is a very condensed statement of his reasoning. Briton, Fleta, etc. are the works from which the dogmas of 'orthodoxy' "Now if the reader will look into the Year Book of H. 6, fo. 38, he will find that Christianity is not and never was a part of the common law, and that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the common law. And the judges who have cited this to be so have not at all been doing what the factions were yet pagan: at a time when they had no idea of Christianity. . . . . I think one might about now point to show when and by what class of people the question was first started."

In our year book, 34 H. 6, fo. 38 (1458), Prisot, C. J., gives his opinion in these words:—"A tiel leis que ils de seint eglise ont en ancien scripture, nostre ley cet credence," etc.

Translating "ancient scripture," into "holy scripture," which it is not, was the first false step; as those of holy church have an ancient writing. It was not even the Bible which Prisot cited; in a half and a half after the dictum of Prisot. Wingate was at once understood to mean the Holy Scriptures; the common law; copying the words of Finch, but citing Prisot, *wings* was at once understood to mean the Holy Scriptures, by the simple substitution of the S. Finch and Wingate. Hale follows in the same strain and without the same examination of the text. They all, therefore, quote as authority by those who have not scrutinized this quotation. And this is that which was established in 1767, that in the law is the common law. It is, as Dr. Finch saith in Finch's Law, page 5, Christianity was prevalent to the territorial courts at large and in the ecclesiastical courts that Christianity was prevalent to the territorial courts at all for ages, and what the character and operation of the ecclesiastical courts were, and in fact the religion and influence of the clergy upon the courts—all are well known.

And the accounts of Russel's case, 1 Finch's Abridgement, say so; and they all cite Prisot, 34, and all the common law. A little qualification, in Evans's case in 1767, and say, the ancestors of the State, who settled afford a law, the 9th, 11th, 15th, and 5th chapters of Massachusetts law. And in all the common law was, but are not all applicable; the common law; Bible, Testament and all are into the common law. The common law is based upon one set of courts and not upon another, and all scholarly's opinion and words "ancient scriptures" said by Prisot. Finch and his follower, Wingate, translate "ancient scripture" into "holy scripture" and so established it in the holy court, in Woolston's case, Ohio State court, and of these Lord Mansfield said; and each has set up this matter wrong, and now quotes it, "it mistakes it on its own authority. Here is an English work, 'Life and Corresponding' productions of Major Cartwright, and the source of authority for this judiciary forgery, a little qualification, in Evans's case in 1767, and say, the ancestors of the State, who settled afford a law, the 9th, 11st, 15st, and 5th chapters of Massachusetts law. Fortescue also presents a very clear and succinct view of the matter that you pay and your partners at this late day."

Things have changed but little since the time of Mr. Jefferson. "Christianity is a part of the common law" is still favored by our courts; true, the claim has been more thoroughly exposed, sixty-six years ago, but the principle has not been completely defeated. "Christianity" as a part of the common law, or any other civil law, is just as much an error now as it was then. No literary hinder that made "Christianity" a part of the common law has been examined; and the result of this examination resulted in this country in the impression
