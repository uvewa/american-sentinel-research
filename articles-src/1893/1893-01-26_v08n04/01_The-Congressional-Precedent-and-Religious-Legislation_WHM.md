ARE the citizens of the United States aware of the present crisis in this country? Time is in crisis. It involves the question—the Government is at stake—it is established. It involves the question as to whether this is to continue to be a government of the people, by the people, for the people, or is to become a hierarchy.

Every judicial precedent necessary to establish the authority of that hierarchy has now been set. The decision of Feb. 29, 1892, by the Supreme Court—the highest judicial authority known to an American citizen—completed the line of precedent and affirmed it. What remained?—That Congress should give to judicial precedent congressional action upon religion! This had long been sought in vain. But no sooner was the series of judicial precedent made complete by the decision of the highest court—the Supreme Court, than the legislation was immediately had.

That legislation was the passage of the Sunday-closing proviso for the World's Fair, in the first session of the Fifty-second Congress. This piece of religious legislation was marvelously well calculated to secure its result. The direct effort from the beginning has been to secure some precedent, however small, for congressional legislation upon religion. Only a foothold was sought. The Fifty-second Congress, except it repeal this Sunday-closing proviso, will have the immortal ignominy of having granted this foothold. Is the Congress willing to go so far into history? Is not some way for a compromise to be had? Can the responsibility of this Congress in this matter be shared?

There are few who do realize that responsibility, and *Desperate*. But that responsibility can not be avoided or shifted.

Why can the burden of the future support, at least, of this religious legislation be shared with others? Why can not the repeal be left to the next Congress?—Because when the next Congress convenes, the people of the United States and of the world will have been, for six months, subject to this law, and it will have been, for one month an *historical* precedent. It would be *ex post facto* legislation, indeed, to call for its repeal after it has been accomplished the full term for which it was enacted, and had gone into history. The Fifty-second Congress shares the burden—this—not that—with none. Neither the next Congress nor any succeeding Congress can capture the record. When this Congress shall have adjourned, if it will let its act pass by not merely complied, its act will be past remedy, completed.

Do the congressmen of the United States know that this legislation is *unconstitutional?* This question cuts close—close, very close home. It raises an ugly alternative. It either impugns their intelligence, or it convicts them of having knowingly legislated contrary to a strict prohibition of the Constitution, the fundamental and supreme law. Which horn of this dilemma will they take? Is it not much more honorable, more worthy, and much more publishable, to acknowledge the error and repeal the erroneous legislation? True, it was not only inaugurated, but openly said, in the daily press, that congressmen would hardly say anything by repealing the proviso that had been in error in passing it. Why, that insinuates a just one? An American gentleman made of such stuff as this! An American manhood of such stuff as this is in their pretended friends and supporters that this accusation comes from; is it just? The American people need not believe it. They will not believe it; and they have confided the highest political trust in the Nation to men of an inferior moral stamina that they will permit the principles upon which this Government was established to be subverted; before they will admit that they have made a mistake; and, with it they have time to undo the mistake before the consequences have become irreversible. Who is the friend? he who says, "Deny your wrong and conceal it?" or he who says, "Be a brave man, confess and mend?"

The American people wait to see whether they have sent, to the Congress of the United States, men—or what?

It has been said to those who would oppose all religious legislation—this as well as all else—and upon constitutional grounds: "You have had your day; your plea is now outlawed. The law has been passed, and is on the statute books. Those objections should have been made before Sunday closing became a law. They have no force now." Is it true that a constitutional objection is ever outlawed so long as the clause upon which it is based remains in the Constitution? Would it be proper to a robber to combat the plea that the robbery had been committed and therefore no prosecution could be had, that all action should have been previous to the commission of the crime? It is if the claim that because the people have already been robbed indeed, be that constitutional right has been taken away; and the claim that since the deed is done, no recovery, no repeal, is in order? Such a claim is not held for a moment; it is, in such case, their right to object, always and everywhere. More, it is their duty to object, and to keep objecting, till they recover the object, and let those who have taken from the citizens their rights listen to their congressmen.

The Chicago *Directory* has transmitted to the Washington correspondence of the *Mail and Express*, of New York City, this: "Dr. Thos. John. Dr. Robbins struck terror into the hearts of the Sub-Committee of Chicago by introducing into the House of Representatives a resolution calling on the President of the United States to sue for and recover the value of all silverware contributed to the World's Columbian Exposition in case the Exposition, from any reason whatever, is not kept closed on Sunday, and giving the United States Circuit Court, in the district of Illinois, jurisdiction to try the same."

The record of congressional proceedings for January 13 does not corroborate this statement. No such resolution or anything appears, as introduced by Mr. Morse, and no Federal Sunday law whatever.

The convenient way in which it is made, however, shows conclusively that such a resolution has not even been introduced. For what reason was it withheld? Perhaps because the Solicitor of the Treasury has already had the resolution in charge so that no possible legislation is necessary; the Solicitor, or the legislation it would ask for, except that of a gratuitous libel, a presumptive law-breaking inscrutiny to the point of law. Still, Congress takes it for granted in advance that the management of the World's Fair does not intend to observe the proviso attached to the appropriation, but does intend to keep the Sunday? Will not such a resolution be an accumulation of intended bad faith? Still another suggestion: Is it not a most arrogant demand for a man on the supposition that a court may find it advisable to favor him, to have it in readiness in case he did; in fact have the condition already made and signed and at heart. It would be quite another matter, and far more manly and becoming if such a resolution would naturally inspire at Chicago.

The resolution, therefore, was never introduced. It is certain that such insurance as the two sides of the question have provoked, and now denied, already produced in the more prominent church members has been of the "purest intent to Christianize" the Fair.

But there is "no intent to Christianize" that has ever been admitted or "entered into the hearts of"—the Chicago Committee. The Fifty-second Congress, which has the responsibility of the business affairs of the Exposition, knows that the resolution was not introduced. How then could it have a "moral terror?" This makes it perfectly clear that the letter to which the Committee refers was looked forward to as attained, and the resolution was in reserve for the emergency.

But the legal legitimacy of the constitutional proceedings—this the point that marked the whole course of this struggle for a governmental foothold—this is, to establish congressional precedent for legislation upon religion. The precedent is, the precedent has been, established and history is in readiness to easily be taught lessons.

But, although it is true that this indictment was not found against the Chicago directory as stated, yet it was the idea, and the preliminary step was taken in the last Congress, to go the full length. Though this resolution, offered by Senator Wilson:

*Resolved*, That the Secretary of State be directed to transmit to the Senate a copy of the receipt from the Columbian Commission and his department under which he is disbursing the appropriation made by the act of Congress, approved August 5, 1892, and conditions prescribed for such appropriation, and the delivery of souvenir coins as he may have enabled.

It will be remembered that the Solicitor of the Treasury declined to endorse the opinion of the American Sabbath Union counsel at that late hearing before the House Committee on the World's Fair. What is the opinion which they hope that the Solicitor of the Treasury? Do they hope from his an opinion which will warrant the issuance of the indictment which has been withheld? This matter will bear much reading between the lines. It is more and more clearly evident that the end of this is not yet.
