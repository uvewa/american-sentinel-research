WHILE the National Reformers and American Sabbath Union oracles are claiming that all "evangelical" preachers of the country are in sympathy with their movement, and are putting forth the still worse claim that the Sunday legislation of Congress last July is not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, some, even some pastors of Presbyterian churches, prove the falsity of the one claim, and can see in the other that such is not the case, as note the following from the Chicago Herald, of recent date:

Rev. W. A. Broadhurst, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church (Chippewa Falls, Wis.), peached a sermon Sunday night on the Sunday opening phase of the World's Fair, which has stirred a number of elders to such a pitch that they have denounced Mr. Broadhurst's liberal ideas and threaten to have him brought before the synod. Several elders, however, who support the pastor, stand in the way and may prevent any action. Mr. Broadhurst denounced as Puritanical the opposition to the opening of the Fair Sunday, and said that the action of Congress in putting a proviso in its bill making an appropriation to the effect that it should not be opened on Sunday is unconstitutional and against public policy.

Whatever else may be the result of the agitation of this Sunday question in connection with the closing of the Fair, it is certain to lead many to a correct understanding of the proper rotation of Church and State.
