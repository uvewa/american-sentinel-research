DESPATCHES from abroad make it clear that there is to be a revival of Jewish persecution both in Russia and Germany. In Moscow Jewish merchants of the first guild of professional men, who have hitherto from their financial importance deemed themselves safe from attack, have been notified to leave the empire unless they unite with the Orthodox Church. The alternative is not a novel one to the Russian Jew, who for generations has nominally accepted it, but in this instance the genuineness of his conversion is to be demonstrated by a three years' residence in a monastic village outside of Moscow and a daily inspection of his piety by the monks.

The conditions imposed would be laughable did they not apply to educated and refined people, and did they not involve a partial confiscation of property, which will be total in the event of expulsion. Another decree issued by the authorities, imposing still greater hardship because applying to a more numerous class, is that requiring Hebrew artisans to reside only in towns where official boards of trade exist, the pretext being that they can thus be kept more effectively under official regulation and supervision. As official boards of trade exist in only about ten per cent of the Russian towns, and thousands of artisans will thus be compelled to remove from the places in which they live, the result will be a vast and barren addition to the sum of Hebrew misery.

In Germany, all reports agree, the anti-Semitic agitation is growing more intense, more than half the Conservative party being committed to it, and in many of the rural districts the peasantry show a disposition to repeat the physical outrages perpetrated a few years ago.

In Berlin, recently, a conference of Conservative members of the Reichstag greeted with applause radical proposals for the abasement of all Hebrews in Germany, and more serious still, the demand is being pressed that all Jews shall be declared by law to be foreigners, and so disqualified for State and university service. The court is opposed to the crusade, but the better classes are plainly in sympathy with it, the inciting cause apparently being jealousy of the Jew intellect rather than of the faculty for acquiring wealth; the movement being the more singular because in Germany the Hebrew has been so assimilated as to be outwardly, indistinguishable from the rest of the people.
