THE *Mail and Express* makes the statement that "the President, within the last few days, has stated most positively that he would veto all bills Congress looking to the repeal of the law for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and that in this comes to him, he will veto it." It seems improbable, however, that Congress will pass any such bill. The Government appears to be hopelessly committed to religious legislation.

In view of the trials to take place in Henry County, Tennessee, on the 30th inst., and in view of the admirable article on another page, which we reprint from the *American Law Register*, of a special interest instead of the able manner in which the writer treats the question of what constitutes a *disturbance* in the meaning of Sunday statutes.

---

The Tennessee Adventists imprisoned last summer, and also those to be tried next Monday, are charged, in the indictments against, with doing secular work on Sunday "to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people;" yet it is in evidence in the cases of last summer that nobody was disturbed—all the witnesses testified that they did not disturb them; and in fact it was of a character and done in such places that it could not be a disturbance in the common acceptance of the word.

But as above shown, the referee also, the term a "disturbance" does not have its ordinary, every-day meaning when used in Sunday statutes. The North Carolina judge stated a truth which lies candid, not secretly revealed, but logically concealed, to admit, namely, that the object of Sunday laws is to compel the performance of a religious duty. The judge's exact language we have already quoted: it is that it "offends us not so much because it disturbs us in practicing for ourselves the religious exercises or enjoying the salutary repose or rest of that day, as that it is *in itself a breach of God's law and a violation of the party's own religious duty.*"

But a still more remarkable turn has been given to a similar statute in New Hampshire, namely, that those who do the work are disturbed by it! These the court has defined the law as prohibiting "acts calculated to turn the attention of the citizens from their appropriate religious

duties to matters of more worldly concern," and hence, as Mr. Blaigdell remarks, it is settled in that State that business, however quietly conducted on Sunday, "disturbs" "others" since in it, and that a man is "disturbed," though he be willing and anxious to do business on Sunday, by the doing of it, or by any act, however voluntary, which tends to distract him from religious observance.

---

The Tennessee courts have taken substantially the same view of the matter of disturbance as the courts of North Carolina and New Hampshire. The "disturbs" and "nuisance" charged in the indictments for Sunday work is the fact that the work is done on Sunday, and it is not necessary to show that anybody has been disturbed. The courts assume that Sunday work shocks the moral sense of the community, and it is not even necessary that any body should see the work done or even know about it being done. If Sunday work is respected and the community does not even know that same family, it is a nuisance under the judicial legislation of the Tennessee courts.

---

ANYPOINT in Mr. Blaigdell's article worthy of special matter, is that Sunday laws are not necessary to protect religious services from disturbance. Religious meetings of all kinds are held every day and night of the week and no one thinks of being disturbed except on Sundays when work not-on-to, not one hundredth part as much toil is going on. If it is necessary to have a law against disturbing public worship? If asking a law is working itself, it is a law in favor of religious. Otherwise, one will surely be punished for remarking to this committee that the plan is "too thin."

The *Industrial World*, of the 3rd ult., has this to say of the imprisonment of Adventists in Tennessee:

The record of the Tennessee courts is the best of a religious reputation. The Sunday closing of this community has proved the proof that the same severe, nonsectarian Sunday laws have been enacted.

If these statements are to the spirit and purpose of the law, and they are, then a judge and jury have it by removing the disturbance and taking out the finger of the Tennessee—. Further, here in America is to be more than the inventing and creating of crime in the courts for the courts there can be no use and no demand for false imprisonment. The claims along that we shall point the hand of all within it for if they are not stricto of this. An injury to an otherwise old, known to all of such. Make history.

The fact that these men are not now in prison as the World seems to think, does not alter the case one whit, several others, members of the same church, are under indictment and will be tried probably the last Monday in this month—and in the Henry County court trial means conviction, for men who are too honest to avail themselves of any thing savoring of indirection in order to secure acquittal.

In a recent memorial to Congress praying for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the Morse Hotel Victor Place M. E. Church South, Washington, D. C., said: "We present this memorial in behalf of millions of Christian citizens." But what is to be counted again?

The *Post-Intelligencer*, of Paris, Henry County, Texas, publishes the following item of news:—

The Circuit Court convenes the fourth Monday in January. We understand from the District Attorney that a number of indictments will be presented against various parties for violation of the Sunday law.

A number of civil cases on the docket are against a number of persons. Among the indictments are, appearance docket, sun block, docket, entry fee to the county, the cases, for gaming, fines for selling liquor, etc. And the charges are—for selling liquor to minors; for keeping open gambling; for keeping an open bar or doing grocery, or for selling liquor on Sunday; for selling liquor to minors, for selling liquor to a habitual drunkard; for selling liquor in four miles of school house; for selling liquor on election day; for selling liquor to minors, etc., for keeping open saloon; for selling liquor on election day; for breach of the peace; adultery; carrying concealed weapons, two; for public drunkenness; for being drunk and disorderly, and vagrancy.

---

The *Post-Intelligencer* does not, however, explain that the indictments for Sunday work are against men who are acknowledged by the prosecuting attorney to be good citizens, from the best of the county, and citizens who keep the law that they do not observe Sunday; it does not tell us that fact, that any one of them was or will be trusted by any merchant in the county to any reason amounts, and that they are known to be scrupulously honest; in short, it does not tell, as is the truth,that to do, that these are Christian men suffering persecution for the sake of conscience.

JUST as we are closing up the last page of this number of the SENTINEL, a letter comes to us from Henry County, Tenn., telling us that the sheriff is summoning a very large number of the citizenship of the district as witnesses in the coming trial of the indicted Adventists. One body of only sixteen members. Here they are as a witness against his own father! In another family the father will be compelled to testify against his son and the sons against the father and against each other and that to prove something which no one of those who were present described; the indictment is described as being "to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people," and "against the peace and dignity of the State."
