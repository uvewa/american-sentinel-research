IN the Apostolic Age there was the sharpest possible line of demarcation between the Church and the world. "The world lay in the wicked one;" he was "the god of this world." The condition of Gentile society under the Empire was unspeakably corrupt. The truly frightful stigmas branded upon its forehead by Saint Paul in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, are burned into it no less indelibly by its own poets, romancers, satirists, and philosophic teachers. The writings of Juvenal, Persius, Petronius, Apuleius, Suetonius, and Martial, have been called by a great French writer the pieces justifications of Christianity; but the terrible indictment of Saint Paul is proved to the letter, and in every particular, not only by these, but in the graver pages of Tacitus, Seneca, and Pliny.

The powers of evil, which could not prevent the triumph of Christianity, did their utmost to render it ineffectual. They wrought to weaken the spirituality of the Church, and to poison the inner springs of her life, in exact proportion as she won the political dominance. "The religion of Constantine," says Gibbon, with perfect truth, "achieved in less than a century the final conquest of the Roman Empire; but the victors themselves were insensibly subdued by the arts of their vanquished rivals." The nominal members of the Church more and more sank back into the seductions of the world, as the Church was more and more able to set at defiance the hatred, contempt, and persecution which has done their utmost to destroy her existence. It may not be uninstructive to touch on one or more of the directions in which the devil tried to reduce to unreality and impotence the victory which had overcome the world. Of the corruption of theology I do not here speak.

The early presbyters and bishops of Christianity (the two words were originally interchangeable) were often men of humble rank, and since they were placed by their position in the forefront of the battle, and were the first to perish by the sword, the stake, or the wild beasts in early persecutions, there was little to tempt avarice or ambition in their spiritual dignity. It is said that almost all the early bishops of Rome perished one after another by martyrdom. When, however, Constantine had laid his somewhat tainted hand upon the Cross, and the position of a bishop became one of

**Status, entourage, worldly circumstance,**

a shocking change for the worse took place. Christian bishops lived in splendor and luxury and no longer abstained from joining in the turbulent intrigues of politicians and partisans. They began to flaunt in superb ecclesiastical vestments broidered with gold and enriched with gems. They reveled in such artificial and inflating titles as "Your Beatitude" and "Your Sanctity," and when they went abroad they appeared in magnificent apparel, lolling in lofty chariots.

2. Like priests, like people. If worldliness, avarice, and ambition so successfully invaded the ranks of the episcopate, we are hardly surprised to find them triumphant among the Christian laity. There is enough to shock us beyond measure in the picture of the state of Christianity at Rome itself which is given us by Saint Jerome, who came to it as to a very arck in the world's deluge, and found it an intolerable Babylon, seething with immorality, intrigue, lust, scandal, and spite.

3. Another sign of evil pagan influence was the growing irreverence in worship. The accounts of the early assemblies tell us of deep and rapturous devotion; of responses which sounded like the voice of many waters; of the ANEN rolling its sounds afar like thunder. Already in Origen's time, much of this solemnity had vanished. It had been destroyed by deadening familiarity and unreal adhesion to the cause of Christ. Christians, as Saint Chrysostom tells us, would adjourn from their church to pagan shows; they pushed and jostled each other to get first to the Holy Table; they turned the great festival into scenes of intemperance and excess; they broke out into tumults of applause at the rhetoric of their preacher, but paid no attention to the spiritual truth; forgot the application, and absented themselves from the prayers.

4. But the worship itself—which was a most serious evil—had been in various directions assimilated to paganism. If the heathen had their idols, the Christians after a time began to have their images and pictures. Faustus, Manichee though he was, had some grounds for the charges he made against the orthodox.

(a) He made a charge of idolatry and semi-idolatry. At first Christianity was utterly opposed to pictures and images in churches, but they have become universal. Beausobre speaks of what he calls the "Christian idolatry," which was thus gradually introduced.

(b) The charge of paganized religious gatherings is also abundantly proved by the regretful admission of contemporary saints.

(c) It is needless to touch on the groveling relic-worship and cross-worship which earned for Christians from the pagans the nicknames of ash-adorers (*cinerarii*) and idolaters.

5. The pernicious influence of paganism showed itself in two other directions—in literature and government. The writings of the Apostolic Fathers are gentle and dignified. In time, however, as in the case of Saint Jerome, controversy was conducted with rabid abuse, in which words and epithets were used, disgraceful even on the lips of an ordinary gentleman and trebly disgraceful to a Christian. Writers called each other names, sometimes too coarse for translation, and to this day, I deeply regret to say, their vile example is followed in the columns of what are called religious and semi-religious newspapers.

6. We can hardly be surprised that when to call a man "a monster," and "a scorpion," and "a grunter," and "an impure demon," is regarded as a ferociously eloquent way of saying that you disagree with him, actual persecution and cruel violence should speedily be resorted to for the enforcement of religious opinion.

It would be quite possible to point out other directions in which the Church suffered grievous harm from her contact with the world. These, however, are sufficient, and they furnish abundant warning that the Church must never relax her vigilance, or forget that even a nominally Christian world may still be essentially of the world worldly.—*Archdeacon Farrar, D. D., in Sunday Magazine, London, November.*
