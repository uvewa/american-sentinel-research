But the fact is clear enough without authority that Sunday laws embody a religious dogma, and that they constrain the citizen on religious grounds alone. There are two sides, again, to this religious character of Sunday laws—the side of the constrainer and the side of the constrained. So far as the latter is concerned, the real spirit of such legislation has been frankly stated by a North Carolina judge, who says that work on Sunday "offends us not so much because it disturbs us in practicing for ourselves the religious duties or enjoying the salutary repose or recreation of that day, as that it is in itself a breach of God's law and a violation of the party's own religious duty." A plainer truth, one more clearly and fully appreciated by Sunday law advocates, while they seek to ignore and even deny it, was never printed. So far, then, as the constrained are concerned, the object of Sunday laws is to compel them to perform a religious duty, and to punish an offense against religion as such. And as this religious duty is exacted by some religious communions and not by all, the "preference" among religions is established.

In strict accordance with this view are the New Hampshire decisions on the point of what constitutes a "disturbance" of one person by another on Sunday. At first sight it might seem unobjectionable to provide that no work should be done on Sunday "to the disturbance of others," as is done in New Hampshire. But the value of the qualification, if it had any, is destroyed by the judicial construction. The court has taken the North Carolina view that the statute was intended to prevent "acts calculated to turn the attention of those present from their appropriate religious duties to matters of mere worldly concern," and hence it is settled in that State that business, however quietly conducted on Sunday, "disturbs" those engaged in it, and that a man is "disturbed," though he be willing and even anxious to do business on Sunday, by the doing of it, or by any act, however voluntary, which tends to distract him from religious observances.

There is no mitigation, then, of Sunday law rigor in the use of the proviso about disturbance. Nor is the New Hampshire court to be reproached for pandering to the spirit of Puritanism in construing its law, proviso and all, as intended to apply to individual conduct, without any reference whatever to its actual effect on others. How the words "to the disturbance of others" came to be inserted in the New Hampshire statute it may not be practicable to ascertain; but there can be no doubt that they would have been promptly stricken out if it had been suggested to the framers of that statute that such words might be taken to mean that a man might do as he pleased on Sunday, if he only did it quietly. There is no doubt that the court, as in duty bound, gave effect to the legislative intent in its view of the objects of the Sunday law.

There are other considerations which may be noted here in connection with the subject of "disturbance." Even if the New Hampshire court were wrong, and the word was meant to apply to others than the doer of the act in question, there would be no saving efficacy in the phrase. We are at once confronted with the difficulty—who is to determine whether or not one man is disturbed on Sunday by the act of another? If the first man's assertion is to be taken as conclusive on the subject, of course there is no use in having such words in the statute. But when we admit that the question of disturbance vel non is one for judicial determination in any given case, we see at once that this qualification involves a fatal confession of the nature and purpose of all Sunday laws. For, without any statutes, wherever the common law, or any other logical system jurisprudence prevails, that is, among any civilized people, work which "disturbs" others is unlawful at all times. To "disturb," in the eye of the law, is to infringe on some right or privilege which it creates or recognizes. When, therefore, the law recognizes a privilege as existing on Sunday which exists on no other day, and considers that acts will amount to a "disturbance" of others on Sunday which will not amount to such disturbance on any other day, we must ask ourselves what this special privilege of Sunday is, which is thus honored. It can not be the right "peaceably to assemble." In every American constitution this right is guaranteed expressly or impliedly, and it exists at all times. Nor does it matter what the purpose of assembling may be, unless it be tainted with treason. People may assemble at any hour of the day or night, and talk religion or infidelity, or politics or dress reform, and if anybody disturbs their assembly, the police will lock him up. The right of assembly and the question of what constitutes a disturbance of or an infringement of that right does not in the smallest degree depend on the object of the assembly, as religious or otherwise, nor does it depend in the smallest degree on the time of the assembly, as on Sunday or Monday. The standard of the law, its test of the right and its violation is the same for all assemblies and all periods. What special "right" is it, then, which is disturbed on Sunday by certain acts which disturb no rights on any other day? Let a Pennsylvania court answer for us: "There are other rights intimately associated with the rights of conscience which are worth preserving. The right to rear a family with a becoming regard for the institutions of Christianity, and without compelling them to witness hourly infractions of one of its fundamental laws"—that is to say, Sunday statutes are passed to compel one man to observe a "fundamental law" of Christianity for the benefit of another man's children. But a statute passed for the purpose of enforcing a law, fundamental or otherwise, of any particular religion gives a "preference" to that religion, unless an equal privilege be accorded to a like law of every other religion.

These authorities are adduced not in order to establish the proposition that Sunday laws embody a preference of one religion over another, but merely, as is proper in an article written for a law magazine, to show that this fact has, at least in some cases, been frankly recognized by the courts. It would be equally a fact if all the courts in the country denied it. All the decisions of all the courts can not make black white. The decision of a court may settle whether or not a Sunday law is enforceable, but it can have no effect upon the question of the origin, or the inspiring motive of such legislation. So the more numerous decisions (more numerous especially among the later cases) which take what is known as the "secular view" of Sunday laws are of no account whatever as evidence of the correctness of that view, because this is a question not of law at all, but of historic fact.

It has been said that the law will prevent the disturbance of a meeting without regard to its character as religious or otherwise. Like many other things in law, this disregard results from its refusal to attempt impossibilities. The law has not yet whereby to determine whether a meeting is religious or not. This being claimed as the character of a Spiritualist-camp-meeting in a Sunday-law case, the court left the point to the jury.\* The "unseemliness" of controversies over such a point, the impossibility of settling any rule for deciding them, the purely religious nature of the dispute are self evident. It is a mere evasion to leave such a question to a jury. An American jury has no authority to decide any question of which American law can take no cognizance. Neither jury nor judge can decide in this country the right and title of any system of belief to be called religious. It is a usurpation for a jury to render a verdict on such a question. It is quite as much a usurpation for a judge to render and enforce a judgment on such a verdict by a jury of others as it would be for him to do so after sitting as a jury himself.

But even were it practicable for American law to discriminate between a religious assembly and any other in the protection afforded against disturbance, no reason whatever exists for attempting such a discrimination. The simple fact is—though, like many other facts, it is constantly "blinked" in the discussion of this subject—that a religious assembly is disturbed by just precisely the same acts which would disturb any other assembly, and by no other acts whatever. From this point of view all sorts and conditions of men are alike. The orderly and regular conduct of a caucus and a church service, the ability of those present to keep abreast of what is going on, and to influence others—these things require precisely the same police conditions in the one case as in the other. This, again, is not matter of law, but fact. The Seventh-day Adventists, that remarkable people whose headquarters are at Battle Creek in Michigan, lately protested before Congress through their clear-headed and eloquent representative, Mr. Alonzo T. Jones, against the attempt of the Women's Christian Temperance Union to have a Federal Sunday law enacted. Mr. Jones consistently—he and his people are nothing if not consistent to the core—disclaimed any desire to have his "seventh day" substituted for Sunday, declaring, with perfect correctness, that all such legislation, involved that union of Church and State which his organization is pledged to oppose with unrelenting hostility. But he also laid special stress on the fact that his brethren were not disturbed in any manner whatever in their "seventh-day" observances by other people's pursuit of their regular occupations—and therefore they did not need the law, even if they felt it right to ask its aid, in order to enable them to observe their day according to their wish. We have among us Jews and Seventh-day Baptists, and their experience is the same—that no "Sunday law" is needed to protect them in the full enjoyment of their scriptural Sabbath. We have also Roman Catholics and Episcopalians who observe such fasts and feasts as Lent, Christmas, Good Friday, "saints days," etc., by holding religious assemblies. Not one of them has ever complained that these assemblies are in any wise disturbed by the steady course of the world's daily work and traffic. The case is still stronger when we come to those who are specially interested in Sunday laws, to whose agency such laws and their spasmodic enforcement are due. These may be broadly grouped as "Evangelicals." Such persons make a regular practice of holding "prayer-meetings" on week-days. The claim has never been advanced that these assemblies are disturbed by the ordinary labor of those who fail to attend them. So, also, with the great "revivals" to which some of them are addicted. Day after day, every day and night in the week, they assemble for religious purposes on such occasions. It has never been remarked that the week-day services are disturbed any more than those held on Sunday—that they are any less satisfactory to those who conduct them, or less profitable in the ratio of "conversions" to attendance.

So that we see our proposition that nothing can disturb a religious meeting which does not disturb any other kind of meeting proven by daily experience of the life around us. And we see further that, as the disturbance of religious meetings at any time will be prevented by the "police-power" of the State, no "Sunday law" is needed to prevent such disturbance. And we are thus brought face to face with the truth of the matter—namely, that the only disturbance involved in Sunday work is the disturbance of one man's right to constrain another to a certain line of conduct as a religious duty; and that Sunday laws are therefore passed with a religious purpose, and designed to punish offenses against religion as such, and so constitute a "preference" by the State of one religion over another.

As this true character of Sunday laws becomes more and more evident to the American people, the demand for their repeal grows stronger and stronger. Nor is this demand to be thwarted by quibbling over what constitutes a union of Church and State. Like other unions, this may be complete or partial. The only instance in history of a complete union of the two, or an absolute identity of Church and State was the polity of the Hebrews in Palestine. But in every civilized country the union exists to a greater or less extent. It was to guard against it that all such provisions as those forbidding a preference among religions have been inserted in the American constitutions. It exists in the very teeth of such provisions wherever a Sunday law is found.
