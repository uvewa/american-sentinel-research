It seems the Presbyterian Church, in South Carolina, has decided that its members must observe Sunday. The following dispatch gives the incidents of a case of discipline for the alleged non-observance, of a member of the Presbyterian Church in Columbia, S. C.

The Presbyterian Church in South Carolina has a case of discipline before it that is attracting much attention from church people throughout the State. The case arose at the Charleston Presbytery, which met at Charleston, and results from the case of trial of a member for alleged Sunday desecration. She was expelled from the Presbyterian Church for the violation of a rule of the Church respecting the observance of the Lord's Day, but which went to the bounded of South Carolina. She works in a restaurant on Sunday and claims to keep Saturday.

A woman member had the trial of her case before the committee and she refused to recognize the authority of the Presbytery. A number of members before the session of the church and forced to come before the Presbytery and all the women of the church entered. She refused to obey the summons, and admitted the charges and was expelled.

The woman confessed that she had some form of necessity: monopoly, and Edisto McCloskey offered to give up her employment. But on the following Sunday the girl declined to attend services and work at the restaurant.

She also carried the case before the presbytery and it went from there to the Synod. Some important features of the matter were being brought out during the discussion that there was not one word of Scripture to prove Sunday is the Sabbath. This, as an expression, a well-read man, and other. I confess that these views are far too radical for me; but from now then we sit there we took hold of the proceedings.

The Synod upheld the decision of the Presbytery for three days, confirmed the action of the church. Since then a new phase of the question has appeared, in Charleston, young wife the matter being the Presbyterians throughout the States are interested in the case.

Another account states that the pastor of the church from which Mrs Monroe was expelled, declared that if the charges were not sustained and the presbytery or the action, in dismissing the young woman from church membership for absenting to her telephone station on Sunday, to which she could not renain pastor of the church.

This prospect for Sunday observance reaches both within and without the church is large. Why is not the plan that Sunday shall be observed by every individual before an ecclesiastical court? It may be that great and providential may be compelled to listen to a full presentation of the claims on them in these troublesome times.
