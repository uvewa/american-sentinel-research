A clear-headed minister, in a letter to a sound doctrine to the editor of the *Brooklyn Eagle*, has truly said, with a confirmation, as follows:—

It was one of the fads in the course of a recent attempt to enforce the observance of Sunday in the borough of Brooklyn, that the authorities had not the right to do. The Council had that our local authorities had no right to make an appropriation conditional on Sunday observance. The attitude of the Government is clear, or of any obligation to, any religion is now, if it is true that our forefathers intended the fathers to keep Church and State apart.
