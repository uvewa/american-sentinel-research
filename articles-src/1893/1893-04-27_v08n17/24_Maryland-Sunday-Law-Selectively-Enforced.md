In Maryland, as elsewhere, the Sunday law has not been enforced heretofore. Railroads, street cars, steamboats, and iron mills have been run on the first day of the week much as on other days; newspapers are issued and sold and in the summer season excursions are run to various resorts. Now, however, it is being rigidly enforced in some sections, against Seventh-day Adventists.

The appealed case of John Judefind, the Seventh-day Adventist, of Rock Hall, Md., was heard on Wednesday, April 19, and decision reserved.
