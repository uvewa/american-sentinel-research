In an address before the Evangelical Alliance at St. Louis, March 27, Rev. Henry George urged that the Sunday mails be stopped, with the argument that the "carrying of letters on the Sabbath is iniquitous." Dr. George is field secretary of the American Sabbath Union. He recounted the victories of the union in the World's Fair Sunday-closing strife, and then said:—

> Our next fight will be to stop Sunday mails. We will go before Congress on that issue. That's the iniquitous traffic that causes one quarter of a million of people to desecrate God's day. That's the examination that makes trains run on Sunday, and makes Sunday newspapers possible.

Resolutions endorsing the position taken by Dr. George were passed by the Alliance, and a committee was appointed to assist in putting an end to the "abomination."—Workers' Bulletin.
