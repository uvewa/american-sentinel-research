Last Sunday week, says London Truth, a number of the inhabitants of Inverness were wicked and depraved enough not only to assemble at the railway station to await the arrival of an Indian troupe engaged to perform at the borough theater, but actually to attend a sacred concert given by the members of the National Grand Opera Company. This heinous behavior has, of course, excited the wrathful notice of the Free Church Presbytery. "Such conduct in a Christian town is a defiance to God himself," declared a Rev. Mr. Mackenzie, and shows that Inverness is "fast ripening for the judgments of the Most High." "Yes," chimed in a Rev. Dr. Macdonald, "we are drifting, in the North of Scotland, very fast into a sort of continental Sabbathism." "Already," added this learned divine, "there is a tremendous amount of walking during the summer evenings, and it is very demoralizing to the young people." Then, after a column or two of similar denunciations, another reverend doctor wound up the debate by an account of how his little dog—evidently as keen a Sabbatharian as his worthy master—"tore out the advertisement calling the sacred concert, which appeared in the Courier. And I think," added this truly Christian minister, "that it was just an advertisement for dogs." This remark was followed by "laughter," but, not being a Scotchman, I will not attempt to explain wherein the "wut" of it lies. I do, however, most unquestionably recognize the dry humor which induced all the bigoted fanatics who took part in this outrageously anachronistic discussion to make their mucorous and immoderate remarks to an official whom they persistently addressed as "Moderator!"
