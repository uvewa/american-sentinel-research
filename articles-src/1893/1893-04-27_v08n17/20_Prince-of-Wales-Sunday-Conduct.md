Apoppos of the views of London Truth on the clerical movement for enforcement of Sunday observance, reprinted on another page, is a report which comes from England of the possibility of an emphatic remonstrance being made to the manner in which the Prince of Wales spends his Sundays; his last offense has been a Sunday dinner given to some thirty or forty theatrical celebrities.
