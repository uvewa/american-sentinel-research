In a leaflet of the Sunday newspaper, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Mrs. J. C. Bateham says:—

This paper further furnishes a providential opportunity to ask the people of every church and community whether we are of the world and love the works of the world or whether we are the children of light, true and pray for its discontinuance, and give out all that in our midst it is the sin of the world which is going to ruin the day.

So it seems, according to the views, thats the mission of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, is to fight "Provincialism." Provincialism has furnished a "test by which men can measure and test their Christianity." This test of faith (2 Cor. 13:5); but instead of being the test of the real life within to which it is all joy when they fail into divers temptations, James 1:2-4, and which causes faith worketh patience (James 1:3-4), instead of this Christ-given standard of examination that will enable them to endure the temptation; the power of self-denial in Romans 1:17), they spend their energies to trying to prevent temptation.

Church people at the present time that is the charge that the press and present day magazines are doing more harm to the young mind than any texts in this world by which a Christian has to study, to learn to work with those who make no profession. And so they labor to abolish that which they say is the temptation to evil, and in the process they afford are providential. In another leaflet, Mrs. Bateham says, "The world would be specially convinced if the church of Christ were united entirely in heart and practice." But not by fighting. No question the need of a general revival, a baptism of the Spirit and fire, being felt and an earnest prayer is offered; but the blessing of the Spirit is given when God's people say, "Blessed are they who abolish the Sunday newspaper," but "blessed are the men that endured temptation." Having lost their power to endure by mingling professed Christianity so and secular worldly pursuits so that there is nothing left but a Sunday observance of religion and worldliness. The gospel is the power of God unto salvation. An irreligious press has the power of God unless he is forced line between the Church and the world, and those who profess to follow Christ, worldliness to endure temptations. They will abolish as many temptations as possible and then try to compel sinners to endure with them those which they see possible with these laws already; how much easier to undertake that which can only be accomplished by the power of God. "The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be," yet they think they can compel unconverted people to obey God. The Bible says "they that are in the flesh can not please God," and "without faith it is impossible to please him," yet they suppose it is highly pleasing to God for them to ask Congress to compel the ungodly to show respect for Christianity by trying to obey its laws and recognize its institutions. In short, they expect Christianity to be promoted by good works—the works of the flesh—instead of by the grace of God. They have forgotten that God counts human righteousness as "filthy rags." For this, being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God: "Come let us righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all.

Any one who undertakes to make men moral or religious by the power of civil law, by conversion to God, is fighting Provincialism; depose, operating the evil, and hindering the salvation of men. They are turning people away from the righteousness of God to the righteousness of the flesh which is nothing but sin. "Crucify the flesh," that which is the crop and platter. Only the Creator of this Spirit that dwelleth, the contest of right may be taken.
