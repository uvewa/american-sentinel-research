A dispatch from Rome to the press expresses an opinion to which Cardinal Gibbons has responded to the following comments upon it thus—

In relation to the report that he had advised that the Church in more closely in her growth, and that she must have no restrictions and the Government have of no interest whatever.

"But not one jot the hostile on the State side or on the Church side that the Church should be free from any interference on the part of the State, and the State should be free from any interference on the part of the Church; that there is and there will be more still after such time when there would seem to be any indication that the Church is gaining raised of the State. The church of the State may well exist together in harmony but the problem comes energetically and more and more directly home to us in a Government that will endure the matter which has led to the its influence in the present day political institutions. American nationality and free schools, the home of the immigrant people will be the issue of socialism the evening press and Italian and other influence or political ambitions and of the end of the period. When its understanding itself as a government of the people, and for all alike, the Church will indeed be "free in pursuit her mission in peace and quietness, with all godliness and honesty" but if the churches and their leaders, those bodies of Christian laborers and workers in our civic life, do not arouse themselves, the phrases of diplomacy serve very well as the assurances that the Church is free, as they lead into too much confidence in a conversion to faith of, or a change in, the Roman hierarchy.

The *Observer* accepts this article and analysis of it without criticism, evidently being so well that the need of religious toleration for its writer ally it holds in double condemnation. For those acquainted with the intents, purposes, and actual legal and governmental relation of the Roman Catholic ecclesiasticism in this country as it does into the subtle deceptive character of the Cardinal. There are more churches in the United States than the church which Cardinal Gibbons represents, and it is from these that the country is in the most immediate danger. They have already assumed to dictate to legislatures and to Congress, and the State and national governments have submitted to their dictation. It is a virtual union of religion rather than a civil supremacy in this Church will follow in due time. This is Cardinal Gibbons is the greater threat against it is not the most immediate of the Sunday-closing question is a religious one that will effectively play into the hands of the establishment of a state. In the meantime the State will be subjugated to clericalism, and a broad and very easy way found for that religious supremacy which is to accomplish its mission. Roman Catholic. Every advancement is making in each step and across to stifle all this while, a false Protestant Christianity is making the road for itself, and Roman Catholic doctrines of the authority of the Church in matters of the State, the church which asserts and exercises the real authority over the State and the people. Confine; for it is the doctrine of that church that the State is inferior to the church may call itself, the assumption of temporal authority of that category has been raised, is Roman Catholic.

That the Church has "assumed to dictate to legislatures" needs not the slightest evidence for gazing that "the State and national governments have submitted to their dictation" is before the eyes of everyone who is able to see; so that it is reasonable to see how disgracefully it has done it and how rapidly she is coming, that the road has been prepared for them this gospel than ever before, "for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed" in the fullness of time, to claim its own.
