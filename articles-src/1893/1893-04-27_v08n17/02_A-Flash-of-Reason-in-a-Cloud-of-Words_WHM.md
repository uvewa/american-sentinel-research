THOSE who heard the utterances of Joseph Cook before the House Committee on the World's Fair, in reference to the Sunday closing of the Chicago Exposition, or have since read what he said there, will be interested to know that in one of his, Boston, Monday lectures, Mr. Cook has denied that he was in sympathy with that dramatic act of Senator Quay, which has stirred to their uttermost depths the hearts of all National Reformers, when he sent the Bible to the clerk's desk open at the fourth commandment, to be read to the Senate of the United States, that the divine law might be thus indirectly interpreted and embodied into his proviso to close the World's Fair on Sundays.

In reference to this incident Mr. Cook said:—

> I do not agree with him. I wish to shake myself loose from all theories which tend toward a union of Church and State.

One of his hearers was so displeased with what Mr. Cook said in the attempt to thus shake himself loose, that he wrote him the following letter:—

> Your statement last Monday that the civil Sabbath is not based upon the fourth commandment, it seems to me, deprives our Sabbath laws of their moral value; for a law that has not the authority of God behind it will not bind the conscience. The ten commandments are a translation of the law of nature, as well as an authoritative rule of spiritual life. They are both a civil code and an ecclesiastical law. They were given to the nation of Israel as their constitution, and to the Church of Israel as a law of ecclesiastical life. For the State to recognize them as the foundation of moral legislation no more tends to unite Church and State than family worship creates a union between the family and the Church. The ten commandments have been placed in Christ's hands as the administrator. Every believer is under that law to Christ. Christ is King of nations, and nations, as moral beings, are under this law to him. The Church is under this law to Christ. But this law, being a rule of life to the individual, the family, the Church and the State, in their respective spheres, brings all into subjection to Christ. Our Sabbath laws are rooted and grounded in the fourth commandment. Separate from that edict of Jehovah they are not worth the paper they were written upon.

It will not be uninteresting to analyze this letter sentence by sentence. It is said that the statement that the civil Sabbath is not based upon the fourth commandment deprives Sunday laws of their moral value. It should be noticed in the first place that the "civil Sabbath" is "Sunday" and not the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. This in itself deprives any injunction to observe this "civil Sabbath" of all "moral value," if by moral value is meant religious or divine weight of authority. That this is the sense intended to be conveyed in the words, "moral value," is shown by the next phase, "for a law that has not the authority of God behind it," etc. Laws for the observance of Sunday as a civil Sabbath must necessarily be civil ordinances, they must be of human origin. God's law says nothing of the observance of Sunday as a civil Sabbath. It cannot therefore have the "authority of God behind it," and it has not, nor ever has had, any moral value in the sense intended. "Our Sabbath laws" therefore cannot be deprived of that which they never had; but there is a Sabbath law, from God, which does bind the conscience, and God's Sabbath law contravenes these Sunday laws; then these—called here "our Sabbath laws," are void, and all are in conscience bound to disobey them.

Is it true, in any sense, that "the ten commandments are a translation of the law of nature"? "Law of nature" is an expression "denoting the standard or system of morality deducible from a study of the nature and natural relations of human beings independent of supernatural revelation." The ten commandments are an expression of the character of God. This can only be known by supernatural revelation and is not deducible from a study of the nature and natural relations of human beings. The apostle says, "that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them."

They are neither a "civil code" nor an "ecclesiastical law." Both of these are of human origin and authority, but the ten commandments are divine; "thy law is truth" and "thy commandments are righteousness." Righteousness is primarily an attribute of God only. The commandments are then his righteousness, which is his character, and not a civil code which is a system of human ordinances, nor an ecclesiastical law which is a human substitute for the divine government of the Church. They were not given to the Jewish nation or the Jewish Church alone, but to the whole world through them.

Family worship does create a union between the family and the Church, and just so the formal civil recognition of the ten commandments as the "foundation of moral legislation" does unite Church and State.

The ten commandments are in the hands of Christ to be "administered" only against the wicked. Every believer who accepts Christ is by faith subject to grace and not to the law, for except through his atonement none can be saved.

Christ is not "King of nations," until in his second coming that which he himself said shall take place,—"Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out." Then shall his kingdom, which "is not of this world," be set up.

Nations are not moral beings, but are composed of moral beings who are individually under the law as many as deny Christ and refuse him their faith and love.

The Church of God is not under the law to Christ—only those members—hypocrites—to whom he will say in the last day, "I never knew you." They who have been forgiven go free from subjection to penalty, keeping in love the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. The commandments are a rule of life to the individual but not to the family or the State, as organized bodies, except as they are a rule of life to the individuals separately, of whom the family, the State and the Church are composed. Neither is it the ten commandments which bring men into subjection to Christ, but the love of God shed abroad in our hearts.

Our Sunday laws are not rooted and grounded in the fourth commandment. Man can make no Sabbath or Sunday laws which will not be separate from that edict of Jehovah; and no religious edict which man can issue is "worth the paper it is written upon."

Rev. Joseph Cook answered this letter; but did he repeat and enforce his statement that "the civil Sabbath is not based upon the fourth commandment"? Here is his reply:—

> Dear Mr. Foster:—We do not disagree in fundamental principles as to the divine authority of the civic rest day. But I could not make that divine authority depend wholly or chiefly on the fourth commandment; for I believe there was a day for rest and worship set apart at the creation; that the Sabbath is as old as the family, and that apostolic example and precept justify the observance of the Lords day as a Christian Sabbath. The fourth commandment begins with the word "R-member," and itself stands on much that went before it as well as on what accompanies it. The self-revelation of God in the whole history of the rest-day from creation until now was the ground on which I placed the divine authority of our Sunday laws in their general outlines.

> Yours very respectfully,
> JOSEPH COOK.

This letter of Mr. Cook's illuminates the point in question about as much as the answer of the spiritualist who, when asked why it was that supposed communications, from the most intellectual or the most ignorant of the departed, showed about the same intellectual average, replied that it was because of the medium having "an indifferentiated perceptivity which antecedes sensory specialization, and which the specialization of the nerve stimuli to which terrestrial evolution conducts us, may restrict as well as clarify."

It would seem that Mr. Cook in a moment of incaution emitted a flash of reason which now he is most extremely desirous of obscuring with a cloud of words.
