SOMETHING over a year ago the village of Rock Hall, Kent County, Maryland, was invaded by two Seventh-day Adventist preachers, who went there on the urgent invitation of a resident of that place who had become interested in their doctrines in Washington City. They secured a hall and commenced a series of meetings which continued several weeks and resulted in the organization of a church of over eighty members. Many of these had, prior to this time, made no profession of religion, and some of them had been more or less addicted to profanity and to the use of intoxicating liquors. But in those who fully accepted the doctrines of the Adventists the moral reform was complete; profane, drinking men became, in a few weeks, sober, praying men; their temperance principles leading them to abandon not only liquors, but tobacco and other more or less hurtful narcotics and stimulants.

There were already in Rock Hall three churches—Protestant Methodist, Methodist Episcopal and Roman Catholic. The Catholics took but little notice of the inroads made in the neighborhood by the Adventists, but the Methodists manifested more or less hostility to the "strange doctrine," and to those who embraced it. This was specially true of the Methodist Episcopal pastor. This may have been due in a measure to the fact that his congregation was somewhat reduced by the coming of the Adventists and that his salary suffered a corresponding reduction.

The man who had been largely instrumental in bringing the Adventist preachers to Rock Hall, in the first place, had formerly been a member of the Protestant Methodist Church. It is a tenet of the Adventist faith that the seventh and not the first day of the week is the divinely ordained Sabbath, and their practice is in keeping with their faith; they religiously observe the twenty-four hours from the going down of the sun on Friday until sunset on Saturday, and, of course, regard and treat Sunday, the first day of the week, as they do the other five days intervening between that and the seventh day—that is, having rested the "Sabbath day according to the commandment" (Luke 23:56 and 24:1) they do ordinary labor or business on Sunday, just as other people are accustomed to do on Monday. It was this fact that gave the Methodist minister at Rock Hall the desired opportunity to at once annoy the Adventists and "get even" with one whom he regarded as an apostate from the true faith.

One Sunday, last November, the opportunity came. It was quarterly meeting Sunday in that charge and the pastor and his presiding elder were on their way to a love-feast. Passing along the road they spied Mr. Judefind husking corn about two hundred yards from the public road along which they were passing; and as though Providence (as it may have seemed to them) was specially favoring them, they met, only a few rods from the spot where they first observed this reckless disregard of their sacred day, a justice of the peace who, with a companion, was going to order some lumber to be delivered (and which was delivered) the next day.

Calling the attention of the justice to the violator of the law, the minister demanded that he be arrested and punished. The justice replied that it was not his place to enter complaints, and that moreover he was shortsighted and could not see the man at that distance. "In that case," said the Rev. Robert Roe, for such is the gentleman's name, "I say to have him arrested." The justice replied, "Well, if you say to have him arrested, and will appear against him, all right." And so after attending to the business on which he was bent, the justice returned to his office and made out the warrant which was immediately placed in the hands of an officer who served it the same evening.

At the trial, the next day, the minister could not positively identify the accused as the man whom he had seen husking corn, but the young man who was with the justice was positive that Mr. Judefind was the man, and so he was fined five dollars and the costs of the case, amounting in all to something over eight dollars. Mr. Judefind immediately took an appeal to the Circuit Court of Kent County, in which the case is pending at this writing.

But Mr. Judefind's case is not the only one in which the spirit of persecution has been manifested. From Kent County, Md., the work of the Adventists spread to Queen Anne County, and a church of some sixty members was raised up at Ford's Store. Four miles from that place on Kent Island, resides a man by the name of Isaac Baker, a farmer, who, until less than a year since was an active member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Hearing of the Adventist meetings at Ford's Store, he went, and finally embraced the Adventist faith. This greatly disturbed his former friends; but nothing came of it until on Sunday, the 9th inst., he did some plowing. The next day he was arrested and, like Mr. Judefind, was fined five dollars and costs, amounting in all to eleven dollars, there being nine witnesses against him.

The field in which Mr. Baker was doing his work was not near any public road, but there was a public boat-landing near one corner of it. He was first observed by some persons who were boating, and subsequently, when it had been noises about that a man was plowing on Sunday, quite a number of people came down, apparently to see the violation of the law. The warrant was sworn out by a prominent member of the Methodist Church, who, however, is by no means an exemplary member, judged by the Methodism of forty years ago.

It seems strange that the Methodists have so soon forgotten that they themselves suffered persecution for their faith not so very many years ago, that their names were cast out as evil, and that ministers of other sects regarded them as trespassers and poachers upon their preserves. Such, however, is human nature; but it is not divine nature, and those who have been made partakers of the divine nature will be found doing to others as they would be done by. The true spirit of the gospel has in it no taint of intolerance. A persecuting church is an apostate church, no matter by what name it may be called.
