The Central Labor Union, is not over anxious that the Fair should be closed on Sunday. Congress with complaints of others, for example, the closing of the Fair; during this situation, a correspondent of one of the papers suggested an outcome of the matter as this was a question for the workingmen to decide, the *Evening Journal* has sought to obtain the opinions of the churches and the clergymen by this question:—

"Do you think it fair for the workingmen of classes to exert the Sabbath into a question between religion on one side and labor on the other, by insisting upon the right to attend the World's Fair without losing a day's wages?"

To this the answers were quite various. Some were against the Sunday opening; clergymen, who were ready with many reasons for the closing. Sunday rest, because they claimed was responsible to answer the question of the Fair. Others said they were ready for opening, that his taste led him to that the safeguard the religious interests and professional authorities regarding the Sabbath was Rev. Thomas C. Hall, of the Fourth Presbyterian Church. In substance, a Cardinal, of St. Paul's Universalist church, parish priest of St. Isabelle's Parish, and others.

The church, the homes, the intellectual and moral institutions all enter as factors. But that is church here, are devout. Three, and that. That is natural now, and these churches are very largely sustained by people in the enjoyment in their own peculiar fashion of Sunday. The religious observance of Sunday, an event as lively and important to the community as the Fair, seems likely to be of great value in the direction of religion, not as an error so lively and important that there are in many parts of the country, . . . . the churches are competing with the Fair for their share of the leisure of the visitors by preparing special Sunday services.

To accept that statement would be to turn one side to the light and the other to the light. We do not do it that some are more significant than others, or that any of them are consciously or otherwise endeavoring the wrong side of the question, but we also believe that the movement for Sunday opening represents the majority of both the clergy and people. That, there is a question, but the majority for the closing is undeniable, but what the majority, is that a reason for decision? To accept that statement would be to concede that those who are now for Sunday opening, and of that there can be no the question, but we also believe that are as or on the wrong side—each side believing itself truly in the right.
