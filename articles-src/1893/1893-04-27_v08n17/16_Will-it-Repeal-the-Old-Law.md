[The St. Paul Daily News has no sympathy with the course of the Law and Order Society in Pittsburg, in reference to Sunday papers, and so expresses itself. The Daily News should remember that there is a similar organization for similar purposes in St. Paul and Minneapolis. That which is done in Pittsburg now will soon be done in other cities.]

The Law and Order Society of Pittsburg appears to be determined to make the statute of 1794 relating to Sunday labor as obnoxious as it has been a dead letter for more than half a century. This combine of offensive fanatics appears to have especial malignity toward Sunday newspapers. The first prosecution was instituted against a newsdealer and the last one against a newspaper, the publisher of the Sunday Press being fined seventy-five dollars. In the course of the proceedings in the case of the Press, the defense set up that the making of a Sunday newspaper is not a violation of the law, because the work is done during the week and on Saturday. But the evidence showed that a very insignificant part of it was done on Sunday morning, hence the fine. The defense also took exception to the fine on the ground that the Monday morning papers were all made on Sunday, and they were the editions which ought to receive the attacks of the society.

Now the fanatics say they will institute proceedings against the Monday morning newspapers, and that if any papers are issued on that morning all the work must be done after twelve o'clock Sunday night. The New York World thinks that the publishers of the Sunday newspapers in Pittsburg ought not to submit to being the only victims of the absurd old Blue Laws in Pennsylvania and advises them to make complaints against all other violators of this outgrown statute and the fanatics will probably be glad to let up, and the New York Press says "such bigotry belongs to the days of the Salem witches. The action of the Pittsburg inquisition should bring the law of 1794 into such odium as to cause its speedy abrogation. It ought to have been abolished years ago."

If the Pennsylvania legislature responds to public sentiment, not only in that State, but throughout the country generally, it will repeal the old law, and with it all other enactments that are in the same way devoid of common sense.
