It is an interesting fact now making itself evident, that ecclesiastical influence has developed the civil law for the enforcement of the religious observance of Sunday beyond what the Church discipline is in itself provided with authority, precedents, and penalties to enforce. Have we a Christian State and an unchristian Church? or have they both become alike unchristian?
