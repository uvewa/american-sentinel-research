The *St. Paul Daily News* has no sympathy with the course of the Law and Order Society of Pittsburgh. It says that if the law of 1794 expresses itself. The Daily News should remember that its friends of the same order in the press in Pittsburg are now will soon be done to other places.

The Law and Order Society of Pittsburg appears to be determined to make the statute of 1794 relating to Sunday labor as obnoxious as it has been a dead letter for more than half a century. This combination of offensive fanatics appears to have expected magisterial leniency toward Sunday newspapers. The first prosecution was instituted against a newsdealer and the line of procedure was against a newspaper, the publisher of which was fined the sum of four hundred dollars. In the course of the proceedings the defense raised the point that to say that the making of a Sunday newspaper is a violation of the law, because the work is done during the week and on Saturday. But the evidence showed that a very insignificant part of it was done on Sunday morning, before the publication time. The defense also took exception to the fine on the ground that the Monthly meeting had exceeded its authority in assessing it, and they were the editions which ought to receive the statute of this course.

Now the fanatics say they will institute proceedings against the Monday morning newspapers, and that if any papers are issued on that morning all the work must be done after twelve o'clock Sunday night. The *New York World* thinks that the publishers of the Sunday newspapers in Pittsburg ought not to submit to being fined under this antiquated statute. It advises them to republicanize all other violators of this religious statute and the fanatics will probably be glad to let it go, and the *New York Press* says "such bigotry belongs to the days of the Salem witches. The action of the Pittsburg inquisition should bring the law of 1794 into such odium as to cause its speedy abrogation, since this law has been abrogated."

If the Pennsylvania legislature responds to public sentiment, of not only in that State, but throughout the country generally, it will repeal the old law, and with it all other enactments that are in the same way revival of common sense.
