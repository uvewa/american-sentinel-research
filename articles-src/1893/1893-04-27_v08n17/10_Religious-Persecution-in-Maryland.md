Sometime over a year ago the village of Rock Hall, Kent County, Maryland, was visited by two Seventh-day Adventist preachers, who went there on the invitation and at the expense of some citizens who had become interested in their teaching. They engaged a hall and commenced a series of meetings which continued for several weeks, and resulted in the conversion of about eight members.
