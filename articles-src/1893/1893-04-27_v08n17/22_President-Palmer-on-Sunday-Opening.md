President Palmer, of the World's Columbian Exposition, has said to a reporter for the Detroit Tribune that "it would hurt the Fair now to open it on Sunday. The churches, Epworth Leagues, Christian Endeavor Societies, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, etc., would boycott the Fair, and they are pretty powerful."

Their capacity to terrorize in just this manner is precisely that which these professedly Christian elements in society have all along boasted. Their thought has been that, although they were a minority, they might, by claiming to be a majority, exercise an influence, and by being ready to affiliate wherever their ends could be reached, hold the balance of power and exercise control. This policy will be continued.
