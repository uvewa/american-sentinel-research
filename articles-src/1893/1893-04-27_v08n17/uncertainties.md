# Uncertainties — v08n17 (1893-04-27)

## Author Attribution

### Article 04: "Must Obey Their Own Laws"
- **Signed:** "W. R. M." at end of article
- **Issue:** The OCR renders this as "W. R. M." but the masthead lists the associate editor as "WILLIAM R. MCKEE" (initials W.R.M. or WHM). The article has been attributed to W. H. McKee (WHM) since "W. R. M." matches "William R. McKee." However, elsewhere in this issue McKee signs as "W. H. M."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "W. R. M." is likely an OCR rendering of "W. H. M." (the 'R' misread for 'H') or else the author consistently used "W. R. M." which would match "William R. McKee." Either way, this is the same person. File attributed to WHM (W. H. McKee).

## OCR Errors Noted

### Page 2 — "A Flash of Reason in a Cloud of Words"
- Joseph Cook's letter quotes the fourth commandment beginning with "R-member" — this is clearly an OCR artifact; the original almost certainly reads "Remember" but the OCR captured a hyphenated line break as "R-member." The text has been transcribed as printed in the OCR source ("R-member"), pending verification against original.
- **Confidence:** LOW — "R-member" is almost certainly "Remember" with a line-break hyphen in the original; preserved as-is pending original check.

### Page 3 — "Sunday Exemption Clauses"
- The quoted Johnson text reads "Do public power may invade those rights" — this is likely an OCR error for "No public power may invade those rights." Preserved as transcribed from OCR source pending verification.
- **Confidence:** LOW — "Do" is almost certainly "No" in the original.

### Page 5 — "The Workingmen, the Clergy, and the Fair"
- Page 5 OCR header shows page number "123" which is inconsistent with surrounding pages (130, 131, 132, 134) — likely an OCR misread of "133." Not affecting article text.

### Page 6 — "Religious Persecution in Maryland"
- "it had been noises about" — likely OCR error for "it had been *noised* about." Preserved as transcribed from OCR source.
- **Confidence:** LOW — "noises" is almost certainly "noised" in original.

### Page 8 — Editorial Notes
- "FOR ALL one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it" — the OCR "FOR ALL one" is unclear; likely "For all one" or possibly "For any one." Boilerplate subscription notice; skipped as publisher info.
- "Apoppos" — likely OCR error for "Apropos." Preserved as transcribed.
