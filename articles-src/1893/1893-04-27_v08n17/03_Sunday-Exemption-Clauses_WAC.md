Many Sunday laws have in them an exemption for those who "conscientiously believe that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath, and actually refrain from secular labor on that day," or who "keep another day of the week as holy time," or "observe as the Sabbath any other day of the week than Sunday," or "observe as the Sabbath one day in each seven, as herein provided." (See Sunday laws of Michigan, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Kentucky, etc.) But such exemptions are wrong for the following reasons:—

1. Because the law which gives occasion for them is wrong. A law which demands an exemption to prevent its coming in conflict with the inalienable rights and conscientious convictions of men, must certainly be wrong.

2. They are wrong because they are merely acts of toleration. To grant that the Government has a right to say whether the individual shall be allowed to exercise his rights or not, is to grant to it the power to deny him his rights. But toleration is not the doctrine of true civil and religious liberty, nor of the founders of the American Government.

Of Madison, history says:—

> Religious liberty was a matter that strongly enlisted his feelings. When it was proposed that, under the new Constitution, all should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, Madison pointed out that this provision did not go to the root of the matter. The free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, is something that carry man may demand as a right, not something for which he must ask as a privilege. To grant to the State the power of tolerating is implicitly to grant to it the power of prohibiting, whereas Madison would deny it any jurisdiction whatever in the matter of religion.—Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography, vol. 4, p. 165.

Dr. Philip Schaff, in laying down the same principles says:—

> Toleration is an important step from Statechurchism to free churchism. But it is only a step. There is a very great difference between toleration and liberty. Toleration is a concession which may be withdrawn; it implies a preference for the ruling form of faith and worship, and a practical disapproval of all other forms. . . . In our country we ask no toleration for religion and its free exercise, but we claim it as an inalienable right.—Schaff's Church and State in the United States, p. 14.

And Hon. Richard M. Johnson, in his famous Sunday Mail Report adopted by the United States Senate in 1829, well observed that,—

> Our Constitution recognizes in every person the right to choose his own religion and to enjoy it freely, without molestation. . . . The proper object of government is to protect all persons in the enjoyment of their civil as well as religious rights, and not to determine for any whether they shall esteem one day above another, or esteem all days alike holy. . . . What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights. . . They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights of which Government can not deprive any portion of citizens, however small. Do public power may invade those rights, but justice still confirms them.—American State Papers, pp. 90–100.

3. They are wrong, because to consent that they are right is to admit that the Government has a right to compel everybody to observe a rest day, which is not true. At most it can only enforce idleness; but it has no right to compel men to be idle, or to deprive them of their God-given time, so long as in their use of it they keep within the bounds of civility. Industry and not idleness is in the interest of both the individual and the Government.

Mr. Andrew Young, in his "Government Class Book," p. 198, speaking of personal liberty, says:—

> Every person has the right to go wherever he pleases, free from restraint on the part of others. If any one restrains him of his liberty even for a very short period or without violence, as by locking him in a room, he may recover damages. This is one of our most valued rights, and is forfeited only by crime.

4. They are wrong, because they require a religious observance, which civil government has no right to do, and are granted only upon religious considerations. In order to receive the benefit of the exemption, one must "conscientiously believe" that some other day than Sunday is "the Sabbath," and "actually refrain from business and labor on that day," or observe it "as the Sabbath."

5. They are wrong, because the exemption requires more of those who are exempted than the law itself requires of those who are not. They must "conscientiously" observe the day they keep, or keep it "as the Sabbath," while of those not exempted no such requirement is made, though as the exemption itself indicates, and as all men know, that is the implied intent of the law. Sunday laws, exemptions and all, are enacted for the purpose of enforcing the observance of a religious institution and compelling the conscience.

6. They are wrong, because to enact that which is professedly designed for the benefit of the consciences of one class only, is to enter upon class legislation, and thereby to consent that the Government may disregard the consciences of all other classes in this respect.

7. They are wrong, because for any class to ask for or accept of them is but selfishness. James Russell Lowell, in a poem entitled "Freedom," has well rebuked the asking for this sort of freedom, in the following words:—

> "Is true freedom but to break
> Fetters for our own dear sake,
> And with leather hearts forget
> That we owe mankind a debt?
> No; true freedom is to share
> All the chains our brothers wear;
> And, with heart and hand, to be
> In earnest to make others free."

8. They are wrong, because those who ask for or accept them thereby virtually shut themselves off from protesting against the law from which they have asked to be exempted; but all men everywhere have a right to protest and should protest against religious legislation on the part of civil government now and forevermore.

9. They are wrong, because they assume that the majority have rights and liberties to grant to the minority, which is false. Inalienable rights come from the Creator, and are possessed by all equally; and with the rights belongs the liberty to exercise and enjoy them. This assumption is clearly indicated in the following words of Rev. F. W. Ware, Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, for Michigan, in the Michigan Sabbath Watchman for June, 1892:—

> There is not a Seventh-day Adventist in this State that dare plow his field, or reap his grain, or build his house, or thrash his wheat, or chop his wood, without pleading his right to do so under the exemption clause of our laws, which clause has its root in his conscientious and religious convictions and customs. The only legal right the Seventh-day Adventists have to do secular work in shop, on house, in field, or to run their presses, etc., in their publishing concern on the Christian Sabbath, is a right given them by this State on religious grounds only.

That Seventh-day Adventists dare do and have done just what Mr. Ware here says they dare not do, reference needs only to be made to their practice in the State of Tennessee where there is no exemption clause to the State Sunday law, and in Arkansas during the time the exemption clause was there repealed.

10. They are wrong, because this assumption of superiority and of being the dispensers of the rights and liberties of others on the part of Sunday-keepers, carries with it the idea that they may rightfully curtail or deny those rights and privileges whenever they see fit to do so. Thus Mr. Crafts claims that—

> The tendency of legislatures and executive officers toward those who claim to keep a Saturday-Sabbath is to over leniency rather than over-strictness.—Crafts' "Sabbath for Man," p. 262.

Instead of granting exemption clauses, he says:—

> Infinitely less harm is done by the usual policy, the only constitutional or sensible one, to let the insignificantly small minority of less than one in a hundred, whose religious convictions require them to rest on Saturday (unless their work is of a private character such as the law allows them to do on Sunday) suffer the loss of one day's wages rather than have the ninety-nine suffer by the wrecking of their Sabbath by public business.—Ibid.

The Bill of Rights in the Kentucky State Constitution well declares—

> That absolute, arbitrary power over the lives, liberty, and property of free men exists nowhere in a republic, not even in the largest majority.

Mr. Andrew W. Young, in his "Government Class Book," p. 199, says:—

> Every man has a right to demand protection by the Government. This protection is afforded by its police and other civil officers. So, also, if these are not sufficient, the governor is bound to call out the militia, to protect even a single person.

This idea of Sunday-law makers being the benefactors of, and dispensers of rights to, those who observe another day than Sunday, is further shown in the words of Mr. Crafts, in his "Sabbath for Man," p. 262:—

> Instead of reciprocating the generosity shown toward them by the makers of Sabbath laws, these Seventh-day Christians expend a very large part of their energy in antagonizing such laws, seeking by the free distribution of tracts and papers to secure their repeal or neglect, seemingly on the policy of rule or ruin. They persuade very few to keep the seventh day; they only succeed in confusing the consciences of many about the first. They increase the desecration of the Lord's day, but not the hallowing of Saturday."

This is what the observers of the seventh day are asked to pay for exemption clauses. They are asked to cease their use of the freedom of speech and the press guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States; to say nothing against either the Sunday Sabbath or Sunday laws; in fact to say nothing about the Sabbath question at all. The Bill of Rights of the Constitution of West Virginia, says:—

> All men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion.

Here is the ground upon which the apostles stood (Acts 4:17-20; 5:27-29); here is where the Reformers of the sixteenth century stood; and here is where those who honor the divine precepts and the Sabbath of the Lord now stand.—W. A. Colcord, in Home Missionary.
