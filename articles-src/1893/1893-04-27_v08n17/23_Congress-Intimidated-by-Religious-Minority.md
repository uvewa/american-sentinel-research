A minister of the City of Chicago, the Rev. William Fawcett, when interviewed as to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, has said:—

> Congress decided that the Fair should remain closed on Sunday. Congress didn't dare to do anything else, not only because of the Sunday laws of Illinois but that course was demanded by the entire country, irrespective of the churches. A friend, who is a Congressman, told me that Congress did not dare to do otherwise than order the Fair closed on account of the petitions presented.

This is a plain statement. It is as much as to say, "We have intimidated Congress, and the members of Congress themselves meekly acknowledge that it is so." This minister's statement is faulty in several particulars—that Congress did not dare do otherwise than pass a Sunday closing proviso "because of the Sunday laws of Illinois" can not be. That would be one entirely sufficient reason why Congress should not meddle with anything which has already been provided for under State and municipal regulation. Again, the Sunday closing was not, and is not, "demanded by the entire country, irrespective of the churches." The proof of that is in the fact that many thousand more bona fide petitions were presented against this action of Congress than for it, and the views of the workingmen are exemplified by the present course of the Central Labor Union in avoiding the effects of the Sunday closing by taking another day of rest. The fact remains, however, that an aggressive religious minority has overawed Congress.
