A WRITER in the New York Observer quotes an expression to which Cardinal Gibbons lately gave utterance, and comments upon it thus:—

> At the recent dinner of the Catholic Club at Philadelphia, Cardinal Gibbons responded to the toast, "Church and State," with the words: "I am firmly persuaded, both by study and observation, that the Church is more steady in her growth, and is more prosperous in her career, when she is free to pursue her divine mission without any interference on the part of the State."
>
> Excellent, good, your Eminence, and so say we all of us! But now put the handle on the other side of the jug, and let it read in this way: That the State is more steady and prosperous when she is free from any interference on the part of the Church. Nobody in this country apprehends any interference with the Church on the part of the State, and there will be none until after such time as the Church shall have succeeded in her scheme for gaining control of the State. The church of which Cardinal Gibbons is so able a representative is now diligently and sagaciously at work upon that problem more energetically and more sanguinely hopeful than ever before, as the way seems to be closing up to it in other quarters of the world. It is the motive which has led to the establishment of a legate upon our soil; it dictates the policy of paternal interest in American institutions, American nationality and free schools; it scores its first great success when the scarlet figures of ecclesiasticism owning papal and Italian allegiance become the centre of interest and social flatter in the drawing rooms of prominent people at the capital of the land. When its undertaking, now in hand, is completed, the hierarchy which arrogates itself the exclusive right to call itself the Church will indeed be "free to pursue her mission without interference on the part of the State;" she will "run" the State. But how will it be with those bodies of Christian laborers and workers to whom she denies the right to be so named? The fine phrases of diplomacy serve very well as the glove of velvet to conceal the claws of craft, but Americans should not suffer themselves to be misled into too much confidence in a conversion to liberal sentiments so sudden and so wholesale.

The Observer accepts this article and prints it without comment, evidently failing to see that the sword of criticism which the writer only wields is double-edged,—that it cuts as deeply into the intents, purposes, and actual legal and legislative achievements of orthodox clericalism in this country as it does into the subtly deceptive phrases of the Cardinal. There are more churches in the United States than the church which Cardinal Gibbons represents, and it is from them that the country is in the most immediate danger. They have already assumed to dictate to legislatures and to Congress, and the State and national governments have submitted to their interference. To-day there is a religious rather than a civil supremacy in this country, but it is not the church of which Cardinal Gibbons is the prelate that rules. That this will eventually but unintentionally play into the hands of that church in true. In the meantime the State will be subjugated to clericalism, and a broad and easy way will be paved for that religious supremacy which is in idea essentially Roman Catholic. Every preparation is being made to accept and utilize all this which a fallen Protestant Church is doing for the assertion of Roman Catholic doctrines of the authority of the Church over the State. The church which asserts and exercises this supremacy must be, of necessity, Roman Catholic; for it is the doctrine of that church and no other. Whatever a church may call itself, the assumption of temporal authority, by virtue of that very act, makes it Roman Catholic. Now that the Church has "succeeded in her scheme for gaining control of the State" it is no wonder that "the church of which Cardinal Gibbons is so able a representative is now diligently and sagaciously at work" and "more sanguinely hopeful than ever before," for now all that it needs to do is to be ready, in the fullness of time, to claim its own.
