The Free Press, published at Greensborough, Md., has this news item:—

> Isaac Baker, of Kent Island, a recent convert to the Seventh-day Adventist doctrine, has been arrested for plowing on Sunday. He was fined five dollars and cost. From this he will take an appeal to court. Frequent violations of the Sunday law have been committed by these people.

The designation "these people" seems to define the mood of this editor as contemptuous towards those who frequently violate the Sunday law. Does the editor of the Free Press never infringe the Sunday law? or is there a large beam in his own eye? He might ask himself also why "these people" do not observe the Sunday law, and whether he has the same good reason for not observing it. It may be both the beam and the mote are in his own eye.
