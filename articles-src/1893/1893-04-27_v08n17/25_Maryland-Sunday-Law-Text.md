Like most of the older States Maryland inherited from the Church and State regime of the middle ages a number of relics of the days when kings were supposed to rule by divine right, and when the Pope as the vicegerent of the Son of God had the power to depose rulers that did not govern in the interests of "the Church." Among those relics is the following Sunday law; under which the late arrests for Sunday work in Maryland have been made:—

> Section 247. No person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday; and no person having children or servants shall command, or wittingly or willingly suffer, any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's day (works of necessity or charity always excepted), nor shall suffer or permit any children or servants to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fowling, hunting, or unlawful pastime or recreation; and every person transgressing this section, and being thereof convicted before a justice of the peace, shall forfeit $5.00, to be applied to the use of the county.

This law is not identical in its terms with the original Sunday law of Maryland, but it is a lineal descendant of the old statute which prescribed branding in the forehead and boring through the tongue for "Sunday-breaking" and "blasphemy." The principle is the same: the penalty has changed, but the right of the State to make such laws is still asserted; whether it will be maintained by the courts as it has been in Tennessee and elsewhere, remains to be seen.
