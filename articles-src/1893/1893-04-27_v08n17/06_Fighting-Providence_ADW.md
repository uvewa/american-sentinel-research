In a leaflet on the Sunday newspaper, published by the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Mrs. J. C. Bateham says:—

> The Sunday paper furnishes a providential test by which we can all measure ourselves and see whether we are of the world and love the world or whether we love the things of the kingdom. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union should labor and pray for its discontinuance, and give out leaflets against it at the news-stands and in our churches.

So it seems, according to their own words, that the mission of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, is to fight Providence. Providence has furnished a "test" by which they can measure and prove themselves, whether they be in the faith (2 Cor. 13:5); but instead of being thankful for the test, instead of counting it all joy when they fall into divers temptations, knowing that the trial of their faith worketh patience (James 1:2-4), instead of laboring and praying for grace that will enable them to endure the temptation and receive the blessing (James 1:12), they spend their energies in trying to get rid of the "test."

The idea seems to largely prevail among Church people at the present time that it is a bad thing for Christianity to have any tests in this world by which a Christian can distinguish himself from those who make no profession. And so they labor to abolish even these tests which they admit are providential. In another leaflet, Mrs. Bateham says: "The world would be speedily converted if the church of Christ were as consecrated in heart and life as in creed and covenant. We feel the need of a general revival, a baptism of the Holy Spirit, and for this, much earnest prayer is offered; but the blessing comes not." No wonder. The Bible does not say, "Blessed are they who abolish temptation," but it does say, "Blessed is the man that *endureth* temptation." Having lost their power to endure temptation, professed Christians are now seeking to abolish temptation. And thus they abolish the line between Christians and worldlings. The gospel is the power of God, and no one can tell whether he has the power of God unless he is tested.

To still further obliterate the dividing line between the Church and the world, they seek for laws which will compel *worldlings* to endure temptations. They will abolish as many temptations as possible and then try to compel sinners to endure with them those which they are unable to abolish. They want to compel sinners to undertake that which can only be accomplished by the power of God. "The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be," yet they think they can compel unconverted people to obey God. The Bible says "they that are in the flesh can not please God," and "without faith it is impossible to please him," yet they suppose it is highly pleasing to God for them to ask Congress to compel the ungodly to show respect for Christianity by trying to obey its laws and recognize its institutions. In short, they expect men to be saved by their own good works—the works of the flesh—instead of by the grace of God. They have forgotten that God counts human righteousness as "filthy rags." "For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God," "even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe."

Any one who undertakes to make men better morally by any other means than by conversion to God, is fighting Providence, opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation of men. They are turning people away from the righteousness of God to the righteousness of the flesh, which is nothing but sin. "Cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also."
