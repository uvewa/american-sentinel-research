In an address the Evangelical Alliance last week, the Rev. Dr. George urged that the Sunday question will come in the carrying of letters on the Sabbath is now being taken up energetically by the Secretary of the American Sabbath Union. Immediately after the World's Fair Sunday closing question is settled.

Our next fight will be to stop Sunday mails. We shall begin by arousing public sentiment as to the immorality and the sin of compelling one million of people to desecrate God's day. That is the way he puts it. He doesn't say anything about the rest of millions who violate the Sunday.

Editorials indicating the position taken by Dr. George were passed by the Alliance, and a committee was appointed to bring the matter before Congress and maintain it.

The Sign Signal has this paragraph:—

Such expressions as these show positive evidences of the religious promotion and agitation that is going on around about the country by invoking the civil law for its aid, in behalf of Sunday observance. The sentiment is growing, but so is the opposition, and the conflict must deepen. The sentiment is right from it now; for compulsory religious legislation to persecute is inconsistent with every principle of the American form of religion which has received governmental acceptance.
