A CLEAR-MINDED Bostonian writes a little sound doctrine to the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle, who publishes the letter with a comment, as follows:—

To the Editor of the Brooklyn Eagle:

In your issue of the 9th inst., in the course of an article on "The Fair and Sunday," you say that undoubtedly the "national authorities had a right to make an appropriation conditional on Sunday closing." Now, this is precisely what the national authorities had not the right to do. The Constitution distinctly forbids Congress to enact religious legislation of any kind. All law-making in the interest of, or in antagonism to, any religion is clearly unconstitutional. Congress has not the slightest right to meddle. It was the intention of the fathers to keep Church and State separate.

E. C. WALKER.

S Somerset Street, Boston, April 14, 1893.

[If the correspondent is correct the appropriation falls with the condition attached to it. We have not heard, however, that E. C. Walker or any other man of sin favors giving up the appropriation.—Ed. Eagle.]

The item as it appears in the Eagle is headed "State Religion and the Fair. Rest, not Religion, and Sanitary, not Devout, Considerations Prevailed." This title is a juggling with words, which, if it shows anything, proves that the editor of the Eagle knows better than to have made the comment which follows the letter. If the Eagle's correspondent is correct the appropriation does not, necessarily, fail with the condition attached to it. The appropriation is perfectly proper; it was entirely within the authority of Congress to make such an appropriation, but it was not within the authority of Congress to attach the proviso which it did. The appropriation was accepted; it was a valid appropriation; there was no reason why it should not be accepted. The proviso was also accepted, but the acceptance of it did not give Congress the right to do that which was unconstitutional,—it only involved the Fair management in the acceptance of an unlawful legislative act. If the directors of the Fair appreciate this fact, that Congress and a certain religious element have led them into this anomalous position, it is perfectly proper for them to plead that they can not undertake to do what Congress was forbidden by law to ask of them. This is a perfectly well recognized principle of law. It is also entirely clear that as Congress had perfect right to make the appropriation, and it was made in due form and transferred, that no amount of illegal and unconstitutional provisos would invalidate the original appropriation. All that would fail would be the provisos which were null and void ab initio.

The truth is that Congress stands before the country disgraced, from whatever point of view the matter is considered. It has yielded to the clamor of an influential minority and passed an unconstitutional act. It would seem that nothing could well be worse than this, but Congress has gone farther and made itself ridiculous by attaching to its appropriation a proviso which not only can not be enforced, but which leaves the Fair managers a good and sufficient defense and which inculpates Congress either of ignorance or wilful violation of the plainest constitutional and legal principles.

It is difficult to see why the editor of the *Eagle* made, in his comment, the reference which he has to the man of sin, except it were to show that he comprehends that which he denies,—that this Sunday-closing question is a religious question and can not possibly be any other.
