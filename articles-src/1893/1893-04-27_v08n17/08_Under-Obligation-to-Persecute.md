Such has subsequently acquired adopted at the Reformation the Protestant carried it off, and along with it the erroneous and tradition of the observance of the first day of Luther's time and the Sunday the particular tradition of that day of rest which was the beginning of the apostasy.

The church is in favor of the largest measure of civil and Sunday rest. Sunday is not the Sabbath, and she will after her course. The law being of divine origin, is that she has been placed the right to compel.

Now Sunday was made to the church a day of rest—of obligation—by the church, and not to fulfil their duties on that day. When there is no obligation to keep the day, there is no moral right to force others to keep it.

Why then have they made sufficient clauses for all? Why should they need to? The only obligation of the country on the subject would be to take a rest day if necessary, and not to seek compliance in the suggestion. Not for want time of effort or pressure has the effort failed. Petitions numerous were taken by envoy of the Protestant clergy of this country, before Congress, praying Congress to close the Fair on Sunday. In addition the churches of the United States they would compel all the rest of us to observe this day. They plainly told Congress that the Fair be closed on Sundays—and such are all battle cry of civil and religious liberty movement.

That the Sunday-closing of the Fair movement was a legitimate and logical outcome of the religious agitation to close the Fair on Sunday to obedience, the Bishop did not think the grounds would be closed for it all in any event, but as in the case of the Centennial at Philadelphia, thousands of the farmers, the small of its craft it is reported to work six days the church pertained to order. He thought it religious used that a minority should rule in this matter, and cited the Fair Expositions, where three times treated the Sabbath every day. Every case in which order and decorum were maintained.

Most of the congregations, interest however, were uncompromisingly opposed in the course of the Central Labor Union, among those was the Rev. Frederick A. Barnard, pastor of the Union Park Congregational Church, who, in answer to the question:—

I do not at all agree with the stand labor is taking that the World's Fair should be opened on Sunday. Any attempt to shift the day would be a most iniquitous attempt to get a certain class of legislation. A movement of this kind should be allowed opposition by a majority of all the people. And the common action.

The Supreme Court has declared this to be a Christian nation. Much of the earliest and most important legislation of this country were laid in Christian truth. Vast expenditures of the institutions of the public of our forefathers to preserve these institutions as we have them passed and our religion would be to forsake the principles of the men who founded them. Will in general who don't believe in liberty, we'll have enough.

This is try for tenure, not liberty, and it comes very near tyranny. As stated the Sunday agitation which began to come in on us like a flood about forty years ago, gradually prepared the way by which we were a generation prepared for the Sunday-law agitators who are endeavoring to sectionize the Sabbath day question of the country.

The Rev. William Fawcett was seen at the South Evanston Methodist Church. He said as follows:—

Such a course as to turn Sunday into a working day would be the climax to all offenses. A committee of Congress decided, further that the Fair should be closed on Sundays. Lately a committee of the Board of Trade of Chicago, representing the interests of Illinois, but that this course was demanded by the sentiment of the people all over the land. Since then their action was sustained by the President in signing the bill. The argument is absurd. The logic of the argument would carry the people beyond keeping what they were, and this course was all that Congress did not dare to do otherwise than its petitions close the Sunday Fair, and would be presented. Those petitions poured in from all over the country, from men representing the best congregations and even people who had not a direct claim for years.

A MINISTER of the City of Chicago, the Rev. William Fawcett, when interviewed on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, has said:—

Congress decided that the Fair should remain closed Sunday. Congress didn't dare to do otherwise than close on Sunday, for the people of Illinois but this excuse was demanded by the sentiment of the people all over the land. President Harrison, who is a Congressman, tell me that Congress did dare do otherwise; and close the Fair they closed but in the account of the petitions presented.

This is a plain statement. It is as much so to say, "We have intimidated Congress, and the members of Congress themselves meekly acknowledge that it is so." This minister's statement is faulty in several particulars—that Congress did not dare do otherwise than pass a Sunday closing bill, "because" the Sunday laws of Illinois" can not be. That would be one entirely sufficient reason if Congress should not meddle with anything which has already been provided for under State and municipal regulation. Again, the Sunday closing was just, and is it "demanded by the entire country," irrespective of the churchmen." The proof of that is in the fact that many thousands of them bore Bible petitions were presented against the action of Congress than for it, and the views of the workingmen are absolutely clear in regard to it. The Central Labor Union in involving the official Trades of the unions of Alleman for Sunday closing by striking and taking a full day of rest. The fact remains, however, that an aggressive religious minority has demanded it.

In Maryland, as elsewhere, the Sunday law has not been enforced heretofore. Richmond, street cars, drumsticks, and the tins mills have been run on the first day of the week much as on the other days; even papers are issued and sold and in the summer season excursions are run to various resorts. Now, however, it is being rigidly enforced, in some sections, against Seventh-day Adventists.

The appealed case of John Judefind, the Seventh-day Adventist, of Rock Hall, Md., was heard on Wednesday, April 19, and decision reserved.

Like most of the older States Maryland inherited from the Church and State region of the middle ages a number of relics of the days when kings were supposed to rule by divine right, and when the Pope as the vicegerent of the Son of God had the power to depose rulers that did not govern in the interests of "the Church." Among these relics is the following Sunday law; under which the indictments for Sunday work in Maryland have been found:

SECTION 317. No person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's Day, commonly called Sunday; and no person having children or servants shall command, or willingly or knowingly suffer, any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's Day (works of necessity and charity always excepted), nor shall any person on the Lord's Day be engaged in the sale of any goods, wares, or merchandize, or in the performance of any ordinary work, except that of piety, charity, or necessity; and if any person shall be convicted of doing or performing any of the above acts, shall forfeit $5.00, to be applied to the use of the county.

Its law is not identical in its terms with the original Sunday law of Maryland. The act as originally enacted was one of the old statutes which prescribed branding in the forehead and boring through the tongue for "Sunday-breaking" and "blasphemy." The principal change is the penalty has changed, but the right of the State to make laws is taken for granted; whether it will be maintained by the courts, as it has been in Tennessee is elsewhere, remains to be seen.

The *Free Press*, published at Greensborough, Md., has this time given to item:—

John Judefind, of Rock Hall, a farmer, known as a has been held in a court process to the several Seventh-day Adventist doctrine, several Adventists for doing work on Sunday in the sum of five dollars and cost. From this he will take an appeal. This is said to be the first case of the kind that has been heard in this county, and the new law has been community to law the county from the Adventists.

The designation "these people" is enough to define the mood of this religious community towards the Adventists who have violated the Sunday law. Now the editor of the *Free Press* knows whether there is any ground law of not there is a Sunday law 1 or is there a large beam in his eye? Its might be also stated that "these people" do not observe the Sunday, but, and whether he has the same good reason for not doing so. It may be both the beam and the mote are in his own eye.
