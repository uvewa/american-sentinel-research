WHAT is the spirit which incites the members of one religious denomination to bring a civil action against those who belong to another denomination because of a difference in religious belief and practice? Is it a Christian spirit? Did the Master leave any such precept, or example?

THERE is no other incentive for the prosecution for first-day labor, of those who observe the seventh day, than that of religious intolerance and jealousy. These prosecutions, with a view solely to persecute, are now in progress in two States, Tennessee and Maryland. In both States complaint has been made and actions brought at the instigation of members of a so-called Christian denomination, professors of religion in good standing. Will such a course injure their position in their church affiliation, or will it redound to their credit?

IN Tennessee, clergymen have interested themselves in the carrying on of prosecution, have provided prosecuting counsel when a case seemed liable to go by default for lack of legal attention; and in Maryland information has been laid by a clergyman, and he himself has appeared as a prosecuting witness against a faithful Christian man, because of a conscientious change in religious belief and practice. Does the Methodist denomination at large uphold its ministers in such a course? Are they ordained for such work as this?

THE religious organizations, throughout the country, which boast their orthodoxy, have been laying the foundations deep for just such procedure as this—the persecuting prosecutions of Christian men, by those who have been ordained to preach the gospel. Have these religious bodies realized the ultimate results of their action? Have they recognized the fact that the logic of their course is the establishment of an inquisition, and the furnishing of informers and prosecutors for this inquisition from their own clergy? That this will be the inevitable result does not need to be said. It is the result which has already been realized. Is the religious denomination, whose representatives have been the first to prove this true, ready to accept the responsibility? Are all they, whose voices, whose petitions, and whose votes, in favor of Sunday laws, have aided to make these persecutions possible, ready to say, "Let all the wrong done to these men in the name of religion be upon our heads?" It will be a humiliating awakening for those who, like Paul, faithfully believe that in persecuting they do God service; but it will be a sadder wakening yet for those who are incited by such personal considerations as influenced the silversmiths of Ephesus.
