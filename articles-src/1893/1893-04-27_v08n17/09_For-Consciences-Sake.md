W. DUCE, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Los Angeles, was fined five dollars for refusing to appear as a witness in court. He refused to pay the fine and was sent to jail. He said he hated to offend Judge Bartholomew, but he would linger in jail for an indefinite period before he would offend the Judge of the universe by attending to any business on Saturday.

We commend Mr. Duce for daring to stand by his conscience in this matter, even though it was against the court. Now the question arises, could Judge Bartholomew impose such punishment upon Mr. Duce? Will the law, to say nothing of justice, bear him out in this act?

Man's dealings with, and obligations to, his fellow-man may be thus tampered or interfered with, but when it comes to the matter of a man's duty to his Maker, as he sees it, it is another and different thing. We do not propose to try to ride any man's hobby, on any line, but such things as we have above referred to seem unfair and unjust, to say the least.—Call, Norwalk, Cal.
