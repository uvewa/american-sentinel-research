The Central Labor Union, in and near Chicago, has systematically undertaken to arrange with employers for a weekly day of rest other than Sunday, during the continuance of the World's Fair. Such an outcome of the matter as this was entirely unexpected. A reporter for the Chicago Evening Journal has sought to obtain the views of some of Chicago's clergymen by this question: "What do you think of the proposition of the working classes to convert the Sabbath into a working day, and rest on one of the secular days of the week, so that they can attend the World's Fair without losing either time or money?"

To this the answers were quite various. There were some notable instances of clergymen who were ready with manly candor and openness of speech to acknowledge that no man was responsible to another for his religious belief or performance, and that no man had the right to enforce any religious belief or performance on another. Among these especially noteworthy was Rev. Thomas C. Hall, of the Forty-first Presbyterian Church, also Dr. A. J. Canfield, of St. Paul's Universalist Church. The reply of Rev. Father Cashman, parish priest of St. Jarlath's Parish, is quite suggestive; it is this:—

> The church insists, remember, upon a proper observance of Sunday in commemoration of the resurrection of her Head and the descent of the Holy Ghost. But that is church law, not divine. There is no command in the Bible which directs the observance of Sunday. That is canon law, and though our Protestant neighbors have borrowed the day from us, we have no desire to meddle with them in its enjoyment in their own peculiar fashion. At the same time we don't want them to meddle with us. Now, as to Sunday being a Christian institution, an error so loudly proclaimed, in the strict sense of the word it was not instituted either by Christ or his church. It is not ordered by divine law nor was it ordered by the church. Constantine decreed the observance of Sunday in order to give the Christians a chance to compete with the pagans, and recognizing it as a good thing, the church in her subsequent councils adopted it. At the Reformation the Protestants carried it off, along with many other good things; but the Sunday of Luther's time and the Sunday the puritanical among us seek to enforce, are two very different things.
>
> The church is in favor of the largest measure of liberty at all times, and when it comes to a question between the classes and the masses it is not probable that she will alter her course. The law being of her own making, rather than see the masses oppressed by the classes, she will doubtless abrogate her law. Sunday was made by the church a day of rest and devotion, and she requires her children to fulfill their duties on that day. When these duties have been attended to, the remainder of the day is properly used for recreation.
>
> While they have made sufficient clamor for millions I believe the proportion of bigots is really small. The best way to ascertain the real feeling of the country on the subject would be to take a plebiscitum, if such a thing were possible. There is the suggestion. Now let some man of affairs provide the machinery for carrying it out.
>
> In conclusion, I wish to say that the position of coercion taken by so many of the Protestant clergy—the position that although they are admittedly in a hopeless minority of all the people of those United States they would compel all the rest of us to accept their Sunday dogmas by recourse to law and other methods—is a grievous departure from their old battle cry of civil and religious liberty.

Rabbi Emil O. Hirsch said that this movement was a legitimate and logical outcome of the congressional action to close the Fair on Sunday in obedience to the demand of a religious minority. The Rabbi did not think the grounds would be closed to all in any event, but, as in the case of the Centennial at Philadelphia, thousands of the favored classes would be permitted to enter. He thought it ridiculous that such a minority should rule in this matter, and cited the Paris Exposition, where with three hundred thousand people on the grounds Sundays perfect order and decorum were maintained.

Most of the clergymen interviewed, however, were uncompromisingly opposed to the course of the Central Labor Union, among these was the Rev. Frederick A. Noble, pastor of the Union Park Congressional Church, who, in answer to the first question, said:—

> I do not at all agree with the stand labor is taking. Divine law requires the observance of that day and society has adjusted itself to its recognition. Any attempt to shift the day would be an attempt to evade the commandment.

"If Sunday observance as you advocate it is considered oppressive by a majority of all the people, would you still enforce it?"

> Exactly as I would enforce the law in any other respect. The Supreme Court has declared this to be a Christian country, and the foundations of the country were laid in Christian truth. Vast expenditures of time and money have been made to build up our institutions, and we owe it to the fathers to preserve those institutions as we have received them—just as we must preserve our liberty. There are many in Europe and the Old World in general who don't believe in liberty, but we believe in it, and are bound to maintain free institutions and our civil liberty.
>
> This cry is for license, not liberty, and it comes from the large foreign element of our population which began to come in on us like a flood about forty years ago. These people have obtained altogether too much voice in our affairs, and they are the ones who are endeavoring to secularize the Sabbath day which we are commanded to keep holy.

The Rev. William Fawcett was seen and the same question asked. He said:—

> Such a course as to turn Sunday into a working day on any excuse would be anarchistical, because it would be in direct violation of the State law. Congress decided, further, that the Fair should remain closed on Sunday. Congress did n't dare to do anything else, not only because of the Sunday law of Illinois, but that course was demanded by the entire country, irrespective of the churches. A friend of mine who is a congressman told me that Congress did not dare to do otherwise than order the Fair closed, on account of the petitions presented. Those petitions poured in from all over the country, and were signed by all classes—men of no religion, laborers, professional men, churchgoers, and even people who had not been inside a church for years.
>
> The working people, or at least some of them, claim that they can't see the Fair on week days on account of the expense. I have no sympathy with their talk. They can pour out by the thousands on Sunday to bail games, theaters, and picnics, and spend their fifty cents or a dollar, often more. Let them add an hour, or an hour and a half, to their working day five days in the week, and then take Saturday off to see the Fair. That will give them Sunday to rest.

The Rev. Dr. Withrow, pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church, was asked, "Would you compel others to observe Sunday in your way?" and replied:—

> Never! I believe in the fullest religious and civil liberty. But neither civil nor religious liberty means lawlessness on the part of any portion of the community. There is a Sabbath observance law on the statute books of this and most of the other States, and the Supreme Court has lately recognized the Christian Sabbath. Sunday observance is the law of the land, and that law must be enforced the same as any other law. Anything less than that would be anarchy.

It is apparent that the contradiction involved in this answer was entirely unrecognized by the reverend gentleman. There is much food for thought in these interviews.
