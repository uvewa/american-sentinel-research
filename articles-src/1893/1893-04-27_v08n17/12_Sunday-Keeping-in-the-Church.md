It seems the Presbyterian Church, in South Carolina, has decided that its members must observe Sunday. The following despatch gives the incidents of a church trial, for a failure in strict Sunday observance, of a member of the Presbyterian Church in Columbus, S. C.

> The Presbyterian Church in South Carolina has a fight on its hands that promises to lay the famous Woodrow case on the shelf for all time to come. The case arose at the Charleston Presbytery, which is now in session in Columbia, and came up in this way. A young girl, very respectfully connected, was expelled from the Presbyterian Church for the charge of working on Sunday. Her name is Sadie Means, a family name quite prominent among the four hundred of South Carolina. She works in the telephone exchange, and this involves several hours work on Sunday.
>
> It transpired at the trial of her case before the presbytery that this poor girl had been summoned before the session of the church and forced to confess that she worked on Sunday. The pastor, Rev. G. A. Blackburn, offered to pay her expenses of learning stenography, and Elder McCreery offered her a place as cash girl in his dry goods store. These offers the girl declined, but requested a letter of dismissal, with a view of joining another church. Then these men expelled her.
>
> Her uncle carried the case before the presbytery on appeal, and for three days the presbytery devoted its time to discussing this matter. It was brought out during the discussion that there were six or seven male members of the same church who habitually worked on Sunday—a newspaper man, an expressman, a railroad man, and others. But it was claimed by Mr. Blackburn, the pastor, that these men were in sin before he took hold of the church.
>
> The presbytery, after gravely discussing the matter for three days, confirmed the action of the session expelling the telephone girl by a vote of twenty to six, all the ministers except Rev. W. T. Thompson, of Charleston, voting with the majority.
>
> The case has been taken to the synod on appeal, and the Presbyterian throughout the State are in a bad state of mind over it.

Another account states that the pastor of the church from which Miss Means was expelled, declared that if the charges were not sustained in the presbytery, and his action, in dismissing the young woman from church membership for attending to her telephone duties on Sunday, upheld, he could not remain pastor of the church.

The prospect for Sunday observance trials both within and without the church is large. Why is not the plea that Sunday is not the Sabbath a very proper defense before an ecclesiastical court? It may be that synod and presbyteries may be compelled to listen to a full presentation of this plea, as these church trials continue.
