The Law and Order League, which announced some time ago that they hoped by vigorous Sunday law in this city, hopes work to stop the running of the Sunday newspapers and modes of evidence, which has been laid before the law as yet the city authorities, and among other accusations is the Citizens Traction Company for running cars on Sunday, and wholesale dealers for violating the Sunday law. Probably the biggest thing in the way of fines for the violators of the Sunday law is the daily newspapers, each of them paid a visit to the forwarding association, and it was there determined that from now onward, they shall not, from necessity, but solely to increase their profits under an agreement with the papers take exempt for the loss of the profits of that were of their charge.

The League's lawyer advises that the matter be left to the civil courts. He says that the publication is not a violation of the law but its delivery by mail is. The legislature allows no sign of relenting.

This is about as ridiculous a result as the effort of the Sunday closing of the Fair in Chicago open the workingman for wages based on principle. Whether it was to be desired. It is poetic justice that the advocates of the strict enforcement of Sunday laws should be hanged or being hoist with their own petard. In the one case Sunday newspapers are the things to be enforced against themselves. In the cases the no every claim to be done for the religious one was ostensibly had take assured rest of their own desire, the result that they may work on Sunday when the Fair is closed, and be free from labor when it is opened in a day that the Fair is open. But the dramatic condition was satisfied, the laws are and must be enforced to all who glories sides of this question, is preached God forth, good enough fruit in time. There will be no more enforcing than the printed page. When the Pittsburg enforcement of Sunday laws upon them, has shown how that unreasonable, improper, unjust and unchristian such laws are, not when the Sunday-closing episode at Chicago has taught hundreds of thousands that Sunday is not the Sabbath and that the fourth commandment will doubly wrong, will they themselves too and surely be beyond that?
