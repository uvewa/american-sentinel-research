An editorial writer in the Christian Statesman asks, "After the Victories, What?" and proceeds to answer his question thus:—

> Christians have been too timid in invoking the aid of the civil law in protecting the Sabbath against the open and gross violation of its claims. It is a part of the law of the land. It is an essential element in every government over men. The law of the Sabbath is the central commandment in the Decalogue. And there is not a command in the divine code more vital to human welfare than that of the Sabbath. It is one of those God-given rights which government is bound to secure to men. The protection of the Sabbath, in its civil claim, is, therefore, one of the plainest functions in civil government. But how slow have the Christian citizens of this land been to invoke the authority of the civil law against the bold and even defiant desecrations of the day. This has given the transgressors immunity in their wicked work. Learning by experience that the violation of any other precept of the Decalogue incurs certain penalty, but that the violation of the law of the Sabbath meets with scarce a protest from the better classes of the community, and is almost certain of immunity from the penalty of the law, the Sabbath desecrator becomes held in his work. The lessons of the past few months ought to be sufficient to convince the most unwilling mind that the civil law has an important and imperative obligation toward the Sabbath. And if the Sabbath is to hold a place among the beneficent institutions of this land, Christians must learn that they have an imperative obligation toward the maintenance and enforcement of the civil law of the Sabbath.

Such expressions as these are positive evidence of the religious prosecutions and persecutions which are to come. Timidity in invoking the civil law for the enforcement of Sunday observance will not exist much longer. The sentiment is gaining ground rapidly that the imperative obligation to persecute is incumbent upon all professors of the accepted form of religion which has received governmental sanction.
