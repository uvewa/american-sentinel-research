What is the spirit which invites the members of one religious denomination to bring a civil action against those who belong to another denomination because of a difference in religious belief and practice? Is it a Christian spirit? Did the Master leave any such precept, or example?

There is no section of the country where the observers of the first-day labor, or those who observe the seventh day, than that of religious intolerance and jealousy. These prosecutions, with a view solely to persecution, are in progress in Iowa, State, Tennessee and Maryland. In the State complaint has been made and entered at the instigation of members of a so-called Christian denomination, professors of religion in good standing. Will such a course injure their position in church? Will it be of standing reduced to their credit?

In Tennessee, clergymen have interested themselves in the carrying on of prosecution when a case failed to come up by default for lack of legal attention; and in Maryland information has been laid by a clergyman, and he himself has appeared as a prosecuting witness against a faithful Christian man, because of conscientious changes in religious belief and practice. Does the Methodist denomination at large uphold its ministers in such a course? Are they ordained to work at this?

The religious organizations, throughout the country, which boast their orthodoxy, have been laying the foundation deep for such prosecutions as this—the personal prosecution of Christian men, by those who have been ordained to preach the gospel. Have these religious bodies realized the ultimate results of their actions? Have they recognized the fact that the logic of their course is the establishment of an inquisition, and the furnishing of informers and prosecutors for this inquisition from their own clergy? That this will be the inevitable result does not need to be said. It is the result which has already been realized. Is this religious denomination, whose representatives have laid the informations and prosecuted, ready to accept the responsibility? Are all they, whose voices, whose petitions, and whose votes, in favor of Sunday laws, have aided to make these prosecutions possible, ready to say, "let all the wrong done to these men in the name of religion be upon our heads"? It will be a humiliating awakening for those who, like Paul, faithfully believe that in promoting this they do God service; but it will be a sadder awakening yet for those who are incited by such personal considerations as indicate toward the allowances of Ripmann.

## A Flash of Reason in a Cloud of Words.

Those who heard the utterances of Joseph Cook before the House Committee on the World's Fair, in reference to the question of closing the Chicago Exposition, or have since read what he said there, will be interested to know that in one of his Boston Monday lectures, Mr. Cook has declared that he was in sympathy with that dramatic act of Senator Quay, which has stirred to their uttermost depths the bigots of all National Reformers, when he sent the Bible to the clerk's desk open at the fourth commandment, in the United States Senate of the United States, that the divine law might be the authority directly applied and embodied into his proviso to close the World's Fair on Sunday.

In reference to this incident, Mr. Cook says:—

No one says more than I wish to shake off soot from all theories which tend toward mixture of Church and State.

One of his hearers was so displeased with what Mr. Cook said in the attempt to thus shake himself loose, that he wrote him the following letter:—

Your statement last Monday that the civil Sabbath is not based upon the fourth commandment seems to me a very unphilosophical position. It seems to me, deprive our Sabbath laws of their moral value, for a law that has not behind it and underlying it authority of God behind it, a civil law will not bind the conscience. The ten commandments are a translation of the law of nature, as well as an authoritative rule of spiritual life. They have a civil side and an ecclesiastical side. They were given to the nation of Israel as their constitution, and so the "touch of Jove" in a law of ecclesiastical life. For our State to recognize them as the foundation of moral obligation is no more tends to unite Church and State than family relations create a union between the family and the Church. The ten commandments have been placed in Christian hands at the administration of Church discipline. They are the laws of Christ, a King of nations and nations, as moral beings, should recognize his authority, as they should recognize his law in Christ. But this law, being a rule of life to the individual the Church, in its membership, is bound to recognize and enforce the State, in their respective spheres, are bound to enforce it in Ohio. One Sabbath law is founded and grounded on the fourth commandment, and from the chief justice of that old Jewry they are not a Sunday observance ordinance.

It will not be misinterpreting to analyze this entire sentence by analyzing it; and but that the statement that the civil Sabbath is not based upon the fourth commandment deprives Sunday purely of their moral value. It should be noticed in the first place that the "civil Sabbath" is "Sunday" and not the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. The Sabbath of itself the fourth commandment has no civil value. Its moral value is meant religious or divine weight of authority. That this is the plain meaning of the phrase "moral value" is shown by the next sentence, "for a law that has not behind it and underlying it authority of God behind it," etc. Now for the observance of Sunday as a civil Sabbath there must necessarily be civil ordinances, they are laws of human origin. God's law says nothing of the observance of Sunday but these laws are the "authority of God behind it," and it has not, and never had, and cannot have it in these commandments. "Our Sabbath laws," therefore cannot be deprived of which they were truly deprived, but there is a Sabbath law, from which does bind the conscience, and God's Sabbath law contravenes those Sunday laws; this inconsistency that "our Sabbath laws," are void, and all are seen as Sabbath demand is divinely false utterly.

It is true, in any sense, that "the ten commandments are a translation of the law of nature"? A "law of nature" is an expression "describing the standard of action of morality deducible from a study of beings independent of supernatural revelation." The ten commandments are an authoritative statement of moral law, which can only be known by supernatural revelation, of the nature and natural relations of beings. The apostle says "that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them."

They are neither a "civil code" nor a translation of human origin and authority, but the expression of divine authority that "thy commandments are truth" and "thy commandments are righteousness." Righteousness is primarily an attribute of God only. The commandments are thus but righteousness which is his character, and not a civil code which is a system of human ordinance, not an ecclesiastical law which is a human institution for the divine government of the Church. They were not given to the Jewish nation or the Jewish Church, but to the whole human family.

Sunday laws cannot create a union between the family and the Church, and not in the formal civil recognition of the ten commandments as the "foundation of moral obligation" unite Church and State.

The ten commandments are in the hands of Christ to be "administered" only through the Church. Every believer who accepts Christ is by his faith subject to obey, and not to the law; for except through his faith in Christ they are simply condemnation to penalty.

Christ is not "King of nations" until "the kingdoms of this world" in the day of which he said shall take place,—"Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out." Then shall his kingdom, which "is not of this world" be set up.

"Nations are not moral beings, but are composed of mortal beings who are individually subject to the law as many as are dead have died individually and not nationally."

The Church of God is not under the law to Christ—only those members—hypothetically: whom he will say in the last day, "I never knew you." They who have become forgiven are free from condemnation to penalty, keeping in force the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. The individual but not in the family or nation, is the unit of society. The commandments are a rule of life to the individual members of the church body. "The family and the Church are composed." Neither is to do the commandments, bringing men into subjection to Christ, but the power is to bring men to Christ.

Our Sunday laws are not rooted and grounded upon this foundation.

Men can make no Sabbath or Sunday laws which will be separate from the ten commandments of God, any more than a law which man can issue is "worth the paper which it is written on."

Rev. Joseph Cook answered this letter; but did his replies and refuted this statement that "the civil Sabbath is not based upon the fourth commandment"? Here is his reply:—

*Dear Mr. Pastor:*—We do not disagree in fundamentals. The civil Sabbath rests upon the Sabbatical rest day. But I could not make this divine institution the same as the fourth commandment; for I believe there was a day of rest obligatory on man as the foundation of moral law, of example and precept justly the observance of the commandments began in the world before the Decalogue, and it stands on much that went before it as well as upon the Decalogue itself. Our forefathers said that religion is the foundation of morals, and morals the foundation of government, and the Republic rested and now rests on the ground on which it was first placed by our forefathers,—in the recognition of great general truths.

This letter of Mr. Cook's illuminates the situation as do lightning flashes. It is the answer of the spiritualist who, when driven from one position to another, confesses, from the most intellectual or the most ignorant of the departed spirits, about the same intellectual average, replied that it was because of his being through so many mansions. Mr. Cook, having an "infinitesimal perceptivity" which attended sensory perceptions and which the apostleship of the serve stimuli to which terrestrial evolution gives, is manifestly equal to one so in the stress of observing with a cloud of words.

I would trust that Mr. Cook or Mr. J. meant of insinuation emitted a flash of reason. It represents the one flash of practical common sense uttered by an advocate of a civil Sunday, and it was this: "Our forefathers said now and ever was the ground on which it was first placed by our forefathers,—in the recognition of general truths."
