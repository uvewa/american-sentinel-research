IN Bay City, Iowa, the Mayor has ordered all business closed on Sunday, without discrimination or exception.

-----

AT a Gospel Volunteer meeting recently held in Detroit, Mich., not long since, it was reported that the American Sabbath Union has every local union organized and in active operation in that State.

-----

THE city attorney of Norwich, Conn., has begun a Sunday-closing crusade; notice has been given to the barbers that unless it is not open their shops on Sunday, and druggists have been notified as well they do or may not sell on that day.

-----

Attorneys of the views of London recently the clerical movement for government closings of observance, reprinted on addresses of which observance, reported on addresses of which in a report what is stated comes England has the possibility on compiling as possible facts being made to the manner in which the Prince of Wales spends his Sundays; his last offense has been a party of the discussion given to some friends merely by theatrical exhibition.

This dispatch from Pittsburg of April 14, shows how these Sunday cases stand: As you all see and how the judicial precedents will be invariably established against of the real principles involved—

Judge White has day handed down at some time three reports from the decision of Alderman some manager of the Pittsburg Press, who was recently fined four hundred dollars in the case of alderman for publishing and selling papers on Sunday. At the conclusion of his opinion Judge White said:—

I am of the opinion that the defendant can not show ordinary publishing with regard to a penalty. The case will be appealed to the Supreme Court. When the State courts and the United States Court have all adjudicated upon this question, then no legislation will be found ready to repeal those laws which all courts have sustained. This the enterprising town itself, its own authority and support.

PRESIDENT PALMER, of the World's Columbian Exposition, has said to a reporter for the Detroit Tribune that "it would just the Fair near to open it on Sunday. The churches, Epworth Leagues, Christian Endeavor Societies, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, etc., would boycott the Fair, and they are pretty powerful."

-----

Their capacity to terrorize in just this manner is precisely that which those professedly Christian elements in society have all along boasted. Their triumph has been that, although they were a majority, exercise an influence, and by being ready to affiliate whenever their ends could be reached, hold the balance of power and exercise control. This policy will be continued.

A MINISTER of the City of Chicago, the Rev. William Fawcett, when interviewed on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, has said:—

Congress decided that the Fair should remain closed Sunday. Congress didn't dare to do otherwise. The sentiment of the people of Illinois but this excuse was demanded by the sentiment of the people all over the land. President Harrison, who is a Congressman, tell me that Congress did dare do otherwise; and close the Fair they closed at the account of the petitions presented.

This is a plain statement. It is as much so to say, "We have intimidated Congress, and the members of Congress themselves meekly acknowledge that it is so." This minister's statement is faulty in several particulars—that Congress did not dare do otherwise than pass a Sunday closing bill, "because" the Sunday laws of Illinois" can not be. That would be one entirely sufficient reason if Congress should not meddle with anything which has already been provided for under State and municipal regulation. Again, the Sunday closing was just, and is it "demanded by the entire country," irrespective of the churchmen." The proof of that is in the fact that many thousands of them bore Bible petitions were presented against the action of Congress than for it, and the views of the workingmen are absolutely clear in regard to it. The Central Labor Union in involving the official Trades of the unions of Alderman for Sunday closing by striking and taking a full day of rest. The fact remains, however, that an aggressive religious minority has demanded it.

-----

In Maryland, as elsewhere, the Sunday law has not been enforced heretofore. Richmond, street cars, drumsticks, and the tins mills have been run on the first day of the week much as on the other days; even papers are issued and sold and in the summer season excursions are run to various resorts. Now, however, it is being rigidly enforced, in some sections, against Seventh-day Adventists.

-----

It is an interesting fact now making itself stated, that ecclesiastical influence has developed the civil law for the enforcement of the religious observance of Sunday. The churches of which the Church is itself in provided with authority, itself with the power to punish its violators. Have a Christian State and an unchristian Christ? or have they both become alike worldly?
