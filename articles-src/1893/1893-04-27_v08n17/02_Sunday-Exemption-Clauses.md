Many Sunday laws have in them an exemption for those who "conscientiously observe" another day; and those who would not and actually refrain from secular labor on the whole of another day during the same week as holy time "or" observe the Sabbath on any other day "or" observe the day other than Sunday, or "observe the Sabbath on another day than Sunday, or observe a heretical position" or something like that. (See Sunday laws of Michigan, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Tennessee, Kentucky, etc.) But such an exemption is wrong for the following reasons:—

1. Because the law which gives occasion for this exemption was originally made as exemption to prevent its coming in conflict with the inalienable rights and constitutional convictions of men, must be wrong.

2. They are wrong because they are merely toleration and not liberty. Because the Government has a right to say whether the individual has observed a day, he has no right to say when or whether to the extent that it relates to religion at all, he has a right to deny his right. His rights are the higher natural, constitutional and religious liberty, not of the founders or the wisdom of the nation.

Of Madison, history says:—

Religious liberty was a matter strongly agitated in his feelings. When it was proposed that the word "toleration" should be used, he opposed it and contended for absolute freedom of religion according to the dictates of conscience, in a sense and to an extent which in its full bearings, Madison's predecessor has not yet acknowledged. Toleration is an important step from State religion to the free exercise of religion. In its full bearings and meanings this acknowledgment by the State of the right of the individual to a religious conviction is a living form of faith and worship, and a practical disavowal of the right of a State to be the judge of religious truth. Thus far we may consider toleration; but we claim it as an inalienable right.—*Saved from oblivion*, Vol. 1, p. 70.

And Hon. Richard M. Johnson, in his famous Sunday Mail Report adopted by the United States Senate in 1829, says:—

Our Constitution recognizes in every person the right to choose his own religion, and to enjoy it freely, without molestation. . . . . .

Whatever may be the religious sentiments of citizens, and however variant, they are alike entitled to protection from the Government, so long as they do not violate the rights of others. . . . .

We look in vain to the Constitution for any of them. . . .

Among all the religious persecutions with which almost every page of modern history is stained, no victim ever suffered but for the violation of what Government denominated . . . . the law of God.—*American State Papers*, Haupt.

They are wrong, because to consent to them is in itself to admit that the Government has a right to compel by law the observance of a day. At most on can lay claim to rest given times, so long as in their use of it they do not interfere with the rights and liberties of others. They industry and not idleness in the interest of both the Sabbatharian and non-Sabbatharian.

4. Andrew Young, in His "Government Cont Book," — p. 189, speaking of exemption clauses, says:—

Every person has the right to go wherever he chooses, every day of the week, to engage in whatever lawful occupation he chooses for any short period or without violence, so as by no means to interfere with the equal rights of others by his work on that day.

5. They are wrong, because the Sunday law itself as law based on the assumption that it is based upon the assumption of religious duty only; upon religious conditions; and if only the non-conformists can claim an exemption, one must "conscientiously" observe another day. This is to force the position that the particular day is "the Sabbath," and "actually religious" and the position that Sunday is to be a day "of religious observance."

6. They are wrong. "To have the benefits of this exemption from these laws" requires that those who wish to take advantage of it "must conscientiously observe the day they keep, or God will reject them." The law to say what constitutes conscientious observance of a day is as objectionable as to compel its observance. To establish on one requirement is as much an establishment as the other, and all men know, that the day is legitimate and conscientious in the observance of its law regarding Sabbath observances. That legislature and civil authority has no power in this direction at all, and a certain religious element have let in these objections. The Sunday-law people who by their exemption clauses apparently provide for them to plead as argument that they keep and believe, that religious worship and not idleness of the interest and this exemption was not forbidden by the law, but only restrained. They exemption clauses were forbidden by law to seek of the true principles of this matter. That constitutes principles of law. It is also extremely clear that it involves the right of the Government to say what is acceptable worship in its essential form, that in pure form, and transferred, that no amount would invalidate the original appropriation of the principle which constitute the provision which were null and void and self-destructive.

The truth is that Congress sets before people the view of the matter in a correct form when in this very Report its committee unanimously says:—

It is not the legitimate province of the Legislature to determine what religion is true, or what false. Our Government is a civil, and not a religious institution. . . . . . .

If a solemn act. . . . .

7. They are wrong, because those who for or against these exemption clauses stand against the law from which they have asked
to be exempted; but all men everywhere have a right to protest and should protest against religious legislation on the part of civil government now and forevermore. . . .

Exemption clauses in Sunday laws assume that the majority have right and duty to in perpetuate for the minority which a false. Inalienable rights come from the Creator, and are possessed by all equally; and with the rights belongs the liberty to exercise and enjoy them, not merely to "tolerate" the exercise of them. The assumption is clearly imbued in the following words of Rev. P. S. Henson, Cor. Secretary of the American Sabbath Union for Michigan, in the *Michigan Sabbath Watchman*, Aug., 1892:—

There is not a Seventh-day Adventist in the State of Michigan that cannot pursue his own build his home, or thrash his wheat, or shop his timber to market without the slightest interference from civil authorities. But if he does it Sunday, he is guilty of a misdemeanor, because in making too much noise he disturbs those day Adventists have to no excuse work in their gardens or plow the fields; it is the still farm work that is permissible. Neither could a Sabbatharian, is a right given them by this state and are not constitutional rights.

That Seventh-day Adventists dare do and have done just what Mr. Warner says they dare not do, reference needs to be made to Sunday law practice in the State of Tennessee where there is no exemption clause to the State Sunday law; and yet the very claims of the no exemption clause were there repeated.

They are wrong in nothing but are exemption of superiority and of being the dispensers of right and justice, of tolerance on the part of Sunday-keepers, carrying with it the fact that they have right to fully curtail or deny those rights and privileges to such members of the body. From Mr. Crafts claims that—

Industry in legitimate and executive off its work; and not to be required of the Sabbath in our history rather than our every day. As for the exemption of those who keep another.

Instead of granting exemption clauses Mr. Crafts claims further—

Industry has here is done by the small percentage, being only one in every two hundred, will not possibly of less than one in a few hundred or one in a thousand. As most of these few observer character work as the law allows them to do for the purpose of their employment, in their definition of public income.—*The Sabbath for Man.*

The Bill of Rights of the Tennessee State Constitution well declares—

That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no human authority can, in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship.

Every man has a right to demand protection in enjoyment of this right. If the exemption clauses are not sufficient, the governor is bound to call on every citizen for its enforcement.

This idea of Sunday-law makers being God and a superior, and dispensers of rights to, those who observe another day than Sunday, is further shown in the words of Mr. Crafts, in his "Sabbath for Man," as follows:—

Instead of recognizing the passively absence, to meet them for the matter of Sabbath laws making such adjustments as may be necessary in this energy in extinguishing such laws, seeking to include the right granted him to enjoy his own find repeal, of exigent, workingman the policy of such a State. Their petitions are still on file; not that Congress dare record its just views as to its endorsement of what they are. They furthermore considered the Lord's Day, both one that has realized all the ultimate results of their action. This is what the observers of the rest day are asked to pay for exemption clauses. They are asked to cease their exercise of the rights of speech and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. A law could just as well cover either the Sunday Sabbath or Sunday rest as it can be for any authority to close the Sabbath question at all. The Bill of Rights of the Constitution of West Virginia, says:—

All men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion.

Here is the ground upon which the apostles stood (Acts 4:5-19; 5:27-29) at a time when the Reformers of the sixteenth century stood, and here is where we should stand: "We ought to obey God rather than man,"—and the Sabbath of the Lord now stand.—*W. Coland*, in *Home Missionary*.
