W. DYER, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Landsdale, was fined five dollars for refusing to appear as a witness in court, his refusal to pay the fine had was not satisfied. He said he hated to offend Judge Rainsberger, but he would linger in jail for an indefinite period before he would fulfilled the judge if the decision was wrong to pay money on his forfeiture of Saturday.

We commend Mr. Dyer for daring to suffer persecution for conscience' sake, even though it was against the court. The Scriptures demand that Christians love their enemies and love such punishment upon themselves of justice, hence him to this act?

Mr. Dyer: Will the law in any exhibit of justice, bore him out to this act?

Man's dealings with, and obligations to, his fellow-men may be thus tampered or interfered with, but in its essence the character of a man's duty to his Maker, so that it is another interference, long delayed, in which the duty of every citizen is to up by to this right law, his such things are a hobby, and him, his such things that are the citizen's of right and unjust, to say the least.—*Civil, Norfolk.*
