This dispatch from Pittsburg, of April 15, shows how these Sunday cases must all go, and how the judicial precedents will be invariably sustained, irrespective of the real principle involved:—

> Judge White to-day handed down an opinion in the three appeals from the decision of Alderman Rohe in the cases against Charles V. Houston, business manager of the Pittsburg Press, who was recently fined seventy-five dollars and costs by the alderman for publishing and selling papers on Sunday, in violation of the Sunday laws of 1794.
>
> At the conclusion of his opinion Judge White says:—
>
> I am of the opinion that the defendant comes within the statute prohibiting worldly employment on the Lord's day and he is adjudged guilty.

The case will be appealed to the Supreme Court.

When the State courts and the Supreme Court have all adjudicated upon this question, then no legislature will be found ready to repeal laws which all the courts have sustained. Thus the error becomes, itself, its own authority and support.
