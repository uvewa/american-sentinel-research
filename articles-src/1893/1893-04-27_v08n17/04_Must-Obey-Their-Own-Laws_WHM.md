The course which the American Sabbath Union has taken, in Pittsburg and Pennsylvania, is likely to bring about an impartial enforcement of the Sunday law of 1794 such as scarcely entered into the plans of the Sabbath Unionists. They had intended to be lords of Sunday themselves, but a new factor has arisen which is likely to turn the tables upon them.

Pittsburg despatches say:—

> The new Law and Order League, which aims to outdo the Law and Order Society in enforcing the ancient Sunday law in this city, began work today. Detectives in its employ have gathered a mass of evidence, which has been laid before the local magistrates.
>
> The names of the superintendent, officials and stockholders in the Citizens' Traction Company were secured, besides the toll takers of the numerous bridges, all of whom will be prosecuted for violating the Sunday law. Probably the biggest game secured were the officials of the Carnegie Company. Alderman McNetney, working as a detective, paid a visit to the Homestead mills, where he found more than 1,000 men working, as they said, not from necessity, but solely to increase their employers' profits. He was assured that most of the works could be shut down over Sunday without loss except the loss of the profits of that day.
>
> The detectives of the new society are paying particular attention to preachers and church goers who employ coachmen to drive them to church, which is said to be as much a violation of the Sunday law as the sale of Sunday newspapers. It is not yet determined when the arrests are to be made.
>
> The League's lawyer advises that the matter be held in abeyance until the legislature adjourns, in the hope that the amendment to the blue law may be made. The legislature shows no sign of modifying the law.

This is about as ridiculous a result as the effect of the Sunday closing of the Fair in Chicago upon the workingmen for whose benefit and in whose behalf it was to be closed. It is poetic justice that the advocates of the strict enforcement of religious laws should in both places be hoist with their own petard. In the one place their own vaunted Blue Laws are to be enforced against themselves. In the other the very class in whose interest the legislation was ostensibly had take another rest day of their own choice, that they may work on Sunday when the Fair is closed, and be free from labor and able to attend on a day that the Fair is open. Thus the dramatic unities are satisfied, and the truth, on both the civil and religious sides of this question, is preached by deeds which speak louder than words, and will be more enduring than the printed page. When the Pittsburg enforcement of Sunday laws upon themselves has shown them how unreasonable, improper, unjust and unchristian such laws are, and when the Sunday-closing episode at Chicago has taught hundreds of thousands that Sunday is not the Sabbath, and that their whole theory is doubly wrong, will they themselves then stop and think? Or have they already gone beyond that?
