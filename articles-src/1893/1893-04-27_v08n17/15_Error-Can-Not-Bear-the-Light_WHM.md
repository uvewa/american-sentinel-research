The Union Signal has this paragraph:

> A contemporary religious paper after making some excellent remarks upon the dishonorable conduct of those who are trying to make it appear that Congress has no right to close the Fair on Sunday, expresses the following strange sentiment: "The antecedent debate on the question has done a wide harm which ten fairs can not heal. Hundreds of thousands have been induced to adopt and approve a line of argument that strikes at the trials both of a Sunday for rest and a Sabbath for worship." If this be true, then agitation on all subjects, except where things are so bad they cannot be made worse, is an evil; for discussions of this kind always confirm some in their wrong ideas and bring to the same view others who were before undecided. To accept this statement would be to admit that it is truth, not error which suffers by the light. We do not doubt that some are more obstinately wrong than ever and others who before were undecided have now gone hopelessly on to the wrong side of the question: but we also believe that some who were before undecided have now decided for the right and we must believe that it is the majority who have so decided, but, whatever may be the relative numbers, it is certain that people might about as well be wrong as to have no opinion on a subject. Those who are on the fence are of no more benefit to a cause and of not much less injury than those who are outspoken against it. What ever may be the immediate effects of the discussion on the Sabbath question, we have not the least doubt that the effect in the long future must be wholesome.

That contemporary has expressed what is, from its standpoint, a truth. The agitation of this question has opened the minds of hundreds of thousands to the truth that religious laws as established and enforced by the civil authorities, are untenable from every point in which they can be viewed. The discussion of this question is wholesome, but it is only wholesome because of the antagonism which it generates toward man-made and man-enforced religion,—because of the fact that it is turning the minds and hearts of many to God, and establishing in them a realizing sense that their dependence is in all things upon God alone, and, that their allegiance in all things spiritual and religious is to him only.

It is not truth but error which suffers by the light, and error is suffering in the light of this discussion, whatever its temporal success may seem to be.
