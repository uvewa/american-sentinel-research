## The Sunday Laws of England.

ENGLAND is well provided with Sunday laws, having no less than twenty-four, all of which are in force at the present time. Of these, eleven refer to manufactory and trading, eleven to the sale of liquor, five to amusements, five to traveling, two to the employment of young persons and women and one to elections. The first law was enacted 1354, and the last in 1887, and they are still at it. In fact Sunday laws are on the steady increase, sixteen having been made during the reign of Victoria. Surely if law can bolster up the Sunday institution this array of Parliamentary statutes should do it. But their very number only shows their weakness, for were there any power or virtue in a Sunday law, one would be enough. But when once men attempt to make others righteous by law they have before them an endless task, for they are attempting the impossible, and can only result in a barren form of legalism, such as the endless ramifications placed upon the Jews by the Scribes and Pharisees.

The first Sunday law was passed in 1354 during the reign of Edward III., and prohibits the showing of wool on the magic day. The next was in 1448, and forbids all manner of fairs and markets "on the principal feasts, and Sundays and Good Fridays." Ten other Sunday statutes also include the principal feasts of the Church, and six of these were enacted in the present reign. In this they are consistent. For Sunday is merely a church festival—a creation of the Roman Catholic Church—and stands on the same basis as other days ordained by the same church. If it is right to enforce Sunday it is also right to enforce Christmas day, Good Friday and all the rest.

But the Sunday law that is most known and respected is 29 Chas. II., c. 7., which passed 1679. It is entitled "An act for the better observation of the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday." Section 1. enacts that "all the laws in force concerning the observation of the Lord's day, and repairing to the Church thereon, shall be carefully put in execution." This itself shows the worthlessness of these laws. As soon as one is made, another has to be made to enact that the first one shall be enforced. This in itself is a confession that there was no power in the first one; and there is no more in the second, and as nothing added to nothing makes nothing, these lawmakers are just where they started, and so set to work and make another law to help out those already in existence, and so the game has gone merrily on until we now have twenty-four and the end is not yet.

This law of Charles II. not only forbids all "worldly labor," but also compels "repairing to the Church" and "enacts" that "all persons shall, on every Lord's day, apply themselves to the observation of the same, by exercising themselves thereon in the duties of piety and true religion, publicly and privately." This is the pet law of a certain class of clergy and what they are most anxious to have enforced. To do so would mean the revival of the Inquisition; for whereas by dragging a man to church and holding him in a pew they might satisfy themselves as to his public exercise of religious duties; the only possible way for them to find out if he has done so privately is to put him on the rack and wring from him a confession of his thoughts. This beautiful relic of Puritanism also practically decrees that any man may rob or knock Sunday travelers on the head and no action may be brought for the said robbery. So it would seem that Sunday traveling is unpardonable, but Sunday robbery or murder is all right.

Another masterpiece of Satan is 21 Geo. III., c. 49, passed 1780, and called, "An act for preventing certain abuses and profanations on the Lord's day, called Sunday." Section 1. has this, "Whereas certain houses . . . have of late frequently been opened . . . under pretext of inquiring into religious doctrines and explaining texts of holy Scripture, debates have frequently been held on the evening of the Lord's day concerning divers texts of holy Scripture by persons unlearned and incompetent to explain the same, to the corruption of good morals, and to the great encouragement of irreligion and profaneness. It was enacted that the keeper of such a room be fined £200 for every day such a room or house was open. The chairman was to also forfeit £100 to any one who should sue for it, and the door keeper to pay £50; which is $1,750 in all.

And yet there are some people in America who are trying to prove that Sunday laws are not religious in character.
