A CORRESPONDENT writes us that a Methodist preacher in his neighborhood recently preached a sermon in which he admitted that Sunday is the Lord's day. But the preacher's saying so does not make it so. The Sabbath is the Lord's day. Ex. 20:10, we read that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." "The Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath." It is the Lord's day. Isa. 58:13. "They also do well from them, thou stay thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day." Again the Sabbath is the Lord's day. Then in Mark 1:28, we have the declaration of our Lord that he is Lord of the Sabbath day; and again the Sabbath is the Lord's day. What difference does it make what any number of preachers say, when we can read for ourselves what the Lord says?
