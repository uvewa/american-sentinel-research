"The violation of Sunday by opening the gates of the Fair is incapacity," says the *Cincinnati Commercial Gazette*. Yes, and so is the violation of Sunday by anything else that it is proper to do on any day. It is refreshing to know that through the agitation of the Sunday-closing question the fact is becoming pretty generally recognized that Sunday-closing rest is also purely imaginary.
