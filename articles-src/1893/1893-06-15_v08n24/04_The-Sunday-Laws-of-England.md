ENGLAND is well provided with Sunday laws, having no less than twenty-two, nearly all of which are in force at the present time. They cover everything from keeping "factory and trading, eleven to the sale of intoxicating liquors, and from bread baking, two to the employment of young persons and women on Sunday."

The first law was enacted 1354, and the last in 1891; they are still in force, and in fact Sunday laws are on the steady increase, reform having been made during the reign of Victoria. Surely if law can enforce the reign of Victoria. Surely if law can enforce the "Sunday" institution and keep every act of "Parliamentary statutes properly." Parliamentary statutes should do it. But their number only shows and reveals their weakness, for were there any power or virtue in a Sunday law, one would be sufficient. If the people of England cannot make other rightness by law they have twenty-two more than is required. But attempting the impossible, and can only the more work the more injury and wrong, as the endless confusions placed upon the law by the authorities and Pharisees.

The first Sunday law was passed in 1354 during the reign of Edward II, and prohibits the showing of wool on the Sabbath day. "That none be to let, and forbid all manner of fairs and markets to be held in and upon churchyards on Sundays and Good Fridays." Yet other Sunday statutes also include the principal fairs and markets, which, however, are still permitted with little change. They still existed in the present reign. In this they have an evidence that the closing of the church festival—a creation of the Roman Catholic Church—is now made upon the same basis on other days contained by the same statute. If it is right to enforce the Christian Sabbath, that Sunday cannot be Sunday is it also right to enforce Christian days, Good Friday and all the rest.

But the Sunday law that is most known and talked about, and that which seems to be the better observation of the Lord's day act passed 1678. It is entitled "An act for the better observation of the Lord's day commonly called Sunday." Section 1 provides "that all the law in force concerning the observation of the Lord's day and repairing to the Church thereon, shall be carefully put in execution." This itself shows the worthlessness of these legislative enactments upon Sunday, for if it has to be made to enact that the first one shall be enforced. This in itself is a confession that there was no power in the first one, and there is no more in the second, and so nothing added to nothing makes nothing, those something was just where they started, and so set to work and make another yet to help out the ones already passed and now there are twenty-two; and nearly every one is equally on, until we now have twenty-two Sunday laws in England.

This law of Charles II not only furnishes still a "workful" but also "making" all the tradesman, artificer, workman, laborer, or other person whatsoever, shall do or exercise any worldly labor, business or work of their ordinary callings upon the Lord's day, or any part thereof (works of necessity and charity only excepted)." And any persons "repairing to the Church" and "exercising" that "persons shall, on every Lord's day, apply themselves to the observation of the same, by exercising themselves therein in the duties of piety and true religion, publicly and privately." This is the pet law of a certain class of people and that what gave so much motion to

of rest to some other day and work on Sunday in order that their rights with the Fair and lose to them of their regular week day. Rev. Dr. Holtzer, Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago, recently gave an address

If the Union is to contest but deny it. The Canadian Conference has met in the town New York last addressed a committee

There is an attempt on the part of members of the churches to organize a boycott of such workmen and firms as do not observe the sabbath. This may and must be obliged to enter that the Fair shall be closed, and secure God and the evil of No Nation. The Nation then take the legislation that all the property of Christian gentlemen and farmers shall be closed Sunday, and all must be obliged to close their Fairs.

Can one who reads these statements can fail to recognize the same spirit, the same unceasing spirit behind this movement, and that persecution to its ultimate end. It is the same spirit that was involved in that first line of all the spirit that has made its way through the centuries to the present hour. Can any of the National Reformers themselves honestly deny it?

And as the National Reform movement of this nineteenth century is a repetition of the fourth century, so the closing acts in the Fair matter are a repetition.

So this was heard the plea for the law to close the World's Fair gates on Sunday, from Rev. Dr. Herrick Johnson: "Is a movement which excited that this law will be enforced the extermination of some who ever by action or word tried ... the same spirit pervades them all. The Lord is to be with His Church in all her struggles."
