ADVENTISTS and Sunday Opening.—With characteristic recklessness the *Christian Statesman* asserts that the temporary order of a State court requiring the World's Fair to be kept open on Sunday was granted by a biased judge in a suit by a Seventh-day Adventist. The fact is that the suit was brought by the Corporators, Wm. Mason, of Chicago, at the instance of Mr. Clingman, a prominent stockholder, and not an Adventist. Seventh-day Adventists were interested in the case only so far as it touched the question of the right of Congress to do indirectly what the whole Constitution forbids it to do, namely, to pass any law interfering with the free exercise of religion. The information from the *Pacific Press*, consistently maintained from the first, has been that the managers of the Fair had a right to open it on Sunday or not to open it, just as seemed to them best, all things considered; and that they should be allowed to be alike free from congressional bribes, to close—and from institutional boycotts, and legal processes, just as from any other private or semi-private enterprises should be free.

The so-called Protestant churches of the land, largely under the leadership of the *Christian Statesman*, were not satisfied to leaving the managers of the Fair free to take their own course in the matter of Sunday opening and failing to move them by its measures, they, by threats of political boycott, induced Congress to purchase Sunday closing. Adventists were interested in the Chicago injunction suit only so far as Judge Stein's decision matters to the whole people the rights wrested from them when Congress, at the behest of overreaching sectarian jealousy, took money belonging to the whole people and appropriated it to the support of a religious institution recognized by only a portion of the people.

Even had this money been appropriated in the interest of a vast majority of the people, which it was not, the action would still be without warrant, either of sound principle or American law. The preservation of inalienable rights demands that while the Constitution of the United States forbids Congress to make any law in any way interfering with the free exercise. From any standpoint except of the sectarian bigot, more concerned for his dogmas than for the rights of his fellows, the action of Congress in conditioning the appropriation on the observance of a religious institution was utterly indefensible.

On this subject the *Advent Review and Sabbath Herald*, of June 6, 1893, the organ of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, published at the headquarters of the denomination, Battle Creek, Mich., says in its issue of June 6:—

We need have a friend upon on the street to this whole day, with the exclamation, "Well, you have the answer to your prayers and the Fair is to be closed on Sunday." No, we replied, we have got no answer to any prayer upon any subject concerning the Fair. We never prayed that the Fair be opened on Sunday; that is not a matter of religion. All Christians have to know that Christians should keep in hands out of and that which has in it no moral issue. We believe that it is not entirely to show how the position of the Seventh-day Adventist is misrepresented. Neither by our members, or example would we be related to by keeping the Fair open on Sunday. But of those within the churches who claim that Sunday is the Lord's rest day, but who patronize the Fair by going and visiting on that day, or on any other property, could not show the better what the rest day is, by their example. What we object to is, Congress, contrary to the Constitution, legislating upon religious questions. And no word would have been heard from Adventists on this subject had it not been that the so-called reform movement, and Sabbath unionists, began to berate Congress to say by its authority and enter the final path of religious legislation, for whatever may be, or is not be put in the mouth of any person.

In perfect keeping with this expression from the *Review and Herald*, is the following from the *Signs of the Times*, another Adventist paper published in Oakland, Cal., by direct authority of the General Conference of the denomination:—

As to results in the World's Fair management by Sunday opening. It is a matter of policy all the time. The Columbian Exposition is not a religious affair. *Principle was sacrificed in the first place in accepting the bribe of Congress to close on Sunday, and now the Fair is opened contrary to agreement with the United States Congress, because more money is needed.* That Congress should vote money for such a purpose in the first place was wrong,

but the matter of the Sabbath the Government had no right to meddle with; that ought to have been left to the local Directory.

This is not a new thought with the Adventists. Their position has remained always what it has been: this position, substantially, has been the *Sentinel's* and the *Signs of the Times*. We have also repeatedly said the same thing. If, as the *Christian Statesman* intimates, any Adventist had assumed any other attitude than this, he has done it as an individual for himself, and has a perfect right to every right of redress, and has a right to do it, not as a representative of the denomination.
