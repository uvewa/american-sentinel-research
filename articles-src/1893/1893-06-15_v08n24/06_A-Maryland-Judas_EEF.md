*Millington, Md., May 31, 1893.*

AMERICAN SENTINEL: May 8, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church at Millington, was observed to be working on Sunday. Mr. Price is a most peaceable, law-abiding citizen of this vicinity. His shop is on the farm near the barn, which is half a mile from the highway, and one fourth of a mile from any house.

On this day the Methodist minister was coming past on the main road, and complained to several persons that Mr. Price was working on Sunday. He then invited the minister to the home of Mr. Price as a friend, and then according to his own statement went before the magistrate.

At the magistrate's office he said he did not desire to prosecute but simply to act as the informer. "The church has done all that it could," he said, and then said that it was a case of religious persecution, but simply to enforce the law. If there has any need the informer to do only this work of persecution. Sunday observance to the law should be enforced by the very ones who have always been complaining. Price was an honest man all day Sunday, and at the same time a very good citizen, and he is one of the most violent opposites of the law enforcement and yet privately it is instructed. But when a man is asked, ought to be a good citizen and a Christian, in the exercise of his God-given right,

after observing the day before according to the plain letter of God's Word, be it forced, fined and imprisoned like the worst criminal, and that by so-called Christians.

The following from the *Centerville Record* to the point:—

Elder Frank we heard to say that Mr. Price, of Millington, who has accepted the Adventist faith, was arrested for Sunday work by Sabbath-keeping people, and he also stated that Mr. Price's friend and butler at supper and went back to the magistrate's office and lodged a complaint. He then said: The informers who call themselves Christians are displaying a spirit which does not belong to Christianity, and that the Word does not teach that one Christian should use the civil power to enforce observance of any day of the week.

Sunday laws of any kind are ungodly relics of fanaticism, and as long as they remain in our statute books, they will always be used by religious bigots as weapons against those who conscientiously religiously differ with them. A dark page in the history of the present century will soon burst it all in fury on those who observe God's rest day—the seventh day. And these laws will be more freely used every day. The church that uses the civil power to enforce its doctrine or enforces or exercises is destructive of godliness and is open rebellion against the government of God.

E. E. FRANKE.
