## A Maryland Judas.

Millington, Md., May 31, 1893.

AMERICAN SENTINEL: Mr. Edgar Price, elder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in this place, was arrested yesterday for working on Sunday. Mr. Price is acknowledged by all to be one of the best, most peaceable, and law-abiding citizens of Millington. Mr. Price was working in his barn, which is half a mile from the home of the informant and more than a fourth of a mile from any house.

The informer is a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church and had heretofore been the recipient of many favors from the man he betrayed. Judas—like he came to the home of Mr. Price as a friend, sat at his table, partook of his hospitality, and then according to his own statement had him arrested to satisfy his church. At the magistrate's office he said he did not want to have Mr. Price arrested but, said the informer, "The church has done it." It was clear to all present at the trial that it was a case of religious persecution, and that the Methodist Episcopal Church here has simply used the informer to do its dirty work of persecution. Sunday work is a common thing in this town, and that by the very ones who have undertaken to persecute Mr. Price. Fishing is carried on all day Sundays, and at the present time goods can be bought in the store of one of the most violent opposers of Mr. Price and his faith; all this goes unnoticed. But when a man acknowledged to be a good citizen and a Christian, in the exercise of his God-given right, goes quietly about his work on Sunday after observing the day before according to the plain letter of God's Word, he is arrested, fined and imprisoned like the worst criminal, and that by so-called Christians.

The following from the Centreville Record is to the point:—

> News reached here to-day that Mr. Edgar Price, of Millington, who has accepted the Adventists' faith, was arrested on Monday for attending to his duties on Sunday. The informer, like Judes, ate Mr. Price's bread and butter at supper and went away and betrayed him. The informer is a member of the Methodist Church. We find that some of the professed Christians are displaying a spirit, but not the spirit that you find in the Word of God. His Word does not teach that one Christian should have another persecuted because he does not believe like himself.

Sunday laws of any kind are ungodly relics of barbarism, and as long as they remain in force, will be used by religious bigots to enforce their opinions on those who religiously differ with them. A dark cloud is hanging over this fair land which will soon burst in all its fury on those who obey God's word in the observance of the seventh day. The church that uses the civil power to enforce its doctrine or observances is destitute of godliness and in open rebellion against the government of God.

E. E. FRANKE.
