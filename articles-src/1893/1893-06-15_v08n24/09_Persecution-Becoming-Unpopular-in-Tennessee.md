## Persecution Becoming Unpopular in Tennessee.

[The following private letter which we are permitted to publish, written to a friend by an Adventist minister in Tennessee, will be of interest to our readers.]

Nashville, Tenn., June 6, 1893.

My Dear Brother: I was at Paris several days before the trials of our brethren came off, and while listening to discussions of principles involved by different parties and classes of men, had an opportunity to learn considerable concerning public sentiment.

There has been a radical change during the past year concerning this kind of work. Nobody, or but few, seem to desire the continuance of the persecution which so many have heretofore considered a necessity. Hardly an expression was to be heard, either from the witnesses summoned by the prosecution, by gentlemen about the court-house, or on the trains, in favor of depriving Adventists of a portion of their God-given time for labor, because somebody else desired to worship on that day.

This change in public sentiment is doubtless due, at least in part, to the fact that the subject of religious liberty is being more studied and better understood than formerly.

Good men have often been led to persecute those who differed from them in religious belief. When such men saw and accepted the true principles of religious liberty, they themselves became the willing subjects of persecution at the hands of those who chose to remain in darkness. The Apostle Paul is a noted case of this class; and to many who may be led to engage in the persecutions of the last days, he may say, "And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."

There were but two cases of indictments, Brethren Thomas Dortch, who was held over from last term of court, and Frank Stem. Not much more than half an hour was occupied in both these cases; and for lack of evidence that either had maintained a "public nuisance" the judge, with the consent of the jury, discharged each.

It seemed as if the presence of the Spirit of God was especially manifest in that court room during the trial of these brethren. An unseen power pervaded the atmosphere and controlled minds.

The Lord has permitted some of the persecutions of the past few years to go further than this; and in this way he has showed to such men as the governors, senators, representatives, judges, attorneys and others, of the "great State of Tennessee," the true nature of the power by which this work is being carried forward.

Thanks be to God for the change which this knowledge has produced! And the good people of this State may well join in thanking him for the powerful influence for good which has been exerted by the AMERICAN SENTINEL, through which some of this has been accomplished.

Your brother in Christ,

C. L. Boyd.
