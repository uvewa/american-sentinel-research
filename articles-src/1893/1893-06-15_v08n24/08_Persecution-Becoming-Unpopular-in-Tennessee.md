[The following private letter which we are permitted to publish from an Adventist assistant resident in Tennessee, will be of interest to all.]

*Nashville, Tenn., June 5, 1893.*

MY DEAR BROTHER: I was at Paris several days before the trials of our brethren came off, and while listening to discussions of principles involved, by different patrons and men of note, had an opportunity to learn considerable concerning the situation.

There has been a marked change during the past year concerning this kind of persecution. Public sentiment is growing since the continuance of the persecution is so well known in the community, and it is becoming a necessity. Hardly an expression was to be heard, either from the witnesses summoned by the prosecution, by gentlemen about the court-room, or on the trains, in favor of depriving Adventist of a portion of their God-given time for labor, because somebody was so dainty of worship on that day.

This change in public sentiment doubtless has, at least in part, to the fact that the subject of religious liberty is before the country.

News papers have often been led to ridicule those who differed from themselves in religious belief. When men have accepted them, the true principles of religious liberty, they themselves became the advocates of them, no matter what the condition of those who choose to remain in the practice of that bigotry, and there are those of this class; and to many who may formerly have been led to persecute those the last days, he may say, "And such were some of you." 1 Cor. 6:11; and such were not to be ashamed, but be ye also in the name of the Lord God and in the presence of our God.

There were but two cases of individuals, Brethren Thomas Dortch, who was convicted, was over from the case of both Frank Stein. Not much more has been done than to accept his conviction and now for lack of redress of which either and no other maintained in a "public" consideration, "and a change of circumstance," charged each.

The presence of the twenty-three at the Spirit of God was especially manifest in that its influence was felt throughout the brethren. As one unseen person prayed for the brethren, and brought others to the same.

The Lord has permitted the persecution for some purpose. It is in the beginning of the latter days; and this is the way in these last days he may yet say "such were some of them;" and in this way by the same spirit that works upon these men now, the work is be suited carried out for God.

Thanks be to God for the change while the dark days of this persecution; if the good people of this State may well all praise God that this change has been wrought, and we believe it is of the good people of this State for the good for which it was been enacted. I believe some of this has been accomplished.

The Lord permitted us to suffer persecution, and the Spirit of God was especially manifested in His kindness. As one unseen prayed for the brethren, it brought others to the same.

Thanks be to God for the change while these dark days of persecution. If the good people of this State may well all praise God, it is of the people for God. The work is being carried out for good.
