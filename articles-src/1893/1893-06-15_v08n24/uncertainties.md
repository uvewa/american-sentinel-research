# Uncertainties — v08n24 (1893-06-15)

## 1. Editor Name on Masthead

- **Location:** Page 1, masthead
- **OCR reads:** "ALOREZO T. JONES"
- **Transcribed as:** "ALONZO T. JONES"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — "ALOREZO" is a clear OCR misread of "ALONZO"; corrected without uncertainty
- **Reason:** The editor is consistently identified as Alonzo T. Jones throughout the project

## 2. Associate Editor "WILLIAM H. BURKE"

- **Location:** Page 1, masthead
- **OCR reads:** "WILLIAM H. BURKE"
- **Issue:** This name does not appear in the known editors list. The known associate editor for 1893 is William H. McKee (WHM). "BURKE" may be an OCR error for another name, or this may reflect an actual staff change.
- **Transcribed as:** "WILLIAM H. BURKE" (as OCR reads, preserved literally in masthead)
- **Confidence:** LOW — Cannot verify without the original PDF scan
- **Note:** Article 03 (Chicago Correspondence) is attributed to W. H. M. (McKee), who signs from Chicago on June 6. If the masthead lists Burke, it may reflect a different person or an OCR error for "Burke" vs. another name. Recommend verification against original scan.

## 3. Author Initial "B." in Articles 01 and 08

- **Location:** End of article 01 ("Adventists and Sunday Opening") and article 08 ("The Christian's Duty Is Plain")
- **OCR reads:** "B."
- **Attribution:** "B." is a known short form for C. P. Bollman (CPB), consistent with other issues
- **Confidence:** HIGH — Pattern matches known Bollman attribution style

## 4. Attribution of Article 06 ("Was it a New Thing?")

- **Location:** End of article 06
- **OCR reads:** "The first step involved the last.—W. A. Colcord, in Home Missionary."
- **Decision:** Treated as a reprint from *Home Missionary* by W. A. Colcord. Attribution set to "reprint" with `original_publication: "Home Missionary"`. Colcord is a known contributor (WAC).
- **Confidence:** HIGH

## 5. Author "E. E. FRANKE" in Article 07 ("A Maryland Judas")

- **Location:** End of article 07
- **OCR reads:** "E. E. FRANKE"
- **Issue:** Initials "EEF" not in the known authors list
- **Action:** Used as-is with `author_short: "EEF"`. Note for future tracking.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — May be E. E. Franke of Millington, Md., a correspondent rather than a staff writer

## 6. Footnote Marker in Article 08

- **Location:** Article 08, paragraph quoting "Arius, the Libyan"
- **OCR reads:** "Arius, the Libyan,"*
- **Issue:** An asterisk footnote marker appears after the title; the corresponding footnote text was not captured in the OCR (likely at page bottom)
- **Action:** Preserved the asterisk as it appears in the text; footnote content unavailable from OCR
- **Confidence:** N/A — footnote text not recoverable from this OCR source

## 7. Pages 7 (Advertisements)

- **Location:** Page 7
- **Content:** Battle Creek Bakery Co. and Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods advertisements
- **Action:** Skipped entirely — these are commercial advertisements, not editorial content
- **Note:** Some OCR text in the advertisements is garbled (e.g., "PLA CREEK BAKERY CO.", testimonial names clearly corrupted). This is expected for advertisement columns and does not affect article transcription.
