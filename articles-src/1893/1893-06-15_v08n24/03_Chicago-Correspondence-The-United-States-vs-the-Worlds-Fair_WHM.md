### The United States vs. the World's Fair.

The second open Sunday of the World's Fair has passed. The attendance on both days has been large, although the people did not come in such great numbers as was expected. The quietness and good order of the crowds, which were double or treble the ordinary week-day attendance, was very marked. No drunkenness or disorder of any kind occurred on either Sunday, and it was evident that all who came were there with the earnest purpose to see and to learn and gain the most profit possible from the exhibition.

The second open Sunday was upheld by a peculiar series of legal events. First, the World's Fair Directory determined, two weeks previous, that in view of the failure of the Government to keep its contract in the matter of the souvenir coins, it had freed the Fair management from its obligation to close Sundays, and passed resolutions abrogating the Sunday-closing regulation; second, this resolution to open on Sundays, the World's Fair Commissioners failed to modify,—it therefore stood, authoritative, according to the action of the Board of Directors; third, in the case brought by Ex-Congressman Mason in behalf of a stock-holder of the World's Fair, to restrain the World's Fair Directors from closing the park, in which the Fair is situated, to the people on Sunday, a temporary injunction was granted and the final hearing set for ten days; fourth, in the meantime the United States brought its action in the United States Court to enjoin the World's Fair authorities from opening the Fair on Sunday, and this case received a three days' hearing, closing on Friday, June 2,—the judges reserving their decision until Thursday, June 8. Thus quite a remarkable combination of circumstances supported the directory in holding the Fair open on Sunday, June 4.

The bill filed by District Attorney Milchrist in behalf of the Government for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, is a lengthy document and cites the act of Congress providing "for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus by holding an international exhibition of arts, industries, manufactures, and the products of the soil, the mine, and sea, in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois;" and also the Sunday-closing proviso in the Civil Sundry bill, and the action of the directory and commissioners thereon. The bill pleads farther, that the directors and commissioners are still bound by this Sunday-closing action and charges a conspiracy wherein the World's Columbian Exposition corporation with others is conspiring and confederating, and are "assuming to be in possession and control of the said Exposition and grounds and have usurped and are attempting to usurp an unlawful authority over the same, and assume to have the right to open and control the said gates and said grounds for the admission of the public thereto on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, during the continuance of the said Exposition, and that by reason of such unlawful claim and authority to open said gates and grounds to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday . . . notwithstanding the fact that the said unlawful assumption and the attempt and purpose as aforesaid to open the said grounds and Exposition on Sunday are in direct contravention of the terms of the said act of Congress."

The plea in the bill that the Columbian Exposition corporation and others "are conspiring and confederating together and are assuming to be in possession and control of the said Exposition and grounds," gives the key-note to the whole contention made by the attorneys for the Government. Their claim, made in various forms by each of the counsel for the Government, was in substance that the selection of the site and its approval by the United States Government and its acceptance at the time of dedication combined with the legislation which has been had upon World's Fair matters, in effect, constituted Jackson Park for the purposes of holding the Exposition and for the time during which such Exposition was held there, a Government reservation. They held that during that time the Government had the same authority over the Exposition and the Exposition grounds which it would have over the navy yards, forts, or any other property distinctively dedicated to Government uses and accepted and occupied by the Government. These averments were not made in such precise language, but the arguments were based upon just such a supposed state of facts.

The answer on the behalf of the Columbian Exposition Company to the bill of District Attorney Milchrist was fully as lengthy and gave also a history of the legislation in behalf of the World's Fair by Congress and of the selection of Jackson Park as a place for the holding of the Exposition, citing in connection therewith, in full the Park Commissioners' ordinance entitled, "An ordinance to allow the use of Jackson Park and the Midway Plaisance for the purposes of the World's Columbian Exposition." The action of Congress in making its several appropriations for the Exposition is then cited, and the condition attached to the souvenir coin appropriation treated as a contract, and the plea made that when the Government failed in the performance of the contract in full on its part, and retained a portion of the souvenir coins, the authorities of the Columbian Exposition were freed from the further fulfillment of the contract on their part. It is denied that there is any law either State or national, forcing the Board of Directors to close the Fair on Sundays, and the entire Federal control over the Exposition and its site and the local corporation, is denied. Mention is made of the restraining order issued from the Superior Court by Judge Stein in accordance with plea that the Columbian Exposition "had by its certain rules and orders excluded the public from admission to said Jackson Park and Midway Plaisance, in violation of the act of the legislature of the State of Illinois creating said parks, and praying that said defendant be enjoined from prohibiting the use and enjoyment of said park by the plaintiff and other citizens on Sundays or any other day of the week" and that "said case is still pending in said Superior Court, that it has jurisdiction, and that such jurisdiction was taken by said court prior to the filing of the complainant's bill herein."

The arguments presented by all the different counsel for the Government, hinged entirely upon the plea of supreme jurisdiction of the general Government over the Fair and the entire control of its business operations; the Local Board and the commissioners being agents of the Government doing its will and subject to it. This plea, of course, included also the right to make all rules and regulations deemed desirable including Sunday closing and the duty of the Local Board to submit thereto. To this plea a portion of the argument of attorney Edwin H. Walker was as follows:—

> For the first time the Government comes into court and claims complete jurisdiction over the Fair, but the 50,000 stockholders and those who have loaned $5,000,000 to the Exposition will never yield jurisdiction until ordered to do so by a mandate of this court. The claim of jurisdiction is without mandate of law. The directors have never by action or word tried to minimize the Fair as a national concern. We have never admitted that the Government was to have control of the enterprise. This local corporation, organized to control the Fair by express assent of the Federal Government, is not yielding at this late day. Certain organizations are behind this prosecution who have cried out that the law-breakers should be punished. If the directors, who have endured all their censure, are guilty of the wrongful act, they should be censured by the court of public opinion. While I admit that this is a Christian Nation I claim that I have the privilege to exercise my right to a free conscience without any dictation from any outside agency. Congress did not pass a law closing the Fair Sunday. Congress knew such a law would have been unconstitutional and repugnant to the principles of the Constitution. There is no provision in the acts of Congress that would empower the representatives of the Government to contract for labor or material, or even pay a gatekeeper to watch the gates, and yet counsel for the other side informs us that the work of the Fair is done under the authority of the United States Government.

Under the act of 1890 and subsequent acts of Congress there is no intimation that the Government was to have the control of the Exposition. The petitioners contend that the Government should have the power to declare whether the gates should be open Sunday on account of the morals of the people. A court of equity has control of property and not of morals. The remedy must be sought elsewhere.

It will be clear to any one who has followed the progress of legislation in behalf of this Columbian Exposition, that the position taken by Mr. Walker in opposition to the counsel for the Government, is the true one. The idea of the supreme control of the Government over the Exposition, and the agency only, of the Local Directory composing the Illinois corporation, is a second thought and not the original intent of the act of Congress or the view taken of it by congressmen at the time of the passage of that act. Congress has carefully avoided all financial responsibility in the matter of the World's Fair, and would be, if in session now, the last to assume such responsibility and give the Government's guarantee for all financial shortages which may occur. If the United States Government is the principal and the World's Fair Directory its agent, the principal is responsible for the acts of its agent and all who have claims, either now or hereafter, against the World's Columbian Exposition, may have recourse against the United States Government. Such a position as this, Congress has carefully avoided from the beginning.

Although in the pleadings, the constitutionality of the Sunday-closing proviso made by Congress was not impugned, yet in the course of the argument by Commissioner St. Clair and Attorney Edwin H. Walker for the Columbian Exposition, its constitutionality was several times called in question and denied. It was expressly declared by Mr. Walker that "the Government was prohibited by the Constitution from interfering,—that even if the act of March 3, 1893 had never been passed, section 4, (the Sunday closing section) of the act of 1892 was unconstitutional. When the counsel for the Government quoted the words of Judge Cooley in reference to the status of Sunday laws in the United States, Mr. Walker replied that "Judge Cooley never said that the United States could come into Illinois and enact Sunday laws."

The counsel for the Government did not fail to make the plea that this is a Christian Nation, and cited Justice Brewer's decision in the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity of New York City vs. the United States, in the support of that idea. This decision was referred to at considerable length and with the most marked assurance. The counsel for the Government also pleaded that Christianity was embedded in the laws of this country and was a part of the common law; and the inference, of course, drawn, that therefore the Government might make laws in reference to religion, and that they were properly enforced and should necessarily be obeyed.

After an interesting and exciting trial, which lasted through three days, and in a crowded court room, the case was taken under advisement by the judges, Grosscup, Wood, and Jenkins, and on Saturday morning notice was given that a decision, would be rendered Thursday, June 8.

When District Attorney Milchrist, in behalf of the Government, asked for a temporary injunction compelling the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, June 4, the court refused to act, leaving the directory to open the Fair on that day. From this action, the conclusion is drawn by some, that the court will refuse to interfere at all in the Sunday-closing matter, but that is a mere inference and therefore no data from which to give an opinion what the final decision of the court will be. If it should be decided that the United States has supreme jurisdiction and that its Sunday-closing proviso was proper legislation, and should an injunction, restraining the authorities of the World's Fair from opening on Sundays be had, the event will mark the most remarkable assumption of paternal and centralizing authority ever exhibited in this country. The question of the conflict of authority between the State Court and the United States Court will then come up; and if, in the case brought before Judge Stein, the final injunction should be granted, the issue would be directly made as between the people and State of Illinois and the general Government. Such an issue as this is sure to come sooner or later, for the upholding of religious legislation and the continuance of its growth in this country necessarily requires that State rights should be abrogated and the general Government assume to itself authority over the manners, morals, and religious conduct of the citizens of the United States in general.

Chicago, June 6.
