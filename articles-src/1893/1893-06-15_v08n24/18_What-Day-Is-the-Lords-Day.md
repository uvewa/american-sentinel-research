A CORRESPONDENT writes us that a Methodist preacher in his neighborhood recently preached a sermon in which he asserted that Sunday is the Lord's day. But the preacher's saying so does not make it so. The Sabbath is the Lord's day. Ex. 20:8, we read that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Then it is the Lord's day. In Isa. 58:13, we have these words: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day." Again the Sabbath is the Lord's day. Then in Mark 2:26, we have the declaration of our Lord that he is Lord of the Sabbath day; and again the Sabbath is the Lord's day. What difference does it make what any number of preachers say, when we can read for ourselves what the Bible says?
