## Adventists and Sunday Opening.

With characteristic recklessness the Christian Statesman asserts that the temporary order of a State court requiring the World's Fair to be kept open on Sunday was granted by a Hebrew judge to a Seventh-day Adventist. The fact is that the suit was brought by Ex-Congressman Wm. Mason, of Chicago, at the instance of Mr. Clingman, a prominent stockholder, and not an Adventist. Seventh-day Adventists were interested in the case only so far as it touched the question of the right of Congress to do indirectly that which the Constitution forbids it to do, namely, to pass any law interfering with the free exercise of religion. The Adventist position, consistently maintained from the first, has been that the managers of the Fair had a right to open it on Sunday or not to open it, just as seemed to them best, all things considered; and that they should in this matter be alike free from congressional bribes, un-American and unchristian boycotts, and legal processes, just as any other private or semi-private business enterprise should be free.

The so-called Protestant churches of the land, largely under the leadership of the Christian Statesman, were not satisfied to leave the managers of the Fair free to take their own course in the matter of Sunday closing; and failing in more drastic measures, they, by threats of political boycott, induced Congress to purchase Sunday closing. Adventists were interested in the Clingman injunction suit only so far as Judge Stein's decision restores to the whole people the rights wrested from them when Congress, at the behest of overreaching sectarian zealotry, took money belonging to the whole people and appropriated it to the support of a religious institution recognized by only a portion of the people.

Even had this money been appropriated in the interest of a vast majority of the people, which it was not, the action would still be without warrant, either of sound principle or American law. The preservation of inalienable rights demands that civil government shall let religion alone; while the Constitution of the United States forbids Congress to make any law in any way interfering with its free exercise. From any standpoint except that of the sectarian bigot, more concerned for his dogmas than for the rights of his fellowmen, the action of Congress in conditioning the appropriation on the observance of a religious institution was utterly indefensible.

On this subject the Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, the denominational organ of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, published at the headquarters of the denomination, Battle Creek, Mich., says in its issue of June 6:

We were hailed by a friend upon the street the other day, with the exclamation, "Well, you have the answer to your prayers, and the Fair is to be opened Sunday." No, we replied, we have put up no prayers, nor signed any petition that the Fair be opened on Sunday; that is to us a matter of indifference. All our contention has been that Congress should keep its hands out of that with which it has no business to meddle. We refer to the matter simply to show how the position of the Seventh-day Adventists is misapprehended. No divine law, or sanction, or example would be violated by keeping the Fair open on Sunday. But if those within whose jurisdiction the question of opening or closing on that day, or on any other, properly comes, desire to close it, let them do so. We have nothing to say. What we object to is, Congress, contrary to the Constitution, legislating upon religious questions. And no word would have been heard from Adventists on the subject had not religious bodies, so called reform associations, and Sabbath unions, begun to besiege Congress to set up its authority and enter the fatal path of religious legislation. So, whatever may come, let no one lay it at the door of the Seventh-day Adventists.

In perfect keeping with this expression from the Review and Herald, is the following from the Signs of the Times, another Adventist paper published in Oakland, Cal., by direct authority of the General Conference of the denomination:

No credit is due the World's Fair management for Sunday opening. It is a matter of policy all the way through, policy at the sacrifice of principle. Principle was sacrificed in the first place in the action of Congress, because the $5,000,000 were wanted, and now the Fair is opened contrary to agreement with United States Congress, because more money is wanted. That Congress should vote the Fair any appropriation they desire is all proper, but the matter of the Sabbath the Government had no right to meddle with; that ought to have been left to the local directory.

This is not a new thought with the Adventists. The position of the denomination has been similarly defined before, both by the Review and by the Signs of the Times. We have also repeatedly said the same thing. If, as the Christian Statesman intimates, any Adventist has assumed any other attitude than this, he has done it as an individual (which, of course, he had a right to do), and not as a representative of the denomination.
