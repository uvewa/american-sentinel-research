IT is a strange thing that a good many papers that see no impropriety in compelling the observance of a religious institution by means of a Sunday law, think the Presbyterian Church blundered for deposing from the ministry a member who persisted in teaching contrary to the tenets of the church. They would have the State enforce religious dogmas by civil punishment, while thinking it improper for the Church to maintain discipline by ecclesiastical censure. A strange inconsistency, truly!
