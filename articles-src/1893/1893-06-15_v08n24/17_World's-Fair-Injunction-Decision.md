IN the injunction suit brought by the United States to restrain the Local Directory from opening the World's Fair gates on Sunday, Judge Woods announced on the 8th inst., that he and his associates failed to agree on certain points, and that each would formulate his ideas in an individual opinion. Judge Wood's individual opinion was that the injunction must issue and the gates be closed. Judge Jenkins agreed with Judge Wood on the main point in the World's Fair injunction proceedings, and he also held that the injunction must issue and the Fair be closed on Sunday.

This decided the question. Judge Grosecup held that the Fair might be kept open. Attorney Walker at once gave notice of an appeal and asked for a stay, pending the final decision.
