THE New York Independent is opposed to an open Sunday Fair, but it is likewise opposed to the antichristian boycott which a portion of the religious press and a great many of the Sunday preachers have been urging. The Independent says:—

> What should be the attitude of Christian men and women toward this International Fair? They have been strongly advised to boycott it, to remove their exhibits from the grounds and to refrain from visiting it. We have never believed that such a movement could be successfully conducted. We have not advocated it and shall not do so now. The Fair itself ought not, in our judgment, to be condemned because it has been opened to the public on Sundays. It is legitimately open six days in the week. It is a legitimate Fair six days in the week. If any have lost interest in it because it is open seven days instead of six and do not want to visit it, well and good. Let them stay away. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind as to whether he shall go or not go. We can see no wrong in visiting the Fair on any week day. We do not believe any good can come from advising Christian people to stay away altogether. The churches ought not to take any such attitude. Let them make their protest fairly and squarely against Sunday opening, as they have done. But for them now to propose a boycott would be unwise, unnecessary and illogical.

The Independent might have added, illegal and unchristian to its list of adjectives descriptive of the boycott. It is unchristian, for it is in violation of the Golden Rule; it is illegal, for it is conspiracy.
