The *New York Independent* is not opposed to an open Sunday Fair, but it is likewise opposed to the antisubmission boycott which a portion of the religious press and a great many of the Sunday preachers have been urging. The *Independent* says:—

What should be the attitude of Christian men and women toward this International Fair? They were not long enough attracted or to boycott it, to restrain their children from the grounds and to refrain from patronizing the exhibitors by whose aid the whole movement could be successfully conducted. We cannot endorse it as advised and we do not so advise. The Fair itself ought not, in our judgment, to be condemned because it has not been its policy to be closed on Sunday. It is legitimately in its duty to keep its gates open for working people every seven days instead of six and do not want to be on the Sabbath for a rest of it. At the same time every man is fully persuaded in his own mind as to whether the working people are not for want by visiting or visiting the Fair on any week day. We earnestly exhort our Christian readers not to use the Christian people to stay away altogether. The right course lies in the golden activities. The churches of them make their protest freely and squarely against Sunday opening, as they have done. But to use one to propose a boycott would be unwise, unwise.
