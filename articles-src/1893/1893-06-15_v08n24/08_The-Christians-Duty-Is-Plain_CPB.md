## The Christian's Duty Is Plain.

Some of the papers are gravely advising Seventh-day Adventists to obey the Sunday laws until they can secure their repeal or modification. Indeed, one Maryland paper insists that as conscientious men they must do this for "it is a Christian duty to be subject to civil rulers." But that depends altogether upon what civil rulers require. From the days of the Apostle Peter until the present time the Christian motto has been, "We ought to obey God rather than men." The blood of millions has been shed in support of this principle. The Christian can go to prison or to death, but he can not deny his faith even at the behest of civil rulers, for the instant he does so he ceases to be a Christian, and is, in fact, only an idolater, worshiping at the shrine of mammon and making a god of the State.

"One of the strangest and yet most logical results of the Christian teachings and practice (and one which has been, for very sufficient reasons, ignored by the theologians)," says the author of "Arius, the Libyan,"* "was to develop a radical and uncompromising spirit of democracy throughout the Christian communities or churches. The early Christians uniformly held that they, as Christians, belonged to a kingdom which was in, but not of, the world—a kingdom for which no earthly potentate had right or power to legislate; and this living faith loosened the bond of allegiance and dissolved the sense of obligation as to all human authority, and was the negation of the lawfulness of temporal government over the subjects of the kingdom for which they recognized no king but Christ. While, for the sake of peace, they were willing to render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, by paying taxes to that government under which they lived, and by even yielding ready obedience to all laws and customs which did not come in conflict with the higher law of the kingdom, the rights of conscience, they universally regarded these laws as extraneous to their own organization, foreign statutes, imposed upon them from without; and, being solicitous to render unto God the things which are God's they steadily abstained from any participation in the affairs of government, and quietly assumed the right to judge for themselves whether any law, regulation, or custom, prescribed by the sovereign power, or other human authority, was or was not such as they might conscientiously obey. . . . But this fearless assertion of the rights of conscience necessarily involved the right to sit in judgment upon all human laws and the powers that ordained them, and to determine for themselves whether the law was lawful. That helpless spirit of blind obedience to the decrees of despotic governments which characterized the pagan peoples was, therefore, impossible to the Christians. . . . The logical tendency of Christianity was, therefore, to originate the idea of personal liberty for all men, unknown to the world before; to repudiate the heathen doctrine of the divine character and right of kings; to sit in judgment upon their laws, and to intelligently obey, or refuse to obey, them; in a word, to cultivate and exercise, as a matter of religious faith, that spirit of personal independence, both of action and of thought, which we in later times denominate democracy, the concrete form of which was the election of deacons, presbyters, and bishops by the people unto whom they ministered."

The Christian's duty is plain, namely, to preserve "a conscience void of offense toward God, and toward men;" but this can be done only by rendering "unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." The Christian must be in subjection to civil rulers in their appropriate sphere, for conscience' sake; but when civil government transcends its jurisdiction, and Caesar demands that the things that belong to God shall be rendered unto the State, the Christian has no option but to disobey and suffer the consequences; to do otherwise would be treason to his divine King, even Jesus Christ, who though he "did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth," suffered as a malefactor because Caesar exceeded his authority.
