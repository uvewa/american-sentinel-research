IF any are still disposed to think that the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, of Feb. 29, 1892, declaring this to be a "Christian Nation," and citing Sunday laws to prove it made no new thing, let them consider the use that has been made of it and is still being made of it by the advocates of compulsory Sunday observance. Note the following:—

The decision is vital to the Sunday question in this way: the Supreme Court having declared this to be a "Christian Nation," this Nation should enforce upon Christian institutions.... The Sabbath day, the Christian Church, therefore the Christian Sabbath, and the Government of the Christian Nation, should recognize and protect it.—*Christian Statesman, May 7, 1892.*

The decision of April of 1892, in favor of keeping the World's Fair closed on Sunday, by the Chicago Presbytery—*Christian Statesman, May 7, 1892.*

*Chicago Evening Journal, April 6, 1893.*

*Christian Endeavor, May, 1893.*

*Journal* recently interviewed a number of clergymen regarding what they thought of enforcing Sunday observance. The following is from his interview with President A. A. Noble, pastor of the Union Park University, Episcopal Church:—

Sunday observance as you advocate it is constitutional, as sustained by a majority of all the people.

Exactly as I would enforce the law in any other case. The Supreme Court has decided that this is a Christian country, and the foundations of the Government are Christian.

The following also is from an interview in the same paper with Dr. J. B. Thomas, Third Presbyterian Church, of Chicago:—

We must have a fixed rule, and that rule must contain the religious element, or it will not avail.

"I believe in the fullest religious and secular liberty possible for every individual. But rather not, a form of a religious liberty which would subvert the very foundation of civil government, that would tear up the statute books of this and more of the great republic, that would destroy the supremacy of the law of the land; and that must be enforced as law enacted in this country should be enforced."

In his "Brief" of April, 1892, in favor of keeping the World's Fair closed on Sunday, presented before the House Committee on Columbian Exposition, by that relentless persecutor, Col. Elliot F. Shepard quoted from the "Thanksgiving Day" Supreme Court Meeting—"the laws respecting the observance of the Sabbath and the like" and then from the Supreme Court declaring that "this is a Christian Nation."

An eight-page pamphlet which was generously distributed at the hearing before the House Committee on the Columbian Exposition and at sundry times often this decision to prove the selections of Sundays of Sunday fairs as offering with the Columbian Exposition.

From all this it is evident that the decision of the Supreme Court did make some new thing. It made a foundation for the advocates of Sunday legislation to argue upon, which they did not have in the form, one "indisputable legal basis" for which they had so long been waiting. In other words it made the image to the beast. The Sunday law was "passed" by Congress; and the decision gave life to it.

This it was declared would be the result.

Our land is in jeopardy. The time is drawing on for the formation of the image. The American Protestants as to give countenance to Roman Catholicism, and they shall be moved to establish a form of religion, in which the aid of the Government will be taken to enforce their purposes, the pulling yoke of popery, will by a national act enforce the Sunday sabbath, this will be the corruption of America.—*Testimony 32 (edition 1885), pp. 206, 207.*

Can one who reads these statements can fail to recognize the same spirit, the same unceasing spirit behind this movement, and that persecution to its ultimate end. It is the same spirit that was involved in that first line of all the spirit that has made its way through the centuries to the present hour. Can any of the National Reformers themselves honestly deny it?

And as the National Reform movement of this nineteenth century is a repetition of the fourth century, so the closing acts in the Fair matter are a repetition.

So this was heard the plea for the law to close the World's Fair gates on Sunday, from Rev. Dr. Herrick Johnson: "a movement which excited that this law will be enforced for the extermination of some who ever by action or word tried to minimize its investment." ... The same spirit pervades them all. The Lord is to be with His Church in all her struggles.
