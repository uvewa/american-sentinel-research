An opinion very generally entertained is that the recognition and support of a single sect is essential to a union of Church and State, and that as no sect or church is in the majority in this country, there can be but in this Nation no such purpose. But those who entertain this opinion have made but a hasty and very superficial examination of the subject. Nevertheless, it is only for that purpose. Nevertheless, it is only for that they have had history to very little related to it. In the *Christian Statesman*, of April, 1890, No. 5, we read:—

A Professor of Political Science in Geneva College, Pennsylvania, a prominently National Reformer, being asked to show that a union of Church and State was implied in this government, replied:

In the phrase "union of Church and State" the word "Church" is used in a loose sense, and the word "State" is used loosely.

"Church" does not mean, in this connection, any particular religious denomination. The State "church," may mean a creed, a form of worship, a liturgy, or a religious standard of morals, either expressed in a constitutional enactment, a law, a judicial opinion, a legislature building, or a compurgation; (1) a body of believers who claim to be the Church or recognized as such in the formation of government; (2) a representative body of religious teachers constituting a church or denomination in itself; the collective body of individuals recognized as exercising ecclesiastical authority, and are not sustained in any form whatsoever and for whatever reason. A union of Church and State exists wherever the Government is connected with the Church, takes in the account the views and welfare of the Church....

Here, however, we turn to the history of the relation of the Church to the State during the early part of the fourth century.

With the commencement of the fourth century ... the State did not overtly become a party ... to any creed. Constantine contented himself ... with a more indirect course. It comes down to the Declaration of broad principles, in which everything must be subordinated. Christianity was, in fact, the religion legally. The State had adopted no creed; Christianity had not been "Church and State" as commonly used, but it was a virtual union of religion and state and reaction. The advantages of a legal connection of the Christian religion with its commanding power was also, if a little while, apparent. By the alliance of church and state the Church gained so much the benefits of the church itself. The beneficent and vital truths of the new religion began to exert their happy influence upon society and State; especially as it now have in law had everything ... in the new relationship. But the evils of that relationship have since manifested themselves on a scale so grand that all its blessings and benefits could not serve, or put it, as it was before, so in its favor. Even a nominal connection with the State was contaminating. Its influence in various ways would operate to secularize the Church; and then necessarily to give the mere properties of the Church to the State.

And this is exactly the relation of the Christian religion to the State of this Nation to-day; and this is the nature of the union of Church and State which exists in this country; and this is the nature of the union which the National Reformers would make forever in the laws and the Constitution of this country. They demand that the Constitution shall be so "changed" and so "amended" as that "Christianity" shall be that by which every thing, including the State, education, and the Church, as much broader, shall be regulated.

But being under one law, governed by one rule, what is the union of Church and State? Let *National Reformers* answer—

It is the teaching that civil rulers ought to make the laws of God the basis of human legislation, and of courts of law and punish all crimes. It is a recognition of God by the Government, and of the Church and a part of the nation by the system of religion.

And who can doubt that like cause, whether in this country and in that time, will produce the like effects? Not only do the civil authorities have been disposed, but to invoke in the state the whole religious question, to in the demand of the Government ever be regarded as the interpreter and exponent of the word of God. And no one as represented by Congress or the Supreme Court of the United States, the civil power will rule the Church or the churches, of the State. And so far, as it has already done in the matter relating to the World's Fair, the question of there is to small excuse.

The National Reform movement of this nineteenth century, as seen on its last day, is only a repetition of the acts of the fourth century over again. Even as Constantine, in establishing the Christian religion, the State declared that to be the Christian Church. As he said: "Let us have nothing in common with the most hostile rabble;" and proposed that Congress does not profess to recognize any particular denomination. Can we hope that the religion of the National Reformers as it is now formulated in that "Christian" Constitution, to be taken as the infallible standard of right, and that all our laws shall conform to the standards of "Christianity," propose to make the divine law, or rather which the courts and Congress shall hold, the Churches decide to be the divine law, for the Churches have the divine law.
