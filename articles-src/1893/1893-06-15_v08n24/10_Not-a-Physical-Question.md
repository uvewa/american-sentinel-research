## Not a Physical Question.

It is a little singular how anybody can determine that it is necessary to the well-being of man and beast that one day in seven should be "kept." Logically, if the farmer who works but six or eight hours a day in the winter should keep one day in seven, in the summer when he works twelve to sixteen hours a day ought to keep two days in seven. Such illustrations might be multiplied, all tending to show the absurdity of this rest-day business from a hygienic standpoint. All will agree that in the case of any individual there is a limit beyond which labor would be injurious, but that limit can never be fixed to a certainty even by the individual himself, and must vary infinitely with times and seasons, character of work, changing physical conditions, etc., all of which go to show that the question of rest as well as that of work should be left to each individual to determine for himself. Most people are not apt to work too much, and but for the religious question involved, no one would ever have thought of any prescribed rest day or compulsory rest at all.
