## Modern Christian Methods.

The continued controversy over the question of Sunday opening of the World's Fair furnishes a striking spectacle of the effects of uniting Church and State, even partially. In theory we have no such union in this country, but in practice we have. In theory we say that no man's conscience shall be dominated by another's, and that no one shall force any part of his religion upon another. The Constitution expressly states that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. Yet we prove the Constitution a lie and our theories of no effect by permitting religious organizations to control the Government and make various laws for the establishment of religion, such as exemption of church property from taxation, requiring the observation of Sunday, etc. In no instance has the tyrannical nature and intolerant spirit of ecclesiasticism shown itself more strongly than in connection with the Chicago Exposition. From the start the Church power has been determined to close the gates on Sunday, and to accomplish that object has resorted to all the tricks of politics.

Petitions were sent to Congress containing names numbering more than double the population of various States; lobbyists were sent to Washington to influence congressmen; at every conference resolutions were adopted threatening that if the Fair were not run according to the wish, will and instruction of the "Christian conscience," said conscience would do all it could to injure it, both by staying away and by inducing others to do the same. Now that the management has decided to return the Government loan, and both the local directory and the national commission have voted to open the gates on Sunday in response to public pressure, these threats are being renewed, and rule or ruin is declared to be the intention of the church element.

All this may be according to the Christianity of Christ, but it doesn't look so to us. It may be consistent with a religion which is "not of this world," and whose weapons are expected to be only spiritual ones, but it doesn't look so to us. It may be in accord with the principles of religious liberty, separation of Church and State, and equal rights, but it doesn't look so to us.
