*Chicago Correspondence.*

The second open Sunday of the World's Fair has passed. The attendance on both days has been large, although the people did not come in such great crowds as was expected. The quietness and good order of the crowds, which were double or treble those of an ordinary week day, was very marked. No drunkenness or rowdyism has been observed on either Sunday, and it was evident that all who came to the Fair on Sunday had come to see and to learn and gain the most possible for the money expended.

The second open Sunday was upheld by a peculiar series of legal events. First, the World's Fair Directory determined, as works policy required its continuance; the failure of the Government to keep the contract made with the Exposition, after it had freed the Fair management from its obligation to close Sundays, and passed a resolution similar to the first Sunday regulations; second, this resolution to open was upheld by the proper judicial authority of the Board of Directors; third, in the case brought by Ex-Congressman Mason in behalf of a stock-holder of the World's Fair, to restrain the World's Fair Directory from closing the park, in which the Fair is situated, to the people on Sunday, a temporary injunction was granted and the final hearing set for nine days later; and also the injunction was brought the action in the United States Court to enjoin the Fair management also from opening the Fair on Sunday. The United States Court granted the injunction, closing on Friday, June 2—the injunction was for the next judicial Thursday, June 8. This quite a remarkable combination of circumstances surprised the directory in holding the Fair open on Sunday.

The bill filed by District Attorney Milchrist on behalf of the Government, asked a stay of the Sunday opening of the World's Fair, a lengthy document and cited the act of Congress relating to the celebration of the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, by holding an international exhibition of arts, industries, manufactures, and the products of the soil, the mine, and sea, in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois;" and also the Sunday-closing proviso in the Civil Sundry bill; and the action of the directory and commissioners thereon. The bill further added, that the directors and commissioners are still bound by the said Sunday-closing action of Congress. The bill also further charges a conspiracy wherein the World's Columbian Exposition corporation with others is conspiring and confederating, and are "exercising to be possessed and in control of the said Exposition and grounds and have usurped and are attempting to usurp an unlawful authority over the same, and assumes to have the right to open and control the said gates and said grounds for the admission of the public thereto on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, during the continuance of said Exposition, and that by reason of such unlawful claim and unlawful assertion of authority, said grounds and public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, this notwithstanding the fact that the said unlawful claim and assertion of right on their part as aforesaid to open the said grounds and Exposition on Sundays are in direct contravention of the terms of the said act of Congress."

The plea in the bill that the Columbian Exposition corporations and others are conspiring and confederating together and great amounts are standing in the control of the said Exposition and grounds, gives the key-note to the whole contention of the Government over this whole matter. Their claim, made in various forms and by various advocates and at various times, was in substance that the selection of Jackson Park and the acceptance at the time of organization established the legislation which has been had upon World's Fair matters, in effect, constituted Jackson Park for the purpose of holding the Exposition, at least during the time which such Exposition was being held, United States territory over which Congress had sovereignty. The plea was made that during that time the Government had the same authority over the Exposition, and the property upon which it is held, would have over the navy yards, forts, or other property belonging to the United States Government and accepted and occupied by the Government itself. The points were not made in such precise language, but the acceptance was based upon just such a supposed state of facts.

The plea of the bill against the Columbian Exposition Company to the bill of the people on the Exposition was that Attorney Milchrist himself gave also a history of his legislation and passed in behalf of the World's Fair and the choice and dedication of Jackson Park as a place for the holding of the Exposition, and from this attempts to establish in full the Park Commissioners' ordinance and the relations and acts with reference to Jackson Park and the Midway Plaisance for the purposes of the "World's Columbian Exposition." The action of Congress made in making its several appropriations for the Exposition is then cited, and the bill recites the situation clause of such an appropriation treated as a contract, and the plea is made that when the Government failed in the performance of the contract in full on its part, and refused a portion of the money, the directors in charge of the Columbian Exposition were freed from all obligation imposed by such contract on their part. It is denied that there is any just either for a national, forcing the Board of Directors to close the Fair on Sundays and the option. Father's control over the Exposition and the site and the corporate operations, is cited. Mention is made of the restraining order issued from the State court and that what was most notable in this action its decision to prove the selection of Sundays of Sunday fairs as offering with the Columbian Exposition.

From all this it is evident that the decision of the Supreme Court did make some new thing. It made a foundation for the advocates of Sunday legislation to argue upon, which they did not have in the form, one "indisputable legal basis" for which they had so long been waiting. In other words it made the image to the law. The Sunday law has been "passed" by this grave following the decision gave life to it. This it was declared would be the result.

Our land is in jeopardy. The time is drawing on for the formation of the image. The American Protestants as to give countenance to Roman Catholicism, and they shall be moved to establish a form of religion, in which the aid of the Government will be taken to enforce their purposes, the pulling yoke of popery, will by a national act enforce the Sunday sabbath, this will be the corruption of America. *Testimony 32 (edition 1885), pp. 206, 207.*

And one who with readers and writers and watchers of events in this act join hands with popery, it is well seen that the aims of the old and the new are exactly the same.

Thus it was in the creation of man. God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. Gen. 2:7. First God formed man, then breathed into him the breath of life; then he became a living soul—a being, walking, living, speaking and acting. The record in the creation of the image of the beast is the same thing. The Revelation 13:14, 15, says that God formed man of the dust of the ground, "that the image of the beast" first, then after it was formed "to give it the breath of life, and man became a living soul."

So in the formation of the image to the beast, the Government by its power formed the image—the likeness of it. The forming of it is one thing, the giving life to it another. The order of events is the same. To follow those first two necessary steps, it is necessary to trace the further steps, and, as it were, for the very existence of that, and different steps as its relation in the prophecy. First, the statement is that the power "had power to give *life* to the image of the beast," second, to cause "them;" then he had power to give life breath; third, unto the line of the beast; and this "that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."

As long as in 1883 this word was spoken:

The Sunday movement is now making its way in darkness. The leaders are concealing the true issue, and many who unite in the movement do not themselves see whither the undercurrent is tending. Its professions are mild, and apparently Christian; but when it shall speak, it will reveal the spirit of the dragon.

So it is the Sunday movement that is to speak. What it shall speak is, in language, it will be that of the persecutor—the voice of the dragon. Already this is beginning to be manifest. The *Christian Sabbath* or *Melbourne News* July 1891 gives an extract from a speech made by Rev. Dr. Mackay Smith at the hearing in Washington.

The Fair managers have accepted the people's money and entered into a contract to keep it closed Sunday. They could have refused the money, but they cannot keep our money and open on Sundays before or after hours. They are compelled to do business more than ever—Sunday.

Although this legislation was secured professedly in the interests of the laboring man, yet when the Central Labor Union, and by inducing others to do the same. Now that the management has decided to reture the Government loan, and both the local directory and the national commission have voted to open the gates on Sunday in response to public demand generally, threats are being returned, and roles to be declared to be the invention of the church element.

All this may be according to the Christianity of Christ, but it doesn't look so to us. It may be consistent with a religion which is "not of this world," and whose weapons are expected to be only spiritual weapons, but it does not seem to be very much in accord with the principles of toleration, to say nothing of the complete freedom which is guaranteed to every State, and equal rights, but it doesn't look so to us.—*American Nonconformist.*
