For years Sunday laws were urged in the interests of temperance. The Sentinel said all the time that the real object was not to promote temperance but to exalt Sunday. Now the facts demonstrate the truth of our contention. A year ago the demand for Sunday closing was very generally coupled with a demand that no liquors be sold on the grounds; now that liquors are sold there, nothing is said of boycotting the Fair for that reason but for Sunday opening; and not only so, but the Political Dissenter, a National Reform paper published in Allegheny, Pa., in its issue of June 1, says:—

> We admit that the use of the pressure of this pledge to stay away from the Fair carries with it an implied assurance that, if the Fair is closed on the Sabbath, the Christian people of America will support it by going to it. And much as we have been opposed to the liquor traffic of the Fair, and earnestly as we have approved a pledge to remain away on account of that feature of it, we are ready now, in view of the supreme importance which the Sabbath-closing question has assumed, to be held to the implied promise of approval and support on which the management, in case the Fair is finally and permanently closed, will say they have trusted in making the Exposition a Sabbath observing enterprise. They will naturally make their argument and appeal to Christians in this way: "In all this conflict before Congress and since, you friends of the Sabbath have declared that you would remain away from the Fair if the gates were opened on the Lord's day. We, together with Congress itself, have understood you to mean by this pledge that you would not stay away if the gates were closed. Encouraged by your implied promise of countenance and aid, Congress passed its law, and the management is accordingly running the Fair with closed gates. And now we look to you for your promised support." There is logic in this argument. And the struggle has brought out the full force of it. And if after such a conflict the gates are faithfully closed, we are constrained to say it is wise and right, in view of all that has entered into the struggle, for Christians to give the Fair their patronage and support.

This shows that Sunday and not temperance is the object aimed at. Everything is to be made subservient to this one idea, the sacredness of the man-made Sabbath, the Sunday of the Papacy, "the wild solar holiday of all pagan times."
