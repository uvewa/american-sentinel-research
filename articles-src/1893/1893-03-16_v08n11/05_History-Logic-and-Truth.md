[*Rev. A. H. Lewis appeared as the only champion of truth, justice, and the correct principles of legislation, at the hearing concerning the State Sunday law before the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives of the State of Pennsylvania, on Feb. 16, 1893. Extracts from the synopsis of Dr. Lewis' remarks published in the* Sabbath Recorder *are reprinted here.*]

I appear in behalf of the Seventh-day Baptists of the State of Pennsylvania, and in behalf of religious liberty for all men. I ask for the total repeal of the Sunday law of 1794.

The origin of the present law is connected directly with the Seventh-day Baptists. Before the Revolutionary War there were many Seventh-day Baptists in Philadelphia and the eastern part of Pennsylvania; they were among the most industrious, upright, and patriotic citizens. At the close of that war there was much general immorality and irreligion, arising from the disorders incident to such times, and from the influence of the moral and religious revolution going on in France in 1793. Philadelphia was the national capital. The yellow fever swept over the city that year, leaving a trail of desolation, sorrow and fear. Accustomed, as the men of that time were, to look upon such epidemics as a direct punishment for sins, the public mind was aroused to learn why such things had come to pass. During the war many laws against vice and immorality had fallen into disuse, or had expired by limitation. The legislature of Pennsylvania convened early in December, 1793, and a committee was appointed to report laws looking toward a better state of things. Religious men of all classes joined in urging this movement, the Seventh-day Baptists, both English and German, being among the foremost. Since the prevailing disorders were most marked on days of leisure, the Sunday question became a prominent factor in the case. When the excitement was at the highest the seventh-day Baptists discovered that the proposed law touching Sunday would press heavily upon them, not in the matter of vice or immorality, but in point of legitimate labor and business. Hence on Thursday, Jan. 2, 1794, they presented the following memorial, saying:

That agreeable to the dictates of their own consciences, they have set apart and kept the seventh day as their Sabbath, and by existing laws are subjected to severe penalties for working on the first day of the week (Sunday), which they conceive to be contrary to the constitution of this commonwealth, they therefore pray that so much of the "act for the suppression of vice and immorality," etc., as imposes a penalty on them for working on the first day of the week, may be repealed.

This memorial was based on Section 3, Article 9, of the State constitution, which reads:—

All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences; no man can, of right, be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent; no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and no preference shall be given, by law, to any religious establishments or modes of worship.

Religious men of all classes, joined in petitioning the legislature that this exemption be granted to the Seventh-day Baptists. The matter was laid over from Jan. 2 to Feb. 5, 1794; and there is good evidence that the exemption would have been granted but for one circumstance.

The petition for exemption was referred to a committee, of which James McLene, who represented Franklin County, was a member. He was a Scotch Irish Presbyterian who was fanatically opposed to everything connected with Roman Catholicism. Through a strange ignorance of the facts, McLene had determined that the Seventh-day Baptists were Papists in disguise, to whom no quarter should be granted. His persistent intolerance gained the victory, and the committee reported against the exemption. On the 22nd of April, 1794, under such influences, the present law was enacted. The Seventh-day Baptists and others have suffered persecution under it from time to time for a century, not because of evil, but because personal spite, or petty ambition has enabled intolerant enemies to cause their arrest and punishment for quietly working on their farms. A law which makes such wrongs possible ought not to abide the light of the closing years of this century. Perhaps "exemption" was all that could be hoped for in the shadows of 1794; but is is too late now to ask for less than repeal, for, as I proceed to show, the law violates the fundamental rights of all men and the fundamental doctrines of religious liberty.

THIS LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL RELIGIOUS LEGISLATION, WHICH OUGHT TO BE REPEALED.

Those who seek to evade this fact say: "The law does not compel men to attend church, nor be religious." This is an evasion. The law forbids "worldly employment or business on the Lord's day." "Worldly" has no meaning here except as opposed to "sacred;" this word, as contrasted with the next, "Lord's day," has no meaning except it be a day sacred to the Lord, a day specially set apart for his service, and in the interest of religion, and as contrasted with other days not so devoted. The term "Sabbath,"—so commonly used in this discussion, but which legislators dare not use in legal enactment lest the law apply to Saturday and not to Sunday—has no meaning except as a day which men should hold sacred to God. The law of 1794 assumes that it is wrong, is irreligious, sinful, to pursue "worldly" affairs on Sunday; the crucial point in the law is that it forbids certain things on Sunday which may be done on any other day without hindrance, because it is not wrong or irreligious to do them on other days. The things prohibited are not wrong per se, but only wrong at a certain specified time, which the law declares to be the "Lord's" time. To say that such a law does not enforce a religious duty, is to deny the plainest facts of history and the clearest meaning of words. And more! no Sunday law has been enacted from the pagan law of Constantine in 321 A. D. to the late national provision touching the opening of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday, which did not spring from religious sentiments, and aim at preventing irreligious actions.

When the friends of Sunday wish to evade the claims of Saturday, the Sabbath, according to the Bible, they declare that the law of God, in the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, does not designate a specific day of the week, but only any seventh day of rest after six days of labor. This is the latest and most popular interpretation of God's Sabbath law. Grant this, not as fact, but for the sake of the argument. By what right then does the law of Pennsylvania go so far beyond the law of God? Who gave the legislature of 1794, under the lead of James McLene, the right to declare that all men in the commonwealth shall cease from all worldly business on a specific day in each week? Was James McLene, with his force anti-papistic intolerance, coupled with an ignorance which kept him from knowing the difference between a Seventh-day Baptist and a Roman Catholic, a better religious guide than "Moses, the man of God?" If the Bible does not fix the Sabbath on any specific day, shall the State of Pennsylvania, in the face of its constitution, which declares that "No preference shall be given by law to any religious establishment or modes of worship" assume to determine what these men say the Bible forbids, by declaring that Sunday, a specific day, is the Sabbath? May this commonwealth visit fines and imprisonment on upright citizens because they practice what those who desire to retain this law say the Bible teaches, but what they themselves inconsistently deny when they plead for the law? Tested by popular assertions used to push Saturday out of sight, Pennsylvania has no right to go beyond protecting each man in Sabbatizing on any day he may choose. So far, these advocates of the law of 1794 are right, even though such arguments, invented to ward off the claims of Seventh-day Baptists, logically destroy all Sunday legislation.

BASED ON FALSE CLAIMS.

But a stronger indictment remains. The law of 1794 is based on false claims. It assumes that Sunday is the Sabbath according to the Bible, and that men sin against God who "desecrate it." Whatever the men of 1794 may have thought, every man who has looked into this matter knows that is not the fact. The Bible designates the "seventh day" as the Sabbath. That this means the seventh day of the week is shown by the fact that the Jews who received the law, so understood it, and have kept it in unbroken succession to this day; and also the fact that Sunday, "the first day of the week," can be located only by its relation to Saturday, the seventh day of the week. There is not a word or hint in the Bible about the transferring of the Sabbath law to Sunday or the "change" of the Sabbath. The modern theory of such transfer and change did not appear in history until the English Reformation, when it was invented as a compromise between the theory of the English Seventh-day Baptists and that of the Roman Catholics. The "first day of the week" is mentioned but a few times in the New Testament. It is never spoken of as sacred, as the Sabbath, or as being in any way worthy of religious regard. Its observance is never connected with Christ's resurrection. The term "Lord's day" occurs but once in the New Testament, and there is no evidence that Sunday was then referred to. There is no definite proof that the term was applied to Sunday until one hundred and seventy years after Christ. In the face of such facts it is difficult to understand how men of this day can continue to assume what we can perhaps, forgive in the men of one hundred years ago.

Similar facts appear in the history of Sunday legislation. The earliest law, that of Constantine, 321 A. D., is wholly pagan in form and fact. It mentions the day only as the "venerable day of the sun." There is not a trace of Christianity in the law. Sunday legislation did not begin as a part of Christianity. Gradually it combined Christian with pagan elements. The term "Lord's day" does not appear until 386 A. D., in a law of Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius; and the term "Sabbath," as applied to Sunday, does not appear in civil law or ecclesiastical literature until the Puritan Reformation in England, three hundred years ago. The assumption which underlies the law of 1794 ignores these facts. Historic honesty demands its repeal.

In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I earnestly and respectfully ask you to consider the repeal of this law of 1794, because,

(a) It contravenes the fundamental principle of religious liberty.

(b) It has always wrought injustice to those who observe the Sabbath—Saturday.

(c) It is unjust toward those who do not believe that they ought to cease from legitimate work on any particular day, for religious reasons.

(d) It rests on the false assumption that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that it is sinful to do on that day that which may be done on Monday without thought of wrong.

(e) It hinders the cause of genuine Sabbath reform by teaching men to rely on the civil law in matters which belong only to the Word of God and the decisions of religious conscience.

(f) It weakens and destroys conscience toward God by putting human authority, resting on false claims, before the divine law.

Permit me also to repeat that, in asking for repeal, I would remove no restriction against the evils which come with Sunday as a day of leisure; evils which Sunday laws help to create by enforcing leisure upon the irreligious. I would inaugurate new and more rigid legislation against saloons, gambling, impurity, rioting, and everything of this kind. I plead for a higher conception of Christianity and of Sabbath-keeping than civil law has given, or can give. I ask for a just and helpful application of Christian principles to all, regardless of creed. This is not a question of majorities, but of God-given rights. It is a question of truth and facts, not creeds and traditions. It is a question of principles, not of the percentage of opinions. That legislation best befits this great commonwealth, bearing the honored name of William Penn, which best attains a broad Christ-like application of the principles of religious freedom to all classes, and to all questions of religious faith and practice. Before closing, I must come to the defense of "Presbyterian elders," and Christian people generally who take the Sunday newspapers, ride on Sunday trains, etc. I have heard these people much condemned in the convention just held for the purpose of inducing your honorable body to preserve the law of 1794. These men are not more wicked than men of a century ago. They have learned more of the facts concerning Sunday and have come to believe that it is not a sacred day. They have learned that the Bible does not declare Sunday work to be a sin. They do not fear that God will forge lightning to smite them if they do advertise to Sunday papers. This is the deeper meaning of the growing disregard for Sunday among Christian men. It is neither honest, charitable, nor Christ-like to denounce them as "hypocrites" and "greedy sinners," for rejecting the false claims of Sunday.
