[REV. A. H. Lewis appeared as the only champion of religious liberty from the standpoint of a Sabbatarian, at the hearing concerning the State Sunday law, before the Judiciary Committee of the Pennsylvania Legislature, Harrisburg, on Feb. 14, 1893. Extracts from the synopsis furnished by himself.]

I APPEAR in behalf of the Seventh-day Baptists of the State of Pennsylvania, and respectfully ask you to consider the bearing of the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794.

This question has been brought to the attention of the Legislature, and that not indirectly directly with the Seventh-day Baptists of this State. In 1840 and 1843, there were many Seventh-day Baptists in Pennsylvania, particularly in the eastern counties; they were among the most intelligent and progressive citizens of the Commonwealth.

At the close of that war there was much to push the cause of religious freedom from the churches' incredible to modern times and from the influence of the moral and religious ideas from the Puritan sources in 1782. Philadelphia was the national capital, and the National Reform Association was working in Washington as well. During that year, leaving a trail of denunciation and intolerance that the records show, the men of that time were, to look upon those who refused to keep Sunday as enemies. The public mind was aroused to learn about the practical effects of such laws and eventually it was shown that it was its immorality that fallen to it and that the law immediately had no fitness for, nor had it any constitutional basis. The law of Pennsylvania convened early in December and has continually passed laws to reject laws looking toward a better observance of Sunday. Many of the churches joined in urging this movement, particularly the Presbyterians, the English and the Germans, being among the foremost. Bishop White of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and the Roman Catholics, were also conspicuous in their support.

The Sunday law was accordingly passed in 1794, and remained practically unchanged until recent years, imposing fines and imprisonment on the dissenters. The Seventh-day Baptists were among those whom such a prosecution forced into action for the purpose of preserving their property, and this, combined with other circumstances, helped the seventh-day Baptists discover that the Seventh-day Baptists of any older day would press heavily upon them, not in the form of religious persecution, but in point of legitimate labor and business.

Items on Thursday, July 4, 1793, I presented the following memorial, saying:—

That whereas to us the first day of the week is a common day of business, that we have always been accustomed to pursuing a peaceful labor in the practice of our several callings on that day, as on any other business, or as on other common or ordinary days or leaves, this depriving the members of said community from a provision period forced into action for the purpose of preserving their property, and this, combined with other circumstances helped the seventh-day Baptists discover themselves; therefore pray that as much of the bill as the passage of the proposed law and as for such, and the provisions act or law on our behalf; or else from a penalty as shall appear.

The memorial was based on Section 3, Article 9, of the State constitution, which reads:—

All men have a natural and inalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship or maintain any ministry against his consent; no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishments or modes of worship.

Religious men of all classes, joined in petitioning the legislature that this exemption be granted to the Seventh-day Baptists. The record for that session, on Jan. 3, Fol. 3, p. 1794, and there is gone evidence that this was the case at this time.

The petition for exemption was rejected. A counter petition, from Franklin McElree, who represented Franklin County, was presented. He was a Scotch-Irish Presbyterian who was fanatically and evidently overlooking convinced with Roman Catholicism. Through a strange ignorance of the fact, McElree determined that the Seventh-day Baptists were Papists in disguise, to whom no quarter should be granted. His personal influence in the legislature of Pennsylvania, on the 22nd of April, 1794, under such false impressions, carried the day.

The Seventh-day Baptists and others have suffered persecution under it from that time for a century, not because of evil, but because personal spite, or personal prejudice, moving the complaint; or because she has made indolent enemies to set the cause their intend and partner for quietly working on their farms. A law which rests under the shadow of an attempt not to abide the right of the citizens' claim of this century. *Perhaps* "exemption" of this measure has been in the shadow shadows of 1794; but it is too late now to reverse the errors which those shadows represent. But whatever may be done now to show, the law violates the fundamental principles of just law and the fundamental doctrines of religious liberty.

UNDER LEGISLATION, WHICH COMPELS RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE.

Those who seek to evade this fact say that the day is "civil" and the requirement is "not be religious." This is an attempt to give a civil name to a religious employment or business on the Lord's day."

It assumes that "the Lord's day" has ever the time been commonly known except as opposed to "sacred;" this word, as contrasted with the rest, "Lord's day," over the rest of 1791 not any way designed, has no meaning except it be a day sacred to the Lord, a day mostly set apart for his direction, and in the interest of religion, as associated with other days not in a religious character and observance. This is mostly used in this discussion, but which is the most common name for the day. But the law apply to Saturday and not to Sunday but its meaning exists at every call of 1794 that assumes that it is wrong, in religious, statute, to pursue "worldly" affairs on Sunday the crucial point in the law is that it forbids certain things on Sunday which may be done on any other day without interfering with those who have a wrong or irreligious to do these on other days. If the law merely forbids us to do a wrong per se, but only wrong at a certain

specified time, which the law declares to be the "Lord's" time. To say that such a law does not enforce a religious duty, is to deny the plainest facts of history and the clearest meaning of words. Any intent to Sunday law its owe its origin from the penal law of Constantine in 321 A.D. which was immediately connected with the opening of the Columbian Exposition and is wholly, at least to be a holiday, from religious sentiments, and aim at preventing everything that is secular.

When the friends of Sunday wish to watch the claims of Saturday, the Sabbath, according to the Bible, they declare that it is not the Lord's day; that the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, does not appoint a specific day of the week, but "one day in seven." But whatever the force of any argument from the Sabbath against them.

This is the latest and most specious argument in favor of Sunday legislation. Grant this, not for fact, but for this argument, and Sunday has at once no claim, and Sunday has at once, not for fact, but for then does the law of Pennsylvania go to beyond the law of God; for that law, by the legislature of 1794, under the lead of Franklin McElree, had to be declared that all men in the commonwealth shall cease from labor, or face fine and imprisonment, in such work? No says James McLeese, with his form and politic and intolerable, coupled with hatred of Catholicism. How strangely ignorant a people may be in not knowing the difference between a Seventh-day Baptist who keeps Saturday, for higher religious grade than "Moses, the man of God." If the law of God appointing the Sabbath on any specific day, shall the State of Pennsylvania in the law of the constitution, which declared that "no preference shall be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship argues to determine when men may say the Bible forbids, by declaring that Sunday, a specific day, is the Sabbath? If that does not subject me to fines and imprisonment on upright citizens who do not regard Sunday as a Sabbath, we desire to retain this law why the Bible said, but what this whole iniquitous business has been—a movement to compel men intolerantly deny when they plead for the poor, and when the purpose of that law, to push Saturday out of sight, Pennsylvania has no such right as guaranteed by freedom to man in Sabbatizing on any day for man's sake. So far, then advocates of the Sunday sabbath have the advantage. Such arguments, invented, to ward off the charges of religious legislation are against all Sunday legislation.

But a stronger indictment remains.

The "First day of the Sabbath."

It assumes that Sunday is the Sabbath. Every man who has searched the Bible and has found that the seventh day is the real Sabbath against God who "denounces it." What ever the rest of 1791 may say about Sunday, every man who has looked into this matter knows that it is not the day. The Bible designates the "seventh day" as the Sabbath. That this means the seventh day of the week, Saturday, is shown by the fact that the Jews who received the law, so understood it; and their practice from that day to this, continued observance on Saturday is the monument to this day; and also the fact that Sunday, "the first day of the week," can be located only by its relation to Saturday, the seventh day of the week. There is not a word or hint in the Bible about the transferring of the Sabbath. The law to Sunday or the "change" of the Sabbath. The modern theory of such transfer as a gradual change in the practice finds no support in history until the English Reformation, and was then adopted to escape from the between the theory of the English

Seventh-day Baptists and that of the Roman Catholics. The "first day of the week" is mentioned but a few times in the New Testament. It is never spoken of as sacred, as the Sabbath, or as being in any way connected with religion as such. It is always in terms connected with Christ as regarding two events that happened to occur but once in the New Testament, which have been differently interpreted from what they mean by those who have refused to adhere to their original context, then and more before. There is no definite evidence of any change of the Sabbath day until one hundred and seventy years after Christ. In the face of such facts it is difficult to understand how men of this generation, who are supposed to be intelligent, forgiven in the men of one hundred years ago.

Sunday legislation. The statutory law, that the first day of the week is the Sabbath, in form and fact. It mentions the day by name. This is to establish religion in its worst form. It is legislative lying in form and fact. Christianity. Gradually it come under the domination of a corrupt form of Christianity. Gradually it come to be used and to establish a worldly religion. The term "Lord's day" does not appear except as it is used wrongly to designate Sunday. Valuable and important works, volumes, and Theological, and Sociology, and literature of the last century and this century deal with the truth concerning this subject, and literature with the Puritan Reformation, many of them showing the same recognition. The assumption which underlies the law of 1794 is false and its principle is wrong. It humanity demands its repeal.

In conclusion, to the Chairman, I earnestly and respectfully ask you to consider the following points:

(1) It is contrary to the fundamental principles of this Government.

(2) It was unjustly and unwisely enacted.

(3) It constitutes the fundamental, or sets the precedent of religious legislation.

(4) It has always wrought injustice to Seventh-day Baptists and other non-conformists.

(5) It is unjust toward those who do not believe that Sunday is the Sabbath, who are a majority of the citizens.

(6) It has always wrought injustice to those who believe that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that it is a day for religious observance, because so much must be done on Monday without thought of the Sabbath.

(7) It hinders the cause of genuine Sabbath reform by teaching men to rely on the civil law of the State instead of the moral law of God and the blessing of religion.

(7) It weakens and destroys conscience by punishing men for obeying God and resting on false claims, before the divine law.

Permit me also to repeat that, in asking for the repeal of the Sunday law of 1794, we ask help to create a sentiment against the evils which come with Sunday breaking and lax morals. To do this we need your help to create the conditions by which genuine and right principles against the abuse of the Sabbath, and against intemperance, gambling, impurity, rioting, and all forms of evil may be enacted and fostered. The repeal of this law, and the spread of a higher conception of Christianity and of the claims of God's Sabbath will best promote every good cause. I ask for a just and helpful law in place of an unjust law, and for a recognition of creed. This is not a question of sentiment, but of law, principle, and rights. It is a question of truth and facts, not and satisfaction, not of law, but of tradition; a question of principle, not of the personal caprice of opinion. That legislation best honors religion and the State which keeps the honored name of William Penn, which remembers that Civil law is only the measure of the principles of religious freedom to
