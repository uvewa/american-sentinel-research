THE various propositions to have Congress legislate affirmatively for the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday are just as vicious in principle as that which has prevailed to close the Fair. The different bills before the Pennsylvania legislature, in reference to the Sunday law of the State, to reduce the fine, and legalize certain forms of business, come within the same category.

CONGRESS had no right to decree, either directly or indirectly, that the World's Fair should be closed on a given day, in deference to the religious views of either a minority or a majority. It had no more right to say that it should be open in opposition to the religious practice or belief of either a minority or a majority. The only possible course for Congress in this matter, and have acted within the principles of justice and the Constitution, would have been strict neutrality.

THE same thing is true of legislatures. They have no more right to legislate affirmatively, in reference to any religious observance, than negatively. The measures introduced in the Pennsylvania legislature, to reduce the penalty affixed to the Sunday law of Allegheny County, and legalize the manufacture and sale of newspapers on Sunday, and the offering for sale of temperance drinks, etc., were just as uncalled for, and just as much beyond the proper legislative sphere as the original law of 1794 forbidding all labor, trade, and diversion, on Sunday. The right to make and sell newspapers, or to follow trade and labor in general, can not properly be restricted on Sunday for any reason which would not apply just as well on Wednesday; for as a matter of absolute right, all these are just as proper, and for that matter rightfully lawful, on Sunday as on other days, or on other days as on Sunday, whether the legislature bid or forbid. In this case the assumption of despotic right to prohibit, presumes the same despotic right of affirmative command, if that should be the legislative choice. In Russia, this assumption has reached the stage of practical experimental reality.

WHO will acknowledge that the legislature may rightfully command him to labor on Sunday under penalty of fine and imprisonment? Who will agree that the State may reasonably and rightfully decree that he shall rest on Wednesday, and abstain from all secular occupation? If the State may so decree as regards Wednesday, it may decree, if it so choose, that he must work on that day, or some other day, or all other days. Can it not be said that persistent and faithful labor by its citizens tends to the welfare of the State; it is a necessity for the support of the citizen himself; public policy therefore demands that the citizens should be required to labor? The State, therefore, having assumed the right, for the benefit of the State and the citizen, as a matter of public policy, a police regulation, to require the citizen to rest on Wednesday, may, if in its judgment changed social and economical or political conditions render it advisable, require him to work on Wednesday. The same reasoning from the same standpoint applies equally in either case; and is just as applicable to Sunday as to Wednesday.

THERE is no distinction, then, in principle between the affirmative and negative Sunday law; both are equally iniquitous. Neutrality is the only just course. It naturally follows, therefore, that the same thing which is true of the Sunday law is also true of its exemption. That is so. The exemption pre-supposes the right to enforce upon others that from which the privileged party is exempt. In all religious laws that is denied by the party exempted. There exists no right, in the first place, to make or enforce the law, consequently there can exist no right to exempt. The assumption of the right to exempt is a cumulative claim of the propriety of the original legislation and of State authority in the matter. It is, as it were, creating an exception, that it may more conclusively prove the rule. Especially is this seen when the fact is taken into consideration that all exemption clauses affixed to Sunday laws require the exempted class to strictly and conscientiously observe another day and be able to present such proof of this religious observance as shall satisfy the magistrate before whom they may be brought for violation of the Sunday law. The only apparent exception to this is in the enumerated list of acts which cover the statutory interpretation of "works of necessity and mercy." What is this but the same law applied to another day? There is a distinction in the days, but no difference in the requirement or the principle which is sought to be applied.

THERE has been introduced in the legislature of Tennessee a bill which reads thus:

An Act to prohibit interference with the Religious Rights or Liberties of Certain Classes of Persons:

Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee: That Section 2289, of Milliken & Vertree's compilation of the statute laws of the State of Tennessee, be and is hereby so amended as not to apply to persons known as Seventh-day Baptists, Adventists, or any other persons whose religious faith teaches them to conscientiously believe that another day than the one generally observed by the people of the State is the proper one authorized by God as a day of rest. Provided that their usual avocations shall not interfere in any manner with the peace, quiet, or proper rights of others, and provided further, that said persons shall observe one day in each week as a day of rest, as commanded in the Scriptures.

Section 2. Be it further enacted: That all laws or parts of laws in conflict with this act be and are hereby repealed.

Section 3. Be it further enacted: That this act take effect on and after this passage, the public welfare requiring it.

The impulse which has called out this measure is, in the highest degree, laudable, and a credit to the humanitarian feelings of the legislator who presented it, and of those who advocate its adoption. But the impulse, unfortunately, has not sound and logical legislative principles upon which to base its action. In the first place, from a legislative point of view purely civil, it would be a mistaken course. When a wrong is done by the enforcement of statutory law, the true course for the legislature to take is not to legislate for the relief of each particular case of hardship or wrong as it appears, but to apply the general principles which may meet and satisfy all cases. If the application of this principle, when found, abrogates the law entirely, it is conclusive proof that the whole law is vicious and should never have been placed upon the statute books. But a still more important element than one which may form a part of any strictly civil statute enters into this question. The whole matter is found to be a religious question, and therefore not a subject of civil legislation at all. If the law is a religious law, every exemption from its action, short of an entire repeal, would also be religious in character.

That Sunday laws are religious laws and intended for the enforcement of religion, has been so many times and so clearly shown, and is in itself so evident, that to rehearse the points which show it to be so is unnecessary. They are religious and nothing but religious. Exemption clauses attached to them will also be religious. Consider this exemption clause which has been quoted and see if it is not so in this case. Look first at the title to the act. Does it prohibit interference with the religious liberties and rights of any and all citizens? No! Only those of "certain classes of persons." Why not? Is it that the right to interfere with the religious liberties of certain other classes of persons is reserved? It certainly is. There is a sense in which it is a religious right to be non-religious; it surely is an inalienable right. The legislative privilege of coercing this class is reserved in this title when read with the body of the bill. Again, the right to coerce into the observance of Sunday those who make a profession of that form of religion, of which Sunday is the distinguishing mark, is reserved by this title and the bill itself, both by virtue of being an exemption clause and by virtue of the naming of certain particular classes within the clause.

Again, in the body of the bill, two religious denominations are specified, and a general expression attached covering all religionists who differ with the majority as to the observance of the first day of the week. The language includes all "whose religious faith teaches them to conscientiously believe that another day than the one generally observed by the people of the State is the proper one authorized by God as a day of rest." What is required here? That the exempted should be taught by a "religious faith" to believe "conscientiously" in another day "authorized by God." A conscientious belief which is the result of religious faith in the authority of God is certainly a religious belief,—and that this exemption clause requires. But not only does it require belief, and religious, conscientious belief, but it requires that the individual shall act according to that belief, and "observe one day in each week as a day of rest, as commanded in the Scriptures." An injunction to observe a religious form in accordance with the Scriptures can scarcely be anything else than a religious injunction. How clear it is that this exemption, and all exemptions, affixed to religious laws, are no less religious in intent and effect than the original statutes themselves.

Will not those hearts which have been warmed by this impulse of humanity, receive still farther the inspiration of courage to stand for the pure justice and right reason which must always accompany true religion undefiled, and ask unequivocally for the complete repeal of all religious legislation, without subterfuge, exception, or exemption?
