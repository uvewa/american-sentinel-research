California's Sunday-law effort in the present legislature has been checked in the advance in the form of a petition. The California House of Representatives of California, twenty one years of age and over, has been in receipt of a petition and a counter-petition. The House had before them a measure of petition and a memorandum as well as cases and notes and arguments on the merits of the said petitions. These were presented by the different persons interested and worked by those who religiously and regularly as in all such matters, feel it to be a work of pious necessity, have been active for years on the petition basis on the subject.

This history the best well known history of the American Sabbath Union. It was expected that the union's agents would take a strong pull at this session. Their years' previous campaigns in the State all the close of which they confidently predicted that arguments a Sunday law, has been their preparation for the present effort. There could be no mistake about this, and no doubt of their ability to educate the people of the State in the religious direction. The boast was that the union never had made a failure, and never could. But it now record one defeat in California. The Sunday law advocates did not stand half the chance at the session this year that it did two years ago; this time it was not even beaten with as an introduction. The attempt to call it out by petition had a prompt counter-petition upon its own echo. Yet Sunday fares as well without such laws as with them, and the bitter pill with the Sunday-law crimes is that they have now no opportunity to put their opponents in the chain gang.

The special mark of the Sabbath Union line is the religious requirement. They have always claimed that they only asked for a civil rest day, but their dictum that to refuse the day observance as they shall in the keeping of this day on the part of a majority is not a civil measure but that the move is a religious one, and its implementation must be administered by the power of civil law. They will, as always, deny this before the people, as well as intelligent and capable lawmakers, are not blind to the fact that the civil government has no legitimate business to interfere with the religious exercises of the people, either to enforce or restrain; therefore they have so far endeavored to choose the Sunday-law movement in a civil garb, with a sprinkling of solicitude for the physical well-being of the working

man. But the requirement that those who observe another day shall observe it "religiously" and "regularly" so, shows that such is the design for Sunday observance. The logical point is that man should be compelled to be religious at least one day in the week, and that the State is the proper authority to see that his duty is performed.

Should the legislature lend its aid to such a scheme? The proposition has two grooves of evil. First, it legislates on a purely religious question in a sectarian way, but which can only result in making many people "hypocrites." Secondly it takes the hands of bigots and fanatize a weapon with which they can persecute those who do not agree with them in the matter of time. Sabbath observably is an admittedly unlimited extant. And we know from experience of some other cities than that men men are not taking when the opportunity is presented.

And, every attempt has been made to oppose legislation of a religious character, and there has been defeat at the first success. The tendency already is for those to wed combined their influence in the way of ambitious churchmen and church work. And, surely, if the right to declare to any what man shall do religiously on any particular day of the week being in no reason why other and further demands of a similar character, under the same influence that should secure its passage.

It should be well understood that this is a question being agitated by Sunday-law men in nearly all the other States, and California does not escape the Sunday-culture action, and it is designed here to bring about just the same result,—a Sunday law,—that has already been enacted in these States. But it should be borne in mind that the American Sabbath Union is a New York corporation organized for the very purpose of encouraging, strengthening enforcement of State Sunday laws, and making those laws more active and start in their persecution. And to this end a part of their programme is to secure the passage of a national Sunday law. So that the general Government will not lie to be used as a means to enforce their State laws.

And our legislators should be reminded that a California Sunday law is a promised factor in the demand for a national law. And this is why the agents of the American Sabbath Union California is avowed as no similarity working toward a State law. California's stands almost alone as a State having no Sunday law, and hence is a barrier to the design of the Union. If the latter can obtain the consent of a unanimity of the States on the Sunday-rest question. Their opportunities for the Union of securing something, to be or ever so mild at present, that can be called a Sunday law. But when the matter is once presented in the law, then, according to the programmes, will ensue a general stiffening on the part of the Sabbath Union toward compulsory church observance. The California legislature should think twice before allowing it to be a sinister weapon against the rights and liberties of the people.—*San Francisco Freddy Reporter.*

When argument takes the place of right landing has victory of right's reply in pillars will dawn, for epithets may be hurled by any one, but sound argument is possible only on the side of the right.—*Freddy Reporter.*
