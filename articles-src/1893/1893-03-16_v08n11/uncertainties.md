# Uncertainties — v08n11 (1893-03-16)

## Masthead / Editor Names

The OCR reads "ANDOCLATE EDITORS, CALVIN P. BULLMAN, WILLIAM N. BURKE." for the associate editors line. This is clearly an OCR error. Known associate editors for this period are C. P. Bollman and W. H. McKee (or W. N. Glenn). The masthead has been rendered as "ASSOCIATE EDITORS, CALVIN P. BOLLMAN, WILLIAM N. BURKE." — however "WILLIAM N. BURKE" is suspect; this may be W. H. McKee or W. N. Glenn. Since article 03 is signed "W. H. M." (matching W. H. McKee) and he is a known associate editor, "WILLIAM N. BURKE" is likely an OCR misread of a different name. The masthead text has been preserved as OCR'd but flagged here. Confidence: LOW for the second associate editor's name.

## Article 03 — "The Inaugural of the National Religion"

Page 4, within the petition text, the OCR reads: "Therefore, believing in permit the holding of such concerts on Sunday..." — this passage is clearly corrupted OCR. The original likely read something like "Therefore, believing that to permit the holding of such concerts on Sunday..." The text has been transcribed as OCR'd without correction, per accuracy rules, and flagged here. Confidence: LOW.

Page 4, Secretary Noble's letter reads: "I shall, in inform you, make in granting the use of this building..." — clearly a corrupted OCR passage. The original letter likely read something like "I shall inform you that in granting the use of this building..." Transcribed as OCR'd. Confidence: LOW.

Page 4, Inaugural Committee resolution: "One as to o'clock a. m." — OCR corruption, likely "One at 10 o'clock a. m." or similar. Transcribed as OCR'd. Confidence: LOW.

## Article 02 — "The Limits of Legitimate Religious Discussion"

Page 3, OCR reads "And how Sippanity, oftentimes, is the question of their obligation discussed!" — this is clearly an OCR error. The word "Sippanity" should almost certainly be "flippantly." Corrected to "flippantly" in the transcription. Confidence: HIGH for correction.

## Page 7 — Advertisements

Page 7 contains extensive watch and health food advertisements (American Watch and Chain; Health Food/Battle Creek Bakery Co.; Pocket Speller; Abiding Sabbath book advertisement). These have been skipped as boilerplate advertisements and subscription information, per workflow instructions.

## Page 8 — Arena Notice

A brief notice about the Arena magazine and its contents (Dr. Alfred Wallace, Louis R. Ehrich, etc.) was not given its own article file as it contains no substantive religious liberty argument and functions as a promotional notice for a periodical.

## Article 04 — "What?" Attribution

This letter from L. L. Goodwin of Mayston, Tenn. includes an editorial bracketed note at the top. Attribution set to "reprint" with original_publication noting the letter source. The editorial note in brackets is included inline per the original.
