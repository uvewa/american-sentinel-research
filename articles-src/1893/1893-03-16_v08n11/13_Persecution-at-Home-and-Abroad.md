IN Brazil, a Methodist missionary has been sentenced to four months' imprisonment for publishing a book derogatory to Roman Catholicism. The Methodist Conference lately in session, appointed a committee to confer with President Cleveland in reference to the matter and seek, if possible, his interference in behalf of the persecuted missionary. There is imprisonment and persecution because of opposition to papal methods within our own boundaries. Why is not that also a proper subject for Executive interference? Have the Methodists considered the advisability of consulting with the President as to the religious persecutions at home?

If the Methodist Conference has not noticed the persecutions in Tennessee and elsewhere, and has failed to take any measures for their suppression, what is the reason? It is because in Tennessee and other States where there have been fines and imprisonment for conscience' sake, the Methodists and other Protestants have not been the persecuted, but have been themselves the persecuting power. What is the consistency in their asking the President to interfere, when what is done to them in Brazil is no different from what they are doing to others at home. Would President Cleveland be justified in quoting to Bishop Newman his own words with which he accepted a place on the committee to call upon the President, and prove their applicability by referring him to an injunction which reads, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them"?
