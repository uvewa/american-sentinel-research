That tract toward religious legislation, or rather toward a restriction of what is popularly known as religious liberty, is moving slowly, plainly; or rather perhaps steadily, toward the desired end. Bishop Coleman, S. T. D., LL. D., Bishop of Delaware, in an article recently published, the North American Review for January, than by any other writer who has yet given his views on this subject to the public through the medium of the press.

The bishop's first proposition is that "there is a discussion, styled religious which is not legitimate." He describes it thus:—

It is not a rude or a call in question the fundamental truth of Christianity; that is to set one's self apart as dangerous to their uncouth. in proper arguments.

Admitting the necessity of defining the religion, Bishop Coleman proceeds:—

My own view of the religion shall be confined to set expression of opinion in matters of belief religion at most, not national, and which in adherence may not the fundamental law of this Government be designed to set to prevent or discourage "sin." It has nothing to say and its legislative enactment only such as by law it's concern with their consciences may dictate. Anybody who believes and does what the Government of the Republic to stop other people from doing.

I quite understand, however, that to confine religious discussion to that which the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution grants or even the Supreme, leaves or is not original with the bishop. It is, however, the fundamental law of a great Nation. That that the framers of that amendment intended to prohibit anything which amounts to religion, or any other form of religion, in this country, by the civil law, and to protect not except the inherently bigoted or the bond ignorantly, can honestly deny this position is absurd.

Continuing, Bishop Coleman says:—

In further support of the contention that Christianity has as an established religion no legal basis that there is no established existence and practice of all classes, from the first days of our political institutions,

The bishop then cites Chancellor Kent of New York, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in support of the proposition that in this country Christianity is part and parcel of the law.

So, then, I repeat that a discussion which would undermine the existence of what is our most essential principles of Christianity is, so far as that discussion is religion, illegitimate and intolerable.

When a citizen essays to bring into court affairs, when he through a lawyer or by himself, goes before a court to defend what he believes to be his rights, or to claim the benefit of the law,—to have his side heard,—and that citizen is a regular trader, and is liable to arrest and punishment for his honest business, it is well to bring into contempt the institutions and forms of "Christianity." And especially when the institutions and forms are put in issue, the ability of an argument over some area of religion and reason, which must always accompany true religion undivided, and ask unimpartially only the complete repeal of all religious legislation, without subterfuge, equivocation, or evasion,—is it "illegitimate?"

as long as the world in which we live. There is a wide difference between discussing or denial, by way of discussion, of the existence of God and the discussion of religion as a part of the civil law.

Anybody in more opposition to me than the bishop, could say this of the legal standing of Christianity in this country, than what the bishop himself says. And this is the risk that is run in advocating the theory of Christianity as a basis for civil law. Its friends, themselves, always admit and maintain that, in law, Christianity is a pale and colorless thing; that in a time of its trial faith in one institution can not be separated from faith in all others.

But how much is involved in the proposition quoted from Bishop Coleman. A reader of this page may have said already, in substance: "Here is a man who wants religion to be crystallized into law, or what is the same thing, wants the law not only to protect, but to establish religion; and as to court decision, freedom of speech, and all the rest,—that argument is dead, because it is a mere reflection of the bias of the past. The more utterance of such sentiments is a menace, for Christianity is established in no country." Let us therefore exercise special care in tracing in many of our States to give this form of law to every religious claim laid down by the bishop. He himself admits the weakness of his own proposition.

It may suffice to address one or two sentences particularly to those who differ from the bishop. There are those who recognize that the people of this State, in common with the people of all the other States, have a right to protect their rights under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, a right to be protected in its civil guaranty of common immunity from any and forced judicial cognizance of those offenses which, while they do exist, are not offenses against any law of the land, either human or divine, or any form of government, but are punishable because they violate a religious institution. There are those who believe—and how can it be denied if the Constitution is not a delusion—that its very substance is in breaking down the common law religious test and that, if possible, to base our Government upon Christianity itself, would be an exercise of unconstitutional power. To prove that it would not be so, the advocates of such a course have stated that "even if Christianity were not a part of the law of the land, it is against the common law to blaspheme or revile it." But blasphemy would be "tending to disturb the public peace," adding that no purpose the common law attaches to such proceedings.

Having this fortified himself in the proposition that "any discussion which questions the fundamental truths" of Christianity is outside the pale of "legitimate" religious discussion, the bishop ventures to adopt some of the "fundamental truths" of Christianity:—

None is more dimmed by our daily practice and experience than the plain duty of the bishop's assertion of his belief in his personality in the regular forms of legal expression of the religion of this country.

More refuse to acknowledge its divinity, while some are careless in preserving its text.

The character of Christ alone himself out of this fundamental feature of our religion, namely the Church, that which primarily sustain it the religion of the commonwealth, however it has its character, out and beyond.

Just how far-reaching the bishop would make this go, is shown by his references to the virtue of an article which, while professing Christianity, and a woman smack but professing Christianity, and a woman smock but professing

This shows that not only would the bishop invoke the civil law to suppress the grosser assaults upon religion calculated

to provoke breaches of the peace, but that he would prohibit all discussion that involves a denial of the fundamental principles of Christianity, no matter how elevated its tone from a literary standpoint. This would involve a religious censorship of the entire press of the country, and utterly destroy all freedom of religious discussion. Discussion could not go beyond the four corners of the Bible, and then it must always be on the side of the recognition of Christ's divinity nor of the claims of the divine law as recognized by the civil law. The bishop says:—

And this because I would not only be a believer the demands of His nature and his character; but also in the obligation of all the forms of religion. I make particular reference to the two great sacraments of the Christian faith. That there are in this country people who deny these were unquestionably established by Christ himself. These people being in these United States with us are within the pale of our national religion.

I am quite prepared to submit that there are some things in American life which indicate that we have distinctly decreased, e. g. the mode of baptism; is the last twenty-five years in the United States. It is one of the fundamental truths of Christianity, moreover, by argument or by practice shows disrespect for baptism, is beyond the legitimate limit of reason. It is not an open question. In fact, it has been settled and reduced to a legal question, and it is not appropriate to come in and open a case in those are who own reflections have dared to venture.

I have used the bishop's language as a discussion of the mode of baptism! If the assertion of the religious view that the majority had a right to forbid the denial of the *essentials* of any baptism at all, would not the same majority have an equal right to forbid a denial of the necessity of a particular mode of administration of the ordinance? It certainly would have just the same right in the one case as in the other. But while majority rule is wrong; no such legitimate authority resides in any majority, however large.

The practical bearing of this anti-liberal ideal will ever be realized so far as baptism and other institutions are concerned, it is more than a possibility that it will; but the principle has had a practical application, and has had for years, in the most natural development in the United States to-day. Almost every State has its Sabbath laws requiring the recognition of one day of the week as sacred to rest and worship. Sunday is always specified, but in most States observers of the seventh day are exempt, that is, those who observe the first day of the week. That is, recognition of one sacred day is always enforced. The individual may be permitted to dissent from the majority as to the particular day to be observed, but they must not in practice deny the divine authority upon which the Sabbath institution rests, nor must they challenge the right of the State to enforce the observance of a day as sacred time. Such has in the past been the status of this question before the American people. Now people are coming to regard a practical denial of the sacredness of Sunday, as observed by the majority as destructive of social order, and so to be prohibited by law. Any practical disregard of Sunday is, to use the bishop's expression, coming to be regarded as "beyond the legitimate limits of religious discussion," and as "treasonable to the King of kings," and consequently to the State, and so to be prohibited.

The bishop's views may be regarded as extreme, but it is certain that whenever he applies his principles to questions of which

the law has thus far taken only a very limited cognizance. Precisely the same argument in principle is made every day in regard to Sunday, and but for few people, comparatively, see the evil there of. The bishop attempts to justify his position on the ground that to assail the principles of Christianity, "distemper the disruption of the very bonds of society." The Sunday law advocate attempts to furnish a "civil" basis and justification for Sunday legislation. The principle is the same, and the argument is as good in the one case as in the other. Shall not Bishop Coleman's article serve to open the eyes of some who ought to have seen this before, that religion is religion, and that to the real issues involved in the question of religious legislation?
