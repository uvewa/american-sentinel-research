THE act of Congress by which it has closed the World's Fair on Sunday has already been used as a precedent for further proceedings by Government officials, in the same line, and also to remind the administration just entering upon its duties that a new factor has entered into governmental affairs, the influence of which must be acknowledged in official life. One paragraph of the ministers' petition to Congress, respecting the forbidding of the Sunday concerts in connection with the inauguration, reads thus:—

WHEREAS, the Congress of the United States, in deference to the Christian sentiment of the Nation clearly and unmistakably expressed by the religious press, the pulpit, and by petition, has by legal enactment closed the doors of the Columbian Exposition on Sundays.

Therefore, of course, because of this now well established precedent, Congress must permit nothing which would be inconsistent with that, and the official course of the Government and its representatives must conform to the requirements of the national religion, otherwise the country will be under condemnation of "national sin." The strange arrogance of the clergy in these matters is shown in a report of the proceedings of the Baltimore Conference of Methodists, where, after appointing a committee to wait upon President Cleveland in reference to the imprisonment of a Methodist missionary in Brazil, this paragraph is found:—

It was suggested that Bishop Newman be also made a member of the committee, and the bishop gracefully accepted the trust, remarking: "I will gladly call on President Cleveland, because he has been converted and is now a member of the Church. His inaugural address breathed the spirit of piety. He is a Christian man. On two occasions I had to rebuke a President of the United States because in his annual messages the name of God did not appear. He seemed astonished, but I told him I was the ambassader of the King of kings, and he was rebuked. Grover Cleveland needs no such rebuke."

This is the tone of the prelates of old,—mingled flattery and authority.
