MATTHEW QUAY, the patron saint of the congressional and Pennsylvania Sunday, has succeeded quite remarkably in throwing about himself—in the closing days of the Fifty-second Congress, and the Harrison administration—a far-shining halo of governmental religion. In fact so intense are those rays, and so well directed as to light the face of the incoming administration with its ghostly lustre. It was a stroke of political genius to involve the new President in the religious toils ere yet his foot had touched the threshold of the White House. The committee having in charge the planning of the inauguration festivities had decided upon entertaining the crowd necessarily remaining over Sunday with concerts by the Marine Band, in the Pension Building. With reference to those concerts the Congressional Record has the following in its report of the proceedings of the Senate, Tuesday, February 28.

Mr. QUAY.—I present a petition of sixty clergymen of the city of Washington, which I ask to have read.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT.—The petition will be read if there be no objection.

THE CHIEF CLERK.—The petition is as follows:—

To the President of the United States, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled:

A PETITION.

WHEREAS, It having been announced by the inaugural committee through the daily papers that, as a part of the programme for the inaugural ceremonies, three concerts by the Marine Band are to be held at the Pension Office building, on Sunday, March 8, proximo; and—

WHEREAS, the Congress of the United States, in deference to the Christian sentiment of the Nation clearly and unmistakably expressed by the religious press, the pulpit, and by petition, has by legal enactment closed the doors of the Columbus Exposition on Sunday:

Therefore, believing in permit the holding of such concerts on Sunday by a band of musicians connected with one of the great departments of the Government, in a Government building which is occupied by another great department, and as a part of the ceremonies connected with the inauguration of the President of this great Christian Nation, by and with the sanction of our closest rulers, would be a national site, believing also that such desecration as proposed in unprecedented, small result in incalculable harm, and would be used as an authority and example for the complete secularization of Sunday.

We earnestly petition that orders be issued forbidding the use of any Government building for such purpose on that day.

Signed by said Chairman, pastor of Congress Street Bethesda Protestant Church; W. Sherman Phillips, pastor of M. C. C. Church; and W. S. Robinson, B. C. C. Church, 1893.

Price of ball tickets, $3.

Price of concert in morning and afternoon of Sunday and Monday, 26 cents.

Price of evening concert Sunday and Monday, $1.

Programmes have not yet been issued.

Mr. QUAY.—In view of these facts, although not exactly in order at this time, I ask for the adoption of the resolution which I send to the desk.

MR. McPHERSON.—Before the Senator offers his resolution I should like to inquire what the paper relates to which has just been read by the Secretary. I could not understand from the language whether it is a petition from our own people or from citizens of a foreign government. I was unable to ascertain from the reading what language it is printed in. I should like to know to what the whole matter relates.

MR. QUAY.—The whole matter relates to the question whether the persons in charge of the inaugural ceremonies have by lawful means obtained the Pension building for the purpose of holding musical concerts there next Sunday. That is the allegation of the petition which has been read and which is signed by, I believe, sixty ministers of the city of Washington. I ask for the immediate consideration of the resolution.

The resolution was considered by unanimous consent, and agreed to as follows:—

Resolved, that the Secretary of the Interior be requested to inform the Senate whether authority has been given for the use of the building of the Pension Office by any person or persons on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, for musical concerts at which a pecuniary charge is made for admission.

The result of this "wise statemanship" of Mr. Quay and the Senate is told thus by the Washington Post of March 2.

There will be no sacred concerts at the Pension Office on next Sunday as originally intended. Owing to the refusal of the Secretary of the Interior to permit the use of the building for the purpose and for other causes, the idea has been abandoned.

The Secretary of the Interior received the following telegram yesterday from the President-elect:—

Lakewood, N. J., March 1, 1893.

To the Secretary of the Interior.

I am strongly opposed to the use of the Pension Building for a Sunday concert on the 5th instant, and object to regarding such a thing as a feature of the inauguration.

GROVER CLEVELAND.

Secretary Noble immediately sent the following reply to Mr. Cleveland:—

Washington, D. C., March 1, 1893.

Hon. Grover Cleveland; Lakewood, N. J.

Your telegram received. Orders were issued already for holding the use of the Pension Building on Sunday, and I am gratified that this action is in accordance with your wishes.

JOHN W. NOBLE, Secretary.

Before the telegram from Mr. Cleveland had been received Secretary Noble had forwarded the following communication to the chairman of the inaugural committee:—

Department of the Interior.

Washington, D. C., March 1, 1893.

Col. JAMES G. BERRET, Chairman Inaugural Committee. Present.

Sir: My attention has been called to the fact that it is the purpose of the Inaugural Committee to open the Pension Building on Sunday, the 5th instant, for one or more musical entertainment, at which a charge for admission will be made. I shall, in inform you, make in granting the use of this building for the inaugural ball, it was not contemplated that the building would be open to the public on Sunday, and, as if any, will be opportunity on the subsequent day, during which the building is at the disposal of the committee, to give the concerts referred to, the use of the Pension Building on Sunday for that purpose will not be permitted.

Very respectfully,

JOHN W. NOBLE, Secretary.

The correspondence upon the subject concludes with the following additional note to Mr. Berret:—

Department of the Interior.

Washington, D. C., March 1, 1893.

Col. JAMES G. BERRET, Chairman Inaugural Committee. Present.

Sir: Since my letter to you of this date, relative to the use of the Pension Office building for a musical entertainment on Sunday next, I have received a telegram from Mr. Cleveland, of which I enclose a copy, expressing his strong opposition to the use of the building for the inaugural ball, which is objecting to such a concert as a feature of the inauguration. I also inclose for your information a copy of my reply thereto.

Very respectfully,

JOHN W. NOBLE, Secretary.

Last evening at the meeting of the Inaugural Executive Committee, the subject was discussed at length, and the following resolution was unanimously adopted:—

Whereas there seems to be somewhat of a sentiment against that part of the programme unanimously recommended by the promenade concert committee which included sacred concerts at the Pension Building on Sunday, March 9, and—

Whereas this committee in its representative capacity desires to eliminate any feature which might be misconstrued, or which would be objectionable to any and all religious sentiment. Therefore he it—

Resolved, That the Pension Building shall be closed on Sunday, March 9, and that in lieu of such concerts there shall be three concerts given on Tuesday, following those of Monday, the above. One as to o'clock a. m. and the other as the afternoon or orphans and their worthy attendants to be admitted free; a second at 3 p. m., admission fifty cents, and a third at 6 o'clock p. m., dancing to begin at 9.30, and the admission at the last concert to be one dollar.

While the resolution was adopted without a dissenting vote, the members of the committee were a unit in protesting against the causes which occasioned such action. The matter was first brought up by Major W. Cranch McIntire, who offered the resolution, and explained the reasons for his course. He said that he heard, early yesterday morning, that certain influences had been brought to bear on the Secretary of the Interior to urge the latter to prohibit the use of the Pension Building for Sunday concerts. He went to the District authorities, procured permits for the same, and then saw the Secretary of the Interior. The latter stated he had already issued orders prohibiting Sunday concerts, and nothing could change his determination. Major McIntire further stated that there were a number of clergymen who had been instrumental in causing such action being taken by the Secretary.

M. I. Weller, Lawrence Gardner, James L. Barbour, C. C. Lancaster, and John Joy Edson, all spoke on the subject, the consensus of their remarks being that the action of the Secretary of the Interior was due to the representations of the clergymen.

Chairman Norris made an explanation of the whole matter to the effect that the resolution was necessary when all things were considered. He said that about three weeks ago he received intimation that there were a number of clergymen who were agitating an opposition to the Sunday concerts. He sent word to these clergymen and asked that they confer with the Executive Committee on the subject, but that the invitation was not accepted. Instead, they continued their opposition, and the only thing to do under the circumstances was to abandon the project. Mr. Norris referred to the fact that a telegram had been sent to Mr. Cleveland protesting against concerts on Sunday which did not specify that the music was to be of a sacred character.

Professor Fanciulli was present at the meeting, and he was asked to explain what he knew of the matter. The professor stated that yesterday morning he was notified by the colonel commandant to furnish the latter with the prepared programmes for the Sunday concerts. It was stated during the meeting that the Secretary of the Navy had been induced to enjoin the Marine Band from playing at the sacred concerts; but Professor Fanciulli knew nothing of such an order. During the discussion the query was raised as to whether the Marine Band would be permitted to give its proposed sacred concert next Sunday evening at Alhaugh's Opera House, but no satisfactory answer could be obtained.

Major McIntire recalled that, during the occasion of the national drill, some years ago, Rev. Dr. Talmage spoke at the White Lot on a Sunday, and there was a band in attendance, and an admission he was charged. A fence was erected about the place at the time, and no objection was raised.

Mr. R. O. Holtzman called attention to the fact that the failure to give the three concerts on Sunday would possibly result in a loss of about ten thousand dollars to the poor of the District, and that the protesting clergymen would be responsible for the same.

As is well known, whatever surplus is derived from the inaugural ball and concerts over the expenses of the inaugural ceremonies is devoted to charitable purposes, and the postponement of the concerts from Sunday to Tuesday will result in a loss, as the great bulk of visitors will have left by Monday night.

Every member of the committee keenly felt the position in which they were placed and did not hesitate to express their indignation at the course pursued by the clergymen. The fact that the concerts would have been an attraction for thousands of visitors who will otherwise spend the day in idleness or worse was commented on, and the ministers were criticized for their interference at such a hour.

The influence which was brought to bear upon President Cleveland is shown by this telegram addressed to him at Lakewood, and which drew from him the communication to Secretary Noble quoted above.

GROVER CLEVELAND, Lakewood, N. J.

Expressed Christian sentiment in city opposed to proposed use of Pension Building next Sunday for concert. Can you aid in closing? (signed.)

A. W. FITZER.

President of Evangelical Alliance.

It is evident that the power behind the presidential chair has but to speak and it is done.

Of Secretary John W. Noble, who thus ran before the incoming President in haste to appropriate to himself the honor of the enforcement of national religion at this time, the Mail and Express, of March 4, most unkindly says:—

He lost his religion at the beginning of the Harrison administration, as he explains it, by giving an Easter dinner, as had been his habit in St. Louis. The Chief Justice of the United States was there, and one or two of his colleagues in the Cabinet, and other great functionaries.

The emblems around the dining-room were appropriate for the resurrection of our Lord. But the day was Sunday. So some ministers in New Jersey notified him that he was to be censured for giving a public dinner on Sunday.

But he wrote them that he did not think much of their opinion, anyway; for he did not expect to go to heaven via New Jersey! Still, he discontinued his Sunday public dinners. "And now," said the Secretary of the Interior, "I have gotten my religion again, and am all right. I stopped the proposed Sunday concert to be given in honor of President Cleveland to-morrow in the Pension Building; and the Maryland Conference of Ministers have passed resolutions that I am all right. That settles it."

The whole matter is justly characterized by the New York World thus:—

The whole thing is foldered, cant, hypocrisy and an impertinent interference with the rights of those who wish to make music or to listen to it.

Moreover, in this country the Government is not set to prevent or discourage "sin." It has nothing to do with religious doctrine one way or the other. It has no concern with Sabbaths or holy days, except to protect all men equally in their right to observe such days as they please in such ways as their consciences may dictate. Anybody who thinks it wrong to listen to a concert on Sunday may stay away. But he has no right to ask the Government of the Republic to stop other people from attending because of his puritanical notions.

Of Matthew Quay, the political henchman of these false religionists, the World does not hesitate to say:—

Those Washington clergymen who are aghast at the sinfulness of permitting the Marine Band to give a concert Sunday seem strangely deficient in the sense of humor. For their mouth piece, chosen to utter their protest against this "national sin" of music on Sunday, they selected Matthew Stanley Quay, a notorious political corruptionist, and a man who a few years ago embezzled nearly half a million dollars from the treasury of his State, and by virtue of the statutes of limitation has escaped the punishment which might have brought repentance for his "sin."

It was one of the dramatic unities, quite unexpected, and so all the more striking, that the first inauguration, after the congressional adoption of the national religion of the United States, should witness in public connection with it the "inaugural" also of the governmental religion.
