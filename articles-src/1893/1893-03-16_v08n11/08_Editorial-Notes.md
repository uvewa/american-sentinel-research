THE appearance of Rev. A. H. Lewis, of the Seventh-day Baptists, before the Judiciary Committee of the legislature of Pennsylvania, in defense of true religion and sound legislation was but the one voice against the many; it had nothing but the truth is a host, and he who speaks it needs not the support of numbers. If the principles which Dr. Lewis presented do not prevail in the minds of his listeners it will be because they are fully set in their own minds to believe a lie and do the evil thing to which it prompts them. Attention is called to the interesting history recorded in the committee by Dr. Lewis, and to the force and soundness of thought shown in the synopsis of his interesting printed elsewhere.

In a letter to the editor of the *Mail and Express* denying that she has experienced any change of opinion in reference to the principle legislature in general, and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by act of Congress, in particular, Miss Frances Willard says:—

When the exercise of Christianity combine, the suffrage and prohibition movements as they do in the White Ribboners to be more conservative than the general public in respect to new lines of thought.

By this we are to understand that those who oppose the Sunday closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, opposed the popular side of the question, and Miss Willard and the editor of the *Mail and Express* are on the unpopular side. The side advocated by forty or fifty million must be the popular side. Is it possible that the majority in this country are on the unpopular side? Is it possible that there could have been a mistake in the figures? There is a discrepancy somewhere. One is forced to believe Miss Willard and accept her statement as truth. There were no forty or fifty millions advocating Sunday closing. Miss Willard is on the side of the minority, and the unpopular and not the popular which has triumphed.

The *Brooklyn Eagle,* in an editorial item in reference to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and the possible action of the management in the direction of non-consequence, of the appropriation with the proviso attached, says, "Even if the managers are convinced that the majority is for opening, they may hesi-

tate to offend a powerful minority. This is a true statement of the legislative history of the whole matter of Sunday closing, hesitation to offend a powerful minority."

The act of Congress by which it has closed the World's Fair on Sunday has already been used as a precedent for further proceedings by Government officials, in the same lines and also to restrain the administration just entering upon its duties that a new factor has entered into administrative affairs, the influence of which must be acknowledged in official management. One paragraph of the memorial petition to Congress, respecting the forbidding of the Sunday concert in connection with the inauguration, reads thus:—

Believing that the holding of a civil celebration on the Sabbath day would be a violation of the Fourth Commandment, and that the official endorsement of the Sabbath to the Christian sentiment of the Nation upon, the pulpit and yet to profess, has by official sanction closed the doors of the Columbian pavilion on Sundays.

Thereupon, of course, because of this new well established precedent, Congress must permit nothing which would be inconsistent with that, and the official course of the Government and its representatives must conform to the requirements of the national religion, otherwise the country will be under condemnation of "national sin." The strange arrogance of this clergy in these matters is shown in a report of the proceedings of the Baltimore Conference of Methodists, where, upon appointing a committee to wait upon the President of the United States concerning the improprieties of a Methodist missionary in Brazil, this paragraph is found:—

It was suggested that Bishop Bowman be also made a member of the committee, and the bishop gracefully accepted the trust, remarking: "I will go to the President of the United States. I have been converted and is now a member of the Church. I was invited him and he accepted."

Of Secretary Foster, the bishop says, "He is a Christian man. On two occasions I had to call him down for being a little naughty." Two of his secretaries, he said, accepted and returned the note or letters but one of the did not accept. The second to think I told the first that he as the ambassador of the King of kings, and he was correct. General Sheridan had something to say.

This is the form of the prelates of old,—political flattery and untimely zeal.

In Brazil, a Methodist missionary has been entrusted to four months' imprisonment for publishing a book derogatory to Roman Catholicism. The Protestant Conference lately in session, appointed a committee to confer with President Cleveland in reference to the matter and seek, if possible, his interference in behalf of the persecuted missionary. There is imprisonment and persecution, because of opposition to papal methods within our own boundaries. Why is not that also proper subject for Executive interference? Even the Methodist conference that all the visibility of consulting with the President as to the religious persecutions abroad.

If the Methodist Conference has not noticed the persecutions in Tennessee and

elsewhere, and has failed to take any measures for their suppression, what is the reason? It is because in Tennessee and other States where there have been fines and imprisonment for conscience' sake, the Methodists and other Protestants have not interfered, but have in many cases been themselves the persecuting power. What is the consistency in their asking the President to interfere, when what is done to them in Brazil is no different from what they say to others here, which is wrong? Would President Cleveland be justified in quoting to Bishop Newman his own words with which he accepted a place on the committee to call upon the President, and prove their guilty by reference to them by him in any place in this country? Never, never; to weald that men should do to you, do ye even so to them?"

An editorial writer in the *Sabbath Recorder,* of March 2, speaking of the Roman Catholic influence in this country and of the teaching of religion in the public schools and the union of Church and State, says:

We are not now introducing that dangerous form of discrimination which Europe has demanded and its great nations practiced for one hundred years.

Does not the facts of an organized ministry, is still within that of a State or religious institution. And do not the Sunday-law agitation, and its prosecution of dissidents and those who refuse to observe the popular institution, present its most prominent form?

That the application of the principles of Sunday-closing by congressional and senate enactments, authority is very easily verified is shown by the Sunday-closing appropriation. In connection with this fact President Cleveland, the official result and correspondence in regard to which is republished to another page:

In this connection the past three years the *Arena* has published about one hundred papers upon these and kindred subjects, besides accounts largely for the fact that there should be scores of men and women among thoughtful women in America. But perhaps the most startling of these papers were contributed by eminent American thinkers, among them Bishop A. Cleveland Coxe, D. D.; Prof. Thomas E. Will, of Kansas; Rabbi Solomon Schindler, D. D.; Mrs. Alice B. Emery; Prof. R. S. Heath, D. D., of Bangor; and others. Among them it may be said a Voice, or Social Conditions in Brazil."—Shakespeare; "In Louis Kossuth," Vol. II.; "Shakespeare; "In Louis Kossuth's Own Hand;"—Rev. E. P. E.; and a well-written paper on the "Money Power and the People." All these papers should be of interest.

The *Arena* continues to be brave, progressive, and helpful. And it has advanced thought on social, educational, ethical and religious subjects.
