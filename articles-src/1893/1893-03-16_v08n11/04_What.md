[*It is not surprising that this Tennessee correspondent should be so astonished at the action of the last Congress in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair as to break out into this rhapsody of amusement. But there are still more amazing things already in progress and yet to come. Let him and every one watch the progress of events, and take at every step a definite stand for the right and against the wrong.*]

I can imagine how a man could be bribed with a dollar or two to vote for a man he had intended to vote for. Also how by the use of a dozen dollars or so, a man in a tight place might be bribed to vote for a man he had not intended to vote for.

I can imagine how by the use of a few hundred dollars, a mean man might be bribed to burn another man's stacks or barn; or for a few thousand dollars, a mighty mean man might be bribed to murder a fellow-man.

But what tremendous crime requires the enormous bribe of $3,500,000? Is it possible that noble, honorable men would offer such a bribe as that? Is it possible that noble, honorable men could be bribed into a crime commensurate with such a huge appropriation?

Behold the Congress of the United States bribing the management of the Columbian Exposition into an actual union of Church and State!!

Behold the acceptance of the bribe by the management, and its enforcement of the contract!!

Indeed justice has fled from the haunts of men. For shame! For shame!! For shame!!!

L. L. GOODWIN.

Mayston, Tenn.
