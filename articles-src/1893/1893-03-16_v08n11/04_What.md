IT is not surprising that this Tennessee controversy, when it is not brought to the World's Fair to be cast out into the shrapnel of the political mill, seems to be a political football kicked this way and that by everybody, and every one witch the progress of events, and the religious aspects of the question, to suit against the wrong.

I can't imagine how a man could be bribed with a dollar or two to vote for a man as he had intended to vote for. Also how by the use of a dollar dollars or so, a man is a tight place could be led to vote for a man he had not intended to vote for.

I can imagine how by the use of a few hundred dollars, a man man might be bribed to form some man's make or learn; or for a few thousand dollars, a greedy man might even might be bribed to follow a fellow-man.

But what tremendous crime requires what tremendous bribe, to suffice to persuade that noble, honorable men could be bribed to action, commensurate and fully explained in the following language of the bribe by a proposition.

What Congress of the United States bribing the management of the Columbia Exposition and the enforcement of Sunday closing? Why, the management of the bribe by the management, and its enforcement of a command of God, upon a mass of men. For shame! For shame!! For shame!!!
