THE appearance of Rev. A. H. Lewis, of the Seventh-day Baptists, before the Judiciary Committee of the legislature of Pennsylvania, in defense of true religion and sound legislation was but the one voice against the many at that hearing; but the truth is a host, and he who speaks it needs not the support of numbers. If the principles which Dr. Lewis presented do not prevail in the minds of his listeners it will be because they are fully set in their own minds to believe a lie and do the evil thing to which it prompts them. Attention is called to the interesting history recounted to the committee by Dr. Lewis, and to the force and soundness of thought shown in the synopsis of his remarks printed elsewhere.
