The trend toward religious legislation, or rather toward a restriction of what is popularly known as religious liberty, is shown more plainly, or rather avowed more openly, by the Right Rev. Leighton Coleman, S. T. D., LL. D., Bishop of Delaware, in an article under the foregoing title, in the North American Review for January, than by any other writer who has yet given his views on this subject to the public through the medium of the press.

The bishop's first proposition is that "there is a discussion styled religious which is not legitimate." He describes it thus:—

> It is such as calls in question the fundamental principles of religion. Any discussion which involves disrespect to them transcends its proper bounds.

Admitting the necessity of defining the term religion, Bishop Coleman continues:

> My own view of the subject shall be confined to the United States. The inquiry will at once arise: "Is there here any form of religion which may be called national, and which its adherents may on that account consider entitled, so far as its fundamental principles are concerned, to limitation of debate?"
>
> Without hesitation, I answer "Yes." From the very beginning of its colonization, this country has distinctly recognized Christianity as its religion. It is just as easy to prove its formal and constant acknowledgement in the beginning as it is to prove that there is no such formal acknowledgment in our present national Constitution. Yet this very lack of formal acknowledgment, when considered in connection with the fact that Congress is prohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, can be fairly considered as testifying not only to the existence, but, also, to the supremacy of Christianity.

This is the same interpretation put upon the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution by the Supreme Court, hence it is not original with the bishop. It is, however, a most monstrous perversion of the fundamental law of a great Nation. The idea that the framers of that amendment designed thereby to establish Christianity, or any other form of religion, in this country is too absurd to be entertained by any except the intensely bigoted or the basely interested. Every fair-minded man knows better.

Continuing, Bishop Coleman says:—

> In further support of the contention that Christianity is the national religion of America I would not only appeal—as one can do very confidently—to the common sentiment and practice of all classes, but also to the well-weighed utterance of the judiciary, from the first days of our political independence.

The bishop then quotes Chancellor Kent, of New York, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in support of his proposition that in this country Christianity is protected by law, and then says:

> So, then, I repeat that a discussion which would include within its limits an attack upon the fundamental principles of Christianity is, so far as that attack is concerned, distinctly illegitimate.
>
> We recognize this dogma when applied to civil affairs. When a citizen essays to bring into disrepute the fundamental principles of that form of government under which he is living, he is accounted a traitor, and is liable to arrest and punishment. . . . Is it not much more treasonable to bring into contempt the institutions and tenets of Christianity? And especially so, since it is a time of war? For in the conflict which Christianity is waging there is no discharge. It will last as long as the world in which we live. Therefore it is that a perpetual limit must be placed to the questioning or denial, by way of discussion, of such things as are essential to Christianity.
>
> Hardly anything is more injurious to the State than a lack of confidence between man and man. It threatens the disruption of the very bonds of society. And this is the risk that is run in allowing religious discussions to go on indefinitely and wantonly, robbing men of their faith in God and Christ, and so, in time, of their faith in one another, for faith in man has its highest development among those who believe in God.

Just how much is involved in the propositions quoted from Bishop Coleman, the readers of this paper need not be told. They will readily understand that were his views to be crystallized into law, or what would amount to about the same thing, into court decisions, freedom of speech, even in religious things, would be a thing of the past. The mere utterance of such sentiments is ominous, for already the legal precedents exist in many of our States to give all the force of law to every proposition laid down by the bishop. He himself thus argues this very question:—

> It may suffice to adduce one or two authorities on this point, Chancellor Kent, of New York, delivered, in 1811, the following opinion: "The people of this State, in common with the people of this country, profess the general doctrines of Christianity as their faith and practice." "True," he went on to say, "the Constitution has discarded religious establishments," but what then? "It does not forbid judicial cognizance of those offenses against religion and morality which have no reference to any such establishment, or to any particular form of government, but are punishable because they strike at the root of moral obligation and weaken the security of social ties." He added: "To construe it as breaking down the common-law barriers against licentious, wanton and impious attacks upon Christianity itself, would be an enormous perversion of its meaning."
>
> The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania subsequently ruled that "even if Christianity were not a part of the law of the land, it is the popular religion of the country; an insult to which would be indictable as tending to disturb the public peace;" adding that "no society can tolerate a wilful and despitful attempt to subvert religion."

Having thus fortified himself in the proposition that "any discussion which calls into question the fundamental principles of religion," transcends proper bounds and can be prohibited by civil law, Bishop Coleman defines what he regards as some of the "fundamental principles of Christianity." He says:—

> None is more distinctly so than a belief in the personality of its Founder, Jesus Christ. And with this belief in his personality is the equally fundamental belief in him as both God and Man.
>
> But few persons question the fact of His existence. More refuse to acknowledge his divinity. And herein lies a transgression of the limits of legitimate religious discussion. Indeed, one who denies the divinity of Christ takes himself out of religious discussion altogether—at least so far as this country is concerned. He robs Christianity of that which primarily makes it the religion of the world, and reduces it simply to a system of wilful deceit and shameless wickedness. . . . Such an assault is beyond the pale of legitimate discussion.

Just how far-reaching the bishop would make his rule will appear from the following:—

> One can not but regret the recent appearance in this Review of an article which, while professing to be a review of the life and works of a French author, lately deceased, was really an arraignment of Christianity, and a wanton attack not only upon Christ's claim to divinity, but also upon his goodness of character.
>
> Such an article certainly transgresses those bounds of religious discussion which I have ventured to lay down, and this not only because of assailing the fundamental principles of Christianity, but, further, because of its vain repetition of what has been so many times answered with such unquestionable reasonableness.

This shows that not simply would the bishop invoke the civil law against these grosser assaults upon religion calculated to provoke breaches of the peace, but that he would prohibit all discussion that involved a denial of the fundamental principles of Christianity, no matter how elevated its tone from a literary standpoint. This would involve a religious censorship of the entire press of the country, and utterly destroy all freedom of religious discussion. Discussion could not pass the limit. It could involve neither a denial of Christ's divinity nor of the obligation of the divine law as recognized by the civil law. The bishop says:—

> And these limits I would set not only as regards the discussion of His nature and his character, but also as regards the discussion of his commandments. Let me illustrate my meaning here by reference to the two great sacraments of the Christian religion, baptism and the Supper of the Lord. These were unquestionably ordained by Christ himself. And they are accounted "as generally necessary to salvation." Yet how largely are they ignored by people living in these United States. And how flippantly, oftentimes, is the question of their obligation discussed! The question, I submit, is beyond the legitimate limits of a religious discussion. It is treasonable to the King of kings, and thus becomes in itself irreligious.
>
> I am quite prepared to admit that there are some points in regard to the sacraments which may be legitimately discussed, e. g. the mode of baptism. But as to their necessity, there is no room for debate. That question has been settled, and whoever, by argument or by practice, shows disrespect to such a fundamental principle of the Kingdom puts himself out of court, and is, I repeat it, guilty of treason. It is not an open question. In fact, it has never been anything else but a closed question, except as those who are rebellious have dared to debate it.

How long would the bishop permit a discussion of the mode of baptism? If the principle were to prevail that the great majority had a right to forbid the denial of the necessity of any baptism at all, would not the same majority have an equal right to forbid a denial of the necessity of a particular mode of administering the ordinance? It certainly would have just the same right in the one case as in the other. But the whole principle is wrong; no such legitimate authority resides in any majority, however large.

It is scarcely probable that the bishop's ideal will ever be realized so far as baptism and the Lord's Supper are concerned, but the principle has had a practical application; and is having its legitimate and natural development in the United States to-day. Almost every State has its Sabbath laws requiring the recognition of one day of the week as sacred to rest and worship. Sunday is always specified, but in most States observers of the seventh day are permitted to do ordinary work on the first day of the week. That is, recognizing the Sabbath institution they are permitted to dissent from the majority as to the particular day to be observed, but they must not in practice deny the divine authority upon which the Sabbath institution rests; nor must they challenge the right of the State to enforce the observance of a day as sacred time. Such has in the past been the status of this question. Now, however, a large number of people are coming to regard a practical denial of the claims of the particular day observed by the majority as destructive of social order, and so to be prohibited by law. Any practical disregard of Sunday is, to use the bishop's expression, coming to be regarded as "beyond the legitimate limits of religious discussion," and so "treasonable to the King of kings," and consequently to the State, and so to be prohibited by civil statute.

The bishop's views may be regarded by many as extreme; but only because he applies his principles to questions of which the law has thus far taken only a very limited cognizance. Precisely the same argument in principle is made every day in regard to Sunday, and but few people, comparatively, see the evil there is in it. The bishop attempts to justify his position on the ground that to assail the principles of Christianity, "threatens the disruption of the very bonds of society." This is the identical argument relied upon to furnish a "civil" basis and justification for Sunday legislation. The principle is the same, and the argument is as good in the one case as in the other. Shall not Bishop Coleman's article serve to open the eyes of some who have hitherto been blind to the real issues involved in the question of liberty of conscience? C. P. B.
