MATTHEW QUAY, the patron saint of Pennsylvania machine politics, combined with super-piety, has uncorked quite remarkably in directing about himself as the closing days of the Fifty-second Congress, and the opening of the administration of the new President in the religious field. In the latest of governmental religion. In fact the issues so there can they are so well adapted as to light the face of the incoming administration with its ghostly lustre. It was to be expected that the religious forces of the new President in the religious field are so directed to with proper regard to the White House. The committee having in charge the planning of the inaugural festivities had decided upon commencing the crowd amusement by rendering on Sunday with concerts by the Marine Band, in the town of Baltimore. With reference to these concerts the *Congressional Record* has the following in its report of the proceedings of the Senate, Tuesday, February 21:—

Mr. QUAY—I present a petition of a society of the city of Washington, which I ask may be read.

THE VICE PRESIDENT—The petition will be read.

The Chief Clerk read the petition, as follows:

*To the President of the United States, the Vice President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives:*

*The undersigned, officials of the reform bureau of the city of Washington, respectfully present this petition.*

*Believing that the holding of a civil celebration on the Sabbath day would be a violation of the Fourth Commandment, and that the official endorsement of Sunday desecration would be in contravention of the law of God and will not be in the best interest of our country;*

*We respectfully petition that orders be issued forbidding the celebration of the inauguration upon Sunday.*

THE VICE PRESIDENT—The petition will be referred to the Committee on Arrangements.

Mr. QUAY—In this connection I desire to state the correspondence upon this subject between myself and Mr. Robert McBurney. When the question first of Sunday last I find a paragraph about the inaugural celebration. I observed that the money by the Marine Band is not yet completed.

The Chief Clerk read the three programmes for the concerts, and as follows:

Mr. QUAY—To show that these concerts are to be held under the auspices of the Committee and the officials in charge of the inaugural ceremonies,

it is in their official paper and furnished in review to a request for information.

The correspondence upon this subject between Mr. McBurney and Senator Quay was then read. From which it appeared that it was a case of the Christian lobby between Mr. McBurney, who is Secretary of the New York City Young Men's Christian Association, and the political boss of Pennsylvania, managing between them a Sunday concert by a government band.

Mr. McPATTERSON—Before the Senator offers his resolution, I should like to call his attention—

Mr. QUAY—I do not yield.

Mr. McPATTERSON—Before the Senator offers his resolution, I should like to call his attention to an occurrence which to me seems far more important that this matter. I could not understand from the language of the petition which has been read and understood by the Senate, whether it was anything approaching a purpose which is to determine from the pending what language of the petition has been read what is the matter under discussion.

*Here followed quite a lengthy discussion as to what other matter rides.*

Mr. QUAY—While white rosiery of another denomination was by lawful method obtained upon this floor, and while the Senate and the national convention has by lawful means obtained upon a committee resolution on Sunday concerts I would not wish it to be understood that I intended—

Mr. McPATTERSON—The Senator misapprehends my intention. I desired to call his attention to the language of the petition which has been read and which is to be referred to the Inaugural Committee of the city of Washington. Look for his resolution offered, and agreed to as follows:

*Resolved, That the Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies be directed to inquire into the matter of the proposed Sunday concerts of the Marine Band, in the city of Baltimore, and if such concerts are given under the auspices of the Inaugural Committee, or by its authority, that said committee take such action as may be necessary to prevent the same, and notify the citizens of Baltimore thereof.*

The result of this is announced by Mr. Quay and the Senate in full this morning:

There will be no sacred concerts at the Academy of Music, Baltimore, Sunday, March 5. Senator Quay succeeded yesterday in persuading the Committee to permit the men of the Marine Band to remain in Washington.

The dates of the last-named order were, February 22.

*Sabbath Noble Sentimentality.*

GROVER CLEVELAND, LAKEWOOD, N. J.

Expressed Christian sentiment in city in regard to the opening and closing on Sunday of the World's Fair at Chicago.

J. W. FOSTER.

*President Political Alliance.*

It is evident that the power behind the presidential chair had to speak and it spoke.

Of Secretary John W. Noble, who it thus was before the incoming President in haste to appropriate to himself the honor of the enforcement of sabbath rest, a paper of this time, the *Mail and Express,* of this city, says:—

He let his religion at the beginning of the Harrison administration die as it had done his faith in his life until at his official home before the Inaugural occasion and other great functions.

While the news also speaks of the "purpose for the restoration of our Lord" during the transition, it is at the same time giving a public dinner on Sunday.

On the other hand we do not think some of this gentleman's friends going to get to heaven via New Jersey? Still, he discards card playing, and his pastor says of him:—

He is a man of intense nature. Once fixed in his religion again, and sin all right. I stopped the President and the party from playing cards and I also expected President Cleveland to recover in the Panama Canal affair as well. He has overcome some bad habits and now stands a power for good in the Nation.

The whole matter is justly characterized by the New York World thus:—

There has nothing to do with religion. It is idle and an impertinent interference with the rights of citizens. The Government of the Republic has nothing to set to prevent or discourage "sin." It has nothing to do with anybody's "morals" and personal conduct. It has no concern with Sabbaths or holy days, except to see to it that everybody shall be left free to spend them, or pass them, in whatever way their consciences may dictate. Anybody who believes and yet what the law demands one shall do, and the Government of the Republic to stop other people from doing.

Of Matthew Quay, the political humbugs most of these have this country, the *World* does not hesitate to say—

The same impious humbugs who are aghast at the sinfulness of permitting the Marine Band to play at Baltimore on Sunday next, will feel no qualm of conscience and no hesitation in sending to urge their protest against the "national sin" of a Sunday concert, who, a few years ago, of the country, who a few years ago embodied nearly half a million dollars from the people of their State. It would be more to the purpose to prevent and punish the punishment which might have brought respite of evil.

It was one of the dramatic untities, however, that was preserved in writing, that the first inauguration, after the congressional resolution making the religion of the United States, should be marked by public "observance" of this "inaugural" also of the governmental religion.
