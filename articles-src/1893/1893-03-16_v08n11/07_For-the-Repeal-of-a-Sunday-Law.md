JANUARY 10, Hon. John Wads, of Fergus, Minn., member of the lower House of the legislature, introduced in the lower House of the legislature, a bill for the repeal of sections, Sections 6515, 277, and 6 of the Minnesota Sunday law.

The occasion for the introduction and the provisions of this bill were as follows: On July 10, 1892, one of the citizens of the Minnesota Sunday law had committed an offense against the said Sunday law in the town of Fergus, which is in the county and district represented by Mr. Wads, a member of the place came to him after his arrest. "I offered you had been let off," said Tolson 1 to 8, replied, "but I do not propose to plead guilty and pay a fine upon such a matter. I will not." He went upon somebody else, because you believe that Sabbath Sunday was kept holy if such law.

These statements in the main subject Sunday law and prompted Mr. Wads to repeal the obnoxious sections. He says he favors a clean sweep of the State Sunday law, but in a Legislature so newly constituted its object is evidently in the interests of faithful liberty and opposed to bigotry and intolerance.

In a view of those facts the following resolutions were passed at the Religious Liberty Association late meeting in present session by assembly.

Believing that it is the duty of the State to protect all its citizens alike, without discrimination, to the end that all its citizens in matters of religion, therefore—

*Resolved,* That the Religious Liberty Association of Minnesota, in its annual convention assembled, at Minneapolis, that the people of our legislature respectfully ask the enactment of religious rites or institutions by civil law and our legislature should aim toward the protection of every citizen in the exercise of his civil and religious rights.

*Resolved,* That we ask the Legislature of Minnesota, now in session, to repeal the existing Sunday laws.

*Resolved,* That copies of these be sent on Thursday February, by, The Rev. Earl. Grange copy of the Rev. Earl of Thursday by all the churches in the State.

Many are becoming interested in the religious liberty movement in Minnesota. A number of men are now working at the right direction and sent petitions throughout the State to be signed and returned to the Legislature. Already the petitions have excited a strong spirit of opposition in the Legislature. The work is being pushed to a successful issue, and now with the new laws the entire legislature was reminded from where, who too had no Sunday law for seven months, have come to Minnesota that it is in Tennessee, to show that we claim none of the 1500, 500, or 600 days imprisonment in Tennessee for Sunday work. We are also working up their cases. The people of Minnesota will be interested.

It is presently the main thing we are taking toward the movement in the legislature opened in Pennsylvania. The Minnesota campaign has been of great assistance in other parts of the country. The object of the Religious Liberty Association in Minnesota is to carry the knowledge of real religious liberty to every part of that State, and reduce the fins affect of the Sunday law there, so that every State shall be felt immediately by active effort to take the same line of action, and the citizens have the penalties to the State Sunday law removed. In this State also it was thought that this exhibition of enthusiasm for legitimate both purposes opened the as seen in the true animus of this position. However this may be, the agitation of the cause there is progressing, as is religious campaign the watchword is, "Educate."
