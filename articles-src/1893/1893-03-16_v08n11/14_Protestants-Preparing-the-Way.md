AN editorial writer in the Sabbath Recorder, of March 9, speaking of the Roman Catholic influence in this country, for the teaching of religion in the public schools and the union of Church and State, says:

Let us remember, however, that the people who are just now introducing that dangerous principle are not Catholics. Jesuits can well afford to go on a vacation, while Protestants prepare the way for all that they have been desiring and seeking. If the national Government, in obedience to the wishes of an organized minority, is willing to place the stamp of its approval on one religious institution, why not another? Once established the principle and its application is easily extended.

That the application of the principle of Sunday-closing by congressional and governmental authority is very easily extended is shown by the Sunday-closing episode connected with the inauguration of President Cleveland, the official record and correspondence in regard to which is reprinted on another page.
