THE various propositions to have Congress legislate affirmatively for the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday are just as vicious in principle as that which has prevailed to close the day. The legislation before the Pennsylvania Legislature, in reference to the Sunday law of the State, to reduce the fine, and legalize certain forms of business, come within the same category.

Congress has no right to decree, either directly or indirectly, that the World's Fair should be closed on a given day, in deference to the religious views of either a minority or a majority. It had no more right to say that it should be open in opposition to the religious practice or belief of either a minority or a majority. The only possible course for Congress in this matter, has been accord with the principles of justice and the Constitution. It would then decree neither way.

The same thing is true of legislatures. They have no more right to legislate affirmatively, in reference to any religious observance, than negatively. The measure introduced in the Pennsylvania legislature, to reduce the penalty affixed to the Sunday law of Allegheny County, and legalize the manufacture and sale of newspapers on Sunday, and the offering for sale of certain articles, is therefore just as unsound for, and just as much beyond the proper legislative sphere as the original law of 1794 forbidding all labor, trade, and diversion, on Sunday. The right to make and sell newspapers, or to follow trade and labor in general, can no properly be restricted on Sunday for any reason which would not apply just as well on Wednesday; for as a matter of absolute right, all these are just as proper, and but that matter rightfully lawful, as well as on other days; or one for which

on Sunday, whether the legislature bid or forbid. In this case the assumption of despotic right to prohibit, presumes the same despotic right of affirmative command, if that should be the legislative choice. In Russia, this assumption has reached the stage of practical experimental reality.

Who will acknowledge that the legislature may rightfully command his labor on Sunday under penalty of fine and imprisonment? Who will agree that the State may reasonably and rightfully decree that he shall sell on Wednesday, and abstain from all secular occupation? If the State may so decree as regards Wednesday, it may decree, if it so choose, that he must work on that day, or some other day, or all other days. Can it not be said that persistent and faithful labor by its citizens tends to the welfare of the State; it is a necessity for the support of the citizen himself; public policy therefore demands that the citizens should be required to labor? The State, therefore, having assumed the right, for its benefit of the State and the citizen,—on a matter of public policy, a labor regulation,—to require the citizen to rest on Wednesday, may not, if in its judgment changed social and economical or political conditions render it advisable, require him to work on Wednesday. The same principle which from one standpoint applies equally in either case, and is just as applicable to Sunday as to Wednesday.

There is no distinction, then, in principle between the affirmative and negative Sunday law; both are equally insidious. Naturally it follows, therefore, that the same evil effects true as to a Sunday law in its negative force, are equally true, and also true of its exemptions. That is, the exemption pre-supposes the right to religiously upon others that from which the privileged party is exempt. In all instances this is denied by the party exempted. There exists no right, in the first place, to make or enforce the law, consequently there can exist no right to exempt. The assumption of the right to exempt is a cumulative claim of the primacy of the religious institution and of State authority in the matter. It is, in-

deed, creating an exception, that it may more conclusively prove the rule. Especially is this seen when the fact is taken into consideration that all exemption clauses affixed to Sunday laws require the exempted class to strictly and conscientiously observe another day and be able to present such proof of this religious observance as shall satisfy the magistrate before whom they may be brought for violation of the Sunday law. The only apparent exception to this is the one couched instead of an express waiver, in the statutory interpretation of "works of necessity and mercy." What is this but the same law applied to another day? There is a distinction, to be sure, but no difference in the requirements or the principle which is sought to be applied.

There has been introduced in the legislature of Tennessee a bill which reads as follows:

*An Act to Prohibit Interference with the Rights or Liberties of Certain Classes of American Citizens in the Exercise and Enjoyment of Religious and Other Privileges Guaranteed by the State of Tennessee. That Section 1 of the Sunday law of Tennessee, be and the same is hereby amended so as to apply to persons known as Seventh-day Baptists and others, the provisions of the religious faith of their denomination, by substituting Friday for Saturday in Section 1 of said law.*

This is absolutely vicious in principle, and would be in its consequences. Let us understand it. We are told by the friends of this legislation that it means that Seventh-day Baptists shall be allowed to work on Sunday, provided they keep Saturday. Leaving out of view the monstrous injustice of not extending such privilege—or rather, of not conceding such right—to all; the principle is as bad as can be. Provided that their own consciences shall not interfere with their business, but that they keep another day, they may then work on Sunday as on other days. That is the sum of the whole matter. The legislature which makes or amends the Sunday law, decrees that those whom it exempts must observe another day,—that they must have and keep a religious observance as shall satisfy the magistrate before whom they may be brought for violation of the Sunday law. Their exemption from civil penalty for Sunday work is conditioned on their religious observance of Saturday.

This provision therefore decrees—

(1) That the exempted class shall have a religion.

(2) It determines what that religion shall be,—it shall be to observe another day as a religious Sabbath.

(3) It determines that this Sabbath shall be kept in a manner approved by the legislature.

(4) It determines the penalty if they do not keep it.

(5) It establishes the jurisdiction of civil courts over a purely religious institution.

(6) It constitutes the civil magistrate the judge of the sincerity and sufficiency of the religious observance of the exempted class.

And all this in the name of an exemption from the requirements of a religious law! What kind of exemption is it that establishes a State religion for the very persons whom it proposes to exempt from the original? While they are relieved from the obligation of keeping Sunday, they are bound more securely to keep another day, and that not as a civil enactment, but as a matter of professed religious faith and observance.
