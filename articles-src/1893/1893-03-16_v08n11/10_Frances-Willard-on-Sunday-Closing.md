IN a letter to the editor of the Mail and Express denying that she has experienced any change of opinion in reference to religious legislation in general, and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by act of Congress, in particular, Miss Frances Willard says:—

When the enemies of Christianity combine, its friends must unite, and while many excellent men and women who are not enemies have taken the popular view of the question, that very fact leads the White Ribboness to be more conservative than might otherwise have been the case.

By this we are to understand that those who opposed congressional action to close the World's Fair on Sunday, espoused the popular side of the question, and Miss Willard and the editor of the Mail and Express are on the unpopular side. The side advocated by forty or fifty millions must be the popular side. Is it possible that the majority in this country are on the unpopular side? Is it possible that there could have been a mistake in the figures? There is a discrepancy somewhere. One is forced to believe Miss Willard and accept her statement as truth. There were no forty or fifty millions advocating Sunday closing. Miss Willard is on the side of the minority, and the unpopular and not the popular wish has triumphed.
