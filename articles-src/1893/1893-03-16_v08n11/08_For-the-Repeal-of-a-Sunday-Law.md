JANUARY 10, Hon. John Wacek, of Prague, Minn., member of the Minnesota, legislature, introduced in the lower House of that body a bill for the repeal of three sections, Sections 225, 227, and 229, of the Minnesota Sunday law.

The circumstances which led to the introduction of this bill were as follows: Certain petty prosecutions for violations of the Minnesota Sunday law had come up recently before Mr. Wacek, as city justice in the town of Prague, which he dismissed without a hearing. Upon this, a minister of the place came to him and said, "I thought you kept the Lord's day." "Indeed I do," he replied, "but I do not propose you shall enforce your religion upon somebody else, because you believe so and so." This seemed to cause Mr. Wacek to appreciate the real nature of Sunday laws, and prompted him to introduce the bill referred to. It is not quite a clean sweep of the State Sunday law, but is a movement in the right direction. Its object is evidently in the interests of religious liberty and opposed to bigotry and intolerance.

In view of these facts the following resolutions were passed at the Religious Liberty institute then in progress at Minneapolis:—

Believing that it is the duty of the State to protect liberty of conscience, and that this is the limit of its authority in matters of religion; therefore—

Resolved, That it is the sense of the Minnesota branch of the National Religious Liberty Association, in convention assembled, at Minneapolis, that all religious laws or measures looking toward the enforcement of religious rites or institutions by the State, should be repealed; and further—

Resolved, That we favor the passage of the bill now before the legislature of Minnesota, introduced by Mr. Wacek, known as H. R. 42, being a bill to repeal those sections of the penal code relating to labor, sports, and traffic on Sunday.

This quotation is from the Home Missionary for February. The St. Paul correspondent of the Review and Herald of the date of February 23, says:—

The fight here for freedom of conscience is moving on. Many are becoming interested in the Wacek bill, which proposes to repeal three sections of our Sunday laws. We believe this is a move in the right direction and sent petitions throughout the State. One section asked to be repealed is what is called the Barber's law. As was expected, this aroused a spirit of opposition from that source. We took occasion to send out a petition favoring the repeal, with some Religious Liberty literature to over three hundred boss barbers in the State, with a letter addressed to each. Yesterday a letter was received from one of these, who said he received signatures from everybody in the village. He said: "I see the same spirit of persecution is here in Minnesota that is in Tennessee. The head of that viper should be crushed. I am glad to stand by you in the fight." Another bill was introduced, the 9th inst., which makes Sabbath breaking a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $100, ninety days imprisonment or both. This increases the fine, ten, and the imprisonment, eight fold over what the law now provides. It seems as though this bill was an aid rather than a hindrance to us in our work.

This is precisely the same thing as occurred in Pennsylvania. The attempt to do away with certain of the Sunday laws of that State, and reduce the fine affixed to the Allegheny County law, was followed immediately by an active effort on the part of the religious legislationists to have the penalties to the State Sunday laws increased. In that case, also, it was thought that this exhibition of enthusiasm for persecution had opened the eyes of some to the true animus of the movement. However this may be, the agitation certainly serves for education, and in this campaign the watchword is, "Educate!" "Educate!"
