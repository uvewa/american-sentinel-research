THE Brooklyn Eagle, in an editorial item in reference to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and the possible action of the management as to the acceptance, or non-acceptance, of the appropriation with the proviso attached, says, "Even if the managers are convinced that the majority is for opening, they may hesitate to offend a powerful minority." This is a true statement of the legislative history of this whole matter of Sunday closing, hesitation to offend a powerful minority.
