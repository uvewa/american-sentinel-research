**PROSECUTIONS** for working on Sunday are gradually becoming the recognized order of the day,—the arraignment of six men for violation of the Sunday law, on February 5, in this city, is recorded as follows:—

Louis Prague, of Prague Bros., shirt manufacturers, No. 474 Broadway, and Philip Krulewitch, a clothing manufacturer, No. 524 Broadway, were arraigned in the Tombs Police Court yesterday, charged with working on Sunday. Prague had thirty hands working and Krulewitch three. They swore that they observed Saturday as a holiday, and were discharged.

Three Sabbath breakers were also arraigned in the Jefferson Market Police Court, viz.: Max Krouse, No. 20 Sixth Avenue; Joseph Leventhan, No. 64 Sixth Avenue, and Bernard Polisickere, of No. 116 Sixth Avenue. The last named keeps a saloon and was charged with violating the excise law. The others are clothing dealers. Justice Koch held all in $100 each for trial in the Court of Special Sessions.

Patrick Shea, of No. 511 Pearl Street, a foreman in the employ of F. M. Hausling, was in the Tombs Police Court yesterday, charged with violating the Sunday law in continuing the work of tearing down the buildings Nos. 64 to 68 Broadway. Shea was held in $300 for examination by Justice Ryan.

Those who obtained their discharge by swearing that they were observers of the seventh day were subjected to civil surveillance of their religion precisely the same in character, though not in kind, as they would have been forced to submit to in Russia. And as to those who were held, where is the distinction between the unwarrantable authority exercised over them here and similar arrests, for the sake of religion, in the dominion of the Czar?
