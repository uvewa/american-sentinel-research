COMMENTARY on the growing tendency toward the strict enforcement of Sunday laws in this city the New York *Sun* says:

Many of the Jewish people living here, who keep open their shops on Saturday evening on the day of rest, are made victims in the community of the cruelty and complexities of the wrongfulness of enforcing the Sunday laws of the State. They are deprived of their freedom from business and labor during two days of every week, or more than one-quarter of their entire time.

Two Jewish shopkeepers have been arrested this week. Two clothing merchants and a dry-goods merchant were held in bail by the Justices of the Jefferson Market Police Court last week. Two barbers were arrested this week for running their barber shops on Sunday, and both of them were discharged by the Justices of the Tombs Police Court. The reporters for justice directed to the religious laws, the claim of the Jews. It is evident from these facts that the Sunday law in its existing form unfairly strikes both the men who observe on Saturday on Saturday, holding the two observances on Sunday, failure has still left many that he has repeated the absence of men. New York said that he reproved the absence of some citizens being arrested on the charge of keeping open on Sunday, "instead of being between people of different opinions in religion, to make the best for a living and for helping one another. I am not the one to prosecute any man for violating a day only; we are not helping you to stop business on another day, and there can be no law that is fair, in forcing men to shut.

In this city of New York, who now number one case of the whole population, are denseness of two or more of a variation or of either family Jews, and owned or let the trade—making men among them are preparing to take back from the Sixths district system on Sunday.

The *Sun* has heretofore indicated the correct basis upon which relief should be had,—namely the entire repeal of all Sunday laws. But if this should be naked by any State legislature would the *Sun* now sustain the movement on the grounds of its own conviction? The *Sun* has editorially said that legislation in its just and wise propriety has now late editorial utterances of the *Sun* go to show that it would not.

In its issue of January 29, the New York *Sun* said in reference to the Sunday opening of the World's Fair:—

No, Congress must insist, whether in the interest of our religion and reverence or in connection with the nature and sentiment of the American people and the World's Fair-grounds be closed on every Sunday. It is to receive pecuniary and act official recognition from the Government of the United States. Close the Chicago Fair on Sunday! Close it tight!

The *Sun* said in its editorial column, on October 7, 1892:

The Woman have realized the folly of the opening of the Chicago Fair on Sundays. The Fair-grounds are already open to visitors, and public attendance is interesting. On a recent Sunday fifteen thousand persons passed through the turnstile. During the week the average daily attendance was one hundred thousand. Most of the visitors in the park on Sunday are loitering men and their families. The wealthy Col. Elliot F. Shepard had endeavored so hard to compel the directors to keep the Fair closed against the workingmen.

What becomes of the keen edges of the *Sun's* irony in this paragraph when compared with its editorial about in January: "Close the Chicago Fair on Sunday!" against the workingmen: "Close it tight!"

The *Sun* once tendered its editorial news about the efforts of the Barbers' International Union to obtain Sunday laws, forbidding Sunday work in barber shops, thus:

Why should the Barbers' International Union ask the State legislature to enact laws prohibiting them or the barbers of the Union from plying their trade on Sunday? There is no law in any State requiring barbers to employ or to shingle a man or boy. Every barber in the country is as liberty to stop shaving on Sunday, or any day he chooses; but he has not the right to close and has no right to, nor has he any right stop from shaving others who choose to shave or be shaved on that day. Barbers had better let the legislatures attend to their business and attend strictly to their razors.

This is sound doctrine. The *Sun* should have applied the same doctrine to legislation for Sunday closing of the World's Fair for Sunday, and, realizing the fact that there is no law in Illinois requiring exhibits to be closed on Sunday to be open, should, and to let the World's Fair to exhibit its goods on Sunday, been willing that every exhibitor should leave his individual exhibits as he wished. The *Sun* has evidently fallen a victim to the very evil which it has been so ready to apply in the individual case, and will hardly be willing to condemn its own injunction and let Congress attend to its secular affairs, while the exhibitors at the World's Fair attend to their own, business on Sunday.

The excitement on the question of Sunday closing of theaters in Denver some months ago has so far as we know subsided, and calm and peace once more prevail.

The German American Reform Association is meeting and adopting the following resolution, in the nature of a resolution demanding that Congress rescind its action having the effect of compelling managers having for its object the enforced observance of Sunday at the Columbian Exposition.
