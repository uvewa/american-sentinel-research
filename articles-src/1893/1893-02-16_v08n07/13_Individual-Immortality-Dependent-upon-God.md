The *Union Signal* of January 5, 1893, delivers itself of the following remarkable utterance, asking all, even the hope and trust of immortality, upon keeping the World's Fair on Sunday, and the proposition that this is "a Christian Nation," and "Sabbath" by law:—

The hope of human immortality and the laboring classes' most inevitably in the end of the destruction of faith in the Sabbath. If we surrender the idea of a God, and of Sunday as Sabbath at all, we must never consent to its being legally desecrated.

To the Christian, the question is of far more importance than an economic one. The Sabbath stands for immortality; it is the emblem of mankind, and, to many, of almost the sole opportunity for coming into contact with influences which lift the soul and tend to develop the spiritual side, the real hopes of our nature's life. Our hope of individual immortality is the main issue—the Sabbath is inseparable from it.

In other words, to sum the whole thing up, these Sunday-law fanatics hold that by means of the civil authority if men are not compelled to keep Sunday they themselves could not keep it, and would therefore stand to show by all arguments that their immortality is at the stake. And all their frantic urgency to have everybody rest on Sunday, and all their extravagant, what perverse ideas do men who will not keep Sunday, shows that that immortality is dependent upon individual faithfulness, and not upon legislative enactment, whatever said about keeping Sunday or the "American Sabbath." Surely the gospel of the Sunday-law people and the "American Sabbath" surely is another gospel.
