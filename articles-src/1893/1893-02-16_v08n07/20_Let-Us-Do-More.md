In referring to the work of the AMERICAN SENTINEL the Christian Statesman, of December 24, says:—

> As we have said before, twenty-six thousand Seventh-day Adventists circulate more millions of papers against the Sabbath than twenty-six million friends of the Sabbath circulate thousands in its behalf. The whole country ought to be sowed knee deep with Sabbath Reform literature, to refute the shallow sophistries of good men and bad as to Sunday opening of the World's Fair and other schemes of infidels and money grabbers thinly disguised as movements for the poor or for "pure religion." But who will provide funds for a part of them?

By "Sabbath" the Statesman means Sunday. By "Sabbath reform" is meant Sunday laws, to promote a stricter observance of the day. But Sunday is not "the Sabbath," and a reform can not take place on what never was. The only true Sabbath reform is a reform on the only true Sabbath, and that is the seventh day. See Ex. 20: 8-10; Ies. 58: 13. This reform God has predicted, and seventh-day keepers are now the only ones enlisted in the work for the Sabbath. Every paper, tract, and page circulated for Sunday and Sunday laws is against, not Seventh-day Adventists, but the Lord God of the Bible and his Sabbath. We are glad Adventists are doing so much; they ought to be doing ten times more. The truth and love of the Lord Jesus Christ and precious souls for whom he died, as well as the rapidly passing moments, demand a tenfold deeper consecration and zeal in God's work. But shall we suggest to the Statesman the cause of the apathy of friends of Sunday?—It is this: The majority of them down deep in their hearts believe neither in the day nor the methods to promote it.
