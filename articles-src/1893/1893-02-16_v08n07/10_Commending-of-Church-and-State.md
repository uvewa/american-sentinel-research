RELATIVE to the ruling of the Supreme Court *Der Lutheraner* said, in its issue of November 11, 1892, in which the State's highest court has based its express conviction that they were based on divine law. For, religion implies subordination under, and obedience to, God.

A State are properly said in a way commendably and from enacting Sunday laws, as Luther says, "it is a beautiful, external custom to keep the Lord's day holy." If the State employs the multitudes, of men and tradespeople, who go their way during the week, having so little time for hearing the word of God, at least to use the further purpose of protecting citizens that profess and keep Sunday. Such are civil Sunday laws. And now the Supreme Court of a State is trying to use the religious right and saying merely a civil enactment, but a religious one! It says, "Christianity is part and parcel of the common law."

*Der Lutheraner* is the official organ of or the law-making power to put down any other enterprise that happened to be inimical to his work. He never resorted to anything like retaliation or coercion, no matter what hid enemies came to him by.

When his work in a place and a fold did not carry on his work because of the unbelief of the people, he did not call for police, he went away and left them to themselves; and neither did he set about organizing either municipal or provincial or imperial committees for the special benefit of their work; although whenever he went they found his benevolence had a tenfold more observable than his own part by understanding of what Christianity really is. We have its own everything.

The truest Christianity was here is fellowship. If we are mistaken as we will finally work out the highest possibilities of religion by reaching the closest and truest understanding of what Christianity really is. We have its own everything.
