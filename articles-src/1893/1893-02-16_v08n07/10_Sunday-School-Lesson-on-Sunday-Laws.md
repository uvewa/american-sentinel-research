It has been recommended that March 5, be set apart by all denominations as a day for considering in the Sunday-schools and pulpits, the question of Sunday closing. The Christian Patriot heads its review of the lesson for the day thus:—

SUNDAY LAWS.

March 5, 1893.—Keeping the Sabbath.

LESSON—Rebehmlet 10:18-20.

GOLDEN TRAY—Eaiohsa 20:8. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.

The lesson relates chiefly to the prohibition of Sabbath work by the civil authority, by law. Sunday, since the resurrection of Christ, is the Sabbath. The adult Bible class which can keep from considering Sunday laws while studying this lesson must have a queer teacher.

Certainly, and still queerer pupils!
