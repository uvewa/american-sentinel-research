In referring to the work of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, the *Christian Statesman,* in its issue of January 14, says:—

As we have said, today twenty-six thousand papers against the petition for Sunday opening and twenty-one million papers against the twenty-one million signatures to the petition. This whole country ought to be sowed down with *American Sentinels* in every county and city and township, to checkmate the friends of Sunday in the opening of the World's Fair and other schemes for secularizing the Sabbath. Who will rise up to help the truth, and who will provide funds for a part of them?

By "Sabbath reform" is meant "Sunday enforcement by law" and the securing by law of "the due observance" of the day. But Sunday is not the Sabbath, and the Sabbath reform, so called, and the "rest" for the day, does not have to take place on what is ever was. The only Sabbath the Bible knows anything about is the true Sabbath, and that is the seventh day, and that day is Saturday, not Sunday. This reform God has predicted, and several times referred to in the Scriptures. True Sabbath reform is a return to the Sabbath as originally instituted, and the work in the collected in the work for the Sabbath. The Sabbath reform, so called, for Sunday and law-enforcement, Sunday laws is unjust, for Sunday and Sunday laws is unjust, for Seventh-day Adventists stand upon their rights. We are Adventists and have no fear. We are Adventists and have no fear in the cause of the right, and we all stand together. And as to "secularizing" the Lord's day, it is not in the power of any one to "secularize" a day which is already secular, and it does not belong to civil legislation, and never did.

Personally, responsibility to God ought to be a principle which should enter into every individual life. God will require and give every account of himself to God? Personally, each is responsible. We are therefore personally responsible to God. We shall one day give account of ourselves at the judgment bar of the Most High, of which we may be a part has any claim to authority or any right to dictate to the conscience of their fellow-men. This is the real question, the philosophical reason for the separation of church and state. The whole question lies in the same lines and are based on the same foundation. If it is good company, and to be in accordance with a principle in involved, we should not follow a wrong course under any circumstance. Personally it is a matter of one's responsibility to God rule. Acting in itself, it is not wrong nor unconstitutional, it is the source of true good. This, too, with God, who gave on better ways to deal with sin than those of human legislation, will but unite us in God's own better way with everything else. Acting in accordance through under the power of the enemy this may seem to leave no door, leave it with the Master, who will take it up at the right time.
