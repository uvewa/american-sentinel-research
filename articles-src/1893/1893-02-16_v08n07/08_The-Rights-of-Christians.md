The rights of Christians are, most emphatically, those just well and commonly understood as the rights of freemen and citizens. The Church departs from the example and the teaching of Christ when it seeks anything more.

Were all deference to Christianity, and there is so much which justifies that deference that equality is not, with us, a question; it is in its very best character, it belongs to its being free and equal. Christianity would lose the best thing in it if it sought the help or force of law. The rights of Christians as represented by the Church are those which the Church can maintain for itself in its own way by its own agencies. In other words, the freemen of the Church, and of the State, as well are equally arrayed in their demand. The phrases, "the rights of the people," "the rights of citizens," "equality before the law," the "rights of Christians," and others of like import, are not in conflict with the Constitution, not antagonistic, but supplemental and concordant; and, as we are coming; we are entering upon a new era.

The idea is emphasized by the proposition that to cope, a theory or on Sunday a fact that "this is a Christian Nation" and must be ruled according to the "sentiment of the majority," and ought not to be "tolerated." It is not a doctrine of the Christian Church that majority rules in matters of faith and inspires the authority to coerce at will. It is a doctrine fatal to the religious liberty of the rights of a free people. In this country this is an absolute right. Applying no such doctrine as one class tolerating another— "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." There is no distinction, as so far as mere human rights are concerned. There is no religious aristocracy. There is no right to pursue happiness in the theater more than the right to pursue happiness in the church. The theory of nearly all Christians that the State should enforce the Lord's day is based on the essential fallacy that the State is above the Church.

The Christian Church never assumed the authority to tolerate or to coerce, until it lost sight of the simplicity and beauty of its principles as the born representative of the people. The disposition to persecute or coerce is not consistent with Christian experience or Christianity, tolerating or not tolerating in the community. The Church is a unit of love that belongs to the citizen as a citizen, in the affairs of all. It is not the privilege of even the best people in the world that ought, nor is it the majority; to deprive, in anything that does not disturb the peace, any one of the rights of a citizen; for in so doing they altogether destroy the very spirit in which Christianity is a growth and a gift of the Almighty, to deprive Christians of their right under their own Church law, whether to work or rest upon any day. They justify the union of Church and State and put into theory what is in effect in many ages and in many localities. As a form of Christianity the practice is not like Christ.

Such a spirit, though called that of Christianity, is not Christian in a proper sense of freedom, and many, are too apt to suppose that it is. Many people, who are not Christian in any real sense, falsely are such only because they take for granted that all which calls itself Christian work of Christ is Christian. A Christian is a follower of Christ, not the law. A Christian is like Christ. Now any one who will take the trouble to read the gospels will learn that Christ never did attempt to
