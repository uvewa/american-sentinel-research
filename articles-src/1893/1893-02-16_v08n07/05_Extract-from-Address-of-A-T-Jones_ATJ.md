These distinct considerations in themselves show the impropriety of Congress to touch the question. The first is from Prof. Philip Schaff's paper on the subject. He read, and sent to the committee the letter which he wrote to Dr. Philip Schaff, whose paper he had under his hand, as follows:—

*My Dear Dr. Schaff:* I have yours of the 11th. I appreciate the compliment, and the kind manner in which you have expressed your views. There are points, however, on which I must say to you, frankly, that my own views differ from yours in certain important matters, especially in regard to the exact question of the relation of the establishment of religion as it is now after the present provisions of the Constitution. I have no doubt of this: that there is no establishment of religion, as such, under the Federal Government; that none has ever grown—except such as are created. Every one of the original thirteen States, not one, has been, a bill of Rights, and therefore be satisfy to give the reasons of those who thought that such as an amendment to the Constitution was not necessary; not because the people wished to be left free to establish a religion in these States without passage, and so found its place among the amendments to the Constitution of the United States without passage, and so found its place States without passage, and so found its place in one of these.

This is shown by the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution which states that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." As no power was delegated to Congress on the subject of religion, that is reserved to the States or to the people. That is where the Constitution left it. It is in a condition where the Constitution has left it. It is in a condition precisely the same as that of the State of Illinois also, so far as any of this has any bearing on its State. The subject, to say whether the Fair shall be open or closed, the position. If this State Congress should not say anything on the subject, it is still with the people, of for the people, in their own capacity as such, or as they choose to fix the matter without any interference or dictation by Congress.

Now, in that the first article of the Constitution had not made a word on the subject of religion, and that Congress has no power in Congress to touch this question. But the people have spoken, the Constitution has spoken, and limited the right of the United States Government to touch the question, and has reserved that right to the States or to the people. Not only did it do that, but it went further, and actually prohibited the Congress of the United States from ever touching the question of religion in any shape or form in any legislation whatever. This lack of power was in the Constitution from the beginning, not only in the prohibition, because the powers granted did not grant it; but that it went further, and not only reserved this power, but expressly prohibited Congress from exercising it. It is trebly unconstitutional for Congress to touch the question. It was so at the beginning of the Government, then the reserved clause says that this legislation shall be undone, and it is not left where the Constitution has left it; then the amendment was adopted.

Mr. Hoak—a member of the Committee—with whom the speaker was talking, I believe, is that Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.

Mr. Jones—I am going to follow this question a little further, and notice that there about the "amendment does not read as it is often misquoted, 'Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion,' or 'no Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'" There are two meanings in this phrase. When the amendment was adopted, all that it said upon this subject was that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." Some of the States had religious tests at that time; I think all except Virginia. Virginia was the only State that was then directly touching this question. The first part of the amendment was intended to prohibit Congress from making any law respecting any of those religions which were already in those States, and the second part of the same prohibition forbids the Congress from touching the subject of religion on the score in any way. In fact Madison's complete record of the matter in the House, from 1785—with the exception of the interval during which the war was the highest—December 15, 1791, there was a campaign conducted over its name upon the subject of the relation of the State to religion. The English Church was the establishment in Virginia, and the Baptists, Presbyterians, and Quakers, and the Baptists sent a memorial to the General Assembly of Virginia, asking that as the Colonies had declared themselves free from and independent of British rule in civil things, so the State of Virginia might also declare its independence from British rule in religious things, and that they might not be compelled to support a religion which they did not believe, for any ever religion, which they did not believe. The petition was entirely disestablished. Then a movement was introduced to make a general tax for religion and legislate in favor of the Christian religion in general rather than having one provision for teachers of that religion. But they had sufficient public influence that bill, and by vigorous efforts, they were able in its place to have the passage of a bill establishing the matter of religion in Virginia, and in fact in all the State Constitutions from that day to this, on the subject of religion in the State.

Now then, that campaign in Virginia was conducted in the interest of establishing religion there, embodied the same principle that is involved in this legislation to-day, and so that it was distinctly shut out, so we ask that this shall be made to the Congress put the Government back to the place where it was to-morrow and where it belongs. Madison, went right out of that campaign into the convention which formed the Constitution of the United States, and carried with him his constitutional principles which he had advocated in that campaign, and put those principles into the Constitution; and the intention of all was, and is, that Congress shall have nothing whatever to do with the subject of religion or religion.

Washington in 1797, made a treaty with Tripoli, which contained this clause, that "the Government of the United States of America is in any sense founded upon the Christian religion." Congress had since then legislated upon this question with direct reference to religion. Now when Congress again it has gone contrary to the express intention of those who made the Constitution and established the supreme law, as expressed in their own words. And for this reason we ask that the thing shall be undone, and Congress put the Government right back where it was before that legislation was established, and leave the question where it belongs.

The Constitution prohibits this legislation and when the Constitution prohibits it, then ought not the legislation to be repealed?
