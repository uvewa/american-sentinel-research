The past week has been an eventful one in the history of the "Adventist cases," as they are familiarly called in Paris, even the Attorney-General using that term when addressing the Court. Prior to last summer, fully five thousand dollars had been spent in this State defending persons accused of misdemeanor by violation of the Sunday laws, but apparently nothing was accomplished; and in the case of last summer nothing in defense was formulated. The defendants simply made a statement to the Court that they were conscientious in working on Sunday, believing that it was a constitutional and God-given right to do so. They were, however, convicted, and upon refusal to pay the fines and costs, amounting in each case to about twenty-five dollars, were imprisoned in the county jail and required to work upon the streets in the public chain-gang to pay the fines and costs, and also for their board while awaiting the petition for *lunacy* and other offenses against the State.

The facts put out stated, coming to the knowledge of Prof. Jas. T. Ringgold, a member of the Baltimore Bar and Professor of Law in the Baltimore University, that gentleman proffered to the National Religious Liberty Association, through whose politeness he had learned the facts, that if it were permissible to do so, he would appear and defend the persons cited in the present cases. His kind offer was accepted both by the association and by the several defendants, and as fast as possible, with every convenient facility possible, Mr. W. L. Carter, of the local of the place, was employed to assist in the defense.

At this stage of the proceedings, Erskine Tolley, of this State, appeared upon the scene, having been attracted by the notoriety of the "Adventist cases," and by his interest in the principle involved. The result was that not only his friend, Ex-Governor Porter, formerly chief justice of the State, now engaged as the only child magistrate of the State, would also be brought into the defense. Some doubt was expressed as to the probability of securing the services of Judge Porter, but when asked if he would appear as counsel on behalf of the represented men, he not only consented, but his services freely because of his interest in the case, his respect for the parties to be tried, and for the sake of the principle involved.

A committee of Memphis Commercial, and published report is appended.

Persons who take part in defending these men will not be of a class easy to put aside. No religious prejudice or bigotry can be attributed to them. They are men who are willing to stand upon the broad ground of the rights and liberties of all citizens in our free government. They believe in our own government, and that for which it stood when begun, and has been in countenance of those broad provisions of our Constitution, and a broad provision of the constitution of our State, being men of liberal education, they are not afraid of doing what is new to them or averse to prevailing custom. They are above the mean and narrow prejudice that characterizes pharisaical pews and law abiding citizens, whose right to an opinion upon these questions we indeed have injured or discommoded by their unlawful or unchristian conduct. When a citizen asks to be charged with getting fast as I do, as the representative of a denomination that is working for conscience sake, I feel that I am not only justified but justified in saying that I sincerely hope that not long before these cases are finally disposed of on their merits.

Upon examination, the attorneys for the defendants said that several of the instruments were defective, flaws, of, in substance; this was qualified by the court upon motion. This left but two cases for trial at this term of the court. One of these was promptly disposed of, namely that of W. D. Dortch, or rather Mrs. Dortch, known as "Billy Dortch." This case was taken from the jury and a verdict of not guilty ordered upon it; it would have required a verdict of acquittal, without the jury having even left the box.

It was proved Mr. Dortch's case that he had worked for two negroes and one or two hired men on Sunday. On one occasion he was one, by two witnesses, working in his corn-field on Sunday. He was, however, by the same witnesses, "going church" is a custom or habit with Billy; and where the Attorney-General made a desperate effort to prove work on Sunday, going so far as to cite neighbors and attempt to get men upon the stand, Mr. Dortch's own men, a boy of only fourteen years old. But this Judge properly ruled would not permit.

In the jury, the jury, the Attorney-General made an effort to appeal to their religious prejudice, but upon objection, and against the earnest prayer of the prosecutor, to the record. This left him free, also in his own discretion, to make claims for saying it; nevertheless he endeavored also to establish a line of right that it would be a verdict of conviction, which he insisted the jury must bring in or else the whole state of things.

The charge of the Judge was very fair, and so was destructive to all the hopes of the prosecution; and all in combination the Attorney-General abandoned the case, saying that the State would consent to an acquittal. Just as, with the consent of the jury, the Judges entered a verdict of acquittal.

The attorneys are very anxious to take the case to the Supreme Court, feeling that it can be reached there; and so have proceeded on the broadest possible ground in a statement of facts, covering all the material points raised. It is probably fair to say, that the Attorney-General, who is more of a politician than a lawyer, will not agree to such a presentation as will get the facts fairly before the court of last resort, and that no appeal can be made to the Supreme Court of the United States if it is in his power to hinder to try the remainder of this at this term of court.

No evidence was claimed of a good deal in this county since the trials at Henry County. A wide range of "Adventist cases" by such men as Professor Ringgold, Ex-Governor Porter has set people to thinking, and while bigotry and intolerance still live here they are becoming ashamed and are found hiding under every conceivable subterfuge.

Judge Dortch has evidently grown tired of having his court turned into a religious inquisition, and with his study of the law and his understanding of the decision of the Supreme Court, enough to lead him to believe that unless some remedies for conscience' sake, there is neither right, power, nor respectability in penalty for the prosecution and that it should be done away with. But the court must at last revert its own decision in the Parker case from above. So he has come to order a discontinuance of the proceedings against the Adventists in this district. More details and further interesting facts will be given in future issues.
