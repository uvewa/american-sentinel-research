Nature has not changed since the apostolic age, nor even the apostolic order. There is that same patient spirit; that same faith in God's power over and above all matters of religion; that same wrong view of the State and its functions survive. If the *Guide* is Christian, it ought to be able to see that there are erroneous views in circulation regarding the relation of Christianity to civil government. Governments are instituted to protect the minority in their rights; and if there would be no protection for them if the government were ruled by a majority of religionists. They would be compelled to believe as the majority believed, whether that belief was right or wrong—right or suffer the penalty.

How can Christian union be gained in the world to-day? It is only because Christians of the different denominations are not consistent; because one sect persecutes another. How can Christians be the means of converting an infidel when they do not follow the teaching of the Bible; when they say that the first day meets the requirement of the fourth commandment, while the fourth commandment and the Bible teaches that the seventh day is; when they say that the State has the right to compel in religion, and the Bible teaches that it should not; on the contrary, that Christians will live and teach consistently a pure religion before the world, and not say that there is a power in the government to force men to be religious. This alone will bring Church union. But the *Guide* does not draw the line on this. The Bible and God are nothing; the State is everything, in the minds of that class of people; and what is this but a transfer of power, and not from God. It does not matter to them how much a conscientious man suffer so long as Sunday is exalted, nothing else matters.

The legislator must decide between the rights of the Sunday rest and the common right of the citizens; and a proper and equal enforcement of Sunday law and the consequent punishment of the violators of it must be had for one man whose religion is a greater manifestation of liberty.

The legislator must decide who does the work. Christians and who are not. The legislator must decide what is sin; not God. If the Government would punish those "enemies," "Adventists" for this fearful sin of keeping the seventh-day Sabbath by their own free choice and by the teaching of the Scriptures and free thought and conscience of the whole. Which is right, to obey the God or the legislator? Let the Bible answer: "That Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men."
