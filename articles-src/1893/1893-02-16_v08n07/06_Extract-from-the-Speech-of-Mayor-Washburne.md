MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN of the Committee: I appreciate the opportunity that I might be called upon to speak before so distinguished a body, and on a question of such vast interest, touching as it does the welfare of ninety-five or a hundred millions of our population. In the first place I deny the right of this body, or of any other legislative body, of the State or of the Nation, to say what day the citizens of this country shall work or rest upon. If it is a question of religion, the matter is settled by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I do not feel at liberty to discuss the subject of religion here.

The preamble of the act of Congress authorizing the holding of the World's Columbian Exposition stated in substance that an exhibit should be a national exhibit, managed and conducted in all respects so as to be representative not only the people of our Union and this continent, but of all the nations which can participate, and should therefore have no distinctive religious character. The law stands so of itself.

Who expected to have a distinctively religious character attached to that great exposition? Why not have set out that the Fair was intended to be religious? The people of our Union and this State, who are in common with the National Government, contributing to and participating in this exposition, are a distinctively mixed people. You have invited to it not only our own people, but the people of Europe, of Asia, of Africa, and of all the islands of the sea, without distinction of race or creed, or religion or nationality, and the Fair should be of such a character as will make it acceptable to all its participants, to the entire world.

Moreover this Exhibition created by Congress has authorized the expenditure of vast sums. It is a great international enterprise of such a character that invites the cooperation and participation of all nations, irrespective of their religious beliefs. To give it a distinctive religious character by closing it on Sunday at the dictation of a particular religious body, and thus exclude those who cannot come on other days, would be a violation of the spirit of the enterprise.

It is a very important question as to what the Fair shall be open to every day. The matter ought not to be left to the dictation or the command of any religious body or the city ordinances shall say the Fair shall not be open on Sunday. If it is a question of the convenience and the welfare and the comfort of the workingmen, let the managers make such reasonable arrangements as will give every worker a day of rest during the week. But it is a wholly different thing to close the Fair on any particular day by legislative enactment. This would be to establish a precedent of the union of Church and State in this country, and would be a blow at the fundamental principles of religious freedom upon which this Government was founded.

Moreover this Exhibition created by Congress, and carried out under its authority, ought to be of international character "so that this continent, but of those of all nations in whose interest this Congress appropriated money, as Congress intends it to be, to the work of all the peoples of every nation. You have invited not only Americans, but the people of China and Japan and Turkey, the people of Europe who regard Saturday or Friday as their day of rest and religion, and we should not exclude them. To close the Fair on Sunday is to close it to the very people who most need to come.

Gentlemen, I trust this committee will see its way to do justice to the people, to the Exposition, and to the cause of religious liberty. Let this great Fair be open every day of the week, and let every citizen be free to attend it or not, as his conscience may dictate.
