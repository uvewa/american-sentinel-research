The excitement on the question of Sunday closing of theaters in Denver seems to have been felt as far as Oakland, Cal., for:

The German-American Political Club held a meeting and adopted the following resolutions:—

"WHEREAS, A movement is under way, instigated by certain parties, having for its object the closing of the theaters of Oakland on Sundays, therefore be it

"Resolved, That we, as citizens of this great Republic, most energetically protest against what we conceive to be an infringement upon our rights and liberties; and, furthermore, that we consider the visiting of a decent theater on Sunday an innocent recreation after six days of labor and toil; and we further think such efforts are contrary to the Constitution of the United States, which does not recognize State religion, and consequently can not endorse a one-sided edict for the keeping of Sunday, which we consider a day of rest."

The question is not as to whether it is a proper or a profitable way to spend Sunday, or any other evening, at the theater. But it is a very important question by what right either the ministerial alliance or the city ordinances shall say that the Denverites, or the German-Americans of Oakland, may not go to the theater if they see fit on any evening they choose.
