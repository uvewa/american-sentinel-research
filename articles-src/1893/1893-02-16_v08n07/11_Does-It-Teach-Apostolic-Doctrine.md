The *Apostolic Guide,* that journal which advocates church unity, and at the same time standing for law to compel all men to keep Sunday, has this, under the heading, "Fighting the Sects":—

In order to fight in order other churches. It is said to recognize only the law of Christ; it professed to follow Christ and only Christ as its leader. The evangelist must have for truth and love as much attraction as falsehood has for evil; if not more.

If the *Guide,* and all others who are clamoring for Sunday laws, would follow this principle, there would be many more Christians than there are, for this is the spirit, law, and method of the Master we follow, and which they left for all other believers to follow,—with a faith and love beginning and ending in a faith and love the gospel," and not compel them. Christ was persuasion. He could not use force, and shall do the same, or we shall be Christ. As to the Adventists particularly, we will want to them in this spirit, but it is strange, to come upon a Christian community, by compulsion. They will pretend to be good, but the least that it will give is an evil in that is not the kind of Christianity God required; it stands within its the several opinions and others, but she looked on the heart." In best services that the Lord requires of us for all men even our enemies—are love, gentleness, and only hypocrites.

The State has the right to whatever is essential to the preservation of law and order, and whatever is needed to secure this, and should make no laws beyond this. The State is a government; it is something different from a social condition, with the respect that the State has the right to enact and to enforce laws for the preservation of law and good society. But by proper and wise application of the gospel of peace, the State can be kept in better peace. But by proper and wise application the said religionists had may chance to be the representatives. You are, in principle, going quotations from the *Guide* into the principle, the Bible, and everything that Christ taught, that is, by persuasion, not by compulsion.

The State has the right to whatever is essential to the protection of law and life and property, and the maintenance of those social conditions, without which civil government itself must fail. For the protection of these it has a right to enact and to enforce laws. It has the right to maintain peace and order; and for this purpose it has a right to raise an army of men at work upon railways, canals, mines or factories; or to employ a police which can be employed without serious difficulty, but when the State undertakes to enter upon the work of religion, to compel men to keep Sunday, in prescribing and other religious observances, it goes beyond its just province. The only way to make men Christians is by the gospel; the only way to make them moral is by persuasion and religious conviction; it has been so from the beginning of time. Fining men, confiscating their property, and locking them up in jail for opinion's sake, are methods of moral coercion will ruin the State. The only effect of such a course is to embitter the man who is fined and imprisoned. It has never been known in the history of the world to make men religious, and the result of the injury inflicted upon a few men who happen to be in the power of those whom they offend by their non-conformity, every law advocates to suffer for the whole State to let others in peace their own convictions.

Is not the *Guide* somewhat inconsistent? It first says that Christians should persuade men to be religious, and should do it by means of the Sunday-school, the pulpit, the observance of the Sabbath, and other religious training, and then urges that to make men religious by the police power of the State ought to be used. But is the same power equally powerful to compel men to exact and enforce laws supporting all conscientiously observe Sunday? It thus says, "Certainly not." But it proceeds to urge upon the legislature to pass laws compelling men to observe Sunday. What are Sunday laws for if they have not, and are not, for religious purposes? What has it to do with civil affairs? Its function is to protect the people, not to enforce law!

They are trying to bring about apostolic church unity, but it can not do this until it drops it; we might say better, not do it until it stops "fighting the sects." You can never be church truism who while you are fighting against it. Apostolic doctrine bounds to destroy Christianity, and not to build churches. He who takes the sword shall perish by the sword. How long will it be before we shall learn from history that the effort to unite church and state has proved a failure?

Allow us to suggest, that inasmuch as God has left this to the church and to the conscience, and has not made it a matter of civil legislation, that it cannot be wisely legislated; ought not, and ought to be, a felony in any and every State to punish a man for his religion. What would you do, and what would you think, what would do yourselves honor if you had found it in any European legislation? Every one of those wicked religious bigots of Henry VIII and Elizabeth and the Stuarts and Louis XIV will drive the keepers of the consciences of these so-called Christians into rebellion if they are not checked by some legal enactment stops the months and years. It is in the interest and a heritage of Christianity that there is no right to interfere, and a heritage of the people that the government exist better and the religion prosper better than their persecutors; and therefore let us admonish the *Guide* that it let men alone, and that it be content to be doing a good thing. Is not a man's religion and his conscience, with all the hopes of a man's life, then, a three-fold the cord stronger than all politics and all the authority the State can possess. Is it not so? And would you not want to deal more than unjust with this his vital concern, than would be doing a good thing, then? The very existence of a State exists to exercise a malicious persecution in the name of religion.

We are Adventists and have no fear. The truth and love of the Lord of all the truth and love of the Lord of all the universe, the Almighty, is on our side. We will do right, as well as the rapidly passing events now in our view so abundantly prove, and it is all a part of the great and comprehensive plan of restoration, and in God's work. But the persecution being endured by a few of our number, should strongly appeal to the conscience of the equality of friends to Christianity as a whole and ought to force them to stand, if they have nothing in it, deep in their hearts before neither God nor the truth or the methods to promote it.
