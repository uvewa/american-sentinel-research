**Note.**—Any one receiving the American Sentinel, without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend, unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It is our invariable rule to send out to papers without pay in advance, except by special arrangement, therefore, those who have not ordered the Sentinel, need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office.

The latest word from the "Adventist cases" at Paris, Tenn., is this: "The remaining case for possible trial at this term of court was continued yesterday on affidavit by the Attorney-General that the State could not safely go to trial because of the absence of important witnesses. It is almost certain that no conviction can ever be had in the case. The charge of the Judge in the Dortch case was such as to make it almost impossible to convict any one of Sunday work unless the work were done in an exceedingly open and public manner."

The present status of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee is worthy of careful notice. These cases have attracted the attention of candid, clear-minded, and able, lawyers and legislators. These men, having a correct view of the purpose and intent of law and legislation, realize the error, the inequity, the inconsistency of existing law under which such persecutions can be had. To have called to the defense of truth, those who love truth, and right, and justice, for their own sake is much. But the greater thing yet remains for all,—to still stand for its defense in the coming day of its seeming defeat and ignominy.
