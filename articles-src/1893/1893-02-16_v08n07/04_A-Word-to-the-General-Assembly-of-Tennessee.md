[The earnest and well-timed appeal to the General Assembly of Tennessee, published below, was read from the Pulpit of Nashville, Tenn.]

The legislature of Tennessee will be in session here in our beautiful capitol building when this number of the *Capitol* shall be in the hand of its constituents and readers. As a whole month will intervene, we shall have occasion and chance to speak to those honored representatives of the people of our State, and they will then be along in their ninety-day biennial session; we want to be in hearing of their clemency upon subjects in which, as ministers, as men, and as servants of God, we feel a profound interest.

There are two questions, or a question of one or two aspects, both of them distinctly moral, for the consideration of the present assembly of a State's legislature, with which we think they can not well be silent, and on which there must be action, for they are an incorporated part of the American system. Ours is a State where a system of religious persecution exists. Nation is a widening reach of the Romanian persecution of the Jews, and it can be done through proper representation of our senators and request of our representatives to Congress. That is all we shall say now upon this question. The corruption of sin in our national spirit and life are such more pressing, and it is upon ourselves our own door, in fact it is in our domestic affairs, that the real testing of all that we believe in the right kind of religion, will come before them in the case of the prosecution of a class of quiet, orderly and useful men, women and children, citizens of the county and district in the State of Henry. It will be for this legislature of these honest-men, and we hope that facing men, when the favor and discretion of their fellow-citizens chose them, to determine how far and to what extent the legislature here, to legislate for the commonwealth, to say whether they endorse that State's Country to persecute or not. It will be in their power to purge the Statute amended so good citizens under a form of law have been persecuted in utter defiance, despise the spot of infamy and injure those unfortunates who own, and are to own that they belong to Tennessee.

It is to be hoped that they will not be starting a wine and patentist substance, and by their legislation will make it its especial care to prepare and bring forward a proper bill for the repeal of all laws or parts of laws upon our statute books in compliance with which any man's religious belief can be made the occasion of his own fine, his own imprisonment, or the indulgence of his own persecutors and petty spite of that major. Let every man who believes in the liberty of the said religionists had may chance to be the representatives. You are, in principle, the Tennessee General Assembly—let us say it in all earnestness and respect—you owe it to the Constitution of your State, and to the spirit of the times we live on, to the genius of this enlightened age, and to your solemn oaths as now contained with the constitutional obligations imposed upon your State (that, under the law of conscience, every man's religious convictions should be allowed to guide his own conduct, be settled by his individual free will), to bring a good measure, a forthright proper course, so directed to be in accord with and under observance of a great national Constitution which as you all well know forbids the passage of any law that interferes with the freedom of conscience in the practice of a man's religion; you owe it to the truth of God and the voice of the very constituencies that he has put within you, to do the thing suggested, and to act promptly and without delay! These are not questions to be discussed and debated; you are, in one sense under American law, are upon you, under obligation (never mind the other business); for it is a matter in which every true Christian, every loyal citizen, and every man in fact whose heart has not, from long
