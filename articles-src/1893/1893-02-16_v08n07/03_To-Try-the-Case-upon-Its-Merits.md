A CORRESPONDENT for the Memphis *Commercial,* at the Seventh-day Adventist trials at Paris, Tenn., published an interview had previous to the calling of the cases, with Professor T. Ringgold, who was for the first time employed as counsel in the defense. Mr. Ringgold is a member of the Baltimore Bar and a lecturer in the Baltimore Law School. This is what he said:—

I suppose you want me to tell you something about what I have come here to do. I have taken considerable interest in the question of religious liberty in its relation to politics, and especially to legislation, and through a work on that subject which I brought recently before a body acquainted with the National Religious Liberty Association, which I found to be composed largely of Seventh-Day Adventists. At the annual meeting of that body I had a warm just interest in this cause of religious liberty, we come to a closer acquaintance, and naturally I heard of the proceedings against the Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, proceedings similar to those to which our Hebrew fellow-citizens are exposed in other States.

Naturally, I at once wrote to the secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, stating that I could be of any service whatever in defending these people it would give me pleasure to volunteer my time and labor in the good cause. My proposition was accepted, and that is the reason I happen to be on the ground. You will understand, therefore, that my coming is a matter in by no means that of mere professional interest. I realize very well that there is an issue at stake in all such cases as those, irrespective altogether of the religious convictions of those concerned. With this idea I have persuaded Ex-Governor Porter, who has every legal resource in that favor, and whose services may add weight to our position, to act as counsel with W. L. Carter of your bar. I may add that the state counsel who has appeared to is making a paper to the effect that Mr. Robert C. Etter, Prosecutor, agreed to give the lawyers facilities to try this case upon its merits.

Of course this is not the time to detail any of the points which Mr. Court or I propose to make; it is quite sufficient to say that we come with good intentions before the court, and that we come prepared for the jury, but I have no objections to telling you that we have a good chance of winning our cases largely upon an expression of opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, given in substance, in a previous case of similar character. I have been informed that Mr. Etter recently claimed that he intended "to have the laws against Adventists vigorously enforced." This is just as he should do. We all agree; and all the desire. We shall enter no special plea for exemption on any ground; nor will we contend for delay for the own sake. On the contrary, we shall insist upon this: that in order that a criminal law shall be "strictly enforced" it is necessary that it shall be tried before a court and jury, ascertained in favor of the accused and not for the State, to be in conformity to that organic law, the constitution. If to the satisfaction of the learned judge that there is conflict between the Sunday law and the provisions of law growing out of these truths we shall urge that nothing short of strict enforcement of the law requires that we say so on the bench and decide not as much on its strict enforcement will justify. Because, if it be wrong, you and I and the jury, shall give us the benefit of every reasonable doubt. If right, it may be given to the jury, if the learned judge will permit an investigation, on the merits, of the law for which we shall contend. I shall not contend, because no man can at this distant guarantee that his rulings will be for the defense, but I shall do my best to see that they cover every possible point, and I feel it my professional duty to study all of the law that there is for us, but not one item more, and to make the best argument of which I am capable.

"I understand from what you tell me, and what I have learned, that you are not a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and have no interest at all of that nature in this business?"

I am a communicant of the Protestant Episcopal Church, but while my religion tells me that the Lord's day falls on Sunday, just as it has on Christianity, the seventh-day Sabbath on Saturday, Adventism, the forty days of Lent, and many other days, I am not aware of anything in the doctrine or discipline which nature requires its members or the police power of the State to compel people to keep within or outside of its pale, to observe a different set of conduct on Sunday, or any other of the days named; and I certainly have no manner of conflict which he observes on any other day or days nor am I free to question the right that I am as free to advocate the absolute
