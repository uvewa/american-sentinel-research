PERSONAL responsibility to God ought to be a principle which should enter into every transaction of life. That "every man must give account of himself to God" is a solemn truth of Scripture. We are therefore personally responsible to God. No society or organization or body politic of which we may be a part has any claim upon us which ought for a moment to transcend this obligation. In mere matters of opinion, where moral principles are not involved, in matters where our duties lie in the same lines and are based on the same principles as these organizations, it is good to have company, and in union there is strength. But where moral principle is involved, we should not follow a multitude to sin. Let personal responsibility to God rule. Acting as in his sight, for his sake who bought us, will but unite us in God's own better way with all the good in the universe. Although under the power of the enemy this may seem to leave us alone, leave it with God, and endure "as seeing Him who is invisible."—Signs of the Times.
