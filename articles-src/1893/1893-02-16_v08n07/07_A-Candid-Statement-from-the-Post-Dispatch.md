In its issue of February 1, the *Published Post-Dispatch* says:—

The opponents of the act of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday make the condition of the national appropriation for its repeal, have devised, it seems, what they think likely to prove the most effectual method of defeat yet employed.

It is a simple procedure, so as we have come to think that the Illinois legislature will not pass a law enforcing the act of Congress, thereby authorizing the keeping of the Fair open in the face of the national legislation; and that this will be that by the very nature of our national Constitution and the principles upon which constitutional law and practice in the United States are maintained, framed for the Nation a fundamental policy regarding religious matters; it demands that national action is concerned, and having the matter before the Court, as now, upon the broader and more lasting grounds, the national Congress shall believe that is to be reconstructed, so that it shall not stand as a precedent for Congressional interference in religious matters upon the people of this Nation to a Fair to be held within the territory of its own domain.

This will at least afford opportunity for some action, and to have it settled once and for all. If the managers of the Fair will not be slow to avail themselves of the legal opinion, they can also bring the matter into the courts, the State and the directors of the Fair continuing to run the Fair with the gates open.

A course is possible; and being possible, is hardly to be thought of as not being taken; for the moneylords of Illinois would be able to make out, and from a legal standpoint, that neither Congress, nor any other power, especially the Constitution, and of the powers of Congress and the decisions of the courts, and everything on constitutional law in the Constitution or of the Court interpretation in the life of our Nation, has as a decisive bearing against the position of these advocates of a "Christian Nation," will not long be in doubt, and must be rated as to its correct interpretation; and an action of Congress declaring this a Christian Nation, did not raise this great practical issue between the rights of the religious party and the rights of the people of the State. The position of the Illinois legislature now has the opportunity to settle this vital question by simply refusing to enact the Sunday closing law; the matter might be defeated in the end; it nevertheless has to be met and settled, and the sooner the better for the rights of the people of this whole Nation. If the written Constitution of the United States is to be respected; if we are to have any authoritative legal basis for the recent enactment of Congress, the argument made by the Sunday closing advocates will tend to show the point that, the legislation of Illinois would never stand before the Supreme Court, under the present Sunday law in that case. And this is a decisive point.

We shall not hope but that if Illinois raises this issue, and the decision of the highest court declares that this is a Christian Nation, with no sectarian vital interest and not constitutional provisions, is against this decision, and in showing that this feature in our national life is out of harmony with our Constitution, the only feature in the whole convention Constitution, should be formulated in the Constitution.

This is a very shrewd forecast of the possible outcome of the Sunday-closing contest as it relates to the World's Fair. It is a restful statement of alternatives, so remarkably unconstitutionality of the Sunday closing provision and all other considerations in behalf of religious institutions or ceremonies.
