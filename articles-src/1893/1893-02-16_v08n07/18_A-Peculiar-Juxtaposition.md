The Mail and Express, of January 30, and 31, contains editorial texts and news items in such relation to each other as will appear to Seventh-day Adventists both suggestive and strikingly apt, though of course quite unintentional.

The scriptural text at the head of the editorial column of the issue of January 30, is:—

> Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil; but to the counselors of peace is joy.

In the news columns of the same issue is this:—

> For violating Sunday laws,—Seventh-day Adventists on trial in Tennessee. Eleven Seventh-day Adventists were placed on trial in the Henry County criminal court at Paris this morning for violating the law of Tennessee by working on their farms on Sunday.

The day following the scriptural text is this:—

> He shall not fail nor be discouraged till He have set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.

And the accompanying news item is as follows:—

> Seventh-day Adventists meet. The Seventh-day Adventist Ministers' Institute is in session here. (Battle Creek, Mich.) Over four hundred ministers are here and about fifty are arriving daily. They represent nearly every portion of America, South Africa, England, Australia, and the Scandinavian countries. This Institute is preparatory to the thirtieth International Conference, which begins here February 17.

An application of these texts, to the incidents narrated under them, may be made by the denomination in question, which is not only striking but significant.

Certainly, deceit has shown itself to be in the heart of those who desire evil against the Seventh-day observers on trial in Tennessee, but in the heart of the persecuted, whose counsel to all men is peace, is joy. They know their God will not fail nor be discouraged, and that he is now sitting in judgment on the earth, while the isles which have waited for his law are receiving it; and that the convocation and conference noted is another assurance of this.
