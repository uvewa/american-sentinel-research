[This comment on the opinion from Justice Brewer that this is "a Christian Nation" is well worth considering.]

A COMMENTARY, commenting on the decision, says: This expression should not be construed as a matter of compulsion by the government of any individuals who may believe otherwise. To say that this country is a Christian country in so far that we owe the laws or the civilization which it has asserted this to be "a Christian Nation." This, of course, was the language of the demagogue, the hypocrite, the Pharisee. We are just now free from this danger of the Christian standard; and from it, the real tolerance of widows and, for a prisoner, make him judge; and welcome those in or out of office, and see the cure one must not forget; for compulsion is the resort of those who cannot convince, the cane who always shall ready to appeal to a power outside of themselves, and who is unwilling, to crucify every Christ who crosses their path.

It was never intended that this should be a "Christian Nation" in the sense that Christians, Jews, heathens, and infidels—all people—should be guaranteed full enjoyment of entire liberty of conscience. It was never intended that any Jew or any Gentile, any Christian or any heathen, any Christian or any number of Christians shall compel any other to act as they wanted; on the contrary, that liberty of conscience and of belief was a matter of right, and not of the mere toleration of any Christian or of any majority whatever.

To a certain class of persons it seems hopeless that the doctrines of Christianity should ever fail; but where they cram these things down men's throats, as they sometimes cut off the ear of the high priest's servant. The Church was designed to be a persuader, and that was the type. They are continually attempting to accomplish by force what Christ himself could accomplish only by persuasion, to strike some one whom they regard as an enemy of religion, is out of the power of some class in "the community that they regard as inimical to Christianity. To them there is no meaning in the command, "Put up thy sword into the sheath," and they can understand nothing of that selfpossessive spirit, with the reply to that: "If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight."
