Now that Congress has gone beyond the Constitution on one point, for religious ends, and has legislated to close the World's Fair on Sunday, it may, for the same reasons, be pushed on to any or every extreme.

The Congress of the United States had no right to put the Bible into the legislation and make it the basis of any legislative enactment. The Constitution is the proper basis of congressional legislation, not the Bible. But the Constitution has been ignored and legislation had upon an assumed Biblical basis. To reach this the Constitution has been violated, the word of God has been blasphemed, and a statutory misinterpretation of the Bible adopted.

The commandment says the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord; but in the face of this plain declaration the Senate of the United States has put its own interpretation upon that commandment, and has declared that statement "the seventh day is the Sabbath" means the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday. Thus the Congress of the United States has taken the fourth commandment from the Bible and put it into its legislation, and has put its own interpretation upon the divine statute.

If Congress can do this in one case, can it not do so in others? It can; it can do it in any case; it can interpret the Bible in any case; it can interpret the Bible at every point. When Congress went beyond the Constitution in this, it did put itself and the Government in line with the Church and State governments that have ever been, and assumed itself to be the interpreter of the Bible for all the people in the land, and to hold all in its own line. More than that, it not only assumed to itself the right and the authority to interpret and enforce divine law as such, but in doing that it put the stamp of its legislative approval upon a given religious and doctrinal belief. It made an adherence to that belief and observance distinctively meritorious to citizens under this Government. It built a sure foundation for that line of judicial precedent in religious law for which there can never hereafter been laid any adequate basis.

This is not strictly an adequate basis, but it will no doubt be accepted as such in connection with the Supreme Court's decision that this is a "Christian Nation." It may be that in its Supreme Court it has acted upon during the coming year to state its position upon this definitely, and not in general terms. This may be brought about through the fact that, as State rights, as to whether Congress has any jurisdiction within the municipality of Chicago by which it may or can penalize the Sunday-closing provision, or lay any penalty for its non-observance. It may come through an appeal from the lower courts of cases now brought under a religious statute or judicial precedent. However it may be, it is not likely that the Supreme Court can long avoid the responsibility of stating directly the position it has taken in the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity of New York. When that point is reached in the Supreme Court, this Nation and its so-called Constitution will face an awkward alternative. It will be necessary either to abrogate the First Amendment to the Constitution, or to reverse the "Christian Nation" decision. Reasoning for Congress-power men have not been grasped by it; or the opinion of Justice Brewer that this is a "Christian Nation," and in which the entire bench concurred, will have to be reversed.

The possibilities, rather even the probabilities, of the continuance of the Sunday-closing contest as regards the World's Fair,—and of appeal to the highest court of Sunday-law cases on their merits,—are fraught with much that is incontestable to the occupants of the Supreme Bench. Congress took the fatal step in haste last session. It abates at the position in which it finds itself and in face of the Church party it refuses now to retrace its steps, or even consider the propriety of so doing. When the Supreme Court is put in a similar position what will be its attitude? Will it refuse to revise or abrogate the Brewer decision and allow this revolution to take its course?
