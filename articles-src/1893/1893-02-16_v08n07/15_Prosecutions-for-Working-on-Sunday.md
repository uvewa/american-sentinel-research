The latest word from the *Advertiser* at Paris, Tenn., is this: "The remaining case for possible trial at this term of court was continued yesterday by affidavit by the Attorney-General that the absence of an important witness in the trial. It is almost certain that no conviction can now be had in the term; the change in the Judge is the Judge in the course was such as no one anticipated. It amounts to convict any case of Sunday work unless the work were done in an exposed or conspicuous public manner."

The present status of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee is worthy of careful notice. These cases have attracted the attention of candid, clear-minded men, able, high-principled lawyers. These men, having a correct view of the purposes and intent of law and legislation; realize the error, the inequity, the wrong of the persecution, but quite too late which such persecution can be had. To these men we owe much. They are willing to stand for the defense of truth, for those who love truth, and right, and justice, for their own sake in itself. But the greatest thing yet of remain for all,—to still stand for the defense in the coming day of its waiting denied of their rights.

Prosecutions for working on Sunday are gradually becoming the recognized order of the day—the arrangement of six men for violation of the Sunday law, on February 6, in this city, is recorded as follows:

Louis Pease, of France from, shirt manufacturer, No. 43 Broadway and Fuldy Streets—also a clothing manufacturer, No. 244 Broadway, were arraigned in the Tombs Police Court, yesterday, morning, with working on Sunday. Pease entered the plea of not guilty, their lawyers setting day for hearing. Koch, first name not known, were discharged.

Barbers were also arraigned in the Manhattan Market Police Court, viz.: N. B. Kraus, No. 99 Kraus Avenue, Joseph Cook, No. 64 Stack Avenue, and Bernard Felkowski, No. 116 Sixth Avenue, first has earned keeps a saloon and was charged with violating the excise laws on Sunday. The others are millers; clothing dealers. Koch held at $100 each for trial in the Court of Special Sessions.

Patrick Hook, of No. 111 Pearl Street, a fireman in the employ of T. W. Blanchard, was in the police district of Police Magistrate yesterday, charged under the Sunday law in conducting the work of leaving shaved barbers during the dark hours of the evening, was held in $100 for examination by Justice Byrne.

When two obtained their discharge by swearing that they were observers of the seventh day were subjected to civil surveillance of their religion precisely; the same in character, though not in kind, as they would have been forced to submit to in Russia. And as for those who were held, where is the distinction between the unwarrantable authority exercised over their lives and similar, for the sake of religion, is the domination of the Czar?
