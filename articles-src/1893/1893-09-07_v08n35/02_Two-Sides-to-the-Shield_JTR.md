PROFESSOR HUXLEY, at the opening of Johns Hopkins University, parodying the words of one greater than he, observed: "It is undoubtedly true that man shall not live by bread alone, but by ideas."

Unfortunately, pending the final perfection of "telepathy," or the direct communication from one mind to another by mere "cerebration," we can convey ideas only by words. This method is and must always remain imperfect. After the preliminary formulation of one's idea, comes the labor of clothing it in articulate language. Every thinker has experienced a frequent difficulty in performing this work to his own satisfaction—that is, in so selecting and adjusting his words that his own mind will recognize in them the precise embodiment of his thought, and neither more nor less. How much harder is it to make sure that the phraseology, in general and particular, shall convey to all who read, the writer's meaning and nothing else.

This uncertainty of language, in the most expert hands, has brought infinite trouble on mankind. Ill-will incalculable has been excited, and oceans of blood have been spilt as the outcome of controversies which might have been avoided if either side had understood what the other side meant, or, indeed, in many cases, if it had been quite clear to either what it meant itself by the propositions for which it contended.

There is an application of these remarks to the language of President Andrews, of Brown University, quoted in the SENTINEL of the 3d ult., "The artificial separation between what is known as religious and what is known as secular," the learned president pronounces, "if carried to the extreme to be prejudicial to society," and the rightfulness of such a separation to him is "untrue from a religious point of view and deleterious from a civil and social point of view." Never was the case of the two knights who killed each other to settle the question whether the shield suspended over their heads was of gold or of silver, it being in fact golden on the side turned towards one of them, and silver on the side facing the other, more forcibly recalled to the writer's mind than when he read this passage. Never did the advice of a great philosopher seem more pertinent: "When a man asks you 'Do you think so and so,'" on some abstract question, reply by asking him, "What do you mean by 'so and so?'" In the majority of cases, you will find that he himself attaches no definite idea to the formula which some one has taught him, and which he repeats Poll-parrot-wise." When this learned president speaks of the separation of things secular from things religious, it is in order to ask him what he means by that. It is expedient to tell him that his shield has two sides, that there is a sense in which this separation is not merely "false" in theory, and "deleterious" in practice, but is absolutely impossible; and another sense, in which it is not merely right and proper but absolutely essential to the preservation of liberty and the welfare of humanity.

From the individual side of the shield this separation can never be made. "Religion's chief concern," says Mr. Matthew Arnold, rightly, "is conduct; and conduct is three-fourths of human life." It is the Christian doctrine that there can be no true religion in any man without its expression in conduct—that is to say, its daily and hourly application by the man himself to all his secular relations. Under the Mosaic dispensation, there was an external, visible identification of Church and State—that is to say, men were kept in order by physical penalties, inflicted in the name of Deity. In every Christian's heart this identification is equally complete—only he is constrained to right doing not by fear, but love. "Thus sail'd the Lord," is with him the standard of conduct. Applying this standard to his relations with his fellow-man, he finds things secular a part of things religious, and needs no civil penalties or police to keep him straight in the narrow path.

But it is plain enough that with such a man as this and such a standard of conduct as this, the State, the government, whatever name we chose to give to the machinery, whereby the force of society is applied to the individual, can have nothing whatever to do. No occasion for the application of such force to true Christians can possibly arise in these days. Moreover, it is impossible, from the Christian point of view, that religion should be aided in any way by the civil power. Conduct may, indeed, be compelled, but no act or course of conduct resulting from compulsion can be in any degree whatever religious according to Christianity. Again, government has no means whatever of ascertaining what conduct is or is not required by religion. The only government that ever had the means of finding this out was that established by Moses. While the revelation of the divine will, under any given circumstances, may still come to any individual heart that is ready to receive it, no modern legislature has authority to begin an enactment with the phrase, "Thus saith the Lord."

Two sides, then, to the shield of "separation between things religious and things secular"—their identification by the individual, in the internal union of Church and State, so that he is honest and clean, and good for his religion's sake, their total disconnection in civil administration, so that the State shall engage neither in the impossible task of settling what religious duties are, nor in the blasphemous folly of attempting to enforce them, as such.

It is only by observing this distinction that we can understand what is meant by "religious liberty"—the absolute equality of all religions and of no-religion, not as between themselves, but before the law. The professional thief and a bishop contending for a piece of real estate stand on a plane of equality in the civil court. In deciding between them, the law neither approves nor disapproves the principles or practices of either. So, in keeping all religions on a level, it does not undertake to decide, but declines to consider, as beyond its ken, their comparative merits. This is the doctrine of Roger Williams, and the doctrine of those who are fighting the hard fight for religious equality to-day.
