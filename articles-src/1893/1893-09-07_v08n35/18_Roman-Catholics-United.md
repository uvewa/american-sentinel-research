THOSE Protestants who have been told a hope that Roman Catholics in the United States were about to become hopelessly divided, were wise to listen before the Corrigan-Satolli imbroglio would. The matter has been cleared up without schism, and the archbishop and nuncio have settled their differences, and all that we learn that the Republic good in the United States is dead. Rome is fast outgoing the betrayals of American liberty, and thousands of so-called Protestants, "progressive social order sailors," are giving her active aid and sympathy.
