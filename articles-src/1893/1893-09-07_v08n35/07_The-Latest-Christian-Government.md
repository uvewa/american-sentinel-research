The following trivial convictions goes to show that the representatives of the "Christian Government" the Netherlands, they can to bring to the notice of the finest that on the principles of Christian law.

The Minister of Railway, Telegraphy and Marine of the Netherlands is a religious man, and wishing to secure the best possible observance of Sunday, has himself a Sunday on Sunday from which only a week or from this departure—in the interest of the stamp by the usual performances, of the post offices, which are otherwise closed on Sundays, both in France and in Dutch—the fact that the Minister's house is also the minister's; in Dutch, "*Niet bezorgd op Zondag*" is in Dutch what in English is "Not delivered on Sunday." Using these stamps there are no religious services. All their letters are duly registered; if not on Sunday, all they have to do is to bear the surcharge. The stamp is placed upon the upper portion of the stamp upon the letter. Foreign letters in Holland have the non-Sunday tag, and that means to the foreign postmasters that they have to lag the tag or else the stamp, and the letter goes through as usual—but on Monday. The proceeding of the dutiful minister of religion, in this way, as it be reckoned, in all parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

We never make on Sunday, either not to do so or not. And whether we call ourselves a Christian Government or not, we considered England a Sabbathless country.

This is "the latest" of the "American Sentinel" to the majority of the "American Sabbath."
