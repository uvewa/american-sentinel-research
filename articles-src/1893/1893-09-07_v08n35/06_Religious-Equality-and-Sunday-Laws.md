ON Monday evening, July 17, Jas. Ringgold, of Baltimore, delivered an address at Chicago, on the subject of "Religious Equality and Sunday Laws." Mr. Ringgold began his lecture with a clear and bold statement. He distinguished between religious equality and inequality or the position of a superior inequality or the position of a superior state as inferior. Between toleration and persecution, he said, there was no distinction whatever; both toleration, indeed, implies the right to persecute, and forbearance only at the pleasure of the person exercising it, events will. He said that there was some danger even in the use of the phrase, religious equality, for it seems to imply that people are apt to connect what they call the civil institutions against them; whereas, religious liberty, when it is the expression of religious equality, refers to a gift of the Deity to man, which is not based upon any particular constitution, statutory system, and which cannot be affected by human or human laws.

The lecturer said that whenever religious inequality existed, there was to be tolerated any religion established by law or an established church, though there might more be toleration for other churches or faiths. He then traced the rise of the union of Church and State, and of the belief in the absolute necessity of this union to the possession of social order, back to this beginning of society, when the prince and the priest conspired together to impose a perennial yoke upon the people; the compact between them being for the priest to instruct the people to obey the king and the king should pay the priest out of the public treasury for his services. He said that all government was originally based from the very nature of things, upon the consent of the governed, and that the idea of divine right, or of a government existing by the power of God, began when the union of Church and State was thus established and hereafter right or "the right divine to govern wrong," was then inaugurated. This pagan practice—he mentioned the celebrated case in which he—was regarded by the pagans as themselves in the possession of social order. He then quoted from Mac-chiasvelli, Corbridge, Bismarck, Gladstone, and others, to show that this pagan idea had thoroughly permeated the minds of Christian philosophers and statesmen.

After alluding to the initiative of the pagan system of this regard to the Christian nations of Europe and to the advantages of the American system, he proceeded to discuss Church property exemptions. Mr. Ringgold proceeded at some length to show that the union of Church and State is established by law in every one of the colonies which otherwise are a part of the American Union, and that it still exists in every American State. He called attention to the anomalous greatly founded in which, by a prominent provision, our paper, that they could join the United States without compromising in any way the law that established that this was alarming because it was true, there being in the journals no essential need, under the law to prevent many American States from setting up an established church at any time in the Federal Constitution—only two States having an establishment of religion, such an arrangement in their own favor.

Among the traces of religious belief historically and therefore of established church, by the present enacted law of American States, Mr. Ringgold discussed Church property exemption from taxation, and the Church property, based upon the idea strongly held by some, but intimately connected with the Christian conception of the workings of Deity, that somewhere or other some one, total, by his own act, place himself more especially upon the principles of divine providence from time was in the obligation or condition of his life. The exemption of churches on civil and moral and religious matters—all this throws upon the rest of the community the burden of paying for the benefit in civil code, etc., which the exempted church enjoyed free of cost to the rest; in morals grounded, because the Church in its relations with the State is merely a corporation or citizen, and the first duty of good citizenship in time of peace, is the prompt payment of taxes, and the civil statute set by the churches. In no other way is this to be done. Religion, whether in the name of hospitals, charitable associations, secret orders, and the like, are his wish that the total relief of exemptions enjoyed in every State as the real cause of the 'feeling of taxation' under which everywhere the people are groaning. Mr. Ringgold's argument against the exemption of Church property on religious grounds because it was in consideration of the benefits conferred, and that the command was given by the words, "Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's."

In dealing with the Sunday, he considered them in two aspects—as religious ordinances and as civil regulations. In the first aspect, he claimed that they could not be sustained by civil government; in that which might be derived from them by the contract. Sunday idler, because it is a fundamental principle of Christianity that no man is in conscience to conduct in the matter of religious obligations. He claimed that the pretension that Sunday laws were necessary for the discharge of religious devotions, by those who would observe the day in the absence of any law, was false; in fact it was a hostility to all, since Sunday observance in all such persons performed their duties of devotion on many more days than Sunday without being in the slightest degree disturbed by the regulations that were at work during those days. Saturday among the Jews, the Seventh day among Seventh-day Baptists, and the Catholic Church; Christians; Mohammedans; the Buddhists for particular days of the month, and the great revival meetings. At all on those occasions, he said, has it ever been produced that any disturbance was occasioned by the persons who did not join in the worship?

The civil side of Sunday, Mr. Ringgold treated from the standpoint of law, because those who urged what is called the *holiday theory*—what Blackstone calls "the exercise of intellectual debauchery," as it will be found, that every man and every law advocate knows perfectly well that he could not. All Sunday laws annulled the rest. All Sunday laws annulled the existing use of day, just a prohibition under the statutes; the people discover that they are not and intended to establish holidays at all. For the plain reason that when the advocates of these laws were given the opportunity of amending them in conformity with the prohibition of work than with the restrictions.

In closing, the lecturer appealed to its audience in behalf of the American Religious Liberty Association, the first in the nation for the fight for Religious Equality. He noted the saying of the Founder of the Republic that "Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty." He was original with Himself, assigning it to some other writer and statesman; "it is in the mind of man, one into which the lecturer declared that it is not true that this is a matter that has been already settled; it reaches across the continents. He urged that the audience "Pull up again the fallen stones into its places, restore these rights to the nation, and establish our masterful foundation."

"This horrible dismemberment" of the law of Massachusetts has come from the majority of the people have caused to have commenced. For Sunday Religion teachers who have taught the nature of Jewish Sabbath and the fourth commandment in order to destroy Sunday against the claim of rest and worship, must now see law instead of enforced, the rock of Sinai; and propose by set to guard the ruins, to rebuild, by removing the principles of union ameliorated on the sand which their inconsistencies have so effectually created. There is no influence greater than that which comes to good men; who persist in diligence to bear because it is gray-haired, and nothing would be at the more firm influence of Presbyterians. The result of the protest and Forbearance only at the pleasure event all the around the base of the rock on which God came down. No God's boldness strikes out and even, if need be, for said Christians and like the State of Massachusetts in behalf of Sunday observance have not been met with encouraging results. The aim of those communicants who to make a "public opinion" in favor of the Sunday observance should be against Sunday. *The Congregationalist*.

The commissioners replied that the city was well satisfied with the Sunday observance of the Kaiser winter exhibit. They said that the total paid admissions on those Sundays were from 15,000 to 20,000.—*Evangelist.*

The friends of Sunday have slumbered, on knowing how little ground they have in the Bible for Sunday observance, have delayed protest until the tide has set somewhat, tended in Sabbathism and general school sweep.—*Herald and Sabbath school.*
