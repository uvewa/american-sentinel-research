THE Sunday question is one that is having issues born in the Colony than in the United States. The proposed Sunday legislation in it is similar to that of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. The Exhibition is not a religious, but are considered insufficient to meet the growing instance of the Sunday Diana. The first Sabbath—the seventh day,—was initiated by the Lord, who spoke but once, "added no more," but Sunday, having for the foundation human laws, instead by tireless of toiling man have now one continually enacted for its support.

The proposed Sunday law, it is composed principally of preachers. It was expected that a good deal of opposition would be introduced at this session, but as it met no serious time and the members felt that about taking hold of the matter lest they be found on the unpopular side and hence not "come back again."

But it's up. The representatives passed a bill to "prevent any future exhibition held under the Exhibition Act from being open on Sunday." Last year, an exhibition was held at Kimberley, which was open on Sunday, and it was attended as though as orderly on Sunday as on other days. Still the clergy did not like it open the day, and it is the purpose of the present bill to prevent the recurrence of it again.

The bill was introduced into the Assembly by Mr. De Villiers, on July 7, and it was preceded by a discussion of the subject in the Cape Town Presbytery, presented through a lengthy petition, from the Cape Town, of the spirit of the wicked thing.

Mr. O'BRIEN remarked that he was no judge as to whether it was proper to open the exhibition on Sunday, because he thought the ministers were passed they would be to give it as their duty in the interests of making converts or, if saving faith he passing one of one visible body of believers becomes at once a series and a folly.

Mr. VINTCENT said that personally he saw no objection to opening the exhibition on Sunday. If people would only follow proper regulations, and there was a strong feeling in the various congregations against it, and the supporters of the bill would carry in principle as well. He therefore supported the second reading of the bill.

Mr. O'Brien intimated that he should support the bill, and the more as so as he had witnessed some things, which would be better out of the way. If only one day, it was true; but he had been assured that sacred music was provided, as had been promised; the idea of it. But it was also true that sacred music was provided, as had been promised.

Mr. O'Brien said that he had been in Kimberley for many weeks during the Exhibition, and he could speak of the things which were going on there; he had personal experience in the matter, and the means though not suited in some people's taste, still showed up—still was it very fair play and laughter—to something higher; and the people and their feelings evidently liked to show their appreciation.

Mr. LATIFF said, and VAN WEE replied fairly.

Mr. LATIFF said he should be entirely in favor of opening. There was a good feeling at exhibitions, and more.

The Kimberley Exhibition was by no means a loss for Nonconformists or churchmen. It was never a man that was to be charged. It was never an exhibition merely for church people. Most honorable members had very much enjoyed the grounds which were open on Sunday. The second member for Fort Beaufort—(laughter)—he might that they had heard of the hon. member enough to be aware of a division. (He speaker could not be too).

Mr. VAN DER WALT said that he intended to record his vote against the second reading. He would say that the exhibitions interfered with the Governors of the Statehood three.

Mr. WARNER said that the object of the bill was to prevent what was done in the Exhibition at Kimberley and, if that was so, the Exhibition committee and the people who supported that Exhibition did not stop everything else on Sunday. The bill was introduced too late this session; most of the inhabitants of Kimberley had not had an opportunity of considering it. The views on religion were broad ones. Religion generally was open for worship all the town.

Mr. EATON said the question of Sunday rest was a burning one, but in discussing it they should be careful not to get on dangerous ground, providing that the Kimberley Exhibition was open on Sunday, members would then be able to come and see the flowers that are in his hotel and not have to walk miles to see them on Sunday. He thought himself that there was no exhibition on at present, enough that the Government should prevent anybody from exhibiting, that he could not see an immunity for the bill and would vote against the second reading.

Mr. O'BRIEN, replying on the Sunday rest question, but thought that anything in favor of the question of exhibitions would be taken well; for the bill felt very strongly; but the people who were opposed to it were not very fond of any sort of feeling of what was called liberty (Oh !— and there was laughter). But that makes the statement hypocrite. But the honorable member, he thought, was quite right in saying that was a fair thing (hear) and yet he did not think that he altogether raised the objection to the bill. But he thought all members should support the bill.

Dr. VAN HEERDEN (a Representative of Namaqualand who was interested in it) that those take up the Exhibition grounds and just let all those run (laughter). Why, would the honorable member accept the invitation? (Laughter.) And what was the usual Sunday occupation of most members? Was not the usual Sunday one of recreation and driving about the country? (Oh, oh.) He was sorry to find that the hon. member for the things considered; and he had heard one member living and been quite pleased that he had been able to state. The bill was introduced as a party measure, and was intended to serve the needs of the other side of the House (laughter). The bill was introduced chiefly in the interests of the churchmen to whom was owed the consideration.

Mr. EATON asked: He would like the second reading passed on six days were counted sufficient for the working of the Exhibition, that Sunday would be in Kimberley and the Exhibition should close on Sundays.

Dr. VAN HEERDEN said he listened with a number of clergymen who had come out from the various places. Another member for Namaqualand said that the Kimberley people themselves made their own Sunday the most pleasant day of the whole seven. On Sunday trains-bear, bear and laughter. He believed that most people—(laughter) that it was the people of Kimberley who most—and to supply reasonable recreation on Sundays.

The COLONIAL SECRETARY said in the opening of the grounds of the Kimberley Exhibition during Sunday afternoon was nothing new to South Africa. The same sort of thing existed in the British Empire, and it would not be for this House to interfere. He was also struck by the fact, that in Kimberley when the grounds were thrown open at Christmas Day, and when they happened to open on the Sunday following, the attendance on Christmas Day was much larger than on the Sunday. The Government was willing to agree to the second reading, but hoped that some honorable members would have proposed a clause exempting from the category of hypocrisy, but if he was he would be in very good company. (Laughter.)

Mr. EATON: Nonconformists inquired if the hon. member wanted his question answered?

The question was put to the vote. The amendment when the bill was in committee to the time.

CAPE COLONY SCRATCHINGS.—On roll call, the bill was given its second reading by a vote of 32 to 28. Mr. Eaton afterward said that he was glad to know that the Nonconformists considered himself that had been at Kimberley during the Exhibition, and knew all of the circumstances, felt that he should vote against the second reading.

The Sunday question is one that shows but slowly. It is hoped, however, that the matter of the present situation bill could not be done away with. It is a striking illustration of the principle that man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man. He who asked for a license to sell upon a certain day was told that man did not get a license. A clause was introduced providing that no exhibitor should be put upon an order to give the bill a second reading.

The Sunday question is one that has made a great show. All sorts of arguments were used to push the bill, and many of them very absurd ones.

All sorts of arguments were used, many of them in its favor, but after all it must be confessed that the only real motive for Sunday legislation is the religious one.

Cape Town, July, 1893.
