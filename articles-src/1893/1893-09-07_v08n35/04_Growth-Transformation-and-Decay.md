"WHEN the control of reason is once surrendered, the most extravagant and, the nations, like all organized combinations of individuals, pass through the meanest flower to the highest human its recurring stages of growth, transformation, and decay."—*Draper*.

The truthfulness of this statement the mind of the careful student of history at once assent. Hence, that grand gift of the Creator to man, that mighty weapon placed for the defense of truth, that subservient of all laws set for the government of all the universe, and the rights of the creatures of the Infinite, that the ground of our judgment, is the contributor of all that enjoys to now the enjoyment of society and the exercise of the righteous endowed of God for especially his own as a member of society. Take away the control of this, and civilization is no longer distinct; the stairs are broken and the structure falls.

In the nation, reason gives birth to growth, and in the growing time that reason is held in check by the exercise of the executive the powers of reason. As long as this is done, all moves on harmoniously, allayed, and not by any selfish or preconceived ideas on the part of those who exercise on every hand. Institutions for the advancement of old lie the man and the individual spring into being about spontaneously, and multiply upon themselves in many fold. The truth of the assertion that the power that he has not exhaust God, manifestation before the eyes of men. Points have been and results in the same great that will continue to be its force. While nature signals personal a beautiful and glorious the manifestation of its creation, the beloved faculty of reason, conferred for the good of man and the glory of God.

But let reason be dethroned, and also for the freshness of the fair and natural blight appear, the sad features of which is that also make timber thin for summation of the ripening harvest, and presentment of the approaching reaper. Unwarrant and the forces of deterioration becomes more and more lively vigilant, a short transformation is all that is possible as a step to permanent decay. Men are historically indifferent; no matter how a mighty race, they relapse into apathy, or propelled by a bad continuation in the deterioration of truth; they blindly on, persisting in that which will inevitably lead to their own destruction, yea, and to say, do not, or will not, take warning.

Here and there unmistakable indications of their approaching ruin are passed undetected by the wary. They point out the dangers of their descent. Men in turn to be either confirmed of their own position, or having started on the wrong road, are so determined to see what at is the end, from which they will find, to their chagrin, when reached, there is no turning back, and will come their evidence.

Exactly the counterpart of all this may be seen in the history of the nations of time, imagination to dream. Look about you and study the history of the great nations the past. Consider if this has not been, then the history of our own State of the Nations. His anticipation birth and development early growth and development you will at question. Look carefully for the provision of the blunt. Study defile into the causes of decay. What is then. The transformation are not now being passed through which we shall learn, what our civil legislatures are pursuing. Inspect closely the relation existing between the civil and the ecclesiastical. Search with anxious thought for the indications of decay. When discovered, point them out with all earnestness to your fellow man. Will you let ruin come without raising a protecting voice? Will you let your great nation be stained with the blood of the structure in the itself prevalence of which it must carry? Will your representatives sit quietly in silence to the propositions that are sure to rob you of your religious liberty? Or are you willing to face death rather than see these things? Are you willing to study and point out to others the principles of that grand a nation now spreading not only over your own land, but over the rest of the world earth—the covering of civil sovereignty to ecclesiastical domination?

W. E. HOWELL.
