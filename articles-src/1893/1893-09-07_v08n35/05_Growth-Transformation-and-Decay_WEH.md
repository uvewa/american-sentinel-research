"When the control of reason is once removed, the catastrophe is no longer distant, and then nations, like all organized creations, all forms of life, from the meanest flower to the highest human institution, pass through the inevitably recurring stages of growth, transformation, and decay."—Froude.

To the truthfulness of this statement the mind of the careful student of history will at once assent. Reason, that grand gift of the Creator to man, that mighty weapon placed for the defense of truth, that substructure of all laws set for the protection of the God-given liberties and rights of the creatures of the Infuute, that powerful upholder of human institutions, the ground of our judgment, is the controller of all that secures to man the enjoyment of society and the exercise of the rights ordained of God to be specifically his own as a member of society. Take away the control of this, and the catastrophe is no longer distant; the stays are broken and the structure crumbles.

In the nation, reason gives birth to growth, and in the growing time that which sustains life is but the continual exercise of the powers of reason. As long as legislators are actuated by reason unalloyed, and not by any selfish or prejudiced motives, evidences of prosperity are seen on every hand. Institutions for the advancement of both the nation and the individual spring into being almost spontaneously, and multiply upon themselves many fold. The truth of the assertion that the powers that be are ordained of God, materializes before the eyes of men. Fruits are borne and results are obtained to the honor of the nation and of God. Visible signs portend a bountiful and glorious harvest, the first fruits of which are already beginning to be realized. Men begin to reap the benefits of the God-bestowed faculty of reason, conferred for the good of man and the glory of God.

But let reason be dethroned, and alas for the feebleness of the race, omens of blight appear, the sad feature of which is that men mistake them for premonitions of the ripening harvest, and precursors of the approaching reaper. Unawares to all except to the assiduously and indefatigably vigilant, a silent transformation is taking place, hastening on toward rapid decay. Men are lamentably indifferent. Either seized by a stupor, they relapse into apathy, or prompted by a zeal commendable in the defenders of truth, they rush blindly on, persisting in that which will inevitably lead to their own destruction, and yet, sad to say, do not, or will not, take warning. What only can be their fate? The conclusion is foregone.

Here and there unmistakable indications of decay are already beginning to be detected by the wary. They point out the danger so surely ahead. Men seem to be either confident of their own position, or having started on the wrong road, are determined to see what is at the end, from which they will find, to their chagrin, when reached, there is no turning back, and will curse their existence.

Reader, this is no fanciful sketch or imaginative dream. Look about you and see if you cannot detect the real, from the picture. Consider if this has not been, and is, the history of our once Queen of Nations. Her auspicious birth and remarkably swift growth and development, you will not question. Look carefully for the presence of the blight, Study dilligently whether the last stages of the transformation are not now being passed through. Examine critically the course legislators are pursuing. Inspect closely the relations being assumed between the civil and the ecclesiastical. Search with anxious thought for the indications of decay. When discovered, point them out with all earnestness to your fellow-men. Will you let ruin come without raising a protesting voice? Will you let your garments be stained with the blood of destruction in the fearful precipitation of your Nation to irretrievable ruin? Will you yield in silence to the preposterous demands of religious bigotry and diabolism? Or are you willing to face death rather than surrender your God-given liberty? And will you study and point out to others the symptoms of that deadly contagion now spreading not only over our own fair land, but over the face of the whole earth—the cowering of civil sovereignty to ecclesiasticism? Which?
