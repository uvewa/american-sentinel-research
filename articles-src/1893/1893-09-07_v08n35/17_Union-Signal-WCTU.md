THE *Union Signal* says of the meeting of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union to take place in Chicago in October, "May we come up to the city of even thousand soldiers in the body of October, trusting and of old in the 'God of Jacob?'" All good people will certainly wish that it might be even so, but the events of the past five years have not been such as to inspire confidence that such will be the case. The trust of that organization is in their own political plans; has for some years been not in the God of Jacob, but in human governments.
