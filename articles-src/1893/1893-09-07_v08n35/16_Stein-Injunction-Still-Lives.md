THE Stein injunction still lives to trouble both the Sunday closers and the Sunday openers. The Sunday Fair does not pay, but open gates are none the less offensive to the friends of the so-called "American Sabbath." Mr. Crafts says that "this farce has ceased to be funny, and has become tiresome."
