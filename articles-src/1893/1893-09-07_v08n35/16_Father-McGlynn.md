THAT clerical mountebank, "Father" McGlynn, has at last been permitted to say "I'm for rest," as which in Protestantism achievers are highly stated, forgetting that the surface of the same is abominable idolatry. McGlynn is and always has been a Romanist, and some of his utterances show him to be a very silly one at that.
