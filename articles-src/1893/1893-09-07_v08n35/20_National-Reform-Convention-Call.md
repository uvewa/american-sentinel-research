FRANK E. BREDT, President of the National Reform Association, has issued a call for "a national gathering of the friends of the Christian Sabbath and all other Christian features of our national life, with a view to secure for them adequate and authoritative recognition in fundamental law," to be held in the First United Presbyterian Church, Eighth Ave., in the City of Allegheny, Pa., November 14, 15 and 16, 1893. The exercises will begin at 7:30 o'clock, P. M., on November 14.

Mr. Bredt says: "This nation, the country, has been stirred by the distress of the times. The distress has woke men, but the fruits be valued on its meaning. This is a time for the great fundamental principles of our Government to be crystallized in more appropriate and proper form."

It is thus evident that the essence of the National Reformers' in mourning one promotional recognition of Sunday only instead of dealing in practice many other things. The conflict has only, confirmed.
