THAT men are still willing to go to prison for their faith has been recently demonstrated in our own land, in the cases of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee and Maryland; and that death itself has no terrors to the true Christian is evidenced by the following, from a recent number of the Independent:—

> News has just reached us from Persia of the death of Mirza Ibrahim, imprisoned for more than a year in Tabriz, for abandoning Mohammedanism, and accepting Christ as his Saviour. During this period, jailer and guards have heaped upon him shameful indignities and brutal outrages. How he has survived so long is a matter of wonder. He has borne it all with the utmost patience, and in unfaltering loyalty to Christ. Boldly and yet tenderly has he preached Jesus to his cruel jailer and his fellow-prisoners, some of whom have been won by him to better ways. But he died at last from the violence of the basic prisoners, who, throttling him again and again, demanded, "Is it God [Jesus] or All," and every time the answer came back, "It is God." His throat was so injured that he died shortly after, as much a martyr to the faith of Jesus as any on the record of the Christian Church. The whole story has great significance for the future of the gospel in Persia.

Religious bigotry and intolerance is as cruel as the grave wherever it exists. The spirit that simply imprisons men in this country and works them in the chain-gang for practical dissent from the popular faith, is the same that persecuted to the death in Persia.
