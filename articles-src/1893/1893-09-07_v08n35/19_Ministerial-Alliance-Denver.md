THE Ministerial Alliance of Denver recently propounded a memorial to be sent to the President asking that he fix a day for public prayer and fasting. The memorial refers to the existing financial distress and the great legalized sin of the Nation, and petitions the President to set aside a day when the people shall gather in their accustomed places of worship and pray that the Nation may be rightly guided in its present sore distress. Commenting upon this fact the Catholic *Review* says:—"These good men do the Church of God well in turning the hearts to do the work of the Church. Let them appoint a day themselves for acknowledgment, observance and repent all other congregations to do the same. The President has enough to do to settle the questions that concern him without doing in the religious matters of future stating and deliberating."

What the *Review* says is true enough, but it comes with poor grace from such a source.
