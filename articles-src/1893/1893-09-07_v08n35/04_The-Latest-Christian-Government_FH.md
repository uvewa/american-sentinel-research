The following trivial occurrence goes to show that the representatives of the United States Government are doing what they can to bring to the notice of the world the "American Sabbath," and to show that their Government is indeed religious.

On Sunday the U. S. cruiser Chicago entered Cowes without saluting, although the Queen of England, the Emperor of Germany, and other royalty were in the harbor. This breach of national etiquette was criticised by the press, and in answer Captain Mahan said:—

> We never salute on Sunday unless not to do so would be to give coffee. We do not salute on Sunday at home, and the reason we did not do so here was that we considered England a Sabbatarian country.

Thus the kings of the earth have to bow to the majesty of the "American Sabbath."

Belfast.
