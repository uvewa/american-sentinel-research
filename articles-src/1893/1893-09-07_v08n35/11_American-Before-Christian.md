A NEW YORK clergyman makes the following statement: "Our duty is to be American even before we are Christians." This is absurd. The United States interferes with no man's creed or belief, and at the present time no church shows any signs of making any demands upon its members calculated to put them in a position of antagonism to the laws of administration of the country. There is no possibility in a constitutional way of religious conduct and civil conduct being brought into antagonism.—*Evening Sun*.
