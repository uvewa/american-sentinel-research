MARKED papers have been sent to us containing statements very damaging to the reputation of the author of one of the Sunday bills recently before Congress. The facts are that the gentleman is charged with seduction and breach of promise by a young lady, who says that he agreed to marry her in the event of his wife's death. His wife did die, and he subsequently married another lady; hence the suit. The case has not yet been tried; so we are not warranted in assuming the guilt of the defendant and defeating him before the world. But even if guilty that fact could in no way affect the merits of the Sunday bill which he introduced. If a worthy measure, it could be none the less so because of the bad character of its author; while on the other hand, improper legislation does not become proper because of the good character of those who advocate it. The SENTINEL deals with principles not with men.
