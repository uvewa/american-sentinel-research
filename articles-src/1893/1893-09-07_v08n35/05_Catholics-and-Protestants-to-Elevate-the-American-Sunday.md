In the year 1884 the National Reformers said that could they once get the aid of the Catholic Church, they could see a hope of making a union. Here is the bid as it appears in the *Christian Statesman* of August of that year. The Rev. Mr. Bovel has said: "We can count on the interest sought to strengthen both our cause to cooperate with our Roman Catholic fellow-citizens. We may be ashamed to some of them in this struggle for the preservation of the American Sabbath, and it is not yet come when the Roman Catholic Church was willing to cooperate with other churches—as such; but the time has come when the Roman Catholic Church is ready to accept cooperation in any form. 'Surely you are willing to co-operate with us.'" At that time the exact "form" in which they might co-operate, was not so clear to them; but they were willing to co-operate in any form in which it might make an appearance.

In a December number of the *Nation*, Mr. Ringgold says of the subject: "Whenever they [the Roman Catholics] shall be able to join hands with us in the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join hands with them; and if they accord us 'political atheism?'" Because the National Constitution does not recognize the Deity and acknowledge "Christ as King of the Nation," "it is not so framed as to 'place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government upon an undeniably legal basis in that instrument" "an embodiment of" the Deity, and until the friends of the *Statesman* would join hands with the Catholics. As long as it remains a compact of political atheism—the Constitution which guarantees our rights, and the Government of the United States, builded upon these rights. This is proven by the fact that in the *Statesman* of July, 1885, Mr. Foster, a leading National Reformer, in speaking of the decision of the Board of Directors to close the World's Fair on Sunday, said that this was the first time that any religious body had attempted to separate themselves from organized political evil, by refusing to support the United States Constitution, so long as it remains a compact of political atheism." And so it is a clear case, that so long as the Constitution remains as it is, National Reformers "co-operate" with the Catholics.

Although it was not at first so very clear in what form they could "co-operate" with the Catholics "in its reading from the religious standpoint of education," at the congress of Catholic laymen, at Baltimore, Nov. 10-17, 1889, the whole matter was made clear in the following resolution, as found in the platform, which was adopted with enthusiasm: "There are many Christian issues in which the churches could come together with the object of aiding and shaping legislation for the public good. In the matter of temperance reform and overlapping morality, we should join together." From this was struck a resolution concerning the preservation of Sunday observance. This was struck a responsive chord in the National Reform convention. And, although there had been a difference of opinion between a Protestant Puritan and a Catholic Sunday, in all of their endeavors in that direction, from the time noted to practically, they have been working together for Sunday legislation.

And when the allies of the National Reform, Catholics and Protestants together, are recognized by the following, from one of their own mouths: The *Statesman* of July 25, 1893; the other from *Archdiocese October*, 1891. One from the National Reform *Christian Statesman*, the Catholic, with only this difference, the *Statesman* says: "This is a Christian nation."

The *Statesman* says: "Halidom!"

But Bishop Ireland's paper also says a very good thing: "The real fact is that Sunday is more important than it may appear and if it is to remove the permanence of Sunday—the Fair and the religion, the acknowledged standard of the good year that our masterful foundation might be established."

And this is truth all. One of the great dailies of St. Paul, *The Pioneer Press*, in the issue of Sunday, July 23, said:—

"Those notable are the fathers who at the opening of the World's Fair to indiscriminate activity for the more effectual observance and promotion of the rights of the people observed that settled the state of the Fair, but it always has been clear that the provisions that prevailed against the Sunday Fair."

This is the common sense view of the case, and most but those who are blinded by religious fanaticism or by a desire that it might be so, could on in this "a struggle for a contest," or a "victory" for Sunday. While this agitation against the Fair lasts, it is a hostility to enforce Sunday before slavery fasten on the work of indictment of the Church, and the final overthrow of the government, and of freedom for what our fathers fought, lived and died.
