On Monday evening, July 31, Mr. Jas. T. Ringgold, of Baltimore, delivered an able address in Chicago, on the subject of "Religious Equality and Sunday Laws." Mr. Ringgold began his lecture with a definition of religious equality. He distinguished between religious equality and toleration, saying, that toleration implied inequality or the position of a superior towards an inferior. Between toleration and persecution, he said, there was no distinction whatever, in principle; toleration, indeed, implies the right to persecute, and forbearance only at the superior's sweet will. He also said that there was some danger even in the use of the phrase, "religious liberty," because, insensibly, people are apt to connect what they call their "liberties," with the form of government under which they happen to live, and the civil institutions around them; whereas, religious liberty, when it is the equivalent of religious equality, refers to a gift of the Deity to man, which is not based upon any particular constitution, or statutory system, and which cannot be affected by human devices or human laws.

The lecturer said that wherever religious inequality existed, there was to that extent, a union of Church and State and an established church, though there might be no establishment under the forms of law. He then traced the idea of the union of Church and State, and of the belief in the absolute necessity of this union to the preservation of social order, back to the beginning of society, when the king and the priest conspired together to impose a permanent yoke upon the people; the compact between them being that the priests should frighten the people into obeying the king and the king should compel the people to pay their tithes regularly to the priests. He said that all government was originally based from the very nature of things, upon the consent of the governed, and that the idea of divine right, or of a government existing "by the grace of God," began when the union of Church and State was thus established and hereditary right, or "the right divine to govern wrong," was then inaugurated. This pagan practice—he quoted from numerous pagan writers to prove—was regarded by the pagans as absolutely essential to the preservation of social order. He then quoted from Macchiavelli, Coleridge, Bismarck, Gladstone, and others, to show that this pagan idea has thoroughly permeated the minds of Christian philosophers and statesmen. After alluding to the imitation of the pagan systems in this regard by the Christian nations of Europe and to the advocacy of its adoption by Catholics and Protestants alike, Mr. Ringgold proceeded to show that religious inequality was established by law in every one of the colonies which afterwards made up the American Union, and that it still exists in every American State. He called attention to the assurance recently given to the Canadians, by a prominent New York City paper, that they could join the United States without compromising in any way their present system of united Church and State. He said that this was an alarming statement, and all the more alarming because it was true, there being, as the journal in question said, nothing to prevent many American States from setting up an established church at any time in the Federal Constitution—only two States having an express provision against such an arrangement in their own constitutions.

Among the traces of religious inequality, and therefore of an established church, existing in what he called the "inorganic law" of American States, Mr. Ringgold cited the judicial oath, the exemption of Church property from taxation, and the Sunday laws. The first, he said, was based upon the idea strongly held by pagans, but utterly inconsistent with the Christian conception of the workings of Deity, that somehow or other the individual could, by his own act, place himself more completely under the jurisdiction of divine power than he was in the ordinary conditions of his life. The exemption of Church property from taxation, was objectionable on civil and moral and religious grounds—on civil grounds, because it threw upon the rest of the community the burden of paying for the benefits of civil order, etc., which the exempted Church enjoyed free of cost to itself—in moral grounds, because the Church in its relations with the State is merely a corporation or citizen, and the first duty of good citizenship in time of peace, is the prompt payment of taxes, and the evil example set by the churches in this regard does more of harm than many sermons can do of good, it being in fact followed by other corporations, such as hospitals, charitable associations, secret orders, and the like, so that the total exemptions enjoyed in every State are the real causes of the burden of taxation under which everywhere the people are groaning. Mr. Ringgold objected to the exemption of Church property on religious grounds because it was in connection with this very question of taxation that the command was given by the Founder of Christianity, "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's."

In dealing with the Sunday laws, he viewed them in two aspects—as religious ordinances and as civil regulations. In the first aspect, he claimed that they could not be sustained on account of any benefit which might be derived from them by the unwilling Sunday idler, because it is a fundamental principle of Christianity that no man is righteous in conduct to which he is compelled. Furthermore, he claimed that the pretense that Sunday laws were necessary for the proper discharge of religious devotions, by those who would observe the day in the absence of any law, was as false in fact as it was insulting to all pious Sunday observers, inasmuch as all such persons performed their duties of devotion on many other days than Sunday without being in the slightest degree disturbed by the regular routine of life around them—instancing Saturday among the Jews, the Seventh-day Adventists, etc.; the saints' days of the Catholic Church; Christmas, Good Friday, etc., of the Episcopalians; the prayer meetings of Mondays and Wednesdays, etc., among the Presbyterian and Methodists, and the great revival meetings held by the latter; in connection with not one of these occasions, he said, has it ever been pretended that any disturbance was caused by the pursuit of their regular occupations by the persons who did not choose to participate in the devotions.

The civil side of Sunday, Mr. Ringgold said, it was difficult to deal with patiently because those who urged what is called "the holiday theory" of Sunday laws, are guilty of intellectual dishonesty, one of the greatest of crimes. Every Sunday law advocate knows perfectly well that he cares nothing whatever for this aspect of the case. All Sunday laws combine the prohibition of play with a prohibition of work, which sufficiently proves that they are not intended to establish holidays, and it may safely be said that if the advocates of these laws were given their choice, they would sooner dispense with the prohibition of work than with the prohibition of play.

In closing, the lecturer appealed to his hearers to sustain the International Religious Liberty Association, the first organized body in the world, he said, to enter the fight for religious equality in the name of the Founder of the Christian religion, whose teaching upon this subject was original with Himself, assigning as it did a new domain to religion, the heart and mind of man, one into which the civil power could never penetrate; and the lecturer declared that it had been too long left to the indifferent and the skeptic to echo back across the centuries the voice which proclaimed in the garden, "Put up again thy sword into its place, for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."

The Parliament of Religions, which is to occupy in its sessions the greater portion of the month of September, at the Art Institute, is to be prefaced by several denominational congresses, the first of which has already been had in the Jewish Denominational Congress. The sessions of this congress have not been largely attended, but have shown from the beginning a well balanced earnestness and substantial ability superior to most of the different congresses which have yet been held this summer. In making the address of welcome, C. C. Bonney, President of the Auxiliary, said:—

> The providence of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who created man in his own image, and gave him from Sinai's glory crowned summit the law of a righteous life, has so ordered the arrangements for the Religious Congresses to be held under the auspices of the World's Congress Auxiliary of the World's Columbian Exposition, and without any plan to that end, that this congress of the Jewish Church in the first of the series. Thus the mother church, from which all the Christian denominations trace their lineage, and which stands in the history of mankind as the especial exponent of august and triumphant theism, has been called upon to open the Religious Congresses of 1893. The highest liberty is the freedom to worship God according to the dictates of conscience, and this is the right of all men. I desire respect for my religious convictions, and must give the same to you as Jews. Our differences are between ourselves and God, the Judge and Father of us all. The supreme significance of this congress and all the others is that they herald the death of persecution throughout the world, and proclaim the coming reign of civil and religious liberty.

This is a remarkable expression to come from Mr. Bonny, who is president of the International Law and Order League, the purpose of which is, in the main, to enforce religious laws, and under the legal lash of whose society, already, many have suffered for their failure to religiously observe the first day of the week; the day to which no conscientious Israelite could properly give reverence.

It is not the creed of the Law and Order Society, of which Mr. Bonney is president, that "our differences are between ourselves and God." It is both the creed and the practice,—indeed it is the life and reason for the existence of that society,—that differences of this kind are not between ourselves and God, but between the Law and Order Society and dissenters. That Mr. Bonney and the society desire respect for their religious convictions, is certain, but that they are not desirous of giving the same respect to others, is just as certain. Mr. Bonney must either reconsider his opinions as expressed here and adapt his thoughts and expression to the intent and purpose of his society, or he should resign the presidency of such an organization. Those to whom he spoke, and the citizens of this country at large, will learn that the supreme significance of this series of congresses and the Parliament of Religions, which is its crowning gathering, is not to herald the death of persecution throughout the world, or to proclaim the coming reign of civil and religious liberty; but, to herald the growing progress of persecution for conscience' sake in this country; and proclaim the end, under this Government, of the reign of civil and religious liberty.

That the Jewish people of this country in general do not realize the insincerity of such expressions as these, or the shallow basis upon which they now stand, or the evidence of the times as shown in the rapid progress of the union of Church and State in late legal and judicial decisions, and legislative action, as well as the systematic persecution in different parts of the country of those who observe the Sabbath of the commandment as do the Jews themselves, is clear. This was also shown by the unstinted adulation showered upon this country and Government by the different speakers, who enlogized its civil and religious liberty without, apparently, the least realization of the fact that there exists already, organized and ready for use, as complete a system of possible persecution as any hierarchy has any need of, for the enforcement of a State religion, and a most efficient discrimination against those who may dissent. A pitiful evidence of the insufficiency of Judaism in its failure to comprehend the plan of salvation and the gospel, was shown over and over again, but more especially in the opening remarks of Rabbi Silverman, of New York, who said:—

> We are constantly groping in the dark. Every doctrine which to-day is a fact, becomes merely a theory to-morrow; the next day, a myth. All is mystery. There is scarcely any truth save the false, any right save the wrong. Knowledge is only opinion about facts, and most opinions are errors or will be to-morrow.

It is indeed suggestive that the Congress of Religions should have been opened in this manner and by this people; but although in the opening session the God of Israel has been preached, the congresses before they have ended, will travel far from him and his Word, and come no nearer the teachings of his Son than do they who deny him.
