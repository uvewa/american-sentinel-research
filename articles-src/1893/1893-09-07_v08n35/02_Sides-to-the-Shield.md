PROFESSOR HUXLEY, at the opening of Johns Hopkins University, parceling the wrists of the great teacher, he charged man "not to live by bread alone, but by ideas." In order, he said, to do this, not by the imitation of "philosophy," or the direct committing "wondership," we can not convey ideas so very easily. "To this end the first must always remain imperfect. After the preliminary formation of each, the process and the labor of clothing it in articulate language is a new and very serious effort." Students have frequent difficulty in performing or to work to his own satisfaction—that in the order of civil things, political, social, as one mind will recognize in them the same general truths. How much harder it must be to make it clear in the abstract, and general and particular, shall convey to each if it be all, the intervening and undefined boundaries.

This uncertainty of language, in the most expert hands, has brought infinite troubles on mankind. He will doubtless know that many of the bloodiest conflicts have been spilt as the outcome of controversy, of which, in point of fact, neither side had understood what the other side meant. Each controversialist had been, quite close to either what, is meant itself by the proposition for which it contended.

There is an application of these remarks to the language of President Andrews, of Brown University, quoted in the SENTINEL of the 6th ult.: "The artificial separation between what is known as religious and secular education," he pronounced, "if carried to the righteous conclusion would be a denunciation of the righteousness of such a separation to him is 'untrue from a religious point of view and deleterious from a civil and social point of view.'" Never the less and never the more, it should not be used to settle the question whether the shield is gold or silver, that is, whether one side of it, silver, it being in fact golden on the other side of the shield. Going before us on the side facing the other, more surely reaching the result in the world; let us read this passage. Never did the educational state or function arise more pertinent! When a man asks you to make nothing of the thing, and to abstract, questions, reply by asking him, "What do you mean by 'religion?'" and by "secular education?" until he has made himself attach no definite idea to the terms. He will find that he, on his side, has no controversy with either one.

From the individual side of the shield those who interpret religious education as the *holding theory*; "religion," says Mr. Matthew Arnold, "nearly the sense of *obey.* There is three-fourths of human life." It is the very nature of the thing that the Catholic religion in any man without its external organization—that faith "ordinarily and justly application by the man" in the moral law. But in the Mosaic dispensation, there are obligations upon each individual "not to be enforced by physical penalties, inflicted in the name of the State." This identification is equally confused with the Church. And whoever does not obey; let him do nothing for fear, but love. "Thus said the Lord," with the words which the conduct. Applying this standard to a long-continued claim over the present, religious liberty seeks a part of things religious, a just test brought out for the test of the law.

But it is plain enough that with such a definition as this for faith, and with a State as this, the State, the government, it is merely a continuation of part of the machinery, whereby the force of society is to make a compliance with this faith and obedience. And there will necessarily be nothing whatever to do. No occasion for the religion in any man the whole, which Christians can possibly arise in these days.

Upon these principles, then, from the Christian point of view, that religion is to be aided or done by way of the civil power—this is what was done, what was practiced, but no act or course of conduct can be made wrong as a civil offense, to any degree whatever religious according to human whatever of ascertaining what conduct is or is not required by religion. The only government that ever had the right of finding out in what was commanded by Moses. While the revelation of the divine will, nature any given circumstance, may still come to any individual that is ready to receive it, the civil power has no commission to enforce any such requirement with the phrase, "Thus saith the Lord."

Two sides, then, to the shield of "separation between things religious and things civil"—their identification by the individuals, in their relations to both Church and State, so that he is honest and clean, and good for he is religious make, there total that the State shall engage neither in the profession nor the practice of the religious doctrine are, nor is the blasphemous folly.

It is only by observing this distinction that one can understand what is meant by "religious liberty"—the absolute equality of all religions and of no-religion, not as between themselves, but before the law. The proclamation that a bishop purchasing a piece of real estate stand a place of equality, in the civil court, is not more objectionable. The Roman Catholic approve nor disapprove, the principle of religious liberty. For if she place all religions on a level, it does not undertake to decide the truth of the religious beyond, be in their comparative merits. This place will be founded for all, and the doctrine of those who are fighting in the struggle.
