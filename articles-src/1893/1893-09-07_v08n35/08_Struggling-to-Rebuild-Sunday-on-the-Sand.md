The zeal of the Sunday reformers is commendable. Their repeated efforts to rebuild what is already fallen, without seeking new foundations, show a lack of wisdom which no eager zeal can atone for. Repeated failure is assured until new foundations are laid. Mr. Crafts, speaking in Massachusetts, lately said:—

What shall we do about it?

1. Organize to repeal the lawless law at the next legislature. This horrible disemboweling of the law could never have occurred if there had been an efficient society with an active salaried secretary ever on guard. Massachusetts would have prevented the State from rebelling against the Decalogue, as Pennsylvania has just done, if there had been as good a State organization as Pennsylvania has. The way out is the way in. Make the Massachusetts Sunday Protective League so efficient that it can unmake this legislative crime.

2. Organize also to teach the people by lectures and literature, that the Massachusetts legislature has not made wrong right by legalizing it. God's law is the standard.

In the calm light of facts Mr. Crafts' appeal is like the "Pope's Bull against the Comet." "An efficient society with an active salaried secretary on guard" is nothing when conscience is dead.

"This horrible disemboweling" of the laws of Massachusetts has come because the majority of the people have ceased to have conscientious regard for Sunday. Religious teachers who have taught the destruction of the "Jewish Sabbath" and the fourth commandment in order to fortify Sunday against the claims of God's Sabbath, must now see that instead of fortifying Sunday, they have undermined all Sabbathism; and yet they delay returning to the bed rock of Sinai, and propose by organized societies and "paid secretaries" set to guard the ruins, to rebuild, by relaying the rubbish of false assumptions on the sand which their inconsistencies have so effectually created. There is no blindness greater than that which comes to good men, who persist in clinging to error because it is gray-haired, and no cowardice greater than that which overtakes those who hesitate to leave the sinking sand which sifts under their uneasy feet, because a threatening surf breaks around the base of the rock on which God calls them to build. Nay, brethren; strike out and swim, if need be, for solid Sinai and the true Sabbath of Jehovah.

According to the Congregationalist the appeals made to the railroad commissioners of Massachusetts in behalf of Sunday observance have not met with encouraging results. The answer of these commissioners indicates that "public opinion" in Massachusetts holds the balance of power against Sunday. The Congregationalist says:—

> The commissioners replied that the only authorized Sunday trains were those of the Boston & Maine winter schedule. They said that the railroads seemed to ignore the commission, believing that no effort would be made to enforce the law. The commissioners expressed doubt whether public sentiment would sustain any restrictions of Sunday travel.

The friends of Sunday have slumbered, or, knowing how little ground they have in the Bible for Sunday observance, have delayed protest until the tide has set seaward, toward no Sabbathism, with unchecked sweep.—*Evangel and Sabbath Outlook*.
