# Uncertainties — v08n35 (1893-09-07)

## Article 01 — "The Christian Doctrine of Justification"

- **Page 1, article body:** The phrase "to obviate life" (in the Bryce quotation, page 2) likely should read "to obviate eternal death" or similar — the sense of the sentence is clearly that union with the visible church is held necessary to avoid damnation. However, as this is a quotation from Bryce's *Holy Roman Empire* reproduced in the Sentinel, the transcription preserves "to obviate life" as printed. Confidence: MEDIUM. Second pass completed; the OCR reading is consistent with the visible text.
- **Page 1:** A footnote marker (*) appears mid-sentence referencing Isa. 50:6. The footnote is placed at the bottom of page 1 in the original; it has been reproduced at the end of the article as a footnote.
- **Page 2:** OCR rendered "severa" (in "to the severa Protestant countries of Europe") — almost certainly "several" but the 'l' is missing. Transcribed as "several" (corrected silently in context of a quotation; noted here). Confidence: HIGH.
- **Page 2:** The phrase "on its ababalf" in the OCR (in the Bryce quotation) is clearly an OCR error for "on its behalf." Transcribed as "its behalf." Confidence: HIGH.

## Article 03 — "Sunday Legislation in Cape Colony"

- **Author name:** "GEO. B. THOMPSON" — full name George B. Thompson, abbreviated GBT. Not previously in the known authors list; added as new.
- **Page 3:** Mr. O'Reilly's speech contains "going a e too far" — clearly "a e" is an OCR artifact for "a step" or similar. Preserved as printed ("a e") per accuracy-first policy. Second pass: likely "a step" but not certain. Flagged.

## Article 04 — "The Latest 'Christian Government'"

- **Author:** "FRANCIS HOPE" — dateline "Belfast" follows. Francis Hope is in the known authors list (FH). Used FH.
- **Captain Mahan's quote:** "unless not to do so would be to give coffee" — likely an OCR error for "offense" or "offence." Preserved as printed. Confidence: LOW. Second pass completed; "coffee" makes no sense in context; probably "offence."

## Article 05 — "Growth, Transformation, and Decay"

- **Author:** "W. E. HOWELL" — not in known authors list. New contributor; abbreviated WEH.
- **Page 4:** "the creatures of the Infuute" — OCR artifact; likely "the Infinite." Preserved as printed; noted here. Confidence: HIGH that "Infuute" = "Infinite."
- **Page 4:** "Study dilligently" — this spelling appears in the OCR and may be the original; preserved as printed (may be a period spelling variant or OCR of "diligently").

## Article 07 — "Religious Equality and Sunday Laws" / Chicago Correspondence

- **Structure:** The article comprises two distinct sections — the report on Ringgold's lecture, and the "Chicago Correspondence" section on the Jewish Denominational Congress and Parliament of Religions. Both are bylined W. H. M. at the end of the second section, and both relate to religious liberty issues at the Chicago World's Fair congresses. They have been combined into one file as they appear to be a single correspondent's report with an internal sub-heading ("Chicago Correspondence / The Religious Congresses Begin"). The sub-heading is not a separate article.
- **Page 5:** "enlogized" — preserved as printed; likely OCR rendering of "eulogized."
- **Page 5:** "brothren" (in article 25) — preserved as printed; likely OCR for "brethren."

## Article 08 — "Struggling to Rebuild Sunday on the Sand"

- **Attribution:** This article ends with "—Evangel and Sabbath Outlook." The editorial commentary before the Crafts quote and the commentary throughout is likely by the Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, reprinted. Treated as reprint.
- **Page 6:** "Boston & Maine" — OCR rendered as "Boston &amp; Maine" (HTML entity); transcribed as "Boston & Maine."

## Article 24 — "National Reform Association Calls for National Gathering"

- **Page 8:** Mr. Brunot's quote contains "the struggle for the 9'-bath" — clearly an OCR artifact. "9'-bath" is almost certainly "Sabbath" with the "Sa" and/or "b" characters being misread. Preserved in the transcription as printed; noted here as OCR error. Confidence: HIGH that intended word is "Sabbath."

## General Notes

- Page 7 is entirely advertisements (Bible Pictures books, Prison Light, Eagle Brand roofing, Mop Wringer, Young Peoples' Library, Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation, Medical Missionary, Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods). None transcribed.
- Page 8 subscription rate table is incomplete/garbled in OCR (rate columns missing values). The subscription info block was skipped as boilerplate.
- "WILLIAM N. BURKE" appears as associate editor in the masthead alongside Calvin P. Bollman — this is unusual (prior issues list C. P. Bollman and W. H. McKee or W. N. Glenn). Preserved as printed.
- Author "Jas. T. Ringold" (article 02) — spelled "Ringgold" in article 07. The article 02 byline reads "JAS. T. RINGOLD" (one 'g'); in article 07 the name is spelled "Ringgold" throughout. The article 02 byline may be OCR dropping a letter. Transcribed as printed in each respective article.
