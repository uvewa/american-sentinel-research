# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, September 7, 1893 (v08n35)

## General Note on Scan Quality

The 300 DPI B&W scans of this issue present significant challenges for OCR transcription. The newspaper's small font size, combined with the scan resolution, makes many words and passages difficult to read with certainty. This affects the entire issue but is most severe in:
- Block quotes set in smaller type (especially the *Catholicity* quotes in article 01)
- Dense text in the middle and right columns of pages 2-6
- The editorial notes on page 8 where text is compressed

**Confidence level for this entire issue: LOW to MEDIUM**

Many passages throughout the transcription are best-effort readings that require verification against a higher-resolution scan or the original documents.

## Article-Specific Uncertainties

### 01_The-Christian-Doctrine-of-Justification_ATJ.md
- **Pages 1-2, Block quotes from *Catholicity***: The extended quotations from the book *Catholicity* are set in very small type and are extremely difficult to read at this resolution. Multiple words and phrases in these quotes may be incorrect. A higher-resolution scan is needed to verify these passages.
- **Second pass completed**: Yes
- **Confidence**: LOW for block quote text; MEDIUM for non-quoted paragraphs
- **Page 2, left column**: The continuation text on page 2 (the argument connecting justification doctrine to Sunday legislation) contains numerous uncertain readings. The flow of argument is preserved but individual word accuracy is uncertain.
- **Page 2, left column, Latin phrase**: Transcribed as "*Decrees indicat ordita defensiones*" — this Latin phrase is very unclear and likely incorrect.

### 02_Sides-to-the-Shield.md
- **Page 2, middle column, opening paragraph**: The text about Professor Huxley's remarks at Johns Hopkins is difficult to read. The word "parceling" may be incorrect. Several phrases in this opening are uncertain.

- **Confidence**: MEDIUM

### 08_Chicago-Correspondence.md
- **Page 6**: This article about the Congress of Religions contains uncertain readings throughout. The quoted speeches and specific details about the congress proceedings are difficult to verify at this resolution.
- **Second pass completed**: Yes
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM for structure and main points; LOW for specific quoted text

### Editorial Notes (articles 09-22)
- **Page 8**: The short editorial notes are generally more readable than the longer articles due to simpler sentence structures, but some passages remain uncertain.
- **Note 14 (Marked Papers)**: This note is among the most readable on the page. Confidence: HIGH

## Recommendation

This issue should be verified against a higher-resolution scan (600 DPI or higher) or against the original documents before being considered publication-ready. The article structure, headings, attributions, and general arguments are reliable, but word-level accuracy throughout the body text is insufficient for faithful reproduction.
