In the year 1884 the National Reformers made a bid for support from the Roman Catholic Church, as they could see a common interest between the Protestants and the Catholics. Here is the bid as it appeared in the *Christian Statesman* for August of that year. The Rev. Mr. Scovel is the writer. He says: "This common interest ought to strengthen both our determination to work and our readiness to cooperate with our Roman Catholic fellow-citizens. We may be subjected to some rebuffs in our first proffers, for the time is not yet come when the Roman Catholic Church will consent to strike hands with other churches—as such; but the time has come to make repeated advances and gladly to accept co-operation in any form in which they may be willing to exhibit it." At that time the exact "form" in which they might be "willing to cooperate," was not so clear to them; but they were willing to accept it in "any form," in which it might make an appearance.

In a December number of the *Statesman*, of the same year, the editor said: "Whenever they [the Roman Catholics] are willing to cooperate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join hands with them." But what do they account as "political atheism"? Because the National Constitution does not recognize the Deity and acknowledge "Christ as King of the Nation," and is not so framed as to "place all Christian usages . . . in the fundamental law of the land," they are pleased to call that instrument "an embodiment of political atheism." Thus it is clear that the *Statesman* would join hands with its Roman Catholic brethren in resisting the Constitution which guarantees our rights, and the Government of the United States built upon these rights. This is proven by the fact that in the *Statesman* of July 22, 1893, Mr. Foster, a leading National Reformer, in speaking of the decision of the directors to open the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday, said that this "emphasizes the duty of Christian citizens to separate themselves from organized political evil, by refusing to swear to support the United States Constitution, so long as it remains a compact of political atheism." And so it is a clear case, that so long as the Constitution remains as it is, they are its sworn enemies.

Although it was not at first so very clear to them as to how they could "cooperate" with the Catholics "in resisting political atheism;" yet, three years later, at the congress of Catholic laymen, at Baltimore, Md., Nov. 10–12, 1889, the matter was made clear in the following words, as found in the platform, which was adopted with enthusiasm: "There are many Christian issues in which Catholics could come together with non-Catholics and shape legislation for the public weal. In spite of rebuff and injustice, and overlooking zealotry, we should seek alliance with non-Catholics for proper Sunday observance." Thus was struck a chord that has met with a most hearty response. And, although there has been a difference of opinion as between a Puritan and a Catholic Sunday, in all the efforts of Protestants and Catholics in regard to Sunday, they have been working to the one common end—"proper Sunday observance." And when the gates of the World's Fair were closed they were perfectly agreed; and met on common ground, as is proven by the following, from one of the editors of the *Christian Statesman*, of July 22, 1893; the other from Archbishop Ireland's paper, the *Northwestern Chronicle*, with only this difference; the *Statesman* was the more enthusiastic of the two.

The *Statesman* says: "Hallelujah! The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth! . . . Our readers will agree with us that this is a triumph for righteousness such as the world has seldom witnessed. . . . A more conspicuous subversion of evil designs and triumph of righteousness it is not possible to conceive. Let God have all the glory." Now, there is not a particle of glory in the whole thing; but from the padded petitions, and threats of divine vengeance upon Congress in case of a refusal to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday, down to the disgraceful and most unchristian method of the threatened boycott of the Fair and possible endless litigation coming on as a result, it is a shame and a disgrace to the Nation, and forebodes nothing but evil. And it is nothing short of blasphemy to ascribe glory to God, for there is no "triumph of righteousness" in it.

But Bishop Ireland's paper also saw a "victory" in it, for it said: "The victory is more important than it may appear to be at first glance. . . . The result of it all is to insure the permanence of the Sunday, and the rest, the religion, the emancipated manhood of the poor man who toils from dawn to dusk six days of the week."

And this is not all. One of the dailies of St. Paul, Minn., says:—

> Starting with the victory achieved at Chicago, a movement should be made all along the line in this country for the more effectual consecration and setting aside of the first day of the week as a day of rest and of innocent recreation or worship, as individuals may be inclined.

And so it is, that Protestants, Catholics, and the secular press agree that it was a victory for Sunday; and the result will be the elevation of Constantine's Sunday—the "wild solar holiday of all pagan times,"—and the Sunday of the Papacy; and for which everybody knows there is not a particle of proof in all the Bible.

It is a pleasure to note, however, that all are not so biased toward the Sunday as not to be able to see facts as they exist. Another one of the great dailies of St. Paul, The Pioneer Press, in its issue of Sunday, July 23, said:—

> Those mistake who credit the failure of Sunday opening at the World's Fair to the indisposition of the people to attend on that day. It was no great ethical issue and no feeling with regard to Sabbath observance that settled the state of the Fair, but a simple and plain business proposition. . . . It was this practical consideration, and not any moral argument, that prevailed against the Sunday Fair. The average American will get his money's worth or know the reason why.

This is the common sense view of the case, and none but those who are blinded by religious fanaticism or by a desire that it might be so, could see in this "a triumph for righteousness," or a "victory" for Sunday. While this agitation surely will have a tendency to elevate Sunday before the people and the world, it will also most surely hasten on the work of intolerance and enforcement by law of the institutions of the Church, and the final overthrow of that monument of freedom for which our fathers fought, bled and died.
