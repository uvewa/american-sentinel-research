THE Minister of Railways, Telegraphs and Posts of Belgium, is an extremely religious man, and wishing to secure the suspension of Sunday mails, he has adopted a Sunday or non-Sunday stamp, with a tag separated from the main part of the stamp by the usual perforations, and announcing in two languages—in French and in Dutch—the fact that the letter is not to be delivered on Sunday. The inscription in French reads: "Ne pas livrer le Dimanche;" in Dutch: "Niet bestellen op Zondag." If the persons using these stamps have no religious scruples against their letters being delivered on Sunday, all they have to do is to tear off the tag containing the order and place the upper portion of the stamp upon the envelope. It will be observed that all stamps have the non-Sunday tag, and that those who have no scruples are required to tear the tag off or else be counted as desiring the suspension of Sunday mails. The careless, the indifferent and the ignorant will, in this way, all be reckoned as opposed to Sunday mails. The scheme is quite worthy of the Sunday cause.
