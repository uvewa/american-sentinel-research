SPEAKING of the World's Congress of Religions to be held in Chicago, September 11-27, the New York Observer says: "The discussions will be friendly, not controversial." But to the Catholics has been assigned the first place. The address of welcome will be delivered by Most Rev. P. A. Feehan, D.D., Archbishop of Chicago, and to this there will be a response by Right Rev. Mgr. Gadd, Vicar General, Manchester, England, and His Eminence Cardinal Moran, Archbishop of Sydney, Australia. These men will land "the church" to the skies, and as there is to be no controversy, the speakers who come after them must either give silent consent or else lay themselves open to the charge of making an unseemly attack on "brothren." Rome is certain to get more out of this monstrous humbug parliament than all other denominations combined.
