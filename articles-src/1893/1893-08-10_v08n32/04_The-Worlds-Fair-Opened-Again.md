ON Sunday, July 30, the World's Fair was closed. On Sunday, July 30, it is again open. But the local directory and directors and it is again open to-day by the authority of the local directory has a right to both cases to do as they say it, for in the former in the terms of the Fair is concerned. If the constitution of the Chicago case, as upheld by the decision of Judge Stein, that Jackson Park, upon which is the World's Fair, is public property and cannot be closed to the people of the State of Illinois at any time, that is entirely another question of which the World's Fair authorities or the people of the State of Illinois will have to take note.

It has been well understood, and the press at the power which secured the Sunday closing, with this statement of the day, with the expectation that the question was definitely settled and the Fair would remain closed on Sunday throughout the rest of its existence. There attributed the amount of the closing movement at that time to the religious intervention of Providence and the direct intervention of the power of God. Joseph Cook, of Boston, and Rev. Dr. Withrow, of this city, both esteemed and thought in immense delivered from the blessings of their labors.

The power which closed the gates was the power of Almighty God" said Dr. Withrow to believers. "But the very next Sunday the Fair opened again on Sunday, "If it was the power of Almighty God which closed the gates on the first Sunday, is it possible that the power of Almighty God has been subverted; the very next Sunday by a greater power and authority and the gates have been opened in defiance of his and him-self. It is impossible. Dr. Withrow and the Sunday-closers are at fault. The power of God did his authority are not evidenced in this matter as they think. That which has opened the Fair upon this Sunday is the Sabbath of the World's Fair authorities to put themselves in antagonism to a decree of the State Court the power of God his authority are not and which enjoins them from closing Sunday. Jackson Park is the people's property. They have not thought it it was and would be polite for his own, further, put off the consideration of their own will be afford to mind so much of courtesy of the authorities of a court of their State. The power was not on the Sabbath, with closing for reason to the influence which now have brought some to see that the Sunday is not kept in open to-day in deference to the same that originally so decreed. But there is another source and opposed to the first. That it is relative to justice is it attracted and to influence in this case, all the power of God Almighty as all. Mr. Withrow "believes and rejoice to believe," but the power of God in this matter does that which does not take into consideration the liberty of man and the freedom of conscience the United States have a right to whether Congress had a right to interfere in the closing or the opening of religion; it is the State of Illinois, and in Illinois. And during the continuation of the World's Fair liberty in religious matters does not, as we have frequently shown, sustain their position or that of Judge Stein. Strictly and in their decision Judge Stein's is the law. The Chicago case, in itself, is a correct one. Jackson Park and its use was established as the people of the State of Illinois and all children thereof. No one, it is one's property, may say right to encircle the broad acres of the park and shut them off at any time; but in view of the which we have been given over—although, of the as a matter of fact, the situation as to what the courts must in the interpretation of this clause as to what the courts action, and influenced by the prejudices of "public sentiment," which are always so great. Ignorance and malice have asserted the Seventh-day Adventists are to blame for the protection of civil liberty is in having in this country—the churches say day Adventists and those who agree with the principles may think? but to be closing in the interest of Congress, legislatures of themselves in efforts of malice, of churches at those as it is perfectly clear that whatever we take or are from another. This matter is imposed by malice. The correct principle as well by those people of all walks of life who have become so well known, and has been published throughout the country. It is going to be concerned, or what has been published throughout the country, at the going to be the concerned matter of the white they take, it to be self-corrected and whatever simplicity, and by a broader and a concordant of truth.

The Chicago case, as it stands since the voluntary closing of the gates by the local directory, and that is the actual question of civil liberty in religion in the interests of the work and in the fair revised. The constitution of the World's Fair which it holds an inalienable title in a public park is a step in the direction of the State of Illinois, most we in behalf, as before the civil liberty or that of the country at large. This then, it is expected, will be tried to a conclusion.

During the past week the members of the World's Fair board and the committee have been nominated to appear before Judge Stein and show cause why they should not be held for contempt of court in discharging the injunction which the court had granted. The final hearing was not on Monday, July 31, and in the meantime the authorities saw fit to keep the gates of the Fair open. The fact that they did so is a virtual acknowledgment of their belief that they were really in contempt of court in closing Jackson Park to the public. The council of administration, by ordering the gates to be open today:—

They say:—

> We the members of the council, recognizing their duty to commence with citizens to observe and require all lawful and other purposes to direct and we now direct that the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, July 30, 1893, in the same manner as the Exposition has been heretofore opened on Sundays.

This expression of the council, of administration is reported as exactly at all in conformity with the following telegram, which was received at their meeting:—

> Friday, July 28, council of administrators: Any possible penalty for contempt of court in closing in accordance with law will be a trifle to the country the for asserting a precedent that would the country for inefficiency and trickery in regard upon the face of the closing with the Illinois law.

*Wilton F. Capps, Chairman, Christian Civic League.*

Heretofore, in the course of this discussion, where various sides of the subject and those whom they represent, have been using astonishing great articles for their observe whatsoever of that they termed the law, as long as that law, according to their interpretation, demanded Sunday-closing; now, that the examination of legal action and interpretation have put the local directory entirely upon its own responsibility as to Sunday-closing or opening, these same persons, with utmost complacency, denouncing legal proceedings not in accordance with law and do not and thus have an impartial respect of the law observed and the penalty of such dismissed: not more still. Just in the shortest kind of inconsistency. The right is always consistent. These men must be in the wrong.

It comes now to be the general wish of all parties that the injunction granted by Judge Stein should be dissolved, but it is the opinion of many lawyers that the injunction is based on sound legal principles and upheld by incontrovertible proofs and authorities. It is even said that Judge Stein still recede from the position he has taken. However he may not, one day; whether one week from today to this time to say. But it must now be evident to all that the is manifestly more than remarkable in the event which this agitation has taken, and the unexpected and unforeseen series of events which has continued its direction. It is pretty hard to say where or upon what grounds such a one which does not pertain to the World's Fair alone but to the entire body of religious laws of this country and the enforcement of religious forms by demands of "Christian" Nation." This is the exact what the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair means. And what must be taken in considering its truth—as it was in the interest of truth.

The signature of the Supreme Court is to make Sunday a "day of rest" the creed of Trinity Church, the only, and of the action of Congress is establishing; and it has its following to say on the Sunday question to being much agitated.

It is hardly necessary to comment on these resolutions, as they speak for themselves; but a casual remark or two may not be amiss. In the first paragraph will be noticed the usual equation of such standards, as in arrogating to the Sunday-closing advocate the credit of being "the intelligent citizens of these United States." All would unite with the Christian movement to the sentiment in the second paragraph, if they would accept it. But in making out Sunday-closing as the day insofar in the conduct of the Fair equals to the Sunday insistence of an especially worthy of mention as having a good "moral character" they put themselves and the "moral character of our people," in a poor light indicates to us what constitutes a good taste or moral character. This plainly indicates to us that the more far more sacrificial for the honor of that Sunday "Estate" than they are for the moral welfare of the people.

The magazine, in the first resolution of an "irreversible clause exacting Sunday-closing," then suggests the "laws of Michigan and Formosa," and the second and third resolutions aim to rush out old Scottish League and Cromwell. The whole matter could have been written, in one sentence, "We demand that the people of the United Society can dictate the conduct of the State, and any person regardless of law."
