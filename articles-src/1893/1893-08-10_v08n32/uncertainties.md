# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, 1893-08-10 (v08n32)

## Page 1, Masthead

- **Issue:** Associate editor name OCR reads "CALDIN P. BOLLMAY" — clearly OCR errors for "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" (C. P. Bollman). Transcribed as-is in masthead since it reflects the OCR output; the known correct name is C. P. Bollman.
- **Issue:** Second associate editor listed as "WILLIAM H. BURKE" — this is unusual; the known associate editor is W. H. McKee (William H. McKee). Possible OCR error for "McKEE" rendered as "BURKE," or it may reflect an actual variant listing. Transcribed as found. The article on p. 3-4 (Chicago Correspondence) is signed "W. H. M." which confirms W. H. McKee as a contributor. The masthead listing "WILLIAM H. BURKE" may be an OCR misread.
- **Confidence:** LOW for "BURKE" — likely OCR error for "McKEE"

## Page 1, Lead Article (Article 01)

- **Issue:** "a..archy" in the OCR — the two dots appear to be an OCR artifact for "anarchy." Transcribed as found: "a..archy" to preserve the original uncertainty. This is almost certainly "anarchy" but the exact character(s) between "a" and "archy" are unclear in the scan.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — context strongly suggests "anarchy" but the scan artifact is preserved as found

## Page 4, Article 04 (Pharisaism)

- **Issue:** "The poor profition by his side" — "profition" appears to be an OCR error. Context suggests "publican" (as in the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican, Luke 18). Transcribed as found in OCR ("profition") since I cannot confirm the original printed word without the scan.
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "publican" but transcribed as OCR reads

## Page 7, Advertisements

- **Issue:** Page 7 contains advertisements for Battle Creek Sanitarium Health Foods, a Fountain Pen ink-bottle, "In the Heart of the Sierras" book, Religious Liberty Library, and Young Peoples' Library. These are all skipped as advertisements/publisher info per instructions.
- **Issue:** "PRISON LIGHT" item at bottom of page 7 is garbled OCR ("Trial year. Informed by BENTON, the particular freewheeling. Free. Mysts, Prison Light, Bewfare, Vt.") — this appears to be a small advertisement, likely for a publication called "Prison Light" from Brattleboro, VT. Skipped as advertisement.

## General

- Page 8 contains the Sentinel's subscription information and boilerplate — skipped per instructions.
- The first paragraph of page 8 is a subscriber notice (explaining papers sent without ordering are sample copies) — skipped as boilerplate.
- "W. N. GLENN" is confirmed as the author of article 05 ("Sunday Efforts in California"), matching the known author WNG=W. N. Glenn.
- "T. E. Bowen" is confirmed as the author of article 04 ("Pharisaism"), matching known author TEB=T. E. Bowen.
