# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, August 10, 1893 (v08n32)

## General Notes

This issue presented significant challenges for OCR transcription due to the quality of the B&W scans at 300 DPI. Many passages throughout the issue were difficult to read with confidence, particularly:

- Dense text in small type across three columns per page
- Blurred or degraded characters in many areas
- Some areas where ink bleed-through from the reverse side interferes with readability

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1-2, Article "The Fourth Commandment and the Churches"
- **Multiple passages throughout:** The long editorial spanning pages 1-2 has many areas where individual words are unclear. The general theological argument about the Sabbath, the fourth commandment, and the churches' relationship with Congress is clear, but specific word-level accuracy is uncertain in numerous places.
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM throughout
- **Second pass completed:** Yes, multiple passes attempted

### Page 2, Left Column
- The text beginning "It is written: 'Hallow my Sabbaths...'" continues the Sabbath/creation discussion. Some Scripture references and connecting phrases are difficult to read precisely.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 3, "The Significance of the Sunday Closing" (C.P.B.)
- Several phrases in this article are uncertain due to scan quality
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 3, "Chicago Correspondence"

## Overall Assessment

This issue requires verification against the original PDF at higher resolution. The 300 DPI B&W scans made many passages very difficult to read with confidence. The theological arguments and general content of each article are clear, but word-level accuracy is uncertain in many places throughout the issue. A second pass with clearer source material is recommended.
