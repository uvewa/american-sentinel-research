When it was given out that the council of administration of the Columbian Exposition had determined to open the Fair on Sunday, July 30, in obedience to Judge Stein's order, the president and secretary of the National Closing Committee, at Pittsburg, sent the council a telegram, saying:—

Any possible penalty for contempt of court in closing in accordance with law will be a trifle to the cost of incurring the everlasting contempt of the country for inefficiency and trickery in recent dealings with the Stein injunction if it results in even one re-opening.

Speaking of this telegram, President Higinbotham said:—

The people who sent that message certainly cannot understand the situation we are in. They seem to think that it would be better for all of us to go to jail for disobedience of that injunction than to incur their displeasure by keeping the Fair open. In other words these good people don't want us to obey the law.

The motto of the Sunday closers, "We ask only obedience to law," always has in it this unwritten clause: "when it is in accordance with our ideas." They have no more respect for law than any other anarchists when it runs counter to their hobbies.
