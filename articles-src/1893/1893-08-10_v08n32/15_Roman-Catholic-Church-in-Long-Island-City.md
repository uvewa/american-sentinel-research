A Roman Catholic Church in Long Island City was destroyed by fire recently, and the pastor of a neighboring Baptist Church tendered the priest in charge the Catholic parish the use of the Baptist house of worship. The kind offer was declined, for the reason that the attending public is being regaled with the usual amount of "gush" about "Christian union." Such an occurrence as that in Long Island City is an indication not as much of prosperity since between Protestantism and Protestantism as it is of Protestantism reaching to Rome. "These are worse changes."

Protestantism can unite with the "Church" only by proving recreant to the very principle which gives them the name. The lash and the lion may unite by the former taking a position inside the latter, and by the process of digestion becoming assimilated with the lion; not otherwise.

Those who "would lightly criticize a kind act; but when a Baptist pastor says in explanation of such an act, "We are simply performing an act of courtesy and aiding in this way, as much as we can, fellow Christians who are in misfortune. We are all followers of the same Master," it simply declares that he is in the same category, for the admission of Rome. Protestantism is either the Church just as the body is, the body, to be the exclusion of the "sects," or else it is antichrist, "the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth." Protestantism may quite unite Rome, but only as the river unites with the incessantly, by flowing and becoming a absorption by it in and of it may; then between Protestantism and Romanism were possible. But in any other sense, it would not be Christians, for Rome and not Christian.

Rome is pagan in everything except in name, and to the name given by the admission to everything flowing into it, so Rome itself necessarily gave her character to everything "uniting" with her.
