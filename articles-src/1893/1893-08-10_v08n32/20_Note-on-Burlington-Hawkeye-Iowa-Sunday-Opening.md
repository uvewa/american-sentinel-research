The Burlington Hawkeye having recently taken the ground that Sunday opening at Chicago "undermined the day of rest, and to that extent endangered the liberties of the people and the permanence of the Republic," the Evening Post, of this city, asked it "whether these results had followed in Iowa, where for a number of years the State Fair has been open on Sundays with a large number of visitors." The Hawkeye makes no reply to this inquiry, "which," says the Post, "is a virtual confession that the experience of its own State lends no support to its argument." Another Iowa paper answers the Post's question in these words: "We have never noticed any demoralization from this source."
