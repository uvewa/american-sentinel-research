ELDER JOHN F. JONES delivered last night at the hall of the Seventh-day Adventists, at Calverton, a sermon in which he said: "As Marylanders we have in the past pointed with pride to our position on the subject of civil and religious liberty. But within the past few months there comes to us from across the Bay the sad news that American citizens, yes, and Maryland born citizens, too, are being imprisoned for exercising their God-given right to labor six days and rest upon the seventh, as commanded in the fourth precept of the Decalogue. Can it be true that sectarian bigots in their zeal for God have connived with the civil authorities to place upon our statute books laws to conflict with the dictates of conscience concerning our duties to our Creator? Must my obligations to my Heavenly Father be determined by the code of Maryland? Where in the divine code has God endowed civil authorities with power to dictate how he shall be worshiped?

"There now stand before the people of God two rival days, claiming their consideration as of divine origin. As individuals walking in the footsteps of Him who is our great example we enter upon an investigation of the claims of each. But the Creator is claimant in the case. Would it be right to allow the code of Maryland to decide which claim shall receive the approval of the Creator of the earth? Did Maryland create the heavens and the earth in six days, and command a rest to commemorate that event? Dangers are ahead of us. Is Maryland, my Maryland, prepared to join hands with religious bigots, and bring again the horrors of the Dark Ages? God forbid! Gladly will we join hands in every good word and work with our religious contemporaries. But when it comes to the point of enforcing religious dogmas by civil laws we draw the line right there.

"Civil and religious liberty is a live question, rapidly coming to the front. Are we prepared to meet it in the spirit of the Master? Are we prepared to grant our brother for whom Christ died, who may perhaps differ from us, the same privileges we enjoy, of working six days and resting one, regardless of the opinions of majorities? The question of the Sabbath is not one to be decided by the multitude. It is a matter between man and his Maker, and there let it rest. And to governments, general and local, we say be careful lest you make void the law of God, in which case it would be time for the Lord to work. And to those in bonds for conscience' sake we say, be true to your Master. We point you to the three Hebrew worthies who passed through the furnace of fire rather than bow to the dictates of earthly powers. We point you to Daniel, who endured the den of lions rather than renounce his privilege of calling upon God in prayer. Daniel's God is our God, and He is able to save us."—*Baltimore Sun.*
