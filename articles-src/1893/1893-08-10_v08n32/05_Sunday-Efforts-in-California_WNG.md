## The Proposed Midwinter Fair.

THE San Francisco people are moving for a Midwinter World's Fair, made up of such features of the Chicago Fair as can be secured in connection with as big a show as the State can make at that time of year. It is said that the project is receiving great encouragement among the exhibitors at Chicago. But the fact of the probable carrying out of the project, or its success in such an event, is not the matter of most interest to many of the readers of the SENTINEL.

The Sunday-closing fever has broken out here before it is certainly known that there will be a Fair. It seems that the churches, through the medium of the Christian Endeavor Society, have a burden to run the World's Fairs as well as the church fairs. The Midwinter Exposition in San Francisco is no sooner suggested than the Sunday-closing bee buzzes in the Christian Endeavor bonnet. The Executive Committee of the Alameda County Christian Endeavor Union took the initiative. This committee consists of the president and two secretaries of each local society in the county. There are ninety of these societies with a membership of 4,000. The Executive Committee transacts the business of the union, and its recommendations have considerable weight. There was a meeting of the committee on the evening of the 17th inst. in this city, at which the following resolutions were passed:—

WHEREAS, Sunday opening of the Columbian Exposition has proved to be so objectionable to the larger part of the intelligent citizens of these United States, as seen by the strong protests against it, and the multitudes who on that account have refrained from attending said Fair, and

WHEREAS, The Christian Endeavorsers of California hold in high regard the good name of our State, as well as the moral character of our people, which will be greatly affected by the manner of conducting the proposed Midwinter Fair, and

WHEREAS, We firmly believe that Sunday opening on that occasion would be a dishonor to God, and a grievous violation of his law, therefore be it

Resolved, That we, the Christian Endeavorsers of the Alameda County Christian Endeavor Union welcome the coming of this Fair, and we do most earnestly petition that the Lord's-day be respected by closing the gates on that day; and we suggest to all Christians and law-abiding citizens of the Pacific Coast the eminent propriety of taking no concessions at the Fair and of entering into no contracts regarding exhibits or other matters without a clear, irreversible clause securing Sunday-closing during the entire time of the Exposition, and be it

Resolved, That we recommend to the president of every Christian Endeavor Society in this county to prepare at once and present to every adult member of their society, church and congregation, a petition setting forth these facts, and be it further

Resolved, That our corresponding secretary be instructed to send a copy of these resolutions to the corresponding secretaries of every union in the State, and ask them to pass similar resolutions and circulate such petitions to their societies.

It is hardly necessary to comment on these resolutions, as they speak for themselves; but a casual remark or two may not be amiss. In the first preamble will be noticed the usual egotism of such movements, as in arrogating to the Sunday-closing advocates the credit of being "the intelligent citizens of these United States." All would unite with the Christian Endeavorers in the sentiment of the second preamble, if they would stop there. But in singling out Sunday-closing as the only feature in the conduct of the exposition worthy of mention as having a bearing on the "good name of our State" and the "moral character of our people," they display a very narrow idea of what constitutes a good name or moral character. This plainly indicates that they are far more exercised for the honor of their Sunday "Diana" than they are for the moral welfare of the people.

The suggestion in the first resolution of an "irreversible clause securing Sunday-closing" suggests the "laws of the Modes and Persians," and the second and third resolutions call to mind the old Scottish League and Covenants. The whole matter could have been written in one sentence, namely, "Unless the Christian Endeavor Society can dictate the conduct of the exposition, the church must boycott it."

## INVOKING THE MINISTERIAL WHIP.

We are fast coming to that point where the ministry will be virtually the court of last resort. An instance of our progress in that direction is now before us in this city. The dry goods clerks inaugurated a move for entire Sunday-closing (a number of the stores having been kept open a part of the afternoon). All the employers but two have agreed to a closing proposition, and the clerks have asked the ministers of the city to preach on the subject—presumably for the purpose of coercing these two merchants into line as Sunday observers. Of course, the movement of the clerks is ostensibly that they may have Sunday to themselves; but when the ministers take hold of the matter it takes on a new feature, and even the results, so far gained without their intervention, will be hailed as a victory for Sunday.

But the most incomprehensible act in connection with this movement is that of the Morning Times, always heretofore an ultra opponent of such a principle, in openly proposing a boycott on the two merchants who have so far held out against closing their stores on Sunday. This position on the part of the Times is the more surprising because of its adverse criticism of the Christian Endeavor action in regard to the Midwinter Fair.

## NO MORE "CIVIL SABBATH" TALK.

The "civil Sabbath" hobby is obsolete. It was advocated in California for several years as a blind, but its advocates never wanted it. They wanted to stop work on Sunday because they considered it a sacred day; the civil Sabbath was only a popular campaign cry. The last legislature passed a literal civil Sabbath law; it provides for a day of rest in every seven for laboring men, and as the day is not specified it may be upon any day according to law. But this civil Sabbath law does not stop the clamor for a Sunday law. "This is a Christian Nation" now, according to the Supreme Court of the United States, and a civil Sabbath is entirely too tame an institution for a "Christian" people. The civil Sabbath is dead. That one-day-in-seven rest law will never be enforced except it be on Sunday. It is possible that some day, in some manner, a hypodermic injection of the "dragon" spirit may bring it to life in a new gash. In short, it may in some mysterious way become "Christianized," possibly in the manner in which the Nation was Christianized—by the dictum of a court. There is no telling all that will happen or just how it will happen, in these days of political and religious deception. But one thing we do know, "In the last days perilous times will come." We know this, because the Word of the Lord says so, and already the thick shadow of coming events is cast over us.
