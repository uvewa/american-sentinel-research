The most astounding case of reckless statement and perversion of facts which we have seen for a long time is found in the lesson comment written by J. L. Withrow, D.D., and published in the Interior, of June 22, 1893. Speaking of Paul's visit to Philippi, he says:—

Paul appears to have reached Philippi during the week; and he used the days of it, probably, to look about and study the people. On the Sabbath day he betook himself to a spot outside the city, where he learned some devout Jewish worshipers, women, were accustomed to gather. He had become a Christian and the first day of the week was his Sabbath. But Paul was no stubborn bigot, bent on squaring everything to his convictions and creed.

"He had become a Christian and the first day of the week was his Sabbath." A statement more unfounded, more out of accord with the facts and circumstances more utterly false in the light of New Testament history and the practices and surroundings of the times, could scarcely be made. It is equally astounding that a man like Mr. Withrow could have had the face to make it without qualification, or that he could expect it to go unchallenged. Such perverting of facts, and misleading students of the Bible, comports illy with Mr. Withrow's place as a minister of truth, or with the Interior as a religious paper.

The book of Acts and the letters of Paul, taken altogether, contain but one reference to the first day of the week, (Acts 20:7), and that reference shows (see Conybeare and Howson's "Life of Paul," as well as the text) that Paul used Sunday as an ordinary day for secular work, pursuing his journey after the meeting on "Saturday evening," of which the account is given. On the other hand, the Sabbath is mentioned, and the observance of it by Paul and the other apostles is declared repeatedly in the book of Acts. The blindness which induced Dr. Withrow to write as above surpasses credulity, and the want of literary and Christian honesty can scarcely be reconciled with the facts.

All this is a strong contrast with a passage from the notes of Alexander McLaren on the same lesson, Sunday School Times, June 17, 1893, in which he incidentally describes Paul honestly and accurately as he appeared at Philippi.

Dr. McLaren says:—

> If the reading of the Revised Version is adopted, the apostle concluded that he would find a Jewish "place of prayer" somewhere by the riverside, and went to look for it on the Sabbath. "We sat down and spoke unto the women." That is all. No blowing of trumpets, no beating of drums of any sort. A few women and four weather-beaten travelers talking together by the banks of the rushing river. How scornfully the great folk of Philippi would have smiled if they had been told that the chief title of their city to be remembered at all would be the presence in it of that one insignificant Jew, and his letter to the church founded on that morning.

This accords with the facts. The term "Christian," if used at all at that time, was one of reproach. Paul was yet a Jew proclaiming the world's Messiah as the redeemer of both Jews and Gentiles. To assure that he and his fellow apostles had broken away from prevailing customs, were teaching that Sunday was the Sabbath, and that he was in the habit of keeping it as such, at Philippi, and that he went to this "Jewish place of prayer" only in the accommodative spirit of his larger faith, when there is no trace of any such thing on record in all that he or the writer of the Acts ever wrote, evinces ignorance or a desire to conceal facts for the sake of supporting an imperilled Sunday. Men who can write thus are preparing for themselves and their "American Sabbath" repeated defeats and an increasing lack of confidence on the part of "sinners" whom they seek to win to faith in the Bible and Christianity. Such treatment of sacred history is most efficient in destroying faith in the Book and in the religious leaders who thus pervert facts in order to sustain a false practice.

Sunday is an "ecclesiastical institution" which was gradually developed after the New Testament period, and if its observance cannot be defended on that ground, there is no shadow of defense for it.—*The Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.*
