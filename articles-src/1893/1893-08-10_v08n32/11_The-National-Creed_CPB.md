Last week we remarked that "before Christianity can have practically as the National Reformers demand that it shall have 'an undeniable legal basis' in this country, it must be defined; that is, it must be decided what constitutes Christianity; and that definition will be the national creed just as the Nicene creed was the creed of Rome." But really not all of this yet remains to be done. More than a year ago the Supreme Court declared this to be "a Christian Nation," and only six months later, Congress decided that Sunday is the "Christian Sabbath," enjoined by the fourth commandment, and consequently that its observance is an essential part of Christianity. Taking into consideration all that is involved in what has been done, the Nation even now has quite an elaborate creed; and in the Sunday-closing proviso an attempt was made to enforce a practical recognition of that creed upon the people.

The action of Congress, considered in the light of the reasons for that action, was a virtual recognition of the being of God, the Sonship of Christ, the inspiration of the Scriptures, and the divine authority of the first day of the week. Or, if preferred, the order can be reversed; namely, the recognition of Sunday as the "Christian Sabbath," enforced by the fourth commandment, necessarily involves the professed recognition of the being, power and authority of the Author of the commandment, the divine Sonship of Christ—the Founder of Christianity—and the inspiration of the Scriptures which contain the fourth commandment.

It matters not that some of these things are true. If every article in the governmental creed were correct it would not alter the principle in the least. A government can have no possible use for a creed except to enforce it to a greater or less extent on the individual citizen, and therefore, such a creed is entirely out of place. The moral allegiance of the individual is due to God. Each man is entitled to have and to hold his own creed regardless of what any or every other man in the universe believes; and government has no right to interfere with him in any manner, either in holding or in practicing that creed, unless under color of religion the individual interferes with the natural rights of his fellows. The Government of the United States has declared that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that the fourth commandment enjoins its observance, but not a single individual is under the slightest obligations to accept this declaration as true or to pay any respect to it whatever, for the Government was entirely out of place in making it.
