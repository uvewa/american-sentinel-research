THE local directors having reached the rule enabling the Fair to be in large open on Sunday, will they carry out their duty to return the appropriation of twenty two million dollars made by the Government for the privilege of having Sunday opening been maintained until the close of the Exposition. It was given on that condition; and the conditions shall continue to be observed. But a change to the administrative policy opens the fair on Sunday, and Sunday opening showed the temper on the Sunday question and the churches bared their power over Congress and the executive. The Chicago *Herald* affords a good example of the Chicago system of economy.

A peculiarity of the Chicago system of economy is that it has a new code of right wrong for every one and, no distinction of starvation surviving the almighty dollar.

That is to say, having deliberately forfeited their right to the enjoyment of the exposition by a violation of the conditions attached, and subsequently having found that Sunday opening did not pay as well as they had expected, their position is not precisely what it was before Sunday opening.

It is precisely as if a man who had violated the conditions imposed in his grandfather's will, should come forward with clear notice that the money on the ground that marriage was a failure and he had begun negotiating for a divorce.
