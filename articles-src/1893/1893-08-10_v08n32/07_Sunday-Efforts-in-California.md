The Proposed Millstone Fair.

THE San Francisco papers are now very busy just about the proposed Young People's World's Fair, made up of such features of the Chicago Fair as can be selected in connection with all to achieve as the States can make at their half of days. It is said to already be receiving great encouragement among the exhibitors of Chicago. But the fact of the probable carrying out of the project, or of its success in mid its search, and the fear of the possible will be upon the readers of the *Sentinel*.

Now we know before it is certainly known to the facts, that for some time past the churches, through the medium of a Christian Endeavor Society's, have been trying to run the World's Fairs as well as to run the World's Fair at stated for the public, Chicago and San Francisco. If San Francisco is no better conditioned in herself. That is the basis upon which Christian Endeavor Society took the the Convention of the Alameda of Illinois. Christian Endeavor took the bodies of the cities. This committee has been organized for the purpose of becoming a society in the country. There are ninety thousand Endeavor societies, representing 4,000,000 the Executive Committee trained them. The members of the Executive recommendations have been completed in weight. Those who are a meeting of the Christian Endeavor was on the convention on the thirsting of the 11th as Christian Endeavor union had no use for this who take the part of them.

(Continued on page 253)

God deals with nations as with individuals (for nations are only individuals combined), and his Lord ever "He that exalteth himself shall be abased" "haughty spirit before a fall." "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." "To every one that exalts himself, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the Father, but he that to God to our Father which is in heaven." Let us, therefore, as a people turn to our God; "the Lord will" repay with his righteous.

*Chicago, July 31.*
