THE most astonishing case of reckless statement and perversion of facts which we have seen for a long time is found in the issue, containing an article written by Withrow, D.D., and published in the *Interior* of June 29, 1893. Speaking of Paul's visit to Philippi, he says:—

> Paul appears to have reached Philippi during the week, and it is natural that he took about and study the people. On the Sabbath he went out of the city by a river side, where he learned some devout Jewish worshipers were in the habit of going to pray. . . . He had his heart on all matters respecting the Sabbath. But Paul was to so enlarge began, because he was a servant to all.

"He had become a Christian and the first day of the week was his Sabbath." It is a statement much unwarranted, more of storm the the falsehood came out more utterly false in the light of New Testament truth. Paul was a man of the surroundings of the times, could scarcely have been expected to know as much as men like Mr. Withrow could have had the time it is wished to speak now on of or that he could expect it to go unattacked. Such perversion of, facts, and misleading students of the Bible, comports with Mr. Withrow's a place as a minister of truth, or with the *Interior* as a religious paper.

The book of Acts and the letters of Paul, taken altogether, but ten times and more, to the first day of the week, (Acts 20:7), that reference shows clearly that the meeting was on Saturday night (as well as the text) that Paul used Sunday as a week day for secular employment—making his journey, after the meeting on "Saturday evening," by land to Assos; the apostle, on the other hand, the Sabbath is mentioned, and the observance of it by Paul and the other apostles is declared repeatedly in the book of Acts. The blindness which induced Dr. Withrow to make so sheer a misquotation, that such a show of literary and Christian honesty can scarcely be reconciled with the facts.

All this is a string extract with a place from the notes of Alexander McMillan. See our paper of June 29, 1893. *Sentinel* of June 15, 1893, in which he incidentally describes Paul's daily and it actually occurred at Philippi.

Dr. McLaren says:—

> If the reading of the *Revised Version* is adopted, the suggested form to the words by week a "place of prayer" was known by the riverside, and a door, Paul went there and sat down himself to be known to a passage of trumpet, no healing of devas of any sort.
