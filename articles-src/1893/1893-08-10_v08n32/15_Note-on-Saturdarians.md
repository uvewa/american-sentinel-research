Not content with stealing the fourth commandment to enforce the claims of Sunday, the Christian Statesman has also appropriated the term "Sabbatarian" and now applies to observers of the seventh day, the real Sabbatarians (see Webster), an epithet coined for the occasion, namely, "Saturdarians." The Statesman is welcome to all such methods of warfare. Blackguards and fishwomen should have a monopoly of epithet hurling. It is quite beneath the dignity of any paper which is Christian in anything but in name.
