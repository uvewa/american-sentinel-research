THERE has been some dispute as to whether the Sunday-closing proviso in the act appropriating the souvenir coins is law. The legal question may never be answered by authority to which all will bow; but the fact is that whether technically law or not, Congress, by that action, showed its temper on the Sunday question, and the churches learned their power over Congress and the executive. The proviso did not, it is true, bind the Columbian Exposition until the conditions had been accepted by the directory; but it was from the first law to the Government itself as a whole, and so, indirectly, to the citizens, the integral parts of the Government. The officers of the Government—the servants of the people—were bound to disburse that money only in accordance with the terms of the act appropriating it.

Under the United States Constitution as it is, Congress could scarcely have done more to give governmental recognition to Sunday than it did in the Sunday-closing proviso. The technical designation of the act does not affect its significance in the least. By its decision of February 29, 1892, that this is "a Christian Nation," and that for that reason Congress could not forbid the importation of Christian ministers, the Supreme Court created in this country the very relation between the Church and the State that has always been the distinguishing feature of the Papacy, namely, subordination of the State to the Church. And by the Sunday-closing proviso Congress gave practical recognition to that evil principle, appropriating $2,500,000 to purchase the observance not only of a religious institution, but of an institution which is the distinguishing mark of an apostate and fallen church.

The significance of the Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, in the matter of Trinity Church, this city, and of the action of Congress in conditioning an appropriation upon the observance of a religious institution, can scarcely be overestimated. The Supreme Court might very properly have found in the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution itself ground for the decision that clergymen could not be excluded under the contract labor law. To forbid any congregation to employ whoever it saw fit as pastor would certainly be interfering with the free exercise of religion, and so in violation of the Constitution; but ignoring this very proper ground, the court went back of the Constitution, to the Colonial Charters, and to the customs and sentiment of the people, and there found a law, which is, in effect, declared to be above even the Constitution; and this higher law is simply the Christian sentiment of the people; and in effect the Supreme Court says that no legislation can be valid if in opposition to that sentiment; thus subordinating the powers of the Government to that sentiment; or in other words, subordinating the secular to the religious, the State to the Church.

The Christian sentiment of the country is embodied in the Church, and the Church must declare that sentiment. But if the courts are to take cognizance of that sentiment and decide questions in accordance with it, it follows as certainly as night follows day, that the Church is above the court, and indeed, above the whole Government, for it holds the legislation of the Nation in its hands. And to this wicked principle Congress bowed when it yielded to the clamor of the churches and appropriated money on the condition that the Columbian Exposition should observe a religious institution, the "Christian Sabbath," enforced, as Congress by its action declared, by the fourth commandment of the Decalogue.
