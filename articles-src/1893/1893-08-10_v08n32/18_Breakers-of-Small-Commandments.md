BREAKERS of small commandments at the World's Fair, the Mail and Express says:—

> There are hundreds of thousands of visitors as well as citizens of Chicago and of surrounding cities and towns, who, while are commercial on their generation on Sunday, do not profess to know the natural demands of Sabbath Christian people who have protested against this such a profane and infidel proceeding concerned against it.

Just so; necessarily confusion must be kept up or at all hampered. If there is anything in this the movement that it is more empty than the harvest with both heads out, it is this hollow pretension which makes an appeal in governmental "piety" to atone for the sins of the nation.
