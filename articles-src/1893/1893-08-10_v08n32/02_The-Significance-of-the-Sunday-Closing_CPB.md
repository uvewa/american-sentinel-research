THEREFORE, this Sabbath question is not a question merely of *days* as such; it is not a question merely as to whether we shall have one day of another; and neither is it a question as to whether we shall have this one freed the other, or another, and whether we shall have him the one true one. Another. It is a question as to whether we shall honor the one true Christian. It is a question as to whether we shall wear the sign of the true God of all his power to save, or whether we shall wear the sign and show of that powerlessness to save. *Which sign do you serve?* That right sign and no other the proposed saviour we shall examine next week.

The Significance of the Sunday Closing.

THERE has been some dispute as to whether the Sunday-closing proviso in the appropriation bill has the force of law. The legal question may never be answered by authority of the courts (it will how); but the fact is that whether technically it is law, or is only custom, by that action, showed the temper on the Sunday question and the churches bared their power over Congress and the executive. The hard fact, and it, is true that, from Columbus Exposition until the condition had been accepted by the directory; but it still remains that the churches, as a fact that as a whole, and so, indirectly, to the Government. The officers of the Government were the ones who actually handed that congress this money only in the terms of the act of the appropriating it.

Under the United States Constitution as it is, Congress could never have done anything to give governmental recognition to Sunday than it did in the Sunday-closing proviso. The binding nature of that action does not affect the spirit of the thing in the least. By its action Congress recognized and set apart "Sunday, or the Sabbath," as a religious institution, and it did this as a Nation, and that for that reason had established and made the practice of Christian ministers, the Supreme Court by its decision and in every one has always been the distinguishing mark between the Church and the State that has always been the distinguishing mark of the Papacy, namely, subordination of the State to the Church. And by the Sunday-closing proviso Congress gave practical recognition to that principle, in appropriating $2,500,000 to permit the admission only on a single condition, a condition which is the distinguishing mark of an apostate religion.

The signature of the Supreme Court is to make Sunday a "day of rest" the creed of Trinity Church, the only, and of the action of Congress in establishing an appropriation upon the observance of a religious institution, can scarcely be overestimated. The Supreme Court might very people have found in the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution itself ground for the decision that churches could not be so endowed under the contract labor law. To forbid any congregation to employ whatever it saw fit as a matter would certainly be interference with the free exercise of religion, and so in violation of the Constitution. But upon this very proper ground, the court went back of the Constitution, to the Continental Charters, and to the customs and sentiments of the people, and thus found a law, which is in effect, declared to be above even the Constitution, and that higher law is simply the Christian sentiment of the people; and in effect the Supreme Court says that no argument can be said to be valid in opposition to that sentiment (we use the word sentiment "for the Government to that sentiment); or in other words, Christianity the national religion, the State to the Church.

The Christian sentiment of the country is embodied in the Church, and the Church must decide that sentiment. And if the courts are to take cognizance of that sentiment and decide questions in accordance with it, it follows as certainly as night follows day, that the Church is over the court, and indeed, above the whole Government, for it holds the legislation of the Nation in its hands. And is to the wicked principle Congress bowed when, to use the words of the act, to give the churches and appropriate money on the very condition that that property should observe a religious institution, the "Christian Sabbath," by keeping it holy in its action declared, by the fourth commandment of the Decalogue.
