THE third and last volume of Mr. Master's History of the United States contains much instructive material. Of the restrictions that prevailed in the States of our Union for religion after the Revolution. In places a man's right to vote depended upon his religious opinions. Thus in South Carolina "a free white man must believe in 'the existence of a God, in a future state of reward and punishment,' and have a freehold of five acres of land." A queer mixture of piety and poll that did not do.
