IT seems that the churches, through the Congress of the United States, have gone as far as it is possible for human power to go toward changing the law of the Most High, it is well to inquire what this means.

The steps that they have taken up the fourth commandment, and have taken out of it what the Lord distinctly and intentionally put there, and have put into it what the Lord never intended to be there, and which never could by any human presumption be put there, it is proper to inquire what this means.

THE Lord of heaven and earth, spake to men the fourth commandment which reads about the seventh; and afterward wrote it twice with his own finger on tables of stone. When he spoke it, and when he wrote it, he had plainly and definitely the seventh day—and in this "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." For forty years by three special acts each week he kept before the people in a way in which it was impossible to mistake, his own day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Besides this, through the whole course of his revelation in the written Word, and by his teaching, in the letter of Jesus and in the Gospel, he has in all ways at all times Jesus Christ on earth, he always set before all people the great importance of this statement.

Now all this being true, when the Congress of the United States, deliberately decides and it is the legislation of the Nation and "the first day of the week, commonly called 'Sunday,' or the Sabbath," and the people of the United States and the world shall be, by the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, it is important to study the high-handed procedure and see what its nature is. When the directory of the World's Fair acted contrary to the strict and literal letter of the act of Congress in this matter, these churches denounced it as "anarchy," "rebellion," "nullification," "treason," etc., etc. This too when there had been no official construction of the act of Congress which the United States courts plainly declared was exceedingly ambiguous. According to their own judgment then, what is this action of the churches and Congress, not only in disregarding, but in deliberately changing the words of the act of Congress of the Most High, when in every possible way he himself had given the authoritative construction of it? what is it then, according to their own showing, but anarchy, rebellion, nullification, treason, etc., etc.?

If this is what the action of the directory was with respect to the law and Government of the United States, then what but this same, is this action of the churches and Congress with respect to the law and Government of the Most High? Shall the law and government of God be more sacred than that of God's? must be, more guilty than tampering with the law of man be, more guilty than tampering with the law of God? Nay, shall they not? Is tampering with the divine law be as much anarchy actually as it spread toward man, and as his law is more sacred than human.

THERE is an instance in history which, with the endorsement of an eminent thinker, serves well as an illustration in this connection. Two hundred years ago the English colony in Ireland had a parliament of their own, subordinate however to the supreme authority of the Parliament of Great Britain, says the historian:—

> The Irish Lords and Commons had presumed not only to re-enact an English act passed expressly for the purpose of binding Ireland, but to re-enact it with alterations. The alterations were trifling; but the alteration, even of a letter was tantamount to a Declaration of Independence.

*Macaulay, History of England,* middle of chap. XVIII.

As the alteration "even of a letter" in the supreme law, by a subordinate power, is "tantamount to a declaration of independence," then what but a complete and defiant declaration of independence, is this action of the churches and Congress of the United States in altering by a presumptuous "interpretation," not merely a letter but the whole intent and purpose of one-tenth of the supreme law of the universe? Are the churches and Congress of the United States indeed independent of the Lord Almighty? Are they sovereign, and not subject with respect to the law of the Most High? Nay, nay. However sovereign and independent their action may declare them to be, they will yet find that in all these things whereof they have dealt so exceeding proudly, the Lord God is yet above them. Macaulay's further comment on the Irish incident is most fitting in this present case:—

> The colony is Ireland was unquestionably a dependency; a dependency, not merely by the common law of the realm, but by the express provision of a statute; and if a dependency were permitted to pass acts of legislation departing even in the smallest degree from the terms of such a statute, it would have been absurd to say that the paramount country could set limits to the right of the subordinate legislature.

EVERYBODY can see the force of this positively. Nor is it in the least strained or overdrawn. It is fitting in every sense and on every point. Surely there never was on this earth a more high-handed proceeding than this action of the churches and Congress of the United States in changing so far as in its human power to change, the law and the Sabbath of the Lord God. The Sabbath of the Lord is not a matter merely of one day or another as such. It is a day, it is true, and it is much more. The day of the Lord, the seventh day as God has made it, is an institution bearing the imprimatur, the nature, of Divinity. It bears indelibly stamped upon it the name and superscription of the Creator of all things on earth. And to substitute in its other day for the Sabbath God has established, as the churches and Congress of the United States have done, is to counterfeit the spiritual coin of the realm of Jehovah and force men to accept it as the genuine. We do not say that these men know what they have done, or what they are doing. Neither did the Chosen managers and Pontius Pilate, eighteen hundred and sixty years ago, know what they were doing when they rejected and crucified the Lord and set up a murderer in his stead. They did not know what they were doing, but they did it. These too have not done it knowingly; yet they have done it.

It is a sign, says he, "that ye may know that I am the Lord your God." Wherein is it a sign? The first of all things that God is to be known by in any degree is his character. Therefore, of the Sabbath, it is written: "It is a sign . . . for [because] in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed [soul delighted]." Ex. 31:17. It is a sign, therefore, by which men may know the Creator of all things, and that he has the power of creation. And these days when "science" is taking the place of the Creator of all things, and of creation, it is time that men should know God as the Creator, who has the power of creation. And now as the time never before, and as never since the Sabbath of the Lord, by which men may know him shall be exalted that men may get for him and know him for themselves. It is not strange, therefore, that the enemy of all righteousness should take supreme measures to shut away from the world the sign by which men may know the creative power of God is and must always be.

JESUS Christ is the Creator. Jesus Christ created the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that in them is, in wet times and in dry times and in divers manners, spoke unto the fathers by the prophets, and hath, in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds." Heb. 1:1, 2. For "by him were created all things by Jesus Christ." Eph. 3:9. And this is why he declares and takes gods upon the point that they have not created the heavens and earth.—Jer. 10:11-16. It was Jesus Christ who spoke, "Why call ye me Lord, Lord" . . . He who makes earth and all that is therein by the breath of his mouth. . . . For he spake and it was done; he commanded and it stood fast." Ps. 33:6-9. "He spake and it was done." And his seventh day at the close of creation he rested. He rested in the completeness, it was he who hallowed it and sanctified it. It was Jesus Christ, then, who thus made the Sabbath—the rest—of the Lord on the seventh day. And the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord Jesus Christ. Eph. 3:9. It was he who made the Sabbath for man. It was he who set it to be so to man. To hold to the Sabbath is to hold to Jesus Christ, the Creator, the man. And this is why it is so essentially bound up with the new creation and put away the seventh day, the Sabbath, in the place of the Sabbath of Jesus and put away Jesus Christ. This is what the Sabbath is, and this is what it means. This is what it would have still been in the time to have and to hold.

BUT man sinned. He did not permanently a part of the Lord's original creation. Through sin, man came over to the enemy of God, himself and all his works. And he who would give man truly give man more than he gave them, though man and all was lost, yet God in Jesus Christ freely and willingly became the man's Redeemer. He by whom God created all things, is also he through whom God redeems all. He through whom the power of God is manifested in creation, is also the same one through whom the power of God is manifested in salvation. And the power of God, whatever, or wherever, or unto whatever purpose it may be manifested, is the same power; for he is the same yesterday and to-day and forever; he changeth not, with him is no variableness nor shadow of turning. It is ever the same, the power of God, the creative power. And the power of God manifested through Jesus Christ unto salvation is exactly the same as the power of God manifested through Jesus Christ unto creation. Therefore wherever salvation to only man ever comes, it is ever and altogether a new creation over again. "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them." Eph. 2:10. "If any man be in Christ he is a new creature [creation]." Ps. 31:10. "If any man be in Christ he is a new creature." 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15, R.V. It is yet further evident that there is nothing but new, and solely creation over again, because the very word salvation, of redemption, when completed is only the accomplishment, in spite of sin, of the original purpose, of what would have been and remained still, and there been no sin. Therefore, since salvation is a new creation, it follows inevitably from the nature of things, that the sign of creation is the sign also of salvation; the Creator being the same power—the power of God, it follows that the sign of that power through Jesus Christ, unto the accomplishment of creation, is in itself the sign of the same power through the same Jesus Christ, which brings the same sign, the sign of the same creative power of God. And since that is the original purpose, so its still the sign of the Creator of all things in the accomplishment of the original purpose. Therefore the sign is in the everlasting rest. This sign is the Sabbath of the Lord which he set to be the sign of his creative power; which sign is also the sign of his power that sanctifies—saves. For it is he, the Lord, which he set to be his sign that God may know the Creator. And this it is, and it is the sign by which men may know him in redemption as in creation, the Almighty Saviour, the Creator in Redeemer. See John 1:3, Col. 1:15-17.

As salvation is creation, as the Creator is the Redeemer, as the creative power of God takes upon the point that they have not any sun, as with all the power of the creation they create not. Thus "by him" were all things "created that are by God to the creation of his things." Since it is that the works of God creation image, and put away a good a God from them, to them, takes created together." Well, had, declared this same combined. Have Who is that held Lord I and there to no other God besides! He is God. It's to God and there is no God for I am God, and there is more also them. See Isa. 43:1-12; 45:12-22.

And the Sabbath of the Lord, set apart from every created thing to the end, as a witness of the power of God, bears in it separation from every constituency of creation as a virtual recognition of God, the sign is as a virtual the sign and the divine authorship of the Scriptures; and the divine authorship and authority of the law being established, as the churches and Congress have preferred, the order can be reversed; the fourth commandment, and therefore the whole "Sabbath," enforced by the civil arm of Christian communities, involves the profound recognition of the divine power and authority of the Author of the commandment, the divine *Sunday* of the whole law. So if the Sunday be preferred, the order can be reversed, the inspiration of the Scriptures which contains it can be vindicated.

It matters not that some of these things are true, if every letter or principle. The creed cannot be enforced, therefore the churches creed except to enforce it to a greater or less extent will impose their creed. And therefore, such a creed is entirely out of the jurisdiction of civil government. That is vital also to God. Each man is entitled to have and to hold his own creed regardless of what any or every other man may think. The civil government, as such has no right to interfere with any man whatsoever in holding or in practicing that creed, unless some right of fellow-man is interfered with—one individual, interference with the natural rights of another. What the churches of the United States have declared and Congress carried into practice, the fourth commandment enjoins its observance, it is but plain equity and the statement of the slightest obligation to keep that day, or to make any attempt at all in the Congress; but since the Constitution of the United States was adopted, the only legitimate use of that was to "secure" "rights," the Government was entirely out of place in making it, or anything of the sort.

THE Constitution of the United States did not create religious rights, but simply recognized them. They were granted by the Creator, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights." And, by the way, the Hon. Richard M. Johnson, in his matchless Sunday Mail Reports to Congress on Sunday mails, January 19, 1829, said:—

> They are not combated or resisted at all by extended independence, and, as of rights, of which governments ever deprive an important portion of citizens, assume must. Before the civil power may trample such rights, it must adjudicate and confirms them. Then some who pass conventicles and temples upon natural rights are the worst of tyrants, no matter what their professed may be.
