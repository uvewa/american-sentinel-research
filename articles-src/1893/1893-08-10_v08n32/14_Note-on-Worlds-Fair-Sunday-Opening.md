After being closed one Sunday, the World's Fair was again open on that day, July 30. The attendance was only 18,637. The game of battledoor and shuttlecock being played between the Sunday openers and the Sunday closers in the matter of the Columbian Exposition is in a sense interesting, though owing to the manner in which it has been conducted—in utter disregard of any correct principle—it cannot be viewed with any degree of satisfaction.
