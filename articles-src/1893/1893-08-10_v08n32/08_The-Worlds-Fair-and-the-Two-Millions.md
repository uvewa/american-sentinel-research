The amazing casuists of Chicago are now endeavoring to show that no moral or legal obligation to return the Government's $2,000,000 rests upon the World's Fair concern. The Chicago Herald affords a good example of this latest argument:—

The local directors having rescinded the rule requiring the Fair to be kept open on Sundays, it is clearly not their duty to return the appropriation of nearly two million dollars received from the Government in the shape of souvenir coins. Had Sunday opening been maintained until the close of the Exposition, a moral obligation might have rested upon the directors for the return of this money. But a change in the administrative policy with regard to Sunday opening has changed the situation as it affects the Government appropriation.

That is to say, having deliberately forfeited their right to the enjoyment of the appropriation by a violation of the condition attached, and subsequently having found that Sunday opening did not pay as well as they had expected, their position is now precisely what it was before the condition was violated!

This is precisely as if a man who had forfeited a legacy by marriage, against the condition imposed in his grandfather's will, should come forward later and claim the money on the ground that marriage was a failure and he had begun proceedings for a divorce.

A peculiarity of the Chicago system of ethics is that it has a new code of right and wrong for every new set of circumstances involving the almighty dollar.—*New York Sun.*
