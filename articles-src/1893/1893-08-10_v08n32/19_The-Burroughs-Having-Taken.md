THE Burroughs having taken the actions the certain point that Sunday opening at Chicago "undermined the day of rest, and to that extent endangered the peace of the the rights and the permanence of the Republic," the *Evening Post*, in that same day, asked it "whether these results were followed in Love, when four or so many years the State Fair has been open on Sundays with a large number of visitors." The *Bürgerzeitung* makes to reply to this query, "which," says the *Post*, "it is obvious to anybody who speaks the plain language tends his ear to support its being an opinion." Another *Post* paper keeps answering this *Post's* question in these words: "Is the *Post's* question this means: two Sundays?"
