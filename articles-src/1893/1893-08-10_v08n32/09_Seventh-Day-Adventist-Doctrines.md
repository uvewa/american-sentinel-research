EXACT statement of the doctrines taught at the bill of the Seventh-day Adventist church. That statement is: "As Marylandites as we have in this it is the subject of civil and religious liberty. The great Endeavor conventions have to come to us from across the Bay and the Maryland have citizens, etc., and Maryland born citizens, too, not being careful for entertaining their visiting Godly right to labor six days and at rest upon the fourth from the seventh day, as set forth in the precept of the Decalogue. Can it be true that Christians have so far departed that they have connected with the civil authorities to carry on and open or settle those tools and carry on is this matter of who shall serve? Are we serving our duties to our Creator? Must we not see this is to make our God a by-product, terminated by the edict of Maryland? Where the principles of this, and where an all the authorities with power to dictate to them of civil to them?

The Constitution of the United States did not create religious rights, but simply recognized them. They were granted by the Creator, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights." And, by the way, the Hon. Richard M. Johnson, in his matchless Sunday Mail Reports to Congress on Sunday mails, January 19, 1829, said:—

> They are not combated or resisted at all by extended independence, and, as of rights, of which governments ever deprive an important portion of citizens, assume must. Before the civil power may trample such rights, it must adjudicate and confirms them. Then some who pass conventicles and temples upon natural rights are the worst of tyrants, no matter what their professed may be.
