WE are fast coming to that point where the minority will be virtually disfranchised in last resort. An instance of our times that this direction is one before set in this city. The day goods clerks inaugurated a move for entire Sunday-closing in numbers of the stores having been upon a part of the stores having been upon a part of the day. All the employees say they want the two holidays for themselves; but the clerks have asked the ministers to help them, and accordingly the usual clerical means have been brought to bear in sermons. Of course, the movement of the clerks is certainly that they may have Sundays to themselves; but when the ministers take hold of the matter it takes on a new course, and even the results, and are quite without their intentions, will give out a victory for Sunday.

But the most incomprehensible act in connection with this movement is that of the *Evening Times,* already heretofore as being editorially much less disposed to the openly opposing a boycott on the two or three firms who would not consent to shut closing their stores on Sunday at all, and moreover, has given its columns, the more surprising because of its adverse criticisms of the Christian Endeavor action in regard to the Millstone Fair.

We quote the word "trade."

The "civil Sabbath" hobby is chestnut. It was advocated, in California for several years as a blind, but the advocates never got far enough the world to dare to work on Sundays because they considered it sacred in honor of a religious campaign campaign. The last legislatures passed a liberty of California and finally set the law to provide a law for a day of rest in every seven for laboring men, and as the day is not specified it may be upon any day according to its. But the civil Sabbath law does not stop the clamor for a Sunday law: "This is a Christian Nation," now, according to the Supreme Court of the United States, and a civil Sabbath is merely the starting point.
