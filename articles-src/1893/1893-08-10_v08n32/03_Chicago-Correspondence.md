AFTER being closed one Sunday, the World's Fair was again open on that day; July 23. The attendance was only 17,481. The game of battleder and shuttlecock being played between the Sunday closers and the Sunday closers in the matter of the Columbian Exposition is in a most lamentable, though owing to the manner in which it has developed—not altogether unexpected of any great disappointment—it cannot disregard of any general correctness—it is viewed by many with any degree of satisfaction.

Nor content with stealing the fourth commandment to the utter silence of the churches, to enforce the Sabbath, and the Sunday closers of the purpose, and the Fair also appropriated the term "Sabbatarians" and now applies to observers of the seventh day, the real Sabbatarians (see Webster), an epithet coined for the occasion—"Saturday-ians." The *Siebenner* is now come to all such methods of warfare. Biskregatious and furthermore shown to be a monopoly of eighth Sunday. It is quite enough the strength of this between Protestantism and Romanism is the same as in Christian in anything but in name.

*The Canadian Baptist* of July 13, has the following to say on the Sunday-closing question to being much agitated in Canada:—

> We urge the question upon social and moral, and upon every religious, reason, because we hold firmly to the view that the religious side of the question is one with which civil courts and regulations have nothing to do. The sphere of moral suasion for Sundayrest and of church discipline against those who violate the day of the Lord, the first the rest of the run not of the run on Sundays, every Christian will see that from exercise of his, the day and make Sabbath opportunities and privileges, and continue by his life to bring to bear upon others in relation to his high spiritual uses, will still be one between himself and his Master; from the religious point of view no Sabbath observance which was enforced by civil statutes and penalties can be of any value in the sight of Him who "looketh upon the heart."

It is convincing to see the Baptist thus take its stand firmly on the right ground —that religious duties enforced by law count for nothing in the sight of God. If the newspapers which are now clashing over the subject, the ministers, and all the citizens of Toronto would take this invincible position on this question, but little difficulty would be experienced in the settlement of it.

A Roman Catholic Church in Long Island City was destroyed by fire recently, and the pastor of a neighboring Baptist Church tendered the priest in charge the Catholic parish the use of the Baptist house of worship. The kind offer was declined, for the reason that the attending public is being regaled with the usual amount of "gush" about "Christian union." Such an occurrence as that in Long Island City is an indication not as much of prosperity since between Protestantism and Protestantism as it is of Protestantism reaching to Rome. "These are worse changes."

Protestantism can unite with the "Church" only by proving recreant to the very principle which gives them the name. The lash and the lion may unite by the former taking a position inside the latter, and by the process of digestion becoming assimilated with the lion; not otherwise.

Those who "would lightly criticize a kind act ; but when a Baptist pastor says in explanation of such an act, "We are simply performing an act of courtesy and aiding in this way, as much as we can, fellow Christians who are in misfortune. We are all followers of the same Master," it simply declares that he is in the same category as those who are coming out from the World's Fair (when its gates open on the Sunday) or is obedient to their self-made law that they must remain at home, done they have been bad been not honesty on the part of many, but that spirit which leads most to all attention to the main issue—they spent the time running away, is Pharisaism, pure and simple. But Christ had no use for it. They would loved to make long prayers, dismiss everything not done for display, and as to do something for the purpose of informing men of more needed instruction. They wanted the praise and applause of men. And that Pharisaism is in full day. When one spends his time in publishing to the world that what he does, it is exactly what Christ would not approve of Christ; for he cried out in the street, nor heard his voice. His was a loving spirit.

To show the world that Christians did it. Assuredly, it would be telling the truth and showing to the world what we would they should do unto us;" to do good to them that hate us; to be patient; to be merciful unto to an sinner; instead of asking for stones for correction, to call from heaven upon those who are differently minded than ourselves; to do good unto them who hate us. If this were done, surely would the sin of the world come to naught.
