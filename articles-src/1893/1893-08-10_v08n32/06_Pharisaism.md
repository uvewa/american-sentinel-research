IT seems a little peculiar that a certain class of people who have been ardent in raising the cry "Judaize" for several years in the past against the work of those who were, and still are, teaching the people to observe the Sabbath (Saturday) as given in the Decalogue, should of a sudden occupy the same position as did the Pharisees (who were "Judaizers" indeed) in the time of Christ. But such is the fact. As in the case of the Pharisees, it was too late for them to obtain mercy, with the fact that they had rejected the Pharisaical spirit.

True Pharisaism engages one who is filled with self-righteousness. It belongs to those who—"being ignorant of God's righteousness," go "about to establish their own righteousness."

The great anxiety of this modern and of Pharisees seems to be that something be said to be done (and that very soon) whereby every justice on earth (and very "Christian Nation"—that this land is filled rapidly.)

Paul appears to have reached Philippi during the week, and it is natural that he took about and study the people. On the Sabbath "he went out of the city by a river side, where he learned some devout Jewish worshipers were in the habit of going to pray." "And his heart is on all matters respecting the Sabbath. But Paul was to so enlarge began, because he was a servant to all. Some of them then called the first day of the week "Lord's day." It read:—

"He had become a Christian and the first day of the week was his Sabbath." It is statement much unwarranted, more of an error or of the school or university. He of storm the the falsehood came out more utterly false in the light of New Testament truth. Paul was a man of the surroundings of the times, could scarcely have been expected to know as much as men like Mr. Wilbrow could; have had the time it is wished to speak now on of or that he could expect it to go unattacked. Such perversion of, facts, and misleading students of the Bible, comports with Mr. Withrow's a place as a minister of truth, or with the *Inferior* as a religious paper.

The book of Acts and the letters of Paul, taken altogether, but two and ten refer more, to the first day of the week, (Acts 20:7), that reference shows clearly that the meeting was on Saturday night (as well as the text) that Paul used Sunday as a week day for secular employment—making his journey, after the meeting on "Saturday evening," by land to Assos; that the apostle, on the other hand, the Sabbath is mentioned, and the observance of it by Paul and the other apostles is declared repeatedly in the book of Acts. The blindness which induced Dr. Withrow to make so sheer an every misquotation, ends that a show of literary and Christian honesty can scarcely be reconciled with the facts.

All this is a string extract will at the place from the notes of Alexander McMillan. See our paper of June 29, 1893. *Sentinel* of June 15, 1893, in which he incidentally describes Paul's daily and it actually occurred at Philippi.

Dr. McLaren says:—

> If the reading of the *Revised Version* is adopted, the suggested time to the words by week a "place of prayer" was known by the riverside, and a door, Paul went there and sat themselves,— to be known to a passage of trumpet, no healing of devas of any sort. A door, Paul went there and sat down himself.
