> Any possible penalty for contempt of court in closing in accordance with law will be a trifle to the country the for asserting a precedent that would the country for inefficiency and trickery in regard upon the face of the closing with the Illinois law was re-opening.

Speaking of this telegram, President Higginbotham said:—

> The people who sent that message certainly cannot understand the situation we are in. They seem to think that it would be better for all of us to go to jail for disobedience of that injunction than in their disobedience for keeping the Fair open. In other words these good people don't want us to obey the law.
