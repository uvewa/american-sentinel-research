It seems a little peculiar that a certain class of people who have been ardent in raising the cry "Judaism" for several years in the past against the work of those who were, and still are, teaching the people to observe the Sabbath (seventh-day) as given in the Decalogue, should now occupy the very same position as did the Pharisees (the strictest sect of the Jews) in the time of Christ. But such is the case. They may never see and realize it until too late for them to obtain mercy, yet the fact remains they are filled with the Pharisaius spirit.

The term Pharisee suggests one who is filled with self-righteousness. It belongs to those who, "being ignorant of God's righteousness," go "about to establish their own righteousness."

The great anxiety of this modern sect of Pharisees seems to be that something shall be said or done (and that very soon) whereby every nation on earth shall be brought to understand that "this is a Christian Nation"—that this land is filled with Christians. Already the spirit is abroad that led the good (?) old Pharisee mentioned by Christ in his parable, to stand and smite his sanctified breast and pray with himself (not God), "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are." I am better than they, because I live up to all the good laws I have made for myself, therefore, O Lord, I am holy." This was the direction of his thoughts. He saw nothing good or commendable only in himself. The poor profition by his side was not afraid to tell the truth and call upon God to be merciful unto him; for he knew he was a sinner. This man was justified (made righteous), while the Pharisee was left to still worship himself.

Thousands have congratulated themselves on their holiness in remaining away from the World's Fair (when its gates were open on Sunday) in obedience to their self-made law that they must remain at home. There may have been real honesty on the part of some, but that spirit which leads men to call attention to what a great sacrifice they are making by remaining away, is Pharisaism, pure and unadulterated. It is identical with that which loved to make long prayers, disfigure faces while fasting, and the like, so as to do something for the purpose of informing men they were righteous. They wanted the praise and applause of men. That was Pharisaism in Jesus' day. When one spends his time in publishing how good he is, it is evident he is not of Christ; for he cried not in the street nor sounded a trumpet before him.

To show the world that Christians abide in America, it would be well to follow the lowly Saviour by "doing unto others as we would they should do unto us;" to do some breast-smiting, calling upon God to be merciful unto us as sinners; instead of calling for troops, pestilences or fire from heaven upon those who are differently minded than ourselves, to do good unto them who hate us. If this were done, others would call us the children of the Father in heaven, and relieve us of the task of publishing abroad our righteousness.

God deals with nations as with individuals (for nations are only individuals multiplied), and his Word says: "He that exalteth himself shall be abased." "Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall." "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." Self-righteousness can never enter that abode, but the Lord will "save the humble person."—Job. 22:29.
