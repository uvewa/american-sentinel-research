On Sunday, July 23, the World's Fair was closed. On Sunday, July 30, it is open. It was closed by the order of the directors and it is open again to-day by the order of the directors, who had the right in both cases to do as they saw fit, so far as the business management of the Fair is concerned. If the contention in the Clingman case, as upheld by the injunction of Judge Stein, that Jackson Park, upon which is the World's Fair, is public property and cannot be closed to the people of the State of Illinois at any time, that is entirely another question with which the World's Fair authorities and the people of the State of Illinois have to deal.

Much has been said by the Sunday-closing press as to the power which secured the closing of the World's Fair last Sunday, with the expectation that the question was definitely settled and the Fair would remain closed on Sundays throughout the rest of its existence. They attributed the success of the closing movement at that time to the working of Providence and the direct intervention of the power of God. Joseph Cook, of Boston, and Rev. J. L. Withrow, of this city, both echoed that thought in sermons delivered here last Sunday. Dr. Withrow said directly, "The power which closed the gates was God Almighty; so we believe and rejoice to believe." But the very next Sunday the Fair gates are open. If it was the power of Almighty God which closed the gates on the first Sunday, is it possible that the power of Almighty God has been subverted the very next Sunday by a greater power and authority and the gates have been opened in defiance of him and his edict? It is impossible. Dr. Withrow and the Sunday-closers are at fault. The power of God and his authority are not evidenced in this matter as they think. That which has opened the Fair upon this Sunday, is the hesitation of the World's Fair authorities to put themselves in antagonism to a decree of the State Court which enjoins them from closing Jackson Park to the public on Sunday. They have not thought it wise and politic to run any further risk of the penalties which may be affixed to such contempt of the authority of a court of their State. The gates were closed on last Sunday in deference to the influence which men have brought to bear upon the World's Fair board. It is open to-day in deference to the same power and authority, emanating from another source and opposed to the first. That which is interested in and exercising its influence in this case, is not the power of God Almighty at all, as Dr. Withrow "believes and rejoices to believe," but the power of man. Unfortunately, this case does not take into consideration the national and constitutional question as to whether Congress had a right to interfere in the ordering of matters of religion in the State of Illinois, and in Jackson Park, during the continuance of the World's Fair; consequently, the question of civil liberty in religious matters does not, as yet, openly enter into the matter as brought before Judge Stein. Strictly and technically, the contention upon which the Clingman case is based, is a correct one. Jackson Park, and its use, was dedicated to the people of the State of Illinois and their children for ever. No one, properly, has any right to exclude the people of the State of Illinois from that park at any time; but in view of the equities which have now arisen,—through the vast expenditures which have been made,—the question as to what the courts would see fit to decree under such conditions, and influenced by the prejudices which are aroused, is quite another thing.

Ignorance and malice have ascribed the continuance of this suit to those who stand for the protection of civil liberty in religious affairs in this country,—the Seventh-day Adventists and those who agree with the principles which they hold as to the non-interference of Congress, legislature and courts, in affairs of religion. In such attacks as these it is perfectly clear that whatever does not arise from ignorance, is inspired by malice. The correct principle espoused by these people, of absolute non-interference of civil law in religion, has become so well known, and has been for a number of years so thoroughly published throughout the country, that to seem to be unaware of the position which they take, is to be self-convicted of either stupidity, ignorance, or a wilful concealment of truth.

In the Clingman case, as it stands since the voluntary closing of the gates by the World's Fair management, there is no question of civil liberty in religion involved. The contention as to whether the public may be excluded from the park to which it holds an inalienable title is a matter which belongs to the people of the State of Illinois, who are in interest, and does not necessarily involve their religious liberty or that of the country at large. The case, it is expected, will be pushed to a conclusion.

During the past week the members of the World's Fair board and the commissioners have been summoned to appear before Judge Stein and show cause why they should not be held for contempt of court in disobeying the injunction which the court had granted. The final hearing was set for Monday, July 31, and in the meantime the authorities saw fit to keep the gates of the Fair open. The fact that they did so, is a virtual acknowledgment of their belief that they were really in contempt of court in closing Jackson Park to the public. The council of administration, in ordering the gates to be open today, say this:—

WHEREAS the members of this council, recognizing their duty in common with all citizens to observe and respect all lawful orders and process of judicial tribunals, and believing it to be their duty under these circumstances to attest their respect for and obedience to the process of the court in the particular case referred to until the question shall have been determined, by restoring the status as it existed prior to the making of the order in council hereinbefore referred to; it is, therefore

Ordered, That the World's Columbian Exposition and the gates thereof shall be opened to the public on Sunday next, July 30, 1893, in the same manner and on like terms and conditions that prevailed prior to the making of the said order in council.

This expression by the council of administration is apparently not at all in sympathy with the following telegram, which was received at their meeting:—

Pittsburg, July 29, council of administration: Any possible penalty for contempt of court in closing to-morrow in accordance with law will be a trifle to the cost of incurring the everlasting contempt of the country for inefficiency or trickery in recent dealings with Stein injunction, if it results in even one reopening. In behalf of Sabbath-closing committee, WILBUR F. CRAFTS, Chairman. H. H. GEORGE, Secretary.

Heretofore, in the course of this discussion, those whose names are signed to this telegram, and those whom they represent, have been exceeding great sticklers for the strict observance of what they termed law, so long as that law, according to their interpretation, demanded Sunday-closing; now, that the vicissitudes of legal action and interpretation have put the local directory entirely upon its own responsibility as to Sunday-closing or opening, these same persons, with utmost vehemence, as seen here, advise an action not in accordance with law and do not hesitate to counsel that the law be disobeyed and the penalty of such disobedience be met. This is the sheerest kind of inconsistency. The right is always consistent. These men must be in the wrong.

It seems now to be the general wish of all parties that the injunction granted by Judge Stein should be dissolved, but it is the opinion of many good lawyers that the injunction is based on sound legal principles and upheld by incontrovertible facts. It is not at all certain that Judge Stein will easily recede from the position which he has taken. The Fair is open today; whether one week from to-day it will be open or closed, it is not possible at this time to say. But it must now be evident to all that there is something more than remarkable in the course which this agitation has taken, and the unexpected and unforeseen series of events which has continued the discussion. It is a discussion which does not pertain to the World's Fair alone but to the entire body of religious laws of this country and the enforcement of religious forms by decree of courts. Its continuance in the matter of the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair may well be looked upon with wonder and amazement, but the course which it is likely to take in its further development throughout every town and hamlet in the country as it comes into question in the daily administration of law may well be a matter of still greater fear and anxiety to those who love equity and justice and realize the correct basis of American law, and desire as true American citizens that religious liberty in civil matters should be retained and upheld in this country.

Chicago, July 30.
