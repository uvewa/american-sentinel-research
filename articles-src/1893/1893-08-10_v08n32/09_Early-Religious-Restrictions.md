The third and latest volume of McMaster's History of the United States gives amusing particulars of the religious restrictions that prevailed in the States of our Union for some time after the Revolution. In places a man's right to vote depended upon his religious opinions. Thus in South Carolina "a free white man must believe in the existence of a God, in a future state of reward and punishment, and have a freehold of fifty acres of land." A queer mixture this of piety and self! And this was not all. Between the right to vote and the right to hold office there was a wide distinction. Thousands of men who, on election day, came to the polls, were by law hopelessly debarred from ever, in the whole course of their lives, holding the office of sheriff, or taking a seat on the bench, or becoming a member of the legislature, or reaching the high place of governor of a state. No Atheists, no Freethinkers, no Jews, no Roman Catholics, no man, in short, who was not a believer in some form of the Protestant faith, could ever be governor of New Jersey or New Hampshire, Vermont or Connecticut. Any rich Christian might be the executive of Massachusetts or Maryland. Elsewhere he must be a Trinitarian and a believer in the inspiration of the Scriptures, or a Protestant and a believer in the divine authority of the Bible, or acknowledge one God, believe in heaven and in hell, and be ready to declare openly that every word in the Testaments, both Old and New, was divinely inspired. At first, these restrictions were submitted to without protest, but the leaven of the Revolution was at work, and bit by bit they were quietly removed. . . . The present generation does not have in mind those fearful examples, and is far from being so alive to the necessity of resisting church encroachments as we wish. It is to be hoped that the old-time tyrannies may never be reinstated.—*Exchange.*
