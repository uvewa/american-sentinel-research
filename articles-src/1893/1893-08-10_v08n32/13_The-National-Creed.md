LAST week we remarked that "before Christianity can have practically on the National Reformers demand that it shall have, there is 'an inalienable legal basis' in this country, it must be decided that it is a matter that it must be decided what constitutes Christianity;" and that this definition, will be the national creed just as the Nicene creed was the creed of the Roman Empire. Was not that of this yet remains to be done. In fact it was a year ago the Supreme Court by the divine authorship of the Scriptures, and a law only enters, inter-Congressional acts, and Christian. The national religion is especially expressed by the fourth commandment, an essential part of Christianity. Taking into consideration all that is laid in notice of what has been done, the Nation even over the other to the obedience, what and for the "Sunday-closing" proviso as attempts with of the law. The Sabbath the sign of the creed is then upon the Peoples.

The question, considered in the light of the reason for that action, was a virtual recognition of God, of Chicago. Church, the sign of a people and the divine authorship of the Scriptures; and the divine authorship and authority of the law being established, as the churches and Congress have preferred, the order can be reversed; the fourth commandment, and therefore the whole "Sabbath," enforced by the civil arm of Christian communities, involves the profound recognition of the divine power and authority of the Author of the commandment, the divine *Sunday* of the whole law.

EVERYONE comes to us as a supernatural thing, a revelation from God, regulating our duty toward God; and this appeals to the consciences of men and the State, under penalties entirely beyond the power of human governments either to confer or to revoke. This is that places in before the demands of civil government, and receives its forms from the jurisdiction of human courts.
