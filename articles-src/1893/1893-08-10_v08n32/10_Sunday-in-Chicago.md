[The Sunday people have been wanting the Fair closed in order that the "American Sabbath" might be exhibited to the nations of the earth. It was so exhibited on a recent Sunday, as witnessed by the following from the World of July 25.]

The people who have clamored for the closing of the World's Fair in order to protect from desecration what they call "the American Sabbath" had an opportunity on Sunday to learn how their theory worked.

Our despatches yesterday told in brief but graphic terms the story of "Sunday observance" at Chicago with the Fair closed.

The greater portion of the one hundred thousand visitors in the city joined the mass of the inhabitants in seeking amusement and recreation. The Sabbatarians discovered that the American people will not go to church upon compulsion or because some diversion which they desire is denied to them. Even the most popular churches "presented discouraging arrays of empty pews."

But the public parks and the great beer gardens were lively with music and gay with crowds. Excursions and private pleasure-boats on the lake were filled to their carrying capacity. "Downtown everything was wide open. The saloons did an enormous business, and the theatres were crowded afternoon and evening."

Around the closed Fair grounds the same scenes were enacted. The saloons, side-shows and fakirs did a big business. The facilities of all the street transit companies were taxed to their utmost to carry the restless crowds.

What rational being can deny that it would have been better to open the great educating Exhibition to even half a hundred thousand of these throngs? Better yet would it be to reduce the rate of admission to twenty-five cents, or even less and attract two hundred thousand people who will otherwise be in worse places.—*The World.*
