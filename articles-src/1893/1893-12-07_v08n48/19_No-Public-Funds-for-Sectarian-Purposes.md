REFERRING to the proposition to so revise the Constitution of this State as to prevent in the future the appropriation of public funds for sectarian purposes, the Outlook says:—

We are prepared to nail to the mast a banner with this motto: "No public funds except to public institutions." This would temporarily cripple some excellent benevolent organizations, but the ultimate benefits would far outweigh any temporary disadvantages. It is unfortunate that so little public interest has been aroused in matters of such public importance.

It is unfortunate; and it is also unfortunate that all who call themselves Protestants are not prepared to stand upon this platform.
