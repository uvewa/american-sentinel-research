NEWPORT, Long Island, has been greatly agitated for some time over an order issued by the chairman of the school board to discontinue the reading of the Lord's Prayer in the public school of the village. The order was based upon demand of a number of citizens, who, for various reasons, objected to the giving of any religious instruction in the public schools. A great protest was raised, a petition made against the chairman's order, and it was carried by a few days ago by unanimious vote of the school board.
