# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, December 7, 1893 (v08n48)

## General Notes

The source images for this issue are at 300 DPI but the text is extremely small, particularly in the three-column format. Many words throughout the issue are difficult to read with full confidence. The articles most affected are:

1. **Article 01 — "What Is the Wages of Sin?"** (page 1, all three columns): This front-page editorial contains theological content about sin, death, the commandments, salvation, and the gospel. The text is very small and many phrases are ambiguous. The article also appears to end mid-sentence at the bottom of column 3, suggesting either a continuation that was not located or a printing anomaly. Multiple sentences in this article should be considered LOW confidence for exact wording.

2. **Article 02 — "Sunday Arrests in Georgia"** (pages 1-3): The letter from Gainesville, the legal code sections, and the warrant text are partially legible. Names and dates are reasonably clear but some of the connecting prose is uncertain.

3. **Article 05 — "Our Protest"** (page 4): This lengthy editorial spans the middle column and continues across. The argumentative structure is clear but specific word choices in several paragraphs are uncertain.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Column 1, "What Is the Wages of Sin?"
- **Obstruction:** Very small type, low contrast
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Issue:** Multiple sentences appear garbled or may be misread. The overall theological argument about sin, death, resurrection, and the commandments of God is clear, but individual word-level accuracy is LOW throughout this article.
- **Confidence:** LOW for exact wording in many paragraphs

### Page 1, Column 2-3, "What Is the Wages of Sin?" continued
- **Issue:** The article appears to end mid-sentence with "Let all take it and" — this occurs at least twice in the transcription, suggesting either a repeated refrain or a reading error.
- **Confidence:** LOW — the ending is unclear

### Page 2, "Sunday Arrests in Georgia" — Legal Code Sections
- **Issue:** The Georgia Code section numbers and text are partially legible. Some section numbers and legal references may be slightly off.
- **Transcribed as:** Various Sec. numbers (4578-4587)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — section numbers appear correct but some intervening text is uncertain

### Page 2, "Sunday Arrests in Georgia" — Letter text
- **Issue:** The letter from Gainesville has some unclear passages, particularly around names and specific details of the arrest and trial.
- **Transcribed as:** Best reading based on context
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 3, Warrant text
- **Issue:** The formal warrant language is partially obscured. Names (G. W. McCutchen, E. C. Keck, D. B. Humphrey, Howard A. Thornton) appear clear.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for the warrant text, HIGH for names

### Page 3-4, "Catholic State Aid for Parochial Schools"
- **Issue:** The circular text and the editorial commentary are in very small type. The general argument is clear but specific wording is uncertain in places.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 4, "Our Protest"
- **Issue:** This editorial about Sabbath legislation and the power of God vs. civil authority is dense prose in small type. The argument structure is clear but multiple sentences have uncertain wording.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for overall content, LOW for exact wording in several paragraphs

### Page 4, "Religion in Schools" — Author attribution
- **Transcribed as:** "E. E. BORDESON"
- **Issue:** The signature at the end of this article is partially unclear. It could be "E. E. Bordeson" or a similar name.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Pages 5-6, "Two Thanksgiving Proclamations"
- **Issue:** The side-by-side proclamation text is partially legible. The general structure is clear but some specific wording may be off.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Pages 6-7, "The American Sabbath Union"
- **Issue:** Author signed as "J. F. HERMANSEN" from "Goodland, Ind." — this name should be verified.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for the name

### Page 7, "True Religion"
- **Issue:** Attributed as reprint from "Christian Advocate" — this attribution appears clear.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 8, Various short items
- **Issue:** Multiple short editorial notes on page 8 are in very small type. The general content is identifiable but specific wording is uncertain.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Overall Assessment
This issue presents significant transcription challenges due to the small text size in the source images. While article titles, authors, and general arguments can be identified with reasonable confidence, exact word-level transcription accuracy is lower than desired throughout. A review against higher-resolution scans would be beneficial for all articles in this issue.
