# Uncertainties — v08n48 (1893-12-07)

## Masthead

- **Associate Editor names:** OCR reads "CALDIN S. BOLLMAY" and "WILLIAM H. BURKE" for the associate editors. The known associate editor is C. P. Bollman. "CALDIN S. BOLLMAY" is almost certainly an OCR corruption of "C. P. BOLLMAN" (possibly "CALVIN S. BOLLMAN" or simply the OCR misreading the name). "WILLIAM H. BURKE" may be another OCR error for "WILLIAM H. McKEE" (WHM). These names are transcribed as they appear in the OCR; the masthead should be verified against the original scan.

## Article 01 — "The Wages of Sin" (WHM)

- **"wages of unreported sin"** (end of page 2 section): The OCR reads "unreported sin" which is unusual in this context. The expected phrase would be "unrequited sin" or "unrepented sin." Transcribed as found in OCR; verify against original.

## Article 02 — "Sunday Arrests in Georgia" (CPB)

- **"fined no"**: OCR reads "the mayor who fined no has a tan-yard in the city." This appears to be an OCR corruption; likely "the mayor who fined us has a tan-yard." Transcribed as found in OCR; verify against original.
- **"Hall Co. ["** bracket notation**: The OCR contains "[" in two places in the legal documents quoted: "D. H. Hall Co. [Stansbury" and "I, D. H. Stansbury, in the name and Hall Co. [in behalf." These brackets appear to be OCR artifacts for a line-break or column insertion in the original (the county name "Hall Co." runs into the next line of text). Transcribed as found in OCR.
- **Page number 382 on page 6**: The OCR shows page 378 (page 2), then 379 (page 3), then jumps to 382 on page 6 (page numbers 380-381 were on pages 4-5 but not explicitly labeled in OCR). The page numbered 380 corresponds to the State Aid / Our Protest articles.

## Article 04 — "State Aid to Parochial Schools"

- **Attribution note**: This article is introduced by the Sentinel with a bracketed note identifying it as content from the New York Sun. The body text is the Sun's content. Marked as reprint of New York Sun. No explicit closing attribution marker "—*Source*" is present in the OCR; attribution is based on the introductory bracket.

## Article 08 — "Two Thanksgiving Proclamations"

- **Proclamation text order**: The OCR interleaves the two proclamations in a two-column layout that is difficult to reconstruct. The Presidential proclamation appears to be split: the opening through "Done at the city of Washington on the third day of November, in" appears at the bottom of page 5, and the closing ("year of our Lord eighteen hundred and ninety-three...") appears at the bottom of page 6, after the church proclamation text. The text has been reassembled in logical order: full presidential proclamation first, then the church proclamation.
- **"Trinne God"**: OCR reads "Trinne" — likely "Triune." Transcribed as found.
- **"George Cleveland" vs. "Grover Cleveland"**: OCR reads "George Cleveland" in the signature line. The president was Grover Cleveland. Transcribed as found in OCR; verify against original.
- **"WALTER Q. GREGHAM"**: The Secretary of State was Walter Q. Gresham; OCR reads "GREGHAM." Transcribed as found.
- **"We J. Reid"**: OCR reads "We J. Reid" for the Principal Clerk — likely "W. J. Reid" or similar. Transcribed as found.
- **"Jan. SHOCK"**: OCR reads "Jan. SHOCK" for the Moderator — likely "Jas." (James) SHOCK or another name. Transcribed as found.

## Article 09 — "The American Sabbath Union in Indiana"

- **"1 These, 2:13"**: OCR reads "1 These, 2:13" — this is a scripture reference to 1 Thessalonians 2:13. Transcribed as found in OCR.

## General Notes

- Page 7 contains the continuation of the American Sabbath Union article and the short Christian Advocate quote. The Bible Students' Library section and advertisements (pages 7-8) were skipped as they are promotional/advertising content.
- The subscription table on page 8 was skipped as subscription/boilerplate content.
- The H. A. Whittaker notice and the literature box advertisement were skipped as classified/advertising notices.
