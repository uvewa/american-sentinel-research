A LAST page note in last week's SENTINEL made a statement concerning in Georgia, the arrest of two Seventh-day Adventist ministers, convicted of Sunday-law violation. The following letter gives the facts more fully:—

GAINESVILLE, Hall Co., Ga., Nov. 21, 1893.

Dear Brother Ballenger: The history of all righteousness is stirred up and we are looking for more trouble every day. Brother McCutchen came here with Brother Clusters and myself, having some work to do in our new church. We had been at work painting and papering on our church building in this place, and are members and had just begun again in the afternoon, when a man came on to Brother McCutchen and arrested him. We were all working, some were on our church at the time, and were right on with our work. They went back to our place, and some of us sat around the house talking about the work some more. Brother McCutchen was working above, finishing some work. Then the officer came with another one with him, and arrested us both, Eld. McCutchen and myself. There are others at work in town to-day.

We appeared on time and were tried for "disorderly conduct." The indictment reads: "For using and engaging in playing at games, and sporting, gambling, fighting, quarrelling, or any other disorderly conduct on the Sabbath day, contrary to the law." There was no disorderly conduct or anything of the kind at all. But under the above ordinance we were fined $10 and costs, and would not have paid them had accordingly we were sent to the chain

gang and locked up. Friends immediately went to work in regard to our matter in a legal counsel and in no way harsh, even though the feeling was very strong against us and the mayor was very much against us; they looked into our case and made arrangements to let us out on bond, and we were released from the chain gang at 11 o'clock that same night. They had told us that—

Just before the mayor gave his opinion, a lawyer, Mr. Keck, who had looked into the case, came and handed over to the County Court for Sabbath breaking case our bond. We were to have a trial in city court of jail yesterday evening we had to go to give bond before the next term of the same court. On account of the bad weather we could not get there in time, and we had to be continued till the next term of the same court. We are now getting ready to go before the Superior Court, and unless the case is continued till the next term we will get a hearing in this, the November, term.

What the result will be of course we don't know, but we do feel that the Lord is standing by us and is watching over his own cause and we are of good courage and rejoicing in the Lord, glad that we can suffer shame for his name. Yours truly,

The ordinance under which they were arrested and convicted is as follows:—

SECTION 506, (adopted Oct. 25, 1891). Any person who shall hunt game, fish or seine for fish on the Sabbath day, within any of the waters of this city, or whoever, or attempt to raise a quarrel, or who shall play at any game whatsoever, or shall be found drunk, or shall fire any gun or pistol within the corporate limits of this city, rails, or shall be guilty of fighting, quarrelling, or other disorderly conduct on the Sabbath day in the city or any citizen, shall be guilty of disorderly conduct. Penalty not more than $50.00, or 30 days on the chain-gang, or both.

Sec. 91 provides for a fine of not more than $100 or confinement in the calaboose for not more than 30 days, or both.

It does not seem that under this ordinance, a conviction of a Sabbath-keeper could be held in the higher courts, when it appears plain that the only "crime" committed was not resting on a certain day (not on Sunday) but for that "crime" the violation of that is being punished "as guilty" penalty. The Georgia Code as to crimes and punishments, so far as they relate to Sunday observance, are as follows:—

Sec. 4578 (707), (5553). Sundays and holidays. All the first day of the week, commonly known and designated as the Sabbath, are declared to be holidays except that holidays are included in the computation of time in any given number of days.

Not so as to Sunday in the thirty days which are given in which to file a bill of exceptions. 84 Ga. 122. Sunday not counted in the five days allowed for second distress. 90 Ga. Selling once on Sunday will not, of itself, constitute a trader, and sale thereunder passes no title. Starnes v. State. 83 Ga. Arrest of a person on a bench warrant for misdemeanor of one who does not know the fact, he can be held in custody, but not be tried. 84 Ga.

Sec. 4579 (3197), (1158). Attachments may issue on Sunday in cases specified in sections 3277 (b) and 3281.

Sec. 4580 (4579), (4580). Any person who shall pursue his business or the work of his ordinary calling on the Lord's day, works of necessity or charity only excepted, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

The oaths prescribed by this code; that he has not complied with all the provisions of this code shall also comply with the other provisions of this section.

Sec. 4581 (4481), (4581). Any person who shall be guilty of keeping open tippling houses on the Sabbath day, or selling spirituous liquors on that day, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Decisions—Jury are to decide whether place is a tippling house. 74 Ga. 96. When house is shown to be a place for the sale of liquors.

13 Ga. 576. Fine for former conviction in the City Court of Atlanta, when the defendant does not pay the fine imposed upon him by the Mayor's Court.

Decisions—Jury to decide whether place is a tippling house used as a bedroom; yet she does not keep open "tippling houses" on Sunday. 41 Ga. 225. "Sabbath day" means the same as "Sunday," held a tippling house. 61 Ga. 218. Chief Justice Bleckley.

Section 4580 of the Code of Georgia (the ordinance of a liquor shop on Sunday,) may be cited. But this section is not self-defining.

Not in our case. On Sunday was not yet established, to the extent that any visitor had only to push it and it would open; the ceiling was not yet up, and where the walls had been lathed, the laths were not covered by canvas from the ceiling to the floor; as

county judge, then the said county judge, when recommended by such coroner, of any other county or elsewhere, to work upon such public roads or streets or any other public works, in county or how out such convicts, upon such terms and conditions as shall seem best for the interest of the county, the said county commissioners making provision for their safe-keeping.

Sec. 4587 (4584), Persons sentenced to confinement in the penitentiary of this State, or sentenced to death, and persons sentenced to be confined in the penitentiary of this State, or to any act of confinement, or be committed to the common jail of the county for any crime, or convict or convicts, or member or members of the chain-gang so working on the public roads, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor; and if murder be committed, be deemed guilty of a capital offence.

It can be clearly seen from the foregoing that the judge is his own interpreter.

It is at once apparent that the Seventh-day Adventist is a conviction under the Georgia Sunday law in a very serious matter. Adventists have universally refused to pay fines when convicted, and rather to go to prison to the chain-gang, as a testimony against Sunday legislation. Doubtless this course will be followed in Georgia.

In the Tennessee cases, those who worked in the chain-gang, were, by the terms of the law of that State, so placed under the chain-gang law that there could be any attempt to compel them to work on Sunday. But the law of Georgia makes no such provision. The Georgia law provides that "no person shall in time of peace be required to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religious faith as a day of rest." The constitution of Georgia contains no such provision. It follows that the Seventh-day Adventist or Seventh-day Baptist, although convicted under section 4580 of the Sunday law, may be required to work on the Sabbath, and to refuse means, by the Georgia law quoted above, refusal, may of discharge by which is "disorderly," or failing penalty by which is "death," or any other offense the chain gang may inflict." The Georgia Sunday law is designed to protect. Fraud is fully provided for by the general provisions of that law.

A subsequent letter from Mr. Keck gives some additional particulars as to the character of the proceedings against himself and Elder McCutchen.—

We were arraigned and tried on the same charge, and fined $10 and costs or 30 days on the streets. Not being willing to pay the fine we were taken to the chain gang. At once friends of law and order in the place, among them our church and school trustees, went to work for us, and had us released on bond. One witness said he was 200 yards across the street, not more than fifty feet from where we were at work, and had not heard a word or seen any act of disorder. The cross-examination of one of the witnesses against us lives near the building at which the arrested brethren at work. All working within sight of the church had been disturbed. All the prominent lawyers here admit that there was nothing in the ordinance to convict us; it was "disorderly conduct;" then every day's work done within the city limits is also disorderly conduct for which the same penalty may be inflicted.

The following are the papers filed against the two. They speak for themselves, and the other case against us, which is as follows:—

STATE OF GEORGIA, HALL COUNTY.

1. Haddrey who being duly sworn on oath, says that to the best of his knowledge and belief, G. W. McCutchen, a minister, in the year 1893, commit the offense of disorderly. He does not state the W. and F.

McCutchen and E. C. Keck, in the county aforesaid, were arraigned by the elder of the Georgia Seventh-day Adventist Church on and 18th day of October, 1893, for violations of Sec. 4580 of the said labor not being works of necessity or charity, and upon a hearing before me I find probable cause to charge the defendants with said offense, and they are known to and subscribed before me the Nov. 21st, November, 1893.

Warrant: I, D. B. Humphrey, in the name and by the authority of the State of Georgia: To any constable or lawful officer of said county: G. W. McCutchen and E. C. Keck are hereby charged with the offense of misdemeanor; for that the said G. W. McCutchen and the said E. C. Keck, on the 18th day of November, 1893, in the county aforesaid, did pursue their business of work as carpenters, viz: papering, and working their calling with planes, hammers, handsaws, etc., on and 18th day of October, 1893, said labor not being works of necessity or charity, all of said acts being contrary to the laws of said State, the good order, peace and dignity thereof.

*City Court, Hall County:*

In connection with all this, I might say that many here are very much excited about our people. On the last day, cattle are killed for food, some selling a load of wood, another painting, and one who was checked on how a law part is the city might that have worked last Sunday on the chain gang, working; and on finding out that they had been told against him he had ever seen or known of anything against our people or their work here, said he would like to go before any court in the land where people can see the spirit behind the whole thing.

The laws of the States of Georgia, and Tennessee and Maryland, the civil law and the divine, are clearly separate.

C. P. B.

A considerable excitement in Gainesville as the result of this imprisonment and trial of those Seventh-day men, and many who were opposed to them before are now their friends. Some say it is a clear case of religious persecution, and reminds them of the time of Roger Williams and the persecution of the Quakers and Baptists.

A. F. BALLENGER.
