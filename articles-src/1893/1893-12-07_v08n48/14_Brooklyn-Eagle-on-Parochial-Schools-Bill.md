The Brooklyn Eagle, of November 27, contains an editorial reference to the bill prepared for submission to the legislature of New York this winter for the providing of State aid to parochial schools. After quoting from the protest of Bishop Doane, the Eagle says:—

It is remarkable that this renewal of the parochial school agitation follows so closely the arrival of the papal ablegate. If the utterances of Mgr. Sandli have possessed any significance whatever, it was in the desire expressed to see the Catholic Church adjust itself to American conditions. We had begun to believe that the guiding minds of Catholicism in this country were being fronted in as toward America and less toward Rome, and the impression was strengthened by the broad patriotism and liberality of thought displayed by so eminent a man as Cardinal Gibbons. It is, we believe, unfortunate that the discussion should have been revived at all, first, because there is not the slightest probability of securing the legislation asked; and secondly, because of the proof it affords that Catholicism is as far away as ever from a correct interpretation of the American spirit when it again attempts, though perhaps in more ingenious guise, to mix the affairs of Church and State.

There can be no well founded belief that Roman Catholicism will ever be "fronted more towards America and less toward Rome." History and prophecy both declare against such a possibility.
