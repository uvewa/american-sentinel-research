The "Pearl of Days" of November 25, has this item:—

Over seventy of the persons who had been indicted by the Grand Jury of Plequemine, La., for violating the Sunday law came forward and pleaded guilty Nov. 13. Judge Talbot imposed a fine of $25 on each, saying that he would be as light on them as the law allowed, but warned them that if they were ever brought up before him again on a similar charge that they could not expect that leniency. The fines, under the law, go to the public school fund, which will be considerably augmented. The law was strictly observed Nov. 19, and it will be henceforward.

The Louisiana Sunday law requires that places of public business shall be closed for twenty-four hours continuously from twelve o'clock Saturday night, till twelve o'clock Sunday night, the penalty for doing business between those hours, being a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than two hundred and fifty dollars, or imprisonment for not less than ten days, nor more than thirty days, or both, at the discretion of the court.
