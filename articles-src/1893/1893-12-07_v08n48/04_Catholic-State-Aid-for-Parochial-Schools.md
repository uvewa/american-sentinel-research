A CIRCULAR on this public school question, issued under the authority and by the direction of Cardinal Satolli, has been distributed among both Protestants and Catholics in Baltimore, and the State of Maryland generally. The intention of the circular is thought to be to sound the public as to its sentiment in the matter of state appropriation for the support of parochial schools. It is largely taken up with citing the public schools as objects of denunciation, and putting forth strong arguments for Roman Catholic parochial schools, both for all denominations of faith. High Protestant authority is reported to show the great benefits to be derived from the religious school over the public school. The system of education that is in use in many Roman Catholic Austria, Prussia, and the German States, is set before the American public as commendable schools supported by public funds, and schools for the public supported alike in those countries to any other denomination.

The circular is a very unfair and specious document, but no doubt fair-minded and careful study will show the curse of thought fully.

Since it is considered by all that religion is an important part of education, and since the State educational system, should have regard for the wishes of all its constituents, the question now stands, parents who prefer parochial to public schools, can they justly be deprived of the benefit of their taxes as far as education goes, when it is adopted to fit requirements and the State is helped to know the poor of their denomination; this three fold benefit of the public school education is lost.

We wish it to be understood that it is not our purpose to interfere with the public schools—we only desire such a modification of the present common school system as will enable us to partake of established justice be done to all citizens, that a proper education may be given the young of all respecting benefit, and that public blessings may be shared by all the public.

The idea of diverting public school funds, or by executing the school system to all schools under religious direction—whether Roman Catholic or Protestant—is one which, we are confident, many thousands in Baltimore alone, would rather endure any kind of taxation than to see the public school system thus in any way be destroyed.

It seems evident that a very thorough effort is to be made, at least in the State of Maryland, to test public opinion on this question; and you, we enlist the catering public opinion, and we wisely the electing of our representatives in the coming elections. It is interesting to see with what marvellous unanimity the lovers of civil and religious freedom of equality and taxation are agreed in the conviction that public schools support and support an extension beyond parochial schools would be the greatest calamity to the commonwealth.

This circular is industriously and energetically circulated, and appeals to all the social and intellectual craftiness of Rome, and the educational energy and business enterprise of many of her people; and while her position is very broad and liberal and generous. The Roman Catholic position in our social system, and the State appropriation which are asked for other denominational schools give these schools over to the Romish priests, to be an example of great fairness and an act of solicitude for all interests. The question whether they will find it difficult to understand that it means simply, doing good to those who are do-rightfully of another denomination. Were the Roman Catholic Church, in this instance having been asked for their own denominational interests mistaken motives, would be really public-spirited, but it realized in the fountains of the commonwealth.

## Catholic State Aid to Parochial Schools.

[The New York *Sun* of Nov. 27, contains the following item concerning Bishop Doane's views:]

Right Rev. Bishop William Croswell Doane of the Albany Episcopal Diocese, preached a sermon last Sunday in regard to the proposed passage of a bill in the State Legislature to appropriate State aid for parochial schools in the State of New York. He has already been before the Legislature on this question, and Mr. A. Spillaney, a member of the New York Legislature, announces that the bill is and it is likely to be vigorously pushed in the coming session of the Legislature.

Bishop Doane's views will be of interest in connection with the circular which has been issued and Satolli expressing approval. He said, among other things, in his morning papers. He said:—

"I believe with my whole heart that the common school system in America is justly and rightly what Bishop Fraser called it, 'the glory of the American people,' and a great element in good government. It has never been my desire to deprive any child its chance to be educated, but upon the necessity of the situation in which the Roman Catholic Church a class of citizens who, being uneducated are not good citizens, to get the thing which is essential to good government. It is all the more reason for this Government, which in the idea of the old makes members powerful, and distributes intelligence is the only safeguard of liberty.

Referring particularly to the bill which the petition of prominent Catholics in the community was asking this legislature to pass, the bishop said:—

"The very grounds, therefore, of the

petition which accompanies the bill is this. The people who urge to have no such rights as they claim. The State gives to them efficient education, free to all, and compels all children to receive it, but the State knows nothing of any particular education in any religious belief.

"As to the bill, it is specious in its title and in its provisions. The American way of creating schools is to increase the number of common schools, and not to subsidize private enterprise for free education. It is idle and legislation in favor of any school, be it Roman Catholic or Protestant, interpreted by the language of the petition and the bill, mean the support of sectarian schools.

"I am abundantly satisfied that such a proposal would be resisted to the death, by the great majority. To authorize any interference is any common school in the granting of public money to connect with any religious teaching.

"I am quite sure that if I were a Roman Catholic I would resent these interferences as my right. The Roman Church is really not rich in America. She is struggling to be adapting herself to American institutions, and very often the burden she thus fastens upon her own people makes them less good citizens. Already she is struggling with a very heavy burden of self-assessment. If she interferes with public education she will at once lose the good will she deserves, the unanimous verdict of the American people, on the part of every citizen: who, being divided into all sorts of religious beliefs and connected with all sorts of religious positions at all, are united in their demand that there is no religion which shall control either the elections or the education of the people.

BALTIMORE, Nov. 24.—Father Slattery, of St. John's Catholic Church last night preached a serious lecture to-night at St. Johns Church, on the public school question, on the school question in line with the circular issued once, on Friday by Cardinal Gibbons. He told the colored people they had two things, education and religion, to combine, and that, viewing from the Catholic point of view, education, as the State gives it, is devoid of religious training brought up in a moral way, the colored children or otherwise, are prepared for that. Of course it would not be do single out any one denomination, say that by principle all at once would be offended.

'But you want the best education you can for the parochial schools.'

Father Slattery's sermon is the first public announcement of the policy of the Church on this question. The idea, it is said, is to gain the support of all the colored people, irrespective of denomination,

How many are there who think the rights of Nonconformists are in danger of being disposed upon in the statement in regard to the amount of religious instruction in the schools, whilst in referring to the call upon the High Church party. They are asked for other denominational schools and the State appropriation which is asked for is well understood. This circular is industriously and energetically circulated, and appeals to much that is very broad and liberal and generous.

It can indeed teach nothing definite without teaching something with which the parents of some of its adapted to that end. It can indeed teach nothing definite without teaching something which must without Christianity is paganism, which will not be endured by the religious public. Therefore in the interest of pure religion as well as of civil liberty, in the interests of the pure Gospel of Christ, the *Present Truth* of London, the position we take that the essential wickedness of State common school religious teaching is right.—*Present Truth, London, Eng.*
