WE print side by side two Thanksgiving proclamations. The one was issued for the United States, the other by officers of one denomination,—the United Presbyterian Church—

THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION.

While the American people to the ministers, elders and all the Christian churches and to give thanks and praise to God for the divine goodness and mercy for divine blessings.

PROCLAMATION BY THE UNITED STATES.

In accordance with a practice at once wise, gracious, and beautiful, we have been accustomed, as the year is drawing to a close, to devote an occasion to the humble expression of our thanks to Almighty God for the blessings and mercies of the past year. It is fitting that such Church, we its servants, should seek the mercy of God, for His great goodness and for His mercy and the mercies of God's hand in order to give thanks.

Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do hereby designate, and ask that on Thursday, the 30th day of November, and of the national feast and set apart Thursday, the day of the President's annual Thanksgiving, as a day of thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by all the people of the land, on that day let us forego our ordinary work and employments and assemble in our usual places of worship.

In the essential points the intent, and the practical of each proclamation is always identical. They both exercise and set apart Thanksgiving day. Now what right does the President of the United States to exercise these sectarian functions?

It will be observed that of these proclamations emanate from the civil and one from the ecclesiastical authority; yet they alike enjoin religious acts upon the people. Now the Presbyterian Church say to their people it is "hereby set aside every boy to lay aside all secular business on the 30th day of November, 1893, and devote it to prayer and special religion." The president says, "I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do hereby designate and set apart Thursday, the day of the President's annual Thanksgiving, as a day of thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by all the people of the land. On that day let us forego our ordinary work and employments and assemble in our accustomed places of worship."

In the essential points the intent, and the practical of each proclamation is always identical. They both exercise and set apart Thanksgiving day. Now what right does the President of the United States to exercise these sectarian functions?

and was disturbed, while the neighbors, who are only fifty feet away from where the work was done, testified that they were not at all disturbed though they are devout Sunday observers. This complaining witness was the man who was it was the informer; but when it was in the trial complainingly, but, when in the trial, Mr. McCutchen stated that he kept Saturday as a matter of conscience, the mayor said:

"Conscience be put in it at all."

The other witness, the informer and complainant, swore witness if he did not know of any disorderly conduct of any kind, such as butchering of beeves, selling of wood, painting, etc. on Sunday. Where the mayor said:

"I don't answer that."

After the testimony was all taken the mayor gave them twelve months' probation, commendation advice as to their belief, and Fraim couldn't; stating that since they had been in his city they had proved themselves good citizens and had done a good work and had succeeded in getting good people to follow them, and there was no reason to doubt that they were good conscientious Christian gentlemen, and that he—"I will fine you $10 and costs, or 30 days on the public works."

We appealed to the Superior Court, to be tried at the next term of court.

A considerable excitement in Gainesville as the result of this imprisonment and trial of those Sev. men, and many who were opposed to them before are now their friends. Some say it is a clear case of religious persecution, and reminds them of the time of Roger Williams and the persecution of the Quakers and Baptists.
