The World, of November 28, has this item: "Samuel Pertak, a clerk in the grocery store at No. 94 Monroe Street, sold a loaf of bread to a woman Sunday last, which act was witnessed by policeman Heaphy, of the Madison Street station. 'What do you mean by violating the Sabbath?' demanded the officer, 'I'm not the only one that's open,' retorted the clerk. 'You must be blind.' The young man was arrested, and Justice Voorhis, in the Essex Market Court yesterday, held him for trial."
