The *China Mail*, a copy of which the SENTINEL is indebted to a subscriber at Hong Kong, notes the fact that a Roman Catholic bishop of the city of Hong Kong had refused, in behalf of the churches of his denomination, in cooperation with the Protestant societies in the observance of a special day set as "Hospital Sunday," and the donation of offerings on that day to a general hospital purpose in the colony. The reason which the bishop gave is that his people support their own charitable institutions. The *Mail* reports the bishop's action especially "in the view of the fact that the Roman Catholic institutions in the colony receive a large measure of support from the Protestant community."
