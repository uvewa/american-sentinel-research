[The Atlanta Journal, of November 22, has the following account of the arrest of the two Seventh-day Adventists, referred to elsewhere in this paper.]

LAST Sunday afternoon, in the city of Gainesville, Rev. W. A. McCutchen and Professor E. C. Keck were arrested and on Monday were tried and fined $50 and costs, before Mayor John A. Smith, for working on Sunday.

Rev. Mr. McCutchen came to Gainesville last summer with a tent and held meetings there during the warm weather, and raised up quite a church in his faith. This last fall they have built a new church and school-house in this city, and now have a high school and kindergarten school in full operation in their building, with Professor E. C. Keck, of Florida, in charge and Mrs. Keck teacher of the kindergarten. These people observe Saturday as their Sabbath, instead of Sunday, and they claim a right to work on Sunday after having kept Saturday.

Last Sunday Professor Keck went out to the church and school-house to fix up some conveniences desired by Mrs. Keck in her kindergarten. Rev. Mr. McCutchen went along with him, and as they were there at work an officer came and watched them through a window for a few moments and then went back to the city and arranged for their arrest, and returned with another officer and led the two men off to the calaboose, with their wives and children following and crying.

In the trial on Monday it was developed by witnesses that the party who complained of these men lived half a mile away from where the work was done, and never saw them at work nor heard them, but simply heard that they were at work and was disturbed; while the neighbors, who are only fifty feet away from where the work was done, testified that they were not at all disturbed though they are devout Sunday observers. This complaining party said he was disturbed conscientiously, but, when in the trial, Mr. McCutchen stated that he kept Saturday as a matter of conscience, the mayor said: "Conscience is not in it at all."

When Mr. McCutchen asked the complaining witness if he did not know of other Sunday work being done in the city, such as butchering of beeves, selling of groceries, and attending a tan-yard, etc., the mayor said:

"You need not answer that."

After the testimony was all taken the mayor gave these reverend gentlemen considerable advice as to their belief, and future conduct; stating that since they had been in his city they had proved themselves good citizens and had done a good work and had succeeded in getting good people to follow them, and he had no reason to doubt that they were good conscientious Christian gentlemen, and then said: "I will fine you $50 and costs, or ninety days on the streets."

The fines were not paid and the cases were appealed to the Superior Court, to be tried in the January term in the city of Gainesville.

There is considerable excitement in Gainesville as the result of this imprisonment and fining of these people, and many who were opposed to them before are now their friends. Some say it is a clear case of religious persecution, and reminds them of the time of Roger Williams and the persecution of the Quakers and Baptists.
