The "Pearl of Days" of November 25, says:—

That several of the persons who had been arrested at the violation of the Georgia Sunday law in violating the Sunday law came forward and pleaded guilty for not.—"Violators of the Georgia Sunday law," "immediately on conviction they paid up fines as soon as the law allowed; but warned them that a second offence would receive the full severity of the law." The facts will become history. The fine, under the law, 49, is the penalty; "or not more than six months confinement." The law was strictly observed Nov. 18 and 25.

Last Sunday afternoon, the city of Gainesville, E. W. and another officer arrested Professor E. C. Keck was arresting—were arrested. E. C. Keck and Elder G. W. McCutchen, before Mayor John A. Smith, on a charge of disorderly conduct.

Mr. McCutchen came to Gainesville for the express purpose of helping finish the church building then in process of construction, and painting there during the warm weather, and Elder Keck desired to put up and finish a church in this city. They had only been there a week. The hall they have built a new church building a new high school and kindergarten and have been doing a fine work. Professor E. C. Keck, of Florida, is in charge of the school.

The same paper, "The *Pearl of Days*" reports the Seventh-day Adventists in the Gainesville case, as keeping the Jewish Sabbath, instead of Sunday, and they were charged with disorderly conduct for having kept Saturday.

Last Saturday Elder E. C. Keck went out to the church and school house to fix up a partition so that they might better use it for his kindergarten. Rev. Mr. McCutchen came to the city of Gainesville on Thursday; at once he and Elder Keck went to work, and they went at work at office cases and watched them at work on cases prepared which were necessary to prepare for church attachments and then went back to the city and made charges of disorderly conduct. Elder Keck with another officer and led the two men off to the chain gang, were put in the chain gang that Saturday night.

In the trial on Monday it was developed that the man who filed the information and complained of these men lived half a mile away from the place where they worked, and never saw them at work nor heard them, but simply heard that they went at work.
