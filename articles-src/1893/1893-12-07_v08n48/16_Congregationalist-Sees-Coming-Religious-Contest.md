The Congregationalist sees some of the signs of the times. It looks forward to a coming religious contest and says; "If we do not wrongly read the signs of the times, it is to be fought on this continent sooner, perhaps, and with more terrible earnestness, than we have thought." There is prophetic assurance that the conflict which the Congregationalist foresees is to take place, and that soon; this country will also be the theatre of action. These signs in the religious, social, and political world are but corroborative of prophecy.
