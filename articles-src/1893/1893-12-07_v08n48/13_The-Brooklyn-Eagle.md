The *Brooklyn Eagle*, of November 17, contains an editorial reference to the bill prepared for submission to the legislature of New York this winter for the providing of State aid to parochial schools. After quoting from the protest of Bishop Doane, the *Eagle* says:—

It is remarkable that the renewal of the parochial school agitation follows so closely upon the suppression of the proposed amendments to the charter regarding the public school appropriations. In any significance whatever, in any significance it is all to the Roman Catholic or any Church adjust itself to American conditions. We have been led to believe that such adjustments should be, as much as possible, to American conditions, and not to go on toward America and into toward Rome, and that in matters of vital and public interest, no patriotism and liberality of thought completed was as manifest at a time of national celebration. It is to have been all, first, because there is not this adjustment to the American spirit, hereafter asked; and secondly, because of the proof it affords

that Catholicism is as far away as ever from a correct conception of the American spirit when it comes again, to mix the affairs of Church and State.

There can be so well founded belief that Roman Catholicism will ever be "trusted more towards America and less toward Rome." History and prophecy both declare against such a possibility.
