TRUE religion puts men crosswise to the world. True religion by its crowning cause creates friction, arouses opposition, exposes itself to the charge of being contentious, self-willed and pugnacious. False religion gets a fine reputation for getting along smoothly. It is loved by the world because it never resists it.—*Christian Advocate.*
