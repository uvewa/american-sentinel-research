WHAT is the wages of sin?—It is death. What is sin?—Sin is the transgression of the law. What is the law?—The law is the ten commandments, and the commandments are the expression to man of the character of God.

The author of sin is Satan. The wages of sin are due him. Death will, then, be the portion of Satan. As a result of the sin of Adam death came upon him, and through him to all men. To all who have sinned, death is inevitable, except they be exempt by the direct intervention of Him who created and can sustain.

The intervention of Christ in behalf of man. Satan is not considered in the plan of salvation. Therefore when the result of sin is visited upon the author no effect will be final,—to Satan there comes but one dissolution. But it is man, as a necessary result of Adam's sin—except God's special mercy, as to Enoch, and Elijah, and those who will be caught up at Christ's second coming, and be changed "in the twinkling of an eye,—there comes the natural death which is the inevitable lot of humanity.

THERE is, however, the first resurrection and the second resurrection; there is the first death which falls upon men, and there is the second death which comes, and the second death which comes is the final and absolute verdict of all those who have scorned the Saviour's intervention. This—the first resurrection—the righteous, to eternal life. Who rise in the second resurrection—the first death and second death and eternal oblivion. Then, through the midway and re-creative power of the Son of God, all, both the just and the unjust, are raised from the grave. But the unrenewed, the first are raised to immortality, and the second to that death from which there is no respite.

This is not the generally accepted theory of death and the future life. But there is no need of any theory. The Scriptures present the simple facts in plain words. Those who can may read, and all who will may understand. All theorizing, all subtlety of interpretation, all exegesis, all "higher criticism," all comment, is entirely out of place. Divine commission makes no mystery of the deep truths of life and death, and the grave, and the resurrection, and the future of the righteous, and the final fate of the wicked, and the ultimate end and use of this earth. It is man who has made a mystery of these things. That which has misled him has been the deception of Satan, and an inclination to follow the phrasing traditions of his own kind.

From the beginning it has been Satan's purpose to substitute falsehood for truth in the minds of men. Those who have chosen to be dupes will be so. Those who aided in the evil work, until now so great a structure of error has been raised that the minds of men, when without scriptural guide, are lost in the maze. Then the sole safeguard,—the only guide is alone the Word of God, solely and alone, without man and other taken from it or added to it,—certified only by its own exhaustive regarding itself, understood by its own interpretation and explanation of itself and none other. The Bible was written to be a mental plaything for philosophers and theologians. All who and all who; Gracing his authorship, his promises, to the individual; children of men in the dust, and them, its words, he put into the mouths of men who were their fellows, to speak to them after their own manner. Christ's preaching was not above the understanding of the plain and simple-minded fisherfolk of Galilee. The disciples whom he chose for them were unlettered men. All they who heard him, and them, had no difficulty in understanding if they listened with willing ears. The words of Scripture have not changed since first they were true. Man is still in possession of the mentality which God gave him. Biblical truth is still for all men, and adapted to the understanding of all. Let all take it and

THE commandments of God are a transcript of his character. It is only those in whom he writes his law who abide "that know righteousness," and so are acquainted with God. Sin is the transgression of the law, and is sinfulness. To be conformed to the law of God, and to have it written in the heart, is to be righteous; to be again in the image of God, whereof man was first made. If man can only return to the likeness of God in which he was created by having the commandments of God written in his heart, as his character, it necessarily follows that they are an expression of the character of God and are therefore his righteousness. The ten commandments are, then, the expression to man of the character of God, and it is the will of God that man conform to them that man becomes godlike. Consequently, to "fear God and keep his commandments" is "the whole duty of man." But, as man has sinned, and through that transgression the seed of all, and notwithstanding of death, has been planted in the nature of every man—the man cannot be saved or serve God except through the mercy and re-creative power of Him who was the creative agent in the beginning,— "through whom" it was "all things were made and all earthly life its being. That it is through him only that man can be saved is therefore but the necessary sequence of Christ and his righteousness. Through Christ, who was the agent in creation, the only possibility of re-creation in the resurrection. Christ offered himself as a propitiation for sin, that it might be possible for those who accepted his sacrifice to cry, "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."

To thwart the plan of salvation,—to prevent its death, its sting, and to give its grave the victory would, be the highest success that the enmity of God and man could achieve. Satan's chief deception is when he constructed the word of God, and by which he persuaded man to transgress, was a denial that the wage of sin was death. It would be natural and logical that the great deceiver should continue, as he has, with an attempt to make the understanding of all. Let all take it and
