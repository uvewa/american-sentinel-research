In behalf of all mankind this protest is made to the enforcement of so-called "Sabbath laws," by which ordinary labor on any particular day of the week is made a crime to be punished by fine or imprisonment. Our opposition to such legislation is not because the wrong day may be selected for such a purpose, but because any day is thus designated. It is not a question as to which day is the Sabbath. The only point to be settled is whether or not the State should enforce any kind of Sabbath observance on any day. Men may differ as to whether the first or the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath, but this is not a subject for consideration in the present discussion. Neither is it the object of this paper to destroy reverence for the Sabbath-day. On the contrary these views are held by many who have the most profound respect for the Sabbath. Therefore, let no one mistake the single point at issue, namely: Shall the State enforce Sabbath observance of any kind, to any degree, on any day, upon any person? We answer with an emphatic so, and give some reasons as follows:—

Sabbath-keeping is a matter of religion. It is based on the Bible and the command of the moral law. It is held to be a memorial instituted by Christ, and hence a part of the gospel. Not only is it called the "Sabbath," a title first applied to the day on which God rested from the work of creation, but it is also termed "Lord's day" and other names to designate a holy character. Hence it is plain that any law in reference to the Sabbath is based on the idea of at least protecting religion. This is equivalent to saying that religion needs the aid of human laws, and that the gospel will have more power to save men when supported by the State. Laws are made to protect the weak against the oppression of the strong; therefore any law to protect religion is virtually saying that evil men are stronger than the gospel, and hence they must be restrained from inflicting injury upon it. Thus the State can protect religion only by assuming that men have more power than the gospel. If this is true, then how can any man expect to be saved by the gospel? Can we be saved from ourselves by something weaker than ourselves? Is a gospel that is unable to live without man's aid sufficient to save man from sin, which has the mastery over him? Who can have any genuine faith in or love for a gospel that must be supported by those it professes to save? Whoever looks to the State to protect religion, thereby declares that he has no faith in the power of religion to save the State. The State, and not Jesus Christ, becomes his saviour. He looks to the State to know his duty in religion instead of to God and his Word as the only authority in such matters. The Bible declares that the "gospel is the power of God." Rom. 1:16. And again, Christ says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and earth." Matt. 28:18. Can any power be added to "all power in heaven and earth"? Can man increase the "power of God"? Is it not presumption then to attempt to protect the gospel by human enactment? "Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men." 1 Cor. 1:25. If God's weakness is stronger than men, certainly the gospel is stronger than men, for it is not the weakness of God but his power. To regard the gospel as anything less than the power of God, able to save unto the uttermost, is only to deny the gospel and the power of God. Such a thing is not only possible, but it is one of the marked sins of the present day. "Having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof." Is not this fulfilled when professed Christians demand of the Nation and State laws to protect their religious institutions? What then shall be said for those misguided souls who are so anxious to have the State make and enforce Sunday laws? Is it a fact that they know not the Scriptures nor the power of God? Do they realize their shame when they turn to the State with outstretched arms to save their religion? Have they not been turned aside to "another gospel," which is not another—one made by man and dependent on man? Are they willing to let the observance of the Sabbath depend on the voluntary obedience of those who accept it as part of the gospel, the same as they do in baptism or the Lord's supper? In short, do they see the sin that is caused by human legislation in matters of religion?

It has been shown that the principle underneath Sunday laws is opposed to the gospel, and hence it is false. We will now look at some of the vicious fruit borne upon its deadly branches. Reference might be made to the "Dark Ages" when the idea that religion must be protected by civil rulers was carried to its logical conclusion, in the dungeon, at the stake, and in the torture-chamber. All this was done to protect the gospel and make the people religious. But bear in mind that it is always a false gospel that seeks the aid of the State. The world now looks with shame and astonishment seeing how the true gospel of love was turned into a false gospel of hate. The fault then was not that the people were worse than now; the trouble was they did not know the power of the gospel of Christ, and so looked to the State for aid. The most zealous of them became the fiercest persecutors of others. And all the time they professed to be the true church of Christ and anxious only for the good of men. The same principle was planted in the New World by the misguided zeal of the Puritans. Quakers, Baptists and witches were persecuted, and the fact was demonstrated that Protestants, no less than Catholics, would stop at nothing in their blind prejudice. From these older colonies religious laws, more or less modified, have found their way into the statute books of the various States of the Union. For some time public sentiment has been opposed to the strict enforcement of these statutes. Owing to this fact and also to the supposed guarantee of the national and State Constitutions in regard to matters of religion, the Church has been left comparatively free from human legislation. As a consequence the gospel has had free course to run and be glorified, and the State has prospered while attending to its own secular business. In this way it is demonstrated again that the gospel and the State both thrive best when each is independent of the other. One might have fondly hoped that never again would the Church ask for, or consent to, the State's protecting religion, and that the State, if solicited to such an unholy alliance, would refuse the lewd appeal. But alas! the last few years have witnessed the religious world not asking, but demanding, by pulpit, press, and petition, of Congress and various State legislatures, acts of legislation pertaining to the Sabbath. As a consequence ancient Sunday laws are now being enforced and men have been arrested, fined and imprisoned for doing ordinary labor on that day. This course is usually at the instigation of members of the church who are determined that the gospel they believe shall be received by those who differ from them. Thus Sunday laws put the means in the hands of those who are bigoted to persecute persons who disregard their religious views.

In the interest of liberty for all men, in the interest of true religion, is it not fitting that a vigorous protest should be made to every idea that makes one man the servant of another man's conscience, and degrades the wonderful gospel of Jesus Christ which is able to save all that accept it in faith as the power of God, to something that must be made subject to human enactment? The man who has the highest regard for the Sabbath is just the one who will refuse to have it made the subject for enforcement by the policeman and constable. Nothing but the power of God can make a man able to keep the Sabbath. The State does not have such power and therefore has no right to demand its performance. God has the power in the gospel to enable the Sabbath to be kept "holy." He only has a right to punish for its rejection. Therefore let us render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.
