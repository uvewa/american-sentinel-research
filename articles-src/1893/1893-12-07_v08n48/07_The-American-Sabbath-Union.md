THE REV. Mr. Day, Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, recently delivered in Montreal, a lecture on the subject of "The Sabbath," which has been delivered three thousand times, in the United States and Canada, to over a hundred thousand people. He declared his purpose to be to set forth the importance of observance of Sunday and secure the cooperation of all in the work of its observance.

The abstract theory of Sabbath observance which the speaker presented was as follows: He, by direct quotation, purported to prove that the fourth commandment commanded the basis of argument, and said truly: "The Sabbath movement is one of the most serious movements of the day. It is the paramount question of the century. The issue is between Christianity and no Christianity. It is the temperance question. The fourth commandment belongs to no generation or to any generation in any age of time. Neither church, State, nor individual can the first, or third, or sixth commandment, neither can we keep it in spirit and not keep it in letter."

Mr. Day "attempted to show, however, that the fourth commandment is indefinite as to the day that should be observed, and that the observance of one seventh part of time is all that is required. This was emphasized, and yet it is not true that all could not agree on the statement that all cannot be kept." "The disorganization of society." This would be plausible if true, but it is not true. To lay upon man the duty of rectifying the error which God had neglected to specify. In doing this it must be supposed that, since the minority should yield to the majority, and, as there are forty millions of people in

the United States, to-day, that claim to be keeping the "Christian" Sabbath, so all ought to harmonize in the observance of that day. Mr. Day conceded that if the plain language more explicit than it is in the fourth commandment, naming the day as the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, not on the face of this position and contended, therefore, plainly and decisively, that individual judgment, even though guided by the word of God will justify disregard of the wishes of the majority. His ablest arguments, doctrine which are started arguments, are these:—

When President Jackson vetoed the bill for carrying the mails on Sunday, in 1831, he asserted that every public officer has a right to interpret the Constitution as he pleased, and no one should gainsay his interpretation.

To this Henry Clay made reply as follows:—

So no seems to respect as he understands it in regard to these matters, no one is able to determine who shall construe the fundamental law in case he does, or as they understand, and in the only things we as a free people have been acquainted, he uses as the law of each and the substance of all, and of his kindred, and day. And by its immortal legislation and the maxims given in the fundamental law prescribed to govern religious opinion, from the highest to the lowest—universally binding—are these.

Still more forcible are the words of Paul when he says that "the law was not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane." Will any man in his senses, after he perceived it, and as the word is, the law it is interpreted, and as it is written.

Mr. Day, however, takes this ground that the law of God is good and of its proper influence, and that the Sabbath of the Lord and that God would use all moral men—"Christian men and commandment, as if he did it on his own authority."

The position of Seventh-day Adventists is as unalterably opposed to the enforcement of Sunday observance. Yet they also said that they are opposed to the legal enforcement of the seventh-day Sabbath also. Mr. Day's vocabulary was exhausted in trying to prove that the Bible answer Adventists on the Sabbath question and still maintain that the word "Sabbath" is in no sense a Jewish institution. If the seventh-day Sabbath were observed, a few was born. Read Gen. 2:3, and you will find that it originated with the creation of the world. Mr. Day decidedly contradicted himself by asserting that it was a Jewish institution, and that no man can tell which is the right day. It is very easy to tell. That is all that is required; that all cannot be kept." The facing logic is the fact that the world was in a condition, and there on the opposite side of the world, and the keeping of the different day. It did not seem to matter that there were a few millions of Jews who had lost all observation as against the true Sabbath. Mr. Day's argument seems to be that more or less in conflict with the statement, and in Baptist confirmation that the day of rest, and on his own statement, more or less in conflict with the common, and in Baptist confirmation that the Sabbath was changed.

If the Sabbath were in no sense "Jewish," why did he try so hard to prove it "Christian"? The commandment says "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord." All such claims as "Jewish," "Christian," "Jewish institution," are mere man inventions. Mr. Day failed to prove from his position. Mr. Day's position that the seventh day is not the Sabbath. He from his commission, for it was positive and always knew when the first day of the week was, by the resurrection of Christ. He also failed to give any authority for a change from the original Sabbath to Sunday.

The only weekly Sabbath known to the Word, the seventh day, or Saturday, and any teaching to the contrary is not the truth.

More than this, the speaker was not in accord with the best authorities in defending his Sabbath. He merely denied the facts the dead in regard to first day observance.

The fact that the Bible is as silent as the dead in regard to first day observance leads the honest in heart to a skeptical position on Sunday observance, and it is an old time maxim that false theories must be bolstered up by compulsory law. The speaker appealed to the word of God, and asked his congregation to convict him should he be found wanting in it. Yet the position he took was in direct conflict with every text of Scripture.

The use of the fourth commandment to sustain a Roman, pagan Sunday is straight to bring the Judgments of heaven upon us, Sunday rest, enjoyed by Constantine the sun-worshiper, in favor of "the venerable day of the Sun." The heathen observance in 321, afterwards taken up by the apostate church and baptized, and then grafted by compulsory law into establishment of the worship by the civil law, and is a "mark of the beast," enforced by apostate Protestantism and will be the sign against those who who the traditions of Romanism more than they do the literal word of God.

Mr. Day said many truthful things in regard to the apostasy of Protestant churches, but seemed to think Sunday laws were necessary to hold their own members, even some of their ministers, to Christian duties; relying on trains, buying Sunday papers, etc. Worldly excursions, etc., were denounced in the bitterest terms. Statistics were quoted from doctors showing why railroad men should have the law to secure them the privilege of becoming Christians, attending church, etc.; instances of railroad accidents occurring on Sunday which were attributed to the running of the Sabbath. He was, also related. Such arguments are folly to the reader of statistics who knows that as many or more accidents occur on other days of the week, proportionally, as on Sunday, and that Seventh-day Adventists and other Sabbatarians will give up good positions, and make heavy sacrifice, for the truth's sake, obeying their sense of right without the aid of compulsory law, and will not be supported by "our Saturday-keeping." He concluded by a tirade against all opponents of his views, saying, "our which advocates of enforced Sunday observance are now directing their batteries.

The faithful keeper of the commandments of God, in the face of Mr. Day's lecture, could say with the Apostle Paul, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth."

It needs no power of man or legislative act to bring man to Christ or convert him to keep the Sabbath of the Lord when once his heart has been touched with the true spirit of obedience.
