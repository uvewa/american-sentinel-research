A subscriber writing from Memphis, Tenn., the State in which Sunday work is a nuisance—when done by Adventists,—says:—

I was walking through the city last Sunday, and could scarcely tell that it was Sunday by anything that I saw. One can buy almost anything he wants here on Sunday just as well as on other days.

But an Adventist cannot hoe in his garden or sprout stumps in his back field or do any other similar work without the risk of being indicted and prosecuted for maintaining a nuisance because of the moral shock to the religious prejudices of his neighbors!
