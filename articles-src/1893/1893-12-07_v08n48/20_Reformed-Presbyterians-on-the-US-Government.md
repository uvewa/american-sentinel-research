The Reformed Presbyterians, the original National Reformers, declare, in a leaflet circulated at the recent National Reform convention in Allegheny, that because the Government of the United States is founded on the will of the people and on the secular theory, "it is constituted and administered in disregard of the authority of God, and of his Christ, and of his law. And by its immoral legislation and its sanction given to great wrongs and enormous evils, the Government proves itself to be a throne of iniquity which frames mischief by a law."

The Christian Statesman, which professes to be very much horrified at the Adventist application of Revelation 13:11-17 to the United States, will please explain in what respect the National Reform view gives superior honor to this Government?
