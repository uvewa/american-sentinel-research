The "Pearl of Days" column in the Mail and Express has this item:—

Rev. Dr. Thomas D. Christie, President of St. Paul's Institute, Tarsus, Asiatic Turkey, writes to the General Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, as follows: "We foreign missionaries are watching with keenest interest the progress of the cause in which you are engaged, and earnestly pray for the largest possible success. May God raise up a multitude of public spirited men of devotion to noble ideals and of a high sense of honor who shall carry forward the cause of the Sabbath."

Such paragraphs as this are indications of the widespread influence of this fatal religious error—the movement for the enforcement of Sunday observance. What will be its influence when it obtains full foothold in the minds of untaught converts from heathenism, who are still imbued with the ideas of pagan force with which this so perfectly tallies?
