TRUE religion puts men crosswise to the world. A false religion conforms to the world. True religion by its crosswise course creates friction, arouses opposition, exposes itself to the charge of being contentious, self-willed and pugnacious. False religion gets a fine reputation for peace by its surrender. It is applauded for the world because it never resists it.
