Two Congregational societies' sort of end of religion has grown a long way toward making religious contest and says: "If we do not swiftly read the signs of the times it is to be fought on this continent sooner, perhaps and with more terrible emphasis than, we have thought." There is prophetic suggestiveness that the conflict which the Congregationalists foresee will take place, and that soon; this country will also be the theatre of action. These signs in the religious, social, and political world are the forerunners of the conflict.
