A SUBSCRIBER writing from Memphis, says: "In the State in which Sunday work is a misdemeanor, does it apply to all the citizens?"

We would say that it was the Sunday law with trains; that no one was exempt from it; trains running on Sunday; yet in one or two States this is the case. But an Adventist can come to his papers on Sunday, and expect no one will follow his track. We fear we would be no better than the man who had and we should not have allowed the Sunday papers to come into our hands.

But an Adventist does not come in his papers or permit anyone in his land field or do any other similar work without the risk of being indicted and prosecuted for maintaining a nuisance because of the moral shock to the religious prejudices of his neighbors.
