FOR some time there has been a controversy over the policy of the London School Board, in regard to religious instruction in the public schools. The controversy is as to whether or not there shall be religious instruction, but it is the unsettled. Many who are opposing an increase, agree that there should be some, and thereby they injure their protest and lose their chief following letter to the *Daily Chronicle*, from a teacher, puts the matter well, and urging desperate efforts to have specific religious instruction in the public schools, —given opportunity to speak briefly of the subject relative to the questions:—

The Education Department, acting upon certain facts, has already issued an order identical with what is being given to the Jews in the instruction of the London Board. And why not? We have now about twenty years a more or less organized system of Jewish teaching, with all the machinery of a board of appointing Jewish teachers, and that at the present time there are hundreds of Jewish children receiving religious instruction. The Department's expense is a "systematic knowledge of the Bible." But this, the opponents of the present teaching complain, is not being carried out—the present teaching the board shows no disposition to abolish what has been wrested from the people, a right to have their children taught the truths of religion in which their parents do not believe in. But I insist that, from the standpoint of the Education Department and your readers, why is it allowable to teach Jewish children doctrines which Protestant parents repudiate, and to refuse similar privileges to Unitarians? Why should the rights of Jewish parents be recognized, and those of Unitarian parents and others be ignored? If the demand of the Jewish parents has returned to stand up for them, is treated as a reasonable, that of Catholics, Baptists, Methodists, Unitarians, Christian Scientists, Theosophists, Jews, Unitarians, and Secularists alike, every body's child is a vessel and can have something different put in from what is in the rest.

Schools.

That is a fair presentation of the case. There is no reason to doubt the honesty of purpose of the gentleman who wrote it.

And if the principle be conceded, that Biblical ethics ought to be taught religion at all then the position taken in the letter is all-together logical and right. And if all then the position taken in the letter is altogether logical. For if religion is to be taught at all, it is plain that the teaching ought to be so definite and distinctly religious that parents should have a right to say in what, if any, way their children shall be instructed, is just.

There is no place in this world where religious instruction can be given as a matter of fact. True religion,—the religion of Jesus Christ, the only true religion,—is a matter of reality. And that is just the reason why religious teaching of any kind should not be taught by any system instituted by law.

Therefore the teaching of religion in the public schools, is as far differing from true living religion in those schools as it can be.

It is true that it is just not proper to teach Christian doctrines in schools, or not to teach Jewish doctrines, because neither is proper. Let this bring to the surface further. It is just as allowable to teach Catholicism as Judaism, just as allowable to teach Mohammedanism as Catholicism; just as allowable to teach Spiritualism as Mohammedanism; just as allowable to teach Christianity as Spiritualism; just as allowable to teach Spiritualism as Buddhism; just as allowable to teach nothing as anything else. "Oh, no; no; that would never do," says the religious world. "We would not allow teach Spiritualism or Buddhism or Mohammedanism in our schools. Why not? "Oh, would be the reply, "because those systems of religion are wicked." Of course they are, but so are Mohammedanism and Hinduism and Buddhism? "No," and we would not allow them to be taught in the public schools. Of course not.

But we ask again, Do you think that Catholicism is a religious system? "Yes." Should it be allowed in the public schools? "No;" would be the reply, at least as far as Protestantism is concerned. But, do you believe that the parents have a right to expect the rights of parents?

This reason can be met by this presentation of the case that the rights of parents are not considered at all. It is not all of those who clamor for religious instruction in public schools using it for a motive or a proposition to teach Spiritualism or Mohammedanism, no matter how many parents desired it. If a sufficient majority demanded a Unitarian, a Christian, a Spiritualist, a Mohammedan instruction, all would be entitled to the same rights and privileges as the present religious instruction. There we are forced to the conclusion that when the chance for State instruction in religion, do so only because they are persuaded that their particular form of religion—their denomination—will be taught.

The fact is, there is no justice nor equality in the granting of any religious instruction to any sect, or any number of persons as the government, who impartially requires the money for religious teaching from all. Now the writer of the above letter allows that he wants a religious instruction that it espouses a religion in which their parents do not believe in. Each denomination that people, whether or not, to teach the children of others that which those others do not believe. But that is just what is done when any form of religion is taught in the schools. For all Christianity is made up of sects; Catholicism, when it is taught in schools; and when any Christian instruction is taught, and why not help to pay for that something, children are asked for the support of religion, when it is not in schools?

It may be urged that equality is maintained since it is not a particular form of religion, just the proportion of money that comes from the believers in that form.

It is true also, since there so many forms of religion which would not be allowed in a moment's consideration. If it were the case, then only let any laws to those who are free to provide their own religious instruction for the money and provide the teaching.

asking, but demanding, by pulpit, press, and petitions, of Congress and various State legislatures, acts of legislation pertaining to the Sabbath. As a consequence Sunday laws are now being enforced that have been unused for years. Even imprisonment for doing ordinary labor on that day. The case becomes usually at the instigation of members of the church who are determined that the gospel they believe in shall be forced upon those who differ from them. That Sunday laws put the instrument and the power, into the hands of one class of citizens to use the power to persecute persons who disregard Sunday observance.

In the interest of liberty for all men, in the interest of true religion, it is not fitting that a vigorous protest should be made to every one that makes one man the servant of another man's conscience, and degrades the wonderful gospel of Jesus Christ which is able to save all that accept it, in his sake as the power of a pet, something that must be made subject to the civil authority. We believe that the highest regard for the Sabbath is just the one who will refuse to have it made the subject of enforcement by the policeman and constable. Nothing but the spirit of anti-Christ can put in force the enforcement of the Sabbath. The State does not and cannot use the love of God to enforce a right to demand its performance. God does not enforce the Sabbath, and for the Sabbath to be kept "holy." He only has a right to protest for disobedience, but first let us render to Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's.
