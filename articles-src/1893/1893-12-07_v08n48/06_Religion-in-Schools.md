For some time there has been a controversy over the policy of the London School Board, in regard to religious instruction in the public schools. The controversy is not as to whether or not there shall be instruction, but as to the amount. Those who are opposing an increase, agree that there should be some, and thereby they deprive their protest of all force. The following letter to the Daily Chronicle, from the member of the board who is making desperate efforts to have specific religious teaching in the schools,—more of it,—gives opportunity to speak briefly of the principles involved in the question:—

The Education Department, acting upon certain rumors, has inquired as to the kind of instruction which is being given to the Jews in the London Board Schools. The answer of the board, as reported yesterday, discloses the fact that for nearly twenty years a more or less organized system of Jewish instruction has been in force in certain of the schools, that the board has made a regular practice of appointing Jewish teachers, and that at the present moment the board is giving instruction at the ratepayers' expense in a "systematic knowledge of Judaism, with special reference to its distinctive dogmas and to tradition." This denominational teaching the board shows no disposition to abolish—very wisely, as I think, for I have a rooted objection to teaching other people's children a religion which their parents do not believe in. But I could not help asking the board, as I now venture to ask your readers, why it is allowable to teach Jewish doctrines at the ratepayers' expense, but so very wrong to teach Christian doctrines in the same way. Why should the rights of Jewish parents be recognized, while the rights of Christian parents are so utterly disregarded that the writer of this letter, who has ventured to stand up for them, is treated as the enemy of religious liberty? I want justice for all, Christian, Jew, Unitarian, and Secularist alike; my only fault (surely a venial one) is that I am inclined to place the rights of parents before the convenience of a school board.

That is a fair presentation of the case. There is no reason to doubt the honesty of purpose of the gentleman who wrote it.

And if the principle be conceded, that State schools ought to teach religion at all then the position taken in the letter is a very fair one. For if religion is to be taught at all, it is plain that the teaching ought to be definite and thorough; and the proposal that the parents have a right to say in what religion, if any, their children shall be instructed, is just.

There is no place in the world where religion ought not to be, not in form, but in fact. True religion—the religion of Jesus Christ—is not form, but fact, a living reality. And that is just the reason why it cannot be enforced by law, and cannot be taught by any system instituted by law. Therefore the teaching of religion in the public schools, is a far different thing from having religion in those schools.

It is true that it is just as proper to teach Christian doctrines in schools, as it is to teach Jewish doctrines, because neither is proper. Let the thing be carried further. It is just as allowable to teach Catholicism as Judaism; just as allowable to teach Mohammedanism as Catholicism; just as allowable to teach Buddhism as Mohammedanism; just as allowable to teach Spiritualism as Buddhism; just as allowable to teach infidelity as Spiritualism. "Oh, no, no; that would never do," says the advocate of religious instruction in schools. Why not? "Oh," would be the reply, "because infidelity and Spiritualism are wicked." Of course they are, but are Mohammedanism and Buddhism righteousness? "No; and we would not allow them to be taught at the public expense." But we ask again, Do you think that Catholicism and Judaism are the truth? "No;" would be the reply, at least as far as Judaism is concerned; "but we must respect the rights of parents."

The reader can see by this presentation of the case that the rights of parents are not considered at all; for none of those who clamor for religious instruction in schools would listen for a minute to a proposition to teach Spiritualism or Mohammedanism, no matter how many parents might be of those persuasions. But a Mohammedan, a Unitarian, a Spiritualist, a Mormon, or an infidel, is a man, and therefore entitled to the same rights and privileges as any other man. And therefore we are forced to the conclusion that those who clamor for State instruction in religion, do so only because they are persuaded that their particular system of religion—their denomination—will be the gainer by it.

The fact is, there is no justice nor equality in the thing. There is no such person as the government, who impartially supplies the money for religious training. All public money comes from the people. Now the writer of the above letter allows that it is not just to teach children at public expense a religion in which their parents do not believe. Neither is it just to tax people, whether parents or not, to teach the children of others that which they themselves do not believe. But that is just what is done when any form of religion is taught in the schools. For all Christians are taxed for the support of Judaism, when it is taught in schools; and when a form of Christianity is taught, the Jews help to pay for that teaching; and infidels are taxed for the support of religion, when they do not believe in any form of it.

It may be urged that equality is maintained by using in the support of each form of religion, just the proportion of money that comes from the believers in that form.

This is not true, since there are many forms of religion which would not be allowed a moment's consideration. If it were the case, then why not leave all the people free to provide their own religious teaching, instead of having the civil government handle the money and provide the teaching?

Any religious teaching whatever in the public schools is manifest injustice, and in reality to none more than to those who are taught. As said before, true religion is a life, not a form, nor a creed. Christianity does not consist of a system of doctrine, but of a vital connection with Christ. But the most that can be taught in any public school, is an outline of certain doctrines, so that the child is choked with a form, instead of being fed with the Bread of life.

There are many who think that the rights of Nonconformists are in danger of being trampled upon in this attempt to increase the amount of religious instruction in the schools, which attempt comes mainly from the High Church party. This is true, but their protests are all useless, as long as they admit the right of the civil government to have anything whatever to do with religion. Civil government is not adapted to that end. It can indeed teach religion but not Christianity; but religion without Christianity is paganism, which is all that the State can ever teach or enforce. Therefore in the interest of pure and undefiled religion, in the interest of the pure Gospel of Christ, the Present Truth will never cease to call attention to the essential wickedness of State connection with religion in any form whatever.
