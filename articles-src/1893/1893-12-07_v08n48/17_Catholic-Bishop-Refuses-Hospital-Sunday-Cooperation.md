The China Mail, for a copy of which the SENTINEL is indebted to a subscriber at Hong Kong, notes the fact that a Roman Catholic bishop of the city of Hong Kong had refused, in behalf of the churches of his denomination, to cooperate with the Protestant societies in the observance of an especial day as "Hospital Sunday," and the donation of offerings on that day to general hospital purposes in the city. The reason which the bishop gives is that his people support their own charitable institutions. The Mail regrets the bishop's action especially "in the view of the fact that the Roman Catholic institutions in the colony receive a large measure of support from the Protestant community."
