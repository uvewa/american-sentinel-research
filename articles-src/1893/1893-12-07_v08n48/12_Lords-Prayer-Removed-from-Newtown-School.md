Newtown, Long Island, has been greatly agitated for some time over an order issued by the chairman of the school board to discontinue the reciting of the Lord's Prayer in the public school of the village. The order was issued upon demand of a number of citizens, who, for various reasons, objected to the giving of any religious instruction in the public schools. But protests long and loud were made against the chairman's order, and it was rescinded a few days since by unanimous vote of the school board.
