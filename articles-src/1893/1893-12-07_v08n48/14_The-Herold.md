The *Herold*, of November 6, has this: "Nannie Pervial, a clerk in the grocery store at No. 54 Monroe Street, sold a loaf of bread to a woman Sunday last, which act was witnessed by policeman Heaghy, of the Madison Street station. 'What do you mean by violating the Sabbath?' demanded the officer.

"'I'm not the only one that's open,'" volunteered the clerk. "'You must be blind.'

"The young man was arrested, and Jim Lee Yorkin, in the Essex Market court yesterday, held him for trial."
