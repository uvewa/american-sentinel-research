[The New York Sun of Nov. 27, contains the following telegraphic matter from Albany, N. Y., and Baltimore, Md., on the question of State aid to parochial schools.]

THE Right Rev. Bishop William Croswell Doane of the Albany Episcopal Diocese was asked to-day for his views in regard to the proposed passage of a bill by the next State legislature providing for State aid for parochial schools. Such a bill has already been drafted by Mr. Dennis A. Spellissey, a member of the New York City Bar, having this object in view, and it is likely to be vigorously pushed at the coming session.

Bishop Doane's views will be of interest in connection with the opinions expressed by Cardinal Gibbons, of Baltimore, in the morning papers. He said:

"The system of education known as the common school system in America is justly regarded as among the most essential factors in good government. It has never been based upon the rights of children to be educated, but upon the necessity of the State to protect itself from the danger of a class of citizens, who, being uneducated and ignorant, become immoral and inimical to good government. It is all the more important, since the possession of the ballot makes numbers powerful, and universal intelligence is the only safeguard of universal suffrage."

Referring particularly to the bill which will be introduced next January, and to the petition of prominent Catholics in the State which will accompany its introduction, the bishop said:

"The very ground, therefore, of the petition which accompanies the bill is wrong. The people who urge it have no such rights as they claim. The State provides sufficient education, free for all, and compels all children to receive it, but the State knows nothing of any particular education in any religious belief.

"As to the bill, it is specious in its title and in its provisions. The American way to promote education is to increase the number of common schools, and not to subsidize private enterprises for free education. It is idle to pretend that the bill does not ask legislation in favor of any one society or church, because it must be interpreted by the language of the petition and by the source from which it originates.

"I am abundantly satisfied that such a proposal would be resisted to the death, and rejected. There is not the slightest interference in any common school in America with any peculiar religious views or with any religious teaching. Every Church and every Christian parent must take care of the religious training of the children for whom they are responsible. My own sense of the importance of religious education is shown by the establishment and maintenance of the diocesan girl's school. But the churches must do this for themselves, or it must be done by individual liberality; and the enormous wealth of Roman Catholics in this country is abundantly sufficient to enable them to take care of their own parochial schools. State money cannot be used to support any denominational school, because it cannot be used to further the interest of any religious body. Such a course would only foster the rivalries of sects, and break up the unity of our educational system.

"I am quite sure that if I were a Roman Catholic I would oppose this scheme with all my might. The Roman Church is really on trial in America. She is claiming to be adapting herself to American principles and habits. Such a proposal as this falsifies the claim. Already she is suspected of interfering with political elections. If she makes open avowal of an attempt to interfere with public education she will receive, and in my judgment deserve, the unanimous verdict of the more than fifty millions of people in America; who, being divided into all sorts of religious associations, and some having no religious position at all, are united in their determination that no religious body shall control either the elections or the education of the country."

BALTIMORE, Nov. 26.—Father Slattery, the head of the Josephites in this country, preached a sermon here to-night at St. Francis Xavier Colored Catholic Church on the school question in line with the circular issued on Friday by Cardinal Gibbons. He told the colored people they needed two things, education and religion, one as much as the other, and that from a police point of view alone, as the State was interested in having its children brought up in a moral way, the colored Catholic schools were entitled to State aid. Of course it would not do to single out any one denomination, but that by including all none would be offended.

"Strike a blow," said he, "whenever you can for the parochial schools."

Father Slattery's sermon is the first public announcement of the policy of the church on this question. The idea, it is said, is to gain the support of all the colored people, irrespective of denomination.
