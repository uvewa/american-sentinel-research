A last page note in last week's SENTINEL gave, very briefly, the facts concerning the arrest of two Seventh-day Adventists in Gainesville, Ga., for Sunday work. The following letter gives the facts more fully:

Gainesville, Hall Co., Ga., Nov. 23, 1893.

EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: Another time the enemy of all righteousness is stirred up and we have another case of religious persecution to report.

Last Sunday morning, Nov. 19, Eld. W. A. McCutchen and myself, having some work to do making a few school seats, table, etc., took our bench into the rear of our new church and school building in this place, and as quietly as possible went about our work. We worked all the forenoon and had just begun again in the afternoon, when a policeman and another man came up and watched us through the windows for several minutes. We kept right on with our work. They went back to town. Then three other men came and looked in while I was there working alone, Brother McCutchen having gone to his house. In a little while the policeman who had been there returned, another one with him, and arrested us both; took us to the mayor's office where we gave bond to appear at mayor's court, at 10 A. M., yesterday.

We appeared on time and were tried for "disorderly conduct." I have not the ordinance as it reads but in substance it forbids loud or indecent language, hallooing, fighting, quarrelling, or attempting to quarrel, etc. The city has no Sunday law at all. But under the above ordinance we were convicted and fined $50 each and costs, $5, or 50 days on the streets. We did not have the money to pay the fines, and would not have paid them had we had it. Accordingly we were taken to the calaboose and locked up. Friends immediately went to work to appeal the case to a higher court and get us out for a time. It was difficult work as the feeling was very strong against us and the mayor would make no concessions. Finally a lawyer took up our case and made arrangements to let us out under bond till January, when it will be brought before the Superior Court. So this case is continued till then.

Just before the mayor gave his opinion, a lawyer, claiming to represent the State, asked that we be bound over to the County Court for Sabbath-breaking; a separate case entirely. So when we came out of jail yesterday evening we had to give bond for appearance at court this morning to answer the above charge. We went and asked for the case to be continued till the next term of the same court. This the judge refused to do. We will now demand an indictment by the Grand Jury which will necessarily cause the case to be continued till the next term, which will be in February.

What the result will be of course we don't know, except this—the Lord's will will be done, his name glorified, and his cause advanced. We are all of good courage and rejoicing in the Lord, glad that we are accounted worthy to suffer for his name.

Yours truly,

E. C. KECK.

The ordinance under which they were arrested and convicted is as follows:

SECTION 268, (adopted Oct. 22, 1891). Any person or persons who shall use loud, boisterous, insulting, or obscene language, or who shall curse, or swear, or attempt to raise a quarrel, or who shall act in a disorderly or violent manner, or who shall fight, quarrel, halloo, or make any unnecessary noise within the corporate limits of this city, calculated to disturb the peace, quiet, or good order of the city or any citizen, shall be guilty of disorderly conduct, and upon conviction shall be punished as prescribed by Section 68.

SEC. 68 provides for a fine of not more than $100 and costs, or ninety days in jail or on the streets.

It does not seem that under this ordinance a conviction for disorderly conduct will hold in the higher courts, when it appears that the real "offense" was working on Sunday; but for that "crime" the statutes of that State provide an "adequate" penalty. The Georgia Code of 1882, and the decisions under it so far as they relate to Sunday observance, are as follows:

SEC. 3614 (3537), (3554). Sundays and holidays shall in no case be included in the computation of the time within which an appeal shall be entered except that holidays are included in the computation in cases of appeals from Justices' Courts).

DECISIONS.—When Sunday not counted. 12 Ga. 93. Not so as to Sunday in the thirty days which bills of exceptions to be certified and signed by the judge. 14 Ga. 123. Sunday not counted in the five days sheriff allowed for serving writs. 23 Ga. 49. Advertisement of tax sale in Sunday paper illegal, and sale thereunder passes no title. Sawyer v. Corgile, 72 Ga. 290. If draft, accepted and delivered on Sunday, but dated day before, comes to hands of one who does not know the fact, he can enforce it. Harrison v. Powers, 76 Ga. 218.

SEC. 3274 (3207), (3198). Attachments may issue and be levied on Sunday when the plaintiff, his agent or attorney at law, shall swear, in addition to the oath prescribed by this code, that he has reason to apprehend the loss of the debt, unless process of attachment do issue on Sunday, and shall also comply with the other provisions of this code in relation to issuing attachments.

SEC. 4535 (4461), (4420). Any person who shall be guilty of open lawdness, or any notorious act of public indecency tending to debauch the morals, or of keeping open tipping houses on the Sabbath day or Sabbath night, shall, on conviction, be punished as prescribed in section 4310 of this code.

DECISIONS.—Jury are to decide whether place was a tipping house, and kept open on Sunday. 19 Ga. 426. Plea for former conviction in the City Court of Atlanta against the same charge in the Superior Court. 53 Ga. 448. Where part of a tipping house used as a bedroom, yet the door must be kept closed on Sunday. 65 Ga. 568. House where the "Albany Glee Club" met and drank on Sunday, held a tipping house. 63 Ga. 319. Chief Justice Jackson, in deciding what constituted the opening of a liquor shop on Sunday, said (69 Ga. 54): "The door on the street through the bar and office room into the restaurant was kept open to the extent that any visitor had only to push it and go in, and tipple in the restaurant. The counter, where on other days tipping could be done, was covered by canvas from the ceiling to the floor, so as to be invisible itself, and to conceal the bottles on shelves behind, and on it in brazen letters was the announcement; 'bar closed,' and all the drinking was carried on in the rear and restaurant room. This fact, that the ostrich thus hid his head in the sand, and thereby imagined that his body was all covered too, is absolutely assigned as the legal reason why he was not visible to the keen eye of the law, which penetrates and despises all subterfuge and deceit! But one witness, though the canvas tried to hide the bird's head, actually did see, poked out through a sort of aperture or window, the bill or beak which let out the liquor from the bar to the servants in the restaurant. So that the foolish bird did not even keep all his head hid all the time. It makes no difference in law whether the place he called a barroom or a glee club resort, or a parlor or a restaurant, if it be a place where liquor is retailed and tippled on the Sabbath day, with a door to get into, so kept that anybody can push it open, and go in and drink, the proprietor of it is guilty of keeping open a tipping house on Sunday." Ala. Law J., Oct. 18, 1884.

SEC. 4578 (4492), (4450). If any freight train (excursion train, or other trains than the regular trains run for the carrying of the mails and passengers) shall be run on any railroad in this State on the Sabbath day (known as Sunday), the superintendent of transportation of such railroad company, or the officer having charge of the business of that department of the railroad, shall be liable to indictment for a misdemeanor in each county through which such train shall pass, and, on conviction, shall be for each offense punished as prescribed in section 4310 of this code. On such trial it shall not be necessary to allege or prove the names of any of the employés engaged on such train, but the simple fact of the train being run. The defendant may justify himself by proof that such employees acted in direct violation of the orders and rules of the defendant; provided always, that whenever any train on any railroad in this State, having in such train one or more cars loaded with live stock, which train shall be delayed beyond schedule time, shall not be required to lay over on the line of road or route during Sunday, but may run on to the point where by due course of shipment or consignment, the next stock pen on the route may be, where said animals may be fed and watered, according to the facilities usually afforded for such transportation. And it shall be lawful for all freight trains on the different railroads in this State, running over said roads on Saturday night to run through to destination; provided, the time of arrival, according to the schedule by which the train or trains started on the trip, shall not be later than eight o'clock on Sunday morning.

SEC. 4579 (4460), (4451). Any tradesman, artificer, workman or laborer, or other person whatever, who shall pursue their business or work of their ordinary railings upon the Lord's day (works of necessity and charity only excepted), shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction, shall be punished as prescribed in section 4310 of this code.

SEC. 4580. Any person or persons who shall hunt any kind of game with gun or dogs, or both, on the Sabbath day, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction, shall be punished as prescribed in section 4310 of this code.

SEC. 4581 (4494). Any person who shall bathe in any stream or pond of water on the Sabbath day, in view of any road or passway leading to or from any house of religious worship, shall be considered guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in a sum not exceeding $500, or imprisoned in the common jail of the county, at the discretion of the court, not exceeding six months.

SEC. 4582 (4459), (4452). All moneys arising from fines imposed for offenses, the gist of which consist in their being committed on the Sabbath day, shall be paid to the ordinary of the county, to be by him distributed for the purpose of establishing and promoting Sabbath schools in the country.

SEC. 4310. Accessories after the fact, except where it is otherwise ordered in this code, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000, imprisonment not to exceed six months, to work in the chain gang on the public works or on such other works as the county authorities may employ the chain gang, not to exceed twelve months, and any one or more of these punishments may be ordered at the discretion of the judge; provided, that nothing herein contained shall authorize the giving the control to private persons, or their employment by the county authorities in such mechanical pursuits as will bring the products of their labor into competition with the products of free labor.

SEC. 4814. In all cases where persons are convicted of misdemeanor, and sentenced to work in the chain gang on the public works, or public roads, or when such persons are confined in jail for non-payment of fines imposed for such misdemeanor, the ordinary of the county, and where there is a board of commissioners of roads and revenues of the counties, then said board of commissioners, and in those counties where there is a county judge, then the said county judge, where such conviction was had, or where such convicts may be confined, may place such convicts, in the county or elsewhere, to work upon such public works of the county, in chain-gangs or otherwise, or hire out such convicts, upon such terms and restrictions as may subserve the ends of justice, and place such convicts under such guards as may be necessary for their safe keeping.

SEC. 4821 (4723). When-ver any convict or convicts now confined, or hereafter to be confined, in the penitentiary of this State, or member or members of the chain-gang now confined, or hereafter to be confined, in the penitentiary of this State, or wherever else employed as such, shall be guilty of insurrection or attempt at insurrection, such convict or convicts, or member or members of the chain-gang, shall, upon trial and conviction in the Supreme Court of the county in which the crime is committed, be deemed guilty of a capital offense, and punished with death, or such other punishment as the judge in his discretion may inflict.

It will be at once apparent that with the Seventh-day Adventist a conviction under the Georgia Sunday law is a very serious matter. Adventists have uniformly refused to pay fines, choosing rather to go to prison or to the chain-gang as a testimony against Sunday legislation. Doubtless this course will be followed in Georgia.

Adventists imprisoned in Tennessee and worked in the chain-gang were, by the constitution of the State, shielded from any attempt to compel them to work on the Sabbath. The constitution of Tennessee provides that "no person shall in time of peace be required to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religion as a day of rest." But the constitution of Georgia contains no such provision. It follows that the Seventh-day Adventist or Seventh-day Baptist, sentenced to the chain-gang for violation of the Sunday law, may be required to work on the Sabbath, and in event of refusal, may be charged with insurrection, the penalty of which is "death, or such other punishment as the judge in his discretion may inflict." The Georgia Sunday law is fully worthy the institution which it is designed to protect. Fraud is fitly supported by injustice, oppression, and barbarity.

A subsequent letter from Mr. Keck gives some additional particulars as to the conviction and subsequent proceedings against himself and Elder McCutchen:—

We were convicted under the ordinance of 1891, and fined $50 and costs or 90 days on the streets. We are told by those who have lived here for some time that similar cases (just convictions of disorderly conduct) are seldom fined more than $5 and costs.

The city had four witnesses against us, all of whom testified that they were disturbed by our noise and work; but in answer to our questions, all admitted that the same work would not have disturbed them on any other day of the week. It was the time the work was done and not the character of the work that disturbed. They said they had been taught that Sunday was a day people ought to keep, and so of course it disturbed their peace to see us working. One witness said he was disturbed before he was near enough to hear the noise. Some one told him we were working and then he was disturbed.

We had but one witness, a gentleman living just across the street, not more than fifty feet from where we were working, nearer than any one else lives. He testified that he was not disturbed. Only one of the witnesses against us lives near the building where we did our work, yet they were all disturbed. All the prominent lawyers here admit that it was a case over which the mayor had no jurisdiction whatever. As one of them said, if what we did was "disorderly conduct," then every day's honest labor is disorderly conduct.

As I wrote before, they immediately made another case against us, which is as follows:—

"Georgia. In person appeared before me D. H. Hall Co. [Stansbury, who being duly sworn says, that to the best of his knowledge and belief W. A. McCutchen and E. C. Keck, did on the 19th day of November, in the year 1893, commit the offense of misdemeanor, for that the said W. A. McCutchen and E. C. Keck, in the county aforesaid, did work as a laborer, artificer, and workman, with planes, handsaws, hammers, etc., on or in the Seventh-day Adventist Church on said 19th day of November, 1893, the same being the Lord's day, said labor not being works of necessity or charity, contrary to the laws of said State, the good order, peace, and dignity thereof. D. H. Stansbury, known to and subscribed before me this Nov. 21st, 1893. S. K. CHRISTOPHER, N. P. & J. P."

"Georgia. I, D. H. Stansbury, in the name and Hall Co. [in behalf of the citizens of Georgia, charge and accuse W. A. McCutchen and E. C. Keck with the offense of misdemeanor, for that the said W. A. McCutchen and E. C. Keck did on the 19th day of November, 1893, in the county aforesaid, as a laborer, artificer, and workman, work on and in the Seventh-day Adventist Church with planes, hammers, handsaws, etc., on said 19th day of November, 1893, being the Lord's day, said labor not being works of necessity or charity, contrary to the laws of said State, the good order, peace, and dignity thereof.

"HOWARD THOMPSON, Solicitor.
"D. H. STANSBURY, Prosecutor.
"City Court, Hall County.
"November Term, 1893."

In connection with all this, I might say that railway trains run every Sunday; street cars and buses do the same; the post-office is open part of the day, cattle are killed for beef, some selling is done by a few stores, wood is cut, and the mayor who fined no has a tan-yard in the city where he keeps men at work every Sunday. During the trial, Brother McCutchen asked one of the witnesses if he had ever seen or known of anything similar being done. The mayor refused to allow the question to be answered. All candid minded people can see the spirit behind the whole thing.

Thus it appears that in Georgia as in Tennessee and Maryland, the civil law has become an engine of religious persecution.
