A CIRCULAR on the public school question, issued under the authority and by the direction of Cardinal Gibbons, has been distributed among both Protestants and Catholics in Baltimore, and the State of Maryland generally. The intention of the circular is thought to be to sound the public as to its sentiment in the matter of placing parochial schools on an equal footing with the public schools as objects of State support. The circular makes its arguments not for Roman Catholic parochial schools alone, but for all denominational schools. High Protestant authority is quoted to show the great benefits to be derived from teaching religion in the public schools. The system of education in vogue in England, Ireland, Canada, Austria, Prussia, and the German States, is also cited as combining State and denominational schools supported by public funds, and is asserted to be thought preferable in those countries to any other system.

The circular is a very subtle and specious example of special pleading. These paragraphs will show the course of thought followed:—

Since it is considered by all that religion is an essential element of civilization and the bulwark of civil government, we consider that the State, in its educational system, should have regard for the right of parents, and accord to them the religious freedom guaranteed by the Constitution. As the law now stands, parents who prefer parochial schools as places of education for their children are deprived of the benefit of their taxes as far as educating their own offspring is helped by them. They are also led from motives of charity to educate the poor of their denomination; this three-fold tax is very onerous.

Furthermore, the system of education which the State adopts, presents to our minds a grievance very much to be deplored, the absence of religion in the public schools.

We wish it to be understood that it is not our purpose to interfere with the public schools—we only desire such a modification of the present common school system, so that the conscience of parents be respected, and that the State sees that evenhanded justice be done to all citizens, that none be taxed without deriving therefrom a corresponding benefit, and thus public blessings may be commensurate with public burdens.

We are persuaded that the above modifications, by extending the school system to all schools under the auspices of the various religious denominations, and thus increasing the number of public scholars many thousands in Baltimore alone, would rather strengthen and render more popular and useful the common school system than in any wise impair or hurt it.

It seems evident that a very thorough experiment is to be made in the State of Maryland to test public opinion on this question, and see whether the entering point of the wedge cannot be driven there. It is interesting to see with what marvellous subtlety the ideas of religious freedom and of equitable taxation are turned from their just and natural uses to enforce and support an erroneous application of the principles for which they stand. This circular is distinctively and peculiarly characteristic of the dialectic skill and intellectual craftiness of Rome, and may deceive many into thinking its positions very broad and liberal and generous. It is noticeable that the same privileges are asked for other denominational schools as for Roman Catholic schools; this can be pointed to as an example of great fairness and as an exhibition of almost unexampled generosity and forbearance in doing good to those who are despitefully using them in this regard. But really the Roman Catholic Church, in thus assisting those who are opposing it selfishly and from mistaken motives, would be really in the end doing itself service, and no doubt this fact is realized at the fountain head from which all its movements issue.
