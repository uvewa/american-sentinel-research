We print side by side two Thanksgiving proclamations, one by the President of the United States, the other by officers of the General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church:

### A PROCLAMATION.

While the American people should every day remember with praise and thanksgiving the divine goodness and mercy which have followed them since their beginning as a Nation, it is fitting that one day in each year should be especially devoted to the contemplation of the blessings we have received from the hand of God, and to the grateful acknowledgment of his loving kindness.

Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do hereby designate and set apart Thursday, the 30th day of the present month of November, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to be kept and observed by all the people of our land. On that day let us forego our ordinary work and employments and assemble in our usual places of worship, where no may recall all that God has done for us, and where from grateful hearts our united tribute of praise and song may reach the Throne of Grace. Let the reunion of kindred and the social meeting of friends lend cheer and enjoyment to the day, and let generous gifts of charity for the relief of the poor and needy prove the sincerity of our thanksgiving.

Witness my hand and the seal of the United States, which I have caused to be hereto affixed. Done at the city of Washington on the third day of November, in

### THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION.

To the ministers, elders, and people of the United Presbyterian Church:

In accordance with the action of the thirty-fifth General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church, we, the officers of said Assembly, do hereby call upon you to lay aside all secular business on the 30th day of November, 1893, and observe that day as a day of thanksgiving, to assemble in your respective places of worship, and give that united, outward, formal expression of sincere, heartfelt gratitude to the Trinne God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, and by the Holy Spirit, which is due to his great name for the innumerable blessings conferred on us as a Nation, as families and as individuals during the past year. The preservation of our peace with all the nations, and of our shores from the threatened invasion of the pestilence, the restraint put upon the passions of men, so that we have been preserved from serious outbreaks, notwithstanding the hundreds of thousands out of employment by reason of the financial troubles which have come upon us, bountiful harvests, and the progress made in social and moral reforms, are all suggestive. Thanks are due and should be gratefully rendered for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, and for the chief things put forth by the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, and for the precious things of the earth and the fullness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwell in the bush."

By order of General Assembly,
Jan. SHOCK,
Moderator.

We J. Reid,
Principal Clerk.

year of our Lord eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and eighteenth.

By the President:
George Cleveland.
WALTER Q. GREGHAM,
Secretary of State.

It will be observed that one of these proclamations emanates from the civil authority; the other, from an ecclesiastical authority, yet they alike enjoin religious observance. The officers of the United Presbyterian Church say to their people we "do hereby call upon you to lay aside all secular business on the 30th day of November, 1893, and observe that day as a day of thanksgiving, to assemble in your respective places of worship," etc. The President says, "I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do hereby designate and set apart Thursday, the 30th day of the present month of November, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to be kept by all the people of our land. On that day let us forego our ordinary work and employments and assemble in our usual places of worship."

In the essential points the intent, and even the language of the two proclamations is almost identical. They both enjoin acts of religious worship. But by what right does the President of the United States thus exercise ecclesiastical functions?
