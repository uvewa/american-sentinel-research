The Rev. Mr. Day, Secretary of the Indiana branch of the American Sabbath Union, recently delivered in Monticello, Indiana, a lecture which he boasted had been delivered three thousand times, in the State, to as many as three hundred thousand people. He declared his purpose to be to educate the people to a better observance of Sunday and secure the cooperation of all in the work of its enforcement.

The abstract theory of Sabbath observance which the speaker presented was excellent. He properly made the fourth commandment the basis of argument, and said truly,—"The Sabbath movement is one of the most momentous movements of the day. It is the paramount question before the American people. It is greater than the temperance question. The fourth commandment is just as binding on us as on any generation in any age of time. We cannot set it aside any more than we can the first, or third, or sixth commandments, neither can we keep it in spirit and not keep it in letter."

He immediately attempted to show, however, that the fourth commandment is indefinite as to the day that should be observed, and that the observance of one seventh part of time is all that is required. This was emphasized, and yet it was lamented that all could not agree on the same day to save "confusion," and the "disorganization of society." This would make God the author of confusion, and lay upon man the duty of rectifying the defect in the commandment and name the day which God had neglected to specify. In doing this, the speaker held, the minority should yield to the majority, and, as there are forty millions of people in the United States, to-day, that believe in keeping the "Christian" Sabbath, so all ought to harmonize in the observance of that day. How could it be possible to make language more explicit than it is in the fourth commandment? "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," yet, in the face of this positive and emphatic declaration, men professing to be guided by the word of God will stultify themselves by bolstering up, with fabricated arguments, doctrines which are entirely unknown to the Bible.

When President Jackson vetoed the bill to charter the United States Bank in 1832, he asserted that every public officer had a right to interpret the Constitution as he pleased, and was only sworn to defend it as he understood it.

To this Henry Clay made reply as follows:—

No one swears to support it as he understands it, but to support it simply in truth. All men are bound to obey the laws, . . . but must they obey them as they are, or as they understand them?

If the party were bound to obey the Constitution, only as he understands it, what would be the consequence? There would be general disorder and confusion, throughout every branch of administration, from the highest to the lowest—universal nullification.*

Still more forcible are the words of Paul, when he says, "We thank God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth." 1 These, 2:13.

Men will, however, take more liberties with the words of God than they would dare take with those of men. The fourth commandment, as it is in fact, faces these advocates of Sunday legislation.

The position of Seventh-day Adventists was very honestly stated, in that it was said that they are opposed to the legal enforcement of the observance of any day of rest. Mr. Day's vocabulary was exhausted, however, when he undertook to answer Adventists on the Sabbath question. But he truthfully said:—"The Sabbath is in no sense a Jewish institution. It had its origin many hundred years before a Jew was born. Read Gen. 2:2, 3, and you will find that it originated with creation itself. However, he immediately contradicted himself by asserting that "we have the Christian Sabbath"; that no man can tell which is the right day; that one seventh part of time is all that is required; that all cannot keep the same day from the fact that the world is round, and those on the opposite side of the globe would be keeping a different day. It did not seem to matter that these arguments were as forcible against first day observance as against the true Sabbath,—and that each proposition asserted was more or less in conflict with the others, and in flagrant contradiction to the letter of the fourth commandment. If the Sabbath was in no sense "Jewish," where is the authority for calling it "Christian"? The commandment speaks of it as the "Sabbath of the Lord thy God." All such names as "Jewish," "Christian," "American," etc., are human inventions. Mr. Day failed to inform his audience how it was possible to always know when the first day of the week comes and not know the seventh. He also failed to give any authority for a change. The Bible knows no such change. The only weekly Sabbath known to it is the seventh day or Saturday, and any teaching to the contrary is not the truth."

* Life of Henry Clay, p. 157.

More than this, the speaker was not in ignorance as to who has sought to change the Sabbath. He merely denied the facts of history, presumably not fearing contradiction.

The fact that the Bible is as silent as the dead in regard to first day observance leads the honest in heart to a skeptical position on Sunday observance, and it is an old time maxim that false theories must be bolstered up by compulsory laws. The speaker appealed to the word of God,—and asked his congregation to correct him should he speak contrary to it. Yet the position he took was in direct conflict with it.

The use of the fourth commandment to sustain a Roman, pagan Sunday is enough to bring the judgments of heaven upon us. Sunday rest, enjoined by Constantine, a pagan emperor, upon his pagan subjects in 321, afterwards taken up by the apostate Catholic Church and ingrafted by compulsory law into established usage is in these last days to be, as a "mark of the beast," enforced by apostate Protestantism and will be the sign manual in the right hands or foreheads of all those who love the traditions of Romanism more than they do the literal word of God. Rev. 13:11-17.

Mr. Day said many truthful things in regard to the apostasy of Protestant churches, but seemed to think Sunday laws were necessary to hold their own members, even some of their ministers, to Christian duties; riding on trains, buying groceries, reading the Sunday newspapers, etc., were denounced in the bitterest terms. Several incidents were related showing why railroad men should have the law to secure them the privilege of becoming Christians, attending church, etc.; incidents of railroad accidents occurring on Sunday which were attributed to violation of the Sabbath law, were also related. Such arguments are folly to the reader of statistics who knows that as many or more accidents occur on other days of the week, proportionately, as on Sunday, and that Seventh-day Adventists and other Sabbatarians will give up good positions, and make heavy sacrifices, for the truth's sake, obeying their sense of right without the aid of law. But false theories must be supported by "our Father which art in the legislature," to which advocates of enforced Sunday observance are now directing their petitions.

The faithful keeper of the commandments of God, in the face of Mr. Day's lecture, could say with the Apostle Paul, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom. 1:16.

It needs no power of man or legislative act to bring man to Christ or convert him to keep the Sabbath of the Lord when once his heart has been touched with the true spirit of obedience.
