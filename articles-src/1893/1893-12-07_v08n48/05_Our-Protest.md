On behalf of all mankind this protest is made to the enforcement of so-called "Sabbath laws," by which ordinary labor on any particular day of the week is made a crime to be punished by fine or imprisonment.

The opportunity in itself is good. Legislation is not because the wrong day may be selected for such a day, nor because any day in this is obligatory is itself as a greeting, as to which day at the week should be kept. The question of whether or not the State should enforce Sunday observance or Saturday observance, is not the issue of our present discussion. Men may differ as to whether the seventh day or the first day is the true Sabbath, but this is not a subject for settlement in the present discussion. Neither is it the object of this paper to destroy reverence for the Sabbath. On the contrary those views are held by many who hold that most sacred respect for the Sabbath. Therefore, let no one mistake the object of this paper; it is not Shall the Sabbath or the Sabbath observance of any kind, in any degree, on any day, upon any person? We answer with an emphatical no, and give reason and argument.

Sabbath-keeping is a matter of religion. It is an observance that rises far above the moral law. It is held to be a memorial of the creation and the very heart and part of the gospel. Not only is it called the "Sabbath of the Lord thy God," the day on which God rested from the work of creation, but it is also the Lord's "holy day" and other names to designate a holy institution for a holy purpose. Every reference to the Sabbath is based on the idea of a special sacredness. This is equivalent to saying that religious motives lie at, and they rest upon religion, the gospel will have more power to save men when supported by the State. Laws were never designed for the repression or oppression of the strong; therefore any statute that proposes to enact a decree that evil men are stronger than the government must enact laws to restrain from inflicting injury upon it. Thus the State can only protect the weak from evil, insisting that men have more power than the man expect to be saved by the gospel. Can he be freed from crime by restraining thinking weaker than ourselves? In a gospel that is unable to be, to withstand sin and the mastery over him? Who can have any confidence in a Christ that admits that must be supported by those it professes to save? Any man who wants the State to protect religion, thereby declares that religion is too weak to stand by religion to save the State. The gospel, not Jesus Christ, becomes the saviour. He looks to the State to know his duty in religion instead of the God he tells his the only authority in such matters. The power of God. "Rom. 1:16." And again, Christ said, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." Matt. 28:18. Can any power be added to "all power in heaven and earth?" Whence then comes "the power of God?" Is it not presumption to attempt to add to the power of God by human enactment? "Because the weakness of God is stronger than men." 1 Cor. 1:25. If the weakness of God is stronger than men, certainly the gospel is stronger than men, for it is the

power of God to his power. To regard the gospel as anything less than the power of God, able to save unto the uttermost, is to deny that gospel and the God of the gospel. Such a thing is not only preposterous and absurd, but it is the sin of the present day: "Having a form of Godliness, but denying the power thereof." Is not this fulfilled when Protestant Christians demand of the Nation and States laws to compel other Christians to keep Sunday? What shall be said for those mistaken Christians, or those not Christians, who demand that the State make and enforce Sunday laws? What is it but a denial that the gospel of Jesus Christ, armed with the power of God, is sufficient? This is a dangerous venture for the power of God? Do the professed followers of Christ really think that Christ with extended arms to save the world is a "another gospel," backed by another apostle, is much more is needed? Are they willing to let the sinfulness make the people religious. But here is voluntary obedience of those who choose to worship the true God in his own way, or in baptism in the God's supper to obey, or that they are to be coerced into it by human legislation in matters of religion?

Underneath Sunday laws is opposed to the power of God through Jesus Christ. Let us now look at some of the vicious fruit of enforced Sunday observance. Some of these might be made to the "Dark Ages" was the Government and the Church united? When civil ruler was carried to its greatest extreme, and the voice of the martyr, saints, and in the torture-chamber. All of these were sanctioned by the religious State, and laws which make the people religious. But here is the power of that same religion when it meets the aid of the State. The world over evil men will take advantage of laws as instruments to harass, plunder, and persecute until a false spirit of power, and, in God's name, they did things that were worse than now; the trouble was they did not have the means of inflicting as much persecution as now. In the name of Christ, and so looked to the State for aid, and, with the power of the State, began the fiercest persecutions of others. And all this while in the name of Christ. The church of Christ and anxious only for the salvation of sinners. But the gospel was planted in the New World by the ministers of Christ. The Pilgrim Fathers, the Baptists and Wicklies were persecuted, and many more who were devout lovers of the Lord and his word, and who have led in abolishing in their blind prejudice. From this time the civil authority, more or less modified, have found their way into the legislation of many of the States of the Union. For some time public sentiment condemned such statues. The enforcement of these unused laws against quiet, peaceable, industrious citizens has also attracted the national and State Constitutions, and every lover of justice. The Church has been left comparatively free from this God-dishonoring legislation; but now the spirit of intolerance has come across the gospel has far fear seems to me and so dishonest to the cause of Christ as any addition to this dishonor to his fairness. In this way it is demonstrated that Christianity itself must thrive best when each is independent of the other—gospel in the church, and hoped that never again would the Church be brought under the domination of the State religion, and that the State, of solicited to maintain religion by human enactment and law and appeal. But alas! the last few years
