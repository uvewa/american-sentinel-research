The late National Reform Convention at Allegheny embraced a large number of themes, and its utterances on Temperance, Social Purity, Divorce Reform, the Labor Question, the Negro Question, the Chinese Exclusion Legislation, etc., were worthy of high commendation.

But the supreme question in the convention was Sunday observance. Its "Statement and Principles" declared as follows:—

Fourth.—That one of the most prominent of national moral questions at this time demanding prompt and right settlement is the relation of our Nation and Government to the Sabbath. We note the following momentous facts in the present attitude of our Nation to the Lord's day: 1. The act of Congress, in connection with an appropriation to the World's Fair, honored the Sabbath. 2. When a determined effort was made to repeal this act, Congress deliberately and firmly maintained it. 3. This was in harmony with the Sabbath laws of nearly all our States, and with the sentiment of the great majority of Christian citizens, about 25,000,000, of whom expressed the Sabbath sentiment of the country in meetings and petitions to Congress. And yet, 4. All this was not enough to prevent the United States Circuit Court and two county courts of one of our States from defeating the will of Congress and of the Christian people of the country. And, 5. This defeat of Sabbath sentiment and congressional action was, on the other hand, in harmony with the great tide of Sabbath-breaking amusements and Sabbath-breaking traffic, especially by great railway corporations, and newspaper companies, and the United States mail. This divided and opposing condition as to the Sabbath law cannot continue. As President Lincoln said of slavery, so it must be said of the Sabbath here: "Our Nation cannot continue to be both for and against it. It must become wholly the one or the other." As our Nation in that struggle in Lincoln's day put itself in right relation to Christ's law against slavery, so to-day we call upon it to put itself in right relation to the Sabbath which was made for man, and thus also to Him who is therefore Lord of the Sabbath.

Although compelled thus to chronicle the utter defeat of the efforts to accomplish a better state of things concerning Sunday, through congressional action, several speakers in the convention dwelt at length upon the "recent victories for Sunday," as shown in matters connected with the World's Fair. Nothing less than blind persistency would insist upon calling such repeated defeats "recent victories." We admire faith and optimism, but when optimism calls black, white, it seems a little like the small boy's clinching argument, "If it is not so, it is so, because my mother says it is so." If the quotation given above from the manifesto of the convention be true, as it certainly is, it is more than a farce to call such a state of things victories for Sunday. The wall of defeat is not the shout of victory.

But the practical and significant point in the utterances of the convention is found in the last item, which reads as follows:—

Fifteenth.—That we request the executive committee of the National Reform Association to send one or more agents to Washington to press at every opportune time, in cooperation with agents of other kindred reform organizations, any such bill or bills as may be before Congress in defense of our public schools, for the investigation or supression of the drink traffic, or for divorce or any other Christian reform; that the committee labor as far as possible for the enactment of a national Sabbath law, and for the promotion of such an amendment to the national Constitution as will justify beyond all peradventure the declaration of our Supreme Court that "this is a Christian Nation;" and that in aid of this practical work the members of this convention pledge their active, prayerful, and financial aid.

The purpose to besiege Congress vehemently and persistently until a national Sunday law is obtained was announced many times during the convention, and strenuous appeals for funds to prosecute the work of "Christian lobbyists" were heard at every session. The future of the National Reform movement is closely allied to this phase of "practical politics." Up to this time the advocates of this movement have been looked upon as "harmless cranks." Its success has not been probable enough to awaken much attention or much opposition. If the proposed efforts to be made at Washington should be pushed, and if some complication touching "party issues" should arise, the movement may be deemed worthy of some definite opposition and of some definite support as a political movement. This has not been the case up to date. The average congressman cares for "reform" only as it aids politics.
