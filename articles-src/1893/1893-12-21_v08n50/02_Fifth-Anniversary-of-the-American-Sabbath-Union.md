On December 10, 11, and 12, the American Sabbath Union celebrated its fifth anniversary, at the Marble Collegiate Church, on Fifth Avenue, in this city. Sunday, December 10, Rev. H. P. Birrell, pastor of the church, delivered the annual sermon. The sermon, worship, and sermons delivered in Dr. Birrell's usual rhetorical and oratorical style, was remarkable for its cautious position at the same time. If many of its statements, if taken in good earnest and carried to their legitimate formulation for the cause for which he pleaded. In his opening the preacher began was made that man might respect the day that Christ observed, and to its close reminded the sermon it was declared with much assurance that necessarily Christians are on the sixth day, and that we rest on the seventh day, and that we rest on the seventh day was to land and uphold the influence of an organization which has been for five years putting forth every effort and using every means to accomplish the end. He stated the purpose of the cause being to be to "preserve" the Christian Sabbath," and used as a text to support the Sabbath the fourth commandment, a chapter of Ezekiel, which begins, "Thus saith the Lord."

Newman, Secretary Stevens of the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, whose subject, "Provincial Ministers," had the most considerable honor as significant as coming from the chief representative of an organization which stands as the strongest organized opponent of every departure of Church and State.

At one of the public meetings held in the battle against the Sunday newspaper, resolutions were offered calling upon them three again each to have their said opinion in the deadening of the public conscience about the Sunday, and these resolutions were taken to perfect, enlarge, and strengthen the organization of the American Sabbath Union, and suggestions were made for the better organization for increasing the service of the society for popular ministry of the country.

The attendance at the anniversary meetings was small,—ranging from forty to sixty people. There were present who were but an earnest of the lejoice of the character that inspired the lovers who heartily support the cause of the American Sabbath Union. Their resolutions were
