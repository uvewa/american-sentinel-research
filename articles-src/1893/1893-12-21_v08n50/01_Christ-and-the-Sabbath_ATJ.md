JESUS CHRIST was persecuted because he did not keep the Sabbath to suit the Pharisees, the scribes, and the priests.

Christ was not only persecuted, but he was rejected, and a robber and murderer was chosen in his place; and he was crucified, because he would not keep the Sabbath to suit the Pharisees, the scribes, and the priests.

Christ, the Lord of the Sabbath, the one to be ever be worshiped as a Sabbathbreaker, was spied upon, was persecuted, was rejected, a robber and murderer was chosen in his stead, and was crucified, because he would not conform to the narrow, bigoted ideas of the Sabbath held by the Pharisees, scribes and priests, and all their following.

All this is worthy of peculiar attention in every way, just when the Pharisees now, the scribes, the chief priests, the hypocrites, and the doctors of the law, are making such a great ado over the Sabbath question, and are spying about for "Sabbath-breaking," who are actually Sabbath-keeping, according to the plainest word of the Son of God, and according to the whole life's example of Jesus Christ himself.

The first year and a half of the Saviour's ministry did not arouse much antagonistic attention from the church leaders and the other authorities. During this time their attention was that of curiosity to know what his work was to amount to. As he had not come in the worldly pomp and kingly power which their selfish designs had pictured, and as his did in no other way show signs of developing into it, they counted him as nothing, and expected to see his influence fade away and of course to naught.

*But, although* indulged in an outwardly empty show, and made no attempt to draw attention to himself, and always spoke in the quietest, simplest way, there was a power that attended his ministry which held the minds and hearts of the people, and which they readily contrasted with the words of the scribes; for "his word was with power," and "he taught as one having authority and not as the scribes." And, instead of the leading and other church leaders seeing his influence and work fade away, they saw it steadily increase and grow so that it even began to threaten their own influence with the people. Then they began their criticism.

It was at the end of the first eighteen months of his public ministry, when the man who was sick of the palsy, was let down through the tiling and was forgiven his sins and instantly restored by Christ's word, and was bidden to take up his bed and walk. "There were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem," and they moreover "began to reason" and to "question." Mark 2:1-12; Matt. 9:1-8; and Luke 5:17-26. Very shortly after this, however, at Jerusalem, he restored the man at the pool of Bethesda, who had been impotent thirty-eight years, and bade him also to take up his bed and walk. But one of the Sabbath day when this was done, and "the Jews therefore said unto him that was cured: It is the Sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed and walk." They asked who he was, and the man could not tell. Afterward, however, the man met Jesus in the temple and recognized him, and went and told the inquirers that it was Jesus who had made him whole, and therefore the one who had told him to carry his bed, and both on the Sabbath day. "And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day. But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto and I work." Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the Sabbath, but said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God." John 5:1-18.

As Christ is Lord of the Sabbath, He made it. He is the one whose power it commemorates. He is the one whom it brings to the mind of the Sabbath-keeper. It was literally impossible for Jesus to break the Sabbath, the Sabbath being the sign of what he is, and that men may know that it is he. Whatever therefore he did in reference to the Sabbath was in itself Sabbath-keeping, and could not possibly be anything else. His Sabbathkeeping was perfect, and in its fullness God's idea of Sabbath-keeping, and was itself perfect righteousness. The Pharisees' idea of the Sabbath was wrong because it did not comport with their ideas of the Sabbath, and demanded that the Lord should alter *his* actions and adopt their ideas of the Sabbath. The question, therefore, is first, not only whether the Lord's or man's idea of the Sabbath should prevail; but whether the Lord's idea of the Sabbath was to reject the Sabbath itself, and this was to reject the Lord himself. And they hung their clog to their own views against him, this was to decide themselves, and was by him left to settle themselves for him, and it was left to put him to death. John 11:45-53.

Jesus went on in his blessed work, and the Pharisees followed with their accusations. At last he raised Lazarus from the dead, and "many of the Jews therefore which came to Jesus" and "immediately believed on Jesus" and immediately "some of them went and carried to the Pharisees." "Then gathered the chief priests and Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. . . . If we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. And one of them named Caiaphas, . . . being high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, that the whole nation perish not. . . . Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. John 11:45-53.

Their self-convicting and self-justifying charge was "Sabbath-breaking." He had personally disregarded the Sabbath. He was a confirmed Sabbath-breaker. He was an avowed Sabbath-breaker. There was no excuse. And he is gracious and willing to forgive all who honestly and sincerely believe on him if things are suffered to go in this way everybody will become believers, will all become, from his teaching and example, Sabbath-breakers; and then the Sabbath will go, and the knowledge of God will depart. This will make a revolution of all things, and all the forces of God will fall upon the land, and the nation itself will be destroyed. Therefore this man must die. In that resolution they did the Sabbath before and swept all the people into the train. And the culmination of the depends upon the idea of the possession of some of the heads of wheat, and the wheat in their land and also them; as far, for they were hungry. Then the Pharisees said at once to him: "Why do thy disciples that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day?"

"The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath day." And if I, the Lord of the Sabbath, will I have mercy and not sacrifice, would not have condemned the guiltless. "Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days."

They tried, if not on the same day, the next day, about the same thing. At that time Jesus went into the synagogue and taught, and there was a man there which had his hand withered. And the Pharisees narrowly watched Jesus to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day that they might accuse him.

Jesus knew their thoughts and their purpose, and as though to make the thing as open as possible, he said to the man with the withered hand, "Stand forth in the midst." The man stepped out, and there every eye in the synagogue was fixed on him. Then Jesus said to the Pharisees, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life or to kill?" They could make no answer. He looked round about on them. "Stretch forth thine hand." "And he stretched it out." "And his hand was restored whole as the other."

Then the Pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. Matt. 12:1-14; Mark 2:23 to 3:6; Luke 6:1-11.

THEN, of course, the Herodians, as tax gatherers naturally as well as through their party industry, were the representatives of the family of Herod. They were a political party. They were also a religious party for they always sought a compromise between the Romans and the Jews. As the Herods were dependent on Rome for their office and power, and Herod held his place as governor of Judea from the Roman Senate led by Mark Antony, the real base of the governmental authority of Rome was the support of the house of Herod and their following. These, ever resentful of the Roman power and constantly guilty under the Roman yoke, political grounds, the occasion was found in the Herodians. But their hatred of Jesus, and their determination to destroy his heretical views and practices on the Sabbath question were so great as to lead them to forget all differences and distinctions of either a sectarian or a political nature, to compromise their principles with their sectarian enemies to further their designs against him; to enter into an alliance with the Herodians also explains the readiness with which the Pharisees finally secured the co-operation of Herod and Pilate in completely carrying out their more corrupt purposes against Jesus.

AGAIN, at the feast of tabernacles, Jesus said to the Jews, "Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision . . . and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man. If a man on the Sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day?" "Then they sought to take him; but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. And many of the people believed on him and said, When Christ shall come, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him." "Then said Jesus, Yet a little while am I with you." "The officers therefore came and said, Never man spake like this man." "Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed." And in their angry and they went to judge and condemn their prey right there, without any hearing, but Nicodemus put a check upon the proceedings for the time. "Doth our law judge any man before it hear him, and know what he doeth?" "The assembly broke up and every man went unto his own house." But Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives. And early in the morning he came again into the temple. The scribes went on with their wicked plotting against him, and it was found that the enemies were allying themselves to political power, to hold out against him, but while they were putting their trust in earthly arms, he was holding his trust in God.

SHORTLY afterward he met the man who had been born blind, and anointed his eyes and told him to go and wash in the pool of Siloam, and the man went and washed and came seeing. "The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him," and others brought to the Pharisees him who before was blind, and it was given him. "And it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. Then again also said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath day." John 9:14-16.

AGAIN: "He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. And behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day." "The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?" "And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him." Luke 13:10-17.

AGAIN. "As he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath day, they watched him. And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day? And they could not answer him again to these things."

Every time they watched to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath day, they saw just what they were looking for, and that was just exactly what they expected. There was no mistaking it. Nor did he ever make any pretence of hiding it; nor did he ever attempt to prove that what he did could not have "desecrated" anybody.

But the Sabbath course of the Saviour was in every instance that of the man of sin. These, too, to this day, the men of it accomplish their purpose upon the governmental authority—they demand their ruin, like men of old did upon Pilate. And to-day, in many parts of the land, these Pharisees are persecuting those who maintain the Lord's idea of the Sabbath, as expressed in his own words, just as those Pharisees then did Jesus for doing the same thing. To-day these Pharisees are watching, and spying upon those who keep the Lord to God's idea of the Sabbath, just as were these back yonder watching Jesus and spying upon him for the same thing. To-day these Pharisees are doing all they can to get others to adopt only these Pharisees' idea of the Sabbath and adopt the same means to enforce it upon all men of sin, as did those Pharisees back in the early times.

And we are more happy to know, and to have these Pharisees find out, that there are some people so much like Jesus, that when they are persecuted to get them to yield to the Lord's—or rather to adopt the Pharisees'—man's, they will not do it. We are glad to find this out, because it is we who are those who are so much like Jesus, that when they are conforming strictly to God's idea of the Sabbath, and are therefore dubbed Sabbath-keepers, they are yet persecuted and prosecuted as Sabbath-breakers. And we are especially glad to know that the same glorious story is being repeated when the Pharisees of to-day go sneaking around hunting up people to spy upon and persecute, and when they find these latter day Jesus, them see just what they are watching for, and there is nothing else for them to do but just what they see him do when they watched Jesus. And we sincerely trust that these people still will be so much like Jesus that they will offer no compromise, that they will make no attempt to compromise or yield one hair's breadth of their allegiance to God's idea of the Sabbath, or to adopt to that extent even the idea of the Sabbath, in the place of the Lord's, or even side by side with the Lord's. For to put man's idea on an equality with the Lord's, is really to put it above that of the Lord's. Of the Sabbath keeping as well as of all else, it must stand as it was when the true people of God became so bewildered with the cry of the enemies of Christ that they refrained from labor also on the Sunday.—*Great Controversy, Vol. IV.*

God forbid that any of the true people of God shall so depart from God and from the truth as to come to even so much as withstand as this! No. Far better be like the Lord Jesus, who in the matter of the Sabbath, then as live by comparison with the lies and denunciation of the Pharisees and Pharisaism, backed up by bold, Herod politically.
