On December 10, 11, and 12, the American Sabbath Union celebrated its fifth anniversary, at the Marble Collegiate Church, on Fifth avenue, in this city. Sunday, December 10, Rev. D. J. Burrell, pastor of the church, delivered the anniversary sermon. The sermon, though delivered in Dr. Burrell's usual rhetorical and oratorical style, was remarkable for its lack of logic, and in the fact that so many of his statements, if taken in good faith, would have overthrown from its foundations the cause for which he pleaded. In his opening prayer the plea was made that man might respect the day that Christ observed, and in the course of the sermon it was declared with much earnestness that Christ rested on the seventh day, and that we rest on the seventh day; and yet the whole intent of the discourse was to laud and uphold the work of an organization which has been for five years putting forth every effort to compel the observance of the first day. He stated the purpose of the Sabbath Union to be to "preserve the American Sabbath," and used as a text to support this the twelfth verse of the twentieth chapter of Ezekiel, which begins, "Moreover I gave them also my Sabbaths," and continues,—"to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."

Whenever God has made a covenant with his people, said Dr. Burrell, he has set a sign of it; the bow of promise, that he would not again destroy the earth by flood; the paschal lamb, as a sign by which to remember that they had been led up out of Egypt, and that One would come to lead them out again; and the Sabbath as a token that if they kept it they should live, and if they failed to keep it they should die.

But Dr. Burrell failed to show that there was any relation between the "American Sabbath," the first day, for which he spoke, and God's Sabbath, the seventh day, which he set as a perpetual remembrance of himself, that thus, retaining him in their hearts, his people might live and not die.

The doctor denied that this country had any national establishment, but declared in the same breath that this country had a nationally established rest-day, and by God's grace always would have. The American "Sabbath" is not ecclesiastical, but it is a "religious fact," and the proof of this is that "in 1892 it was solemnly decided that this is 'a Christian Nation.'"

With the rhetorical and elocutionary grace of the practised pulpit orator, Dr. Burrell poured forth for an hour such contradictory statements as these, and held his audience apparently in "spell bound" ignorance of his errors either of fact or reasoning.

At the public meetings addresses were delivered, and papers read, by Rev. Drs. J. H. Knowles, T. A. Fernley, T. L. Cuyler, C. H. Payne, W. W. Atterbury, A. H. Plumb, Charles L. Thompson, and J. M. King, Secretary of the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, whose subject, "Provolential Mission of the American Sabbath Union," was significant as coming from the chief representative of an organization which poses before the country as standing for the separation of Church and State.

The great burden of the meeting was the battle against the Sunday newspaper. All the evil and moral disorders prevalent throughout the country were over and over again declared to have their origin in the deadening of the public conscience through Sunday newspapers. Measures were taken to perfect, enlarge, and strengthen the organization of the American Sabbath Union, and suggestions were made, which, if carried out, will draft into the service of the society the entire popular ministry of the country.

The attendance at these anniversary meetings was small,—ranging from forty to one hundred,—yet those gathered there were but an earnest of the legions of the clergy throughout the country who heartily support the cause of the American Sabbath Union. Their cooperation will be insisted upon; it will be received,— and through them the people, by congregations, will be coerced. It is a great scheme. It will succeed,—until that terrible hour when, at Christ's second coming, the eyes of men will be opened to see all things and themselves as they are.

W. H. M.
