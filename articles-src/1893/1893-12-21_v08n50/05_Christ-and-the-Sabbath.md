CHRIST, as has been shown, was the agent through whom God created all things, visible and invisible. He is also the agent through whom the plan of redemption is carried out. And this comes in very naturally when we remember that redemption is only creation. Just two or three texts upon that point. In Eph. 2:10 we read: "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works." That is, redemption is creation, and Christ is the agent. So we have the scripture in 2 Cor. 5:17: "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature," says the common version; the Revised Version suggests the marginal reading, "there is a new creation." So also in Gal. 6:15 the same expression occurs: "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision, availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature." And again is suggested the reading, "a new creation."

So Christ is the agent in the creation of the world; he is also the agent in our recreation, which is redemption. Some texts from the Old Testament will show that this is no new idea, and that this is not particularly a New Testament teaching: "But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not; for I have redeemed thee." Isa. 43:1. The One who creates is the One who redeems, and redemption is simply creation over again. In another sense, it is simply carrying on God's plan of creation; it is simply finishing up the work which he began in the first place, in creating man in his image. It is that the image of God may be restored in the soul. That is what redemption is. So God carries forward during the time of probation the work of creation by creating us anew in Christ Jesus. Therefore redemption is creation, and the Lord, the Creator, is our Saviour. (See also Isa. 43:11, 44:21, 22.) The One who created, the One who formed, is the One who redeems. And note in connection with that the creative power is necessary for redemption. He who can create can redeem. He who can redeem can create. But the one who cannot create cannot redeem. This is, in fact, the very point that the Lord makes against all false gods in his challenge in Isa. 45:20-22: "Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations; they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save. Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together; who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the Lord? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else." Angels could not redeem because angels have not creative power. It is a mark of divinity; wherever you find divinity, there you find creative power, and that is redeeming power. That is to say, putting it in another way, we have the manifestation of the power of God in creating all things about us, and in redemption. It is all an illustration of the power of God.

Notice how closely this idea is associated with Christ, as we read again in 1 Cor. 1:24: "But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God." So in the creation of all things, visible and invisible, and in the plan of redemption, in the redeeming of those who put their trust in him, we have an expression to the world of the power of God. And Christ, through whom this whole expression is made, is called the power of God. What is the purpose of this display of the power of God that we see about us? What purpose ought every created thing to serve? We are taught this in Rom. 1:20: "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead," or, as the Revised Version renders it, "even his everlasting power and divinity."

What purpose, then, ought every created thing to serve, everything that can be seen?—It is that we may behold the power of God. And what is the purpose that our attention should thus be called to the power of God?—It is that we may believe in his power for creating the things not seen. We see the material universe. We look up and the heavens declare the glory of God. But the purpose of it all is that we may be reminded, whichever way we turn, whatever object we see, that the power of God is there, and that the power that created these things is the power pledged for the salvation of every one who believes in Jesus Christ.

Do not pass lightly by that point. Make it practical in daily experience. You cannot open your eyes in any direction that you do not see some indications of the power of God. Remember that everything speaks of the power of God, reminds us that the same power which created these things is pledged to us; remember when you see the heavens that they declare the glory of God, and remind you of his power, and that the same power which holds these things in their places is the power which is promised to hold you in your place; that, if God has raised you up to sit in heavenly places with Christ Jesus, his power is sufficient to keep you there: "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling."

But have we nothing further to tell us of God? It is true that the heavens, that every created thing that we see, testify to us of the everlasting power and the divinity of God, but have we nothing which is a further sign to us of the power of God in redemption?—Indeed we have. It is very interesting to notice that there have been set up at different times signs to remind the people of God's dealings, as, for instance, when the people came through Jordan by the hand of God, Joshua set up a pillar as a memorial of the power of God in dividing the waters, that they might go through on dry land.
