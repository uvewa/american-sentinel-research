On another page (397) we publish an article on the "Separation between Church and State," by Rev. Dr. MacArthur, of the Calvary Baptist Church, in this city.

Doctor MacArthur writes as a Baptist, and claims much for the denomination; but to that point the people is mentally in question. For continue the Baptists were, under God, almost the sole defenders of religious liberty; and to them the people of the United States are largely indebted for the freedom hitherto enjoyed in this land in matters of conscience and of worship.

But while it is true that Baptists have in the past stood stiffly for Religious liberty, it is equally true that within a few years the mass of Baptist have, in some respects, proved recreant to their principles, and have with other Protestants, formulated for governmental support of religious institutions. Doctor MacArthur himself is himself prominent in the American Sabbath Union, an organization which has done more than any other to secure national recognition of Sunday as "the American Sabbath."

This body is not only a religious institution, but it is an ecclesiastical institution, and of demands that made in its behalf by the united churches under the lead of the American Sabbath Union which said that a few years ago in Chicago that was not permitted the joint crusade of the Papists on State funds, in behalf of their denominational schools. The Papists do not ask for aid for their schools, but that only that there shall be an equitable distribution of school funds for the purpose of carrying out the instruction coming up to the requirements of the State, whether Protestant or papal. This is simply inviting Protestants to a concerted action in the matter of school funds for the mutual benefit of a crusade on the general Government in behalf of the Sunday institution. Consistent denominations of the Baptist opposition to Sunday legislation as well as to all other State interference in religious matters.

But whether consistent or not, Doctor MacArthur says some excellent things. One paragraph alone fully justifies the position of those who have gone to prison rather than deny their faith by observing a false and counterfeit Sabbath. "The early Christians," says the doctor, "obeyed civil law in secular matters, but they dared to disobey when their Christian faith was in peril. Then they refused and received punishment with Christian submission and with heroic endurance. Their persecutions arose chiefly from the ancient laws which forbade the worship of deities which the State did not recognize. The Roman Government was tolerant of native religions, when their representatives were quiescent, but when they became active in propagating their faith they encountered fierce civil opposition."

The principle which the doctor states and applies to the early Christians, is equally true of the Seventh-day Adventists of our own day, and his language needs but little change to express the exact truth concerning the Adventists and the persecution which they are called upon to endure. We paraphrase his words thus: The Adventists obey civil law in secular matters, but they dare to disobey when their Christian faith calls for it. Then they refuse and receive punishment with Christian submission and heroic endurance. Their persecutions arise chiefly from old laws still upon our statute books which require the observance of a pagan festival as the Christian Sabbath. Our civil authorities are tolerant of Adventists when they are quiescent, but when they become active in propagating their faith, and are consistent in living it out, they encounter fierce civil opposition.

Then in the situation is a similar—a human tenure has not changed at all, and times have changed but little since the days of the Cæsars. The spirit of persecution is not essentially different from what it was then, while the occasion for it we are almost identical with those of thirteen hundred years ago.

In discussing the Roman Catholic raid on the public schools, the *Mail and Express* says:—

The State and the Church are separated in this country as government and are united in the old countries on the other side of the Bridge. Such attempts have always resulted in political and religious oppression. In Europe, the Church and the State are intimately connected. Has this union, this attempt been a benefit to our own glorious country? This is a question to which we should give an honest and true answer. Let us look back on past history for an answer be both emphatic and final. Religion has no right to meddle in secular affairs of the government. No government can interfere with it, except to a guarantee perfect freedom to each in the exercise of that faith which each has seen fit to embrace.

These are good sentiments, and yet the *Mail and Express* has, for years, been one of the most persistent advocates of religious legislation to be found anywhere in this country. The "impassable gulf—that civil and ecclesiastical despots have endeavored in vain to bridge," has been bridged in "free" America by the action of the Supreme Court, applauded by the *Mail and Express,* and by the Sunday legislation of the Fifty-second Congress—legislation demanded by the *Mail and Express,* in the interests of the ecclesiastical churches of the land.

In the Senate, Dec. 13, Mr. Colvin, of Illinois, is offering petitions from his constituents.

Last year's a petition signed by the patrons of a section of Chicago were presented and praying Congress to make an appropriation of at least $100 for a chaplain for the county jail of Cook County, Ill. Now this year our patitions ask the county ask jail in a small chapel in connection in which the County to provide money to pay a chaplain for said jail, to hold religious services there in, and it is not proposed to be changed by the chaplain of a denomination.

This is obviously a matter of which in the state or national government has nothing whatever to do, and in no way concerns the United States in Provision and Furnished and the Congress in Public Buildings and Grounds.

A TELEGRAPHY news item from Chicago says that the clergy of that city of "God, a certain national voice body for an aggressive work in municipal affairs." "The first step of the clergy," says the dispatch, "is an effort to have the ministers of Chicago should give all their time and attention to the management of municipal affairs, otherwise their attention might be naturally drawn to the fact that there are too many men of business more on the poor the winter than they always in the name of reform, to look after the real situation of their Christian charity. The religious central mission, have sent the food of the hungry, clothe the naked, and visit the widow and the fatherless in their affliction?

In the Senate, Dec. 13, Mr. Colvin, of Illinois, has presented a petition from Baltimore it has been determined, under the advice and counsel of Cardinal Gibbons, to withdraw the proposition which has likely been made by Maryland and New York for a grant to public and church schools "for the present."
