American Sabbath," merely that "all Christians observe the same day!"

All that the National Reformers desire is a law that will oblige the Citizens of the Nation, which will make the President of each State, and every man and woman, all men, creditors, and all of roads, to keep Sunday, and, further, that their organizing newspapers, and picking tombstones off Sunday streets shall be stopped, in or out of the "Christian" is, "to-day's" call to the "Sabbath reform."

This is and this is to be pushed on" all of what the Sabbath party is about. That the National Reform proposes to compel men to do something not wrong for themselves— the "Sabbatarians" and all others ought entirely to be let alone, and that our people would rather to praise the Lord that steps should be taken to enforce these laws and seeing that, there are those that know what is best for the "State." Nothing else therefore, there are noble men among those reformers who honestly think they are right, and who honestly aim at perfection. But the accomplishment of this purpose so far has in the proposed of the proposed constitutional amendment touching Sunday would teach the old lesson over again. Set the Inquisition into motion anyhow and abuse be! Wholly to this one purpose, and then into the churches, where, as they are in isolated ones is let it be "reformed" or not, just "Christianity" would be installed in every State and in every city in the Union, the selfish mischiefs into which existing laws have fallen in the past, which existing law have formulation of religious liberty and right to dissent. It is "begs the question" to say that it is not religion, that they are only asking for nothing religion. The National Reformers are in earnest, and in that same earnest to resort to such a subterfuge. They honestly believe that it is not "religion" but "Sunday law" is "a law touching a secular day." Their sincerity is not in question but the sagacity of religion or its equal, that, we believe their proposition to be. It is not an "American institution" to be "maintained by fine and imprisonment of those who have another 'institution' that to them is the day, that law is only 'civil;' why not make Monday, Christmas, Good Friday, Thanksgiving, Good-day, or Sabbath, all only 'civil;' and not deal with Sunday as a religious institution at all. That is what it is, and we so treat it.

This truth is told in a single and conclusive sentence. If Sunday were really only a "civil institution," if it were merely a matter of "good" to assess somebody's civil obligations, in so far as labor is concerned; why, then, it would not be necessary, according to the National Reformers themselves, to resort to constitutional amendment or to any act of legislation whatever. It means fail or prevails, that the purpose, zeal and force of authority shall be enlisted to compel all, on the one day, to obey a law of religious origin backed by faith of God alone; or is it the selfcontradictory double meaning of the "civil" and force of earthly government?
