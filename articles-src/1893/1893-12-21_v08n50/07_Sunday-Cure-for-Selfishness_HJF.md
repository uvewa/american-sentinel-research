THAT the movement for Sunday closing of barber shops and other places of business, is not purely a religious one, the following report from the Providence, R. I., *Telegram* will testify:—

The Greystone Barber Association met last evening at their rooms, 63 Washington Street, to consider the Sunday closing question. It was voted that the practice of keeping the shops closed on Sunday be continued, but that a fine of $5 be charged for the first offense and $10 for the second, against those in the organization who open their shops on Sunday. The practice is to observe the Sabbath closed Sunday in this city. The Association also voted to raise the price of hair-cutting to 25 cents on Saturdays and holidays, and this is likely to make customers allow the shops to close.

Nothing could be more evident than this. The shops are to be closed on Sunday and to compel all barbers "to observe the Sabbath closed Sunday." We do not doubt that many things that should any keep that their shops open on Sunday, "do so because they are selfish," but which would prevent the form a fine from those the equal chance of earning their daily bread. But the shops must be closed, the Sunday paid for, by law, all to comply. Why should the barbering business force a man to happen to differ from connections morally and intellectually? And the barber who would have to be watched by the association in such case, is not the man to leave alone to prosecute him. In so doing they three again each to have their said opinion in each of his time. In this, "the god of this world" has blinded the minds that the liberty over the rights of others. They in any of the world need to make its people for the is profit. To Make the world people have "its customers" as witnesses work Sunday better, not to "avoid being drawn into court." The enactment and one, but "better" is wronged, and all done in the name of the "Sabbath" and "religion."

At the same meeting a proposition was made by the Providence Association to unite with the Gloversville Association that these measures might be carried out.

November had, another meeting was held and rejected by the same paper, which says:—

The matter of Sunday closing was discussed pro and con at length, and the sentiment that Brett was open on the Sabbath, and that a committee be appointed to investigate the matter. The committee stated that the town sergeant was also sent, and they promise to do according to rule every case.

By this report we see that the association means business. They are not simply entering complaints against those who may open their shops Sunday. More over, because the town sergeant was a little slow to carry out their wishes in enforcing the Sunday closing law, they propose to hurry on the town sergeant, or, perhaps, boycott him at the next election. By this we see that oppression and selfishness are constantly increasing, and the words of Eccl. 4:1 Prov. 1:7-8, are being fast fulfilled: "This know also, that in the last day perilous times shall come. *For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,* etc. Contest all me by the signs of the times! that we see in the last days of that the time that we might. The question is: Are we ready to meet the Lord when he shall appear to gather his own?
