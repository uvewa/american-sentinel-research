Anything like the probable success of the National Reform movement would undoubtedly result in increased wrong and persecution. While the design to persecute is disclaimed, and we think honestly, by the better class of leaders, the purpose to compel all men to regard Sunday on religious grounds is openly stated. These reformers have some definitions quite as queer as that which calls defeat "victory." They want no "union of the Church and State," but only "union of Christianity and State." That is exactly what the Roman Empire did from the time of Constantine forward. Roman Catholics now rejoice that there is no union of Church and State in the United States, as in Europe, and they only wish that the State should countenance and give proper aid and opportunity to Christianity, which means Catholicism. Our National Reformers want the same thing, only they want to define Christianity after the National Reform pattern, and not after the Roman Catholic. They aver, "we would not interfere with any man's conscience; all we want is a law to compel every man to give proper regard to Sunday as the American Sabbath." That means that Seventh-day Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, and Jews can keep Saturday if they want to, but they must also keep Sunday, because "the civil law cannot make provisions for minorities." It means that men who believe that there is no religious obligation to observe any day must keep Sunday sacred to cessation from business, recreation and the like, according to the National Reform programme. It is a proposition to put into the national Constitution, and make, as a fundamental law of the Nation, a requirement compelling every man to treat Sunday as the National Reformer thinks it ought to be treated. All this is defined as "freedom of conscience." Great is the mystery of definitions. Seventh-day Adventists are now imprisoned in Maryland for quietly working on their farms on Sunday, but that is not "persecution;" oh, no, "persecution" has an unsavory sound; it is—it is only—ahem; it is merely, quietly and lovingly obliging them, i.e., constraining them to obey the statute law of Maryland, touching the "blessed American Sabbath," merely that "and nothing more."

All that the National Reformers desire is a few words in the Constitution of the Nation, which will enable the President to call out the army, if need be, to compel all men, creedless, and of all creeds, to desist from running railroad trains, printing newspapers, and picking tomatoes on the "American," the "holy," the "civil," the "Christian," the "Lord's day" Sabbath. This is not to be spoken of as illiberal or as persecution! It is simply what National Reformers propose to compel men to do. That is all, and it is such a trifle that "Saturdayians" and all others ought to be ashamed to say a word about it. They ought rather to praise the Lord that steps are being taken to bring them into line along with those who know what is best for them. Nothing like definitions. There are noble men among these reformers who would not be illiberal, and they do not aim at persecution. But the accomplishment of their purpose, and the enforcement of the proposed constitutional amendment touching Sunday would make persecution unavoidable. Set the machinery in motion and abuses will follow. If the present Sunday laws were enforced everywhere, as they are in isolated cases in Tennessee and Maryland, "religious liberty" would be assailed in every State and on every day in the year. The desuetude into which existing laws have fallen is the only reason why so little persecution exists. It "begs the question" to say that the "civil Sunday" can be enforced without touching religion. The National Reformers are too consistent and too brave to resort to such a subterfuge. They honestly and openly accept the truth that any "Sabbath law" is a law touching religion, and ought to be enforced as such. We commend such honesty, erroneous as we believe their proposition to be. It is supreme nonsense to aver that men should be punished by fine and imprisonment for not keeping a civil holiday! If the Sunday law is only "civil," why not make and enforce similar laws concerning Christmas, Good Friday, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, etc. If the law does not deal with Sunday as a religious institution, the days are parallel.

The truth is told in a single sentence. The National Reform movement, so far as Sunday is concerned, is the mistaken effort of good men to accomplish desirable ends on a false foundation and by wrong methods. It must fail at last, however earnest, devoted, and well-meaning its advocates may be.—*Sabbath Recorder.*
