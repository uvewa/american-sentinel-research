Anything like the probable success of the National Reformers would result in grossly increased wrong and unrighteous persecution. While the design to persecute is not deliberate and purposeful on the part of the better class of leaders, the purpose of gaining control of the government on religious grounds is openly stated. These professed Christian reformers ask nothing more quiet as that which calls defeat "victory." That is not even an invasion of the "Church and State," but only "union of Christianity and the State." They point to the time when the Empire did from the time of Constantine that he was a Christian. They look upon it, that there is no union of Church and State in the United States, as in Europe. Consequently not only will that be Stateand compel the old power of the State to back up their ideas. Our National Reformers want the Christianity of the State to back up their ideas. Our National Reformers want the Christianity after the National Reform model put into the Constitution. When they aver, "we would not interfere with Seventh-day Baptists," or "we don't want to compel every man to give proper regard to Sunday as an American institution," they really mean that they want it *now*. That means that Seventh-day Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, and Jews need not keep Saturday if they want to, but they must also keep Sunday, because "the civil law" compels it. In other words, it means that men who believe that there is a "higher law" than the law of man must keep Sunday sacred to cessation from labor and all secular business, and according to the National Reform program. It is a proposition to put into the national Constitution, and make, as a fundamental of the Nation, a requirement compelling every man to treat Sunday as the National Reform thinks it ought to be treated. All this is defined as a promotion of "Christianity." Great is the production of definitions. Seventh-day Adventists are now imprisoned in Maryland for working on Sunday. They are at work on Sunday, but that is not "persecution," say the National Reformers who are aiding, comforting them to obey the statute law of Maryland, touching the "Christian

for the promotion of such an amendment to the national Constitution as will suitably acknowledge Almighty God as the author of our national existence and his Son Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations; the Bible as the supreme rule; and the national government has pledged that "this is a Christian Nation," and that is all there is of it: that the Nation must give to God and to its people their active, prayerful, and financial support.

The purpose to besiege Congress wholesale persistently and periodically until a national Sunday law is obtained was announced many times during the convention, and is strenuous appeals for funds to prosecute the work of "Christian lobbyists" were heard at every session. The nature of the National Reform movement is clearly a menace to the liberties of the American people. Up to this time the advocates of this movement have failed to make much headway, and their organization exhibits many cracks. Its success has and been probably discouraged greatly by the lack of money and much opposition. If the proposed efforts to be made at Washington are backed by talent, and if some complication touching the State or national policy should arise, a start may be deemed worthy of some dangerous importance and of some distinguished support as a political movement. This has not been the case in the past. We hope that this aggression of the purpose will succeed, and congress came for "reform" only but national reform.
