## This a Living Question.

I AM no alarmist; but I agree with the late General Grant, who wisely said at Des Moines, Iowa, in 1876: "If we are to have another contest in the near future of our national experience, I predict that the dividing line will not be Mason and Dixon's, but it will be between patriotism and intelligence on the one side, and superstition, ambition and ignorance on the other." Several Protestant churches are now taking public money for the sectarian education of Indians. The amount appropriated to Protestant denominations for this year is $80,350, and to the Roman church $365,045. I am no pessimist, but neither do I wish to be blinded by an optimism which refuses to see existing dangers, and which rejects appropriate remedies. The subject is, then, a living question, a question which will demand and receive during the closing years of this century the earnest thought of the most patriotic and devout citizens of this great Republic.

Insistence on the entire separation of Church and State brings us, as citizens and Christians, into sympathy with the teachings of Christ and the apostles. Our Lord, with rare wisdom, recognized the authority of the State in all secular affairs. If ever there was a religious teacher marked by sanctified common sense, that teacher was Jesus Christ. We have not recognized, as we ought, his remarkable shrewdness, his holy adroitness, and his sacred cleverness. When an effort was made to entrap him and to secure from him a pronouncement which his foes could use against him, he lightly stepped over the snares set for his feet and soon involved his enemies in the tolls which they had laid for him. He at once perceived their wickedness. They asked a question which they expected would place him in a hopeless dilemma. If he replied with an affirmative, all the Pharisees would announce that he favored paying tribute to Caesar. From this admission they would reason that his claims to be the Messianic King were ridiculous; they would also charge him with being neither patriotic nor pious. But if he answered with a negative the Herodians would proceed immediately to Pilate and make charges against him as a usurper. The Romans cared little for the religious affairs of the Jewish people; but, of course, they could not permit open revolt from their authority. Our Lord's answer was one of those great truths which go straight to the heart of the subject discussed. Under the theocracy, duties to the civil and divine ruler were practically one; but now that the hated Roman was civil ruler, the distinction between civil obligations and religious requirements was of the utmost importance. Jesus here gave a great object lesson on this subject. Holding up the coin, he emphasized obedience to Caesar in secular things, and to God in sacred things. His enemies were confounded. Hostile as they were, they were obliged to acknowledge that he had placed them in the dilemma from which he had himself escaped. They saw also that he had declined to act the part of a political Messiah, and that he had fully answered a question as difficult as it was important. He here distinctively announced that there is a separation between the Church and the State. Later, in addressing Pilate, he affirmed that the legitimate powers of civil rulers were of divine origin.

Peter and the other apostles echo the truths taught by Christ when, in their reply to those who commanded them not to teach in the name of Jesus (Acts 5:29), they said: "We ought to obey God rather than men." They thus made a direct appeal to the best instincts of their enemies, both as judges and as men. The Sanhedrim, claiming to be appointed by God, must have seen the force of this appeal, for all admitted that the authority of God was superior to that of man. The announcement of this principle has had important bearings on human liberty from the first century even to the nineteenth. The Apostle Paul, in writing to the Romans, recognizes the fact that the civil power has its rights, and also that those rights are delegated and limited. In the letters to Timothy and Titus, and also in the first epistle of Peter, similar truths are taught, and similar courses of conduct are urged. It is affirmed in all these cases that when civil government makes demands contrary to religious duties, its authority is to be denied; but in other cases its mandates are to be obeyed. Baptists, to-day, in their insistence upon separation between Church and State, are in full harmony with the teachings of Christ and the apostles. Our highest privilege is to be in all respects pupils of Jesus Christ, and successors of the apostles. Standing beside him and them we know that we are right. Here we have ever stood; and, God helping us, here we shall ever stand.

## THE GROWTH OF A STATE CHURCH.

Insistence upon entire separation between Church and State brings us into sympathy with noble souls through all the centuries. The early Christians, as we have already seen, obeyed civil law in secular matters, but they dared to disobey when their Christian faith was in peril. Then they refused and received punishment with Christian submission and with heroic endurance. Their persecutions arose chiefly from the ancient laws which forbade the worship of deities which the State did not recognize. The Roman Government was tolerant of various religions, when their representatives were quiescent, but when Christians became active in propagating their faith they encountered fierce civil opposition.

With the conversion of Constantine, we enter upon a new era in the relation between Church and State. Then privileges were granted to the officers of the Church, giving them rights similar to those which had previously been enjoyed by pagan priests. The first exhibition of State churchism is thus a direct result of pagan ideas introduced into the Church. The emperor soon became known as Pontifex Maximus. Constantine did not hesitate to place the cross on one side of the coins in use, and the symbol of the sun-god on the other side. The emperors soon came to consider themselves as patrons of the Church. It is true that prominent bishops, such as Ambrose, Jerome, and others, vigorously denied the right of the emperors to pronounce on religious questions and duties. Thus the conflict between bishops and emperors continued, now one, and now the other, exercising the greater authority. In 494, Bishop Gelasius affirmed the superiority of the ecclesiastical over the secular power; and in 502 Bishop Symmachus resisted the assumptions of King Odoacer over the rights of ecclesiastical officers.

Charlemagne conceived the idea of a universal Christian monarchy; and he considered it his right to oppose or to indorse the election of even the Pope, as well as that of the bishops. His successors, however, were too weak to carry into effect the ideas which he had first promulgated. From this time on the popes increased their powers at the expense of those of the emperors. But in the ninth and tenth centuries the papal throne was nearly overthrown by the immoralities of some of the popes; and, as a result, the imperial power again greatly increased. About the middle of the eleventh century Hildebrand put forth exorbitant claims for the papal see; and soon the power of the emperors in the election of popes was annulled and given to the college of cardinals. Under the name of Gregory VII., Hildebrand, in 1073, took his seat upon the papal throne, and boldly claimed that the Church was the highest power in the world, and that the secular governments owed their existence to the permission of the Church. These assumptions led to unceasing conflicts with the German Emperor, especially as the views of Gregory were maintained by Alexander III. and Innocent III. Boniface VIII., in his famous bull, "Unam Sanctam," held the belief that it was necessary to salvation to believe that the Roman popes had power over everything earthly; but he suffered severely for his extraordinary assumptions thus expressed. His own death, the transfer of the papal see to Avignon, and the great schism, were the direct fruits of the unholy seed which Boniface had sown. One of the Avignon popes revoked this blasphemous bull, as far as concerned France, although it was afterward restored by Leo X., in 1516.

When we come to the time of the Reformation, we find all these principles entering vigorously into the grave discussions of the hour. Luther and Calvin, Zwingli and Melancthon, and others, condemned the claims of the Church of Rome. At times they saw the truth, but through a glass darkly; at other times they were involved in hopeless confusion, and, seemingly, in Egyptian darkness. Some of their writings show that they wished to keep the two powers separate, and that they favored the government of the Church by the Church; but, as many reformers clung to the idea of a Christian State, whose magistrates had a right to punish heresy, there was no clear teaching regarding separation of Church and State. I do not charge Calvin with the execution of Servetus; but I have a right to rebuke him for not exercising the power which he possessed to prevent that execution. State churchism came finally to be established in the Lutheran and Reformed countries. The Roman Church used force to suppress Protestantism; Protestantism, therefore, justified itself in using force to maintain its existence. Rationalism and infidelity later exercised some influence in restricting the power of the Church. The French Revolution, in 1789, shook ecclesiastical structures to their very foundations. The Congress of Vienna, in 1815, led eventually to the recognition of Lutheran and Reformed churches, as well as Roman, as State churches in different countries.

## PRECIOUS TRUTHS MAINTAINED BY BAPTISTS.

The persecutions in the Old World which drove many dissenters to the New World, opened the discussion afresh on the virgin soil of America. All through these bloody periods there were brave Baptists who saw, who held, and who were willing to die for the truth. They held substantially the principles which are maintained by Baptists to this hour. They opposed infant baptism, which was the cause of many of the greatest evils which ever dishonored the pages of Church history. They condemned vigorously the doctrine of salvation by baptism. Among these were the Paulicians of Eastern Europe, and the Petrobrusians and Henricians in the West. They vigorously prescined the Baptist doctrine of salvation by faith alone. They saw that infant baptism was responsible, in large part, for the union of Church and State; and also for the bloody persecutions which resulted from that union. In the times of the Reformation these truer disciples of Christ were numerous in Switzerland, Bavaria, the Tyrol, the Rhine country, and the Netherlands. They rightly denied their nickname of Anabaptists, declaring that infant baptism was no baptism at all.

In bearing testimony against infant baptism and in favor of infant salvation, Baptists also testified to the doctrine of separation between Church and State. This testimony was not merely a lucky thought of astute Baptist philosophers; it was the logical outcome of distinctive Baptist principles. How came they to be so much wiser than all other religious bodies?

Their wisdom lay in the fact that they grasped the great principles laid down by Christ and the apostles. They preceded all others in declaring the true relations between civil and ecclesiastical bodies, because they held correct scriptural principles, while all others were involved in the meshes of unscriptural tenets. Baptists thus were the first to condemn the use of force in religion. Down to a comparatively late date, if a man said that the civil magistrate should not interfere in strictly religious matters, it was known thereby that he was a Baptist. . . . A glance over the brilliant path which Baptist heroes and martyrs have made through the dark centuries will arouse in all our people a holy enthusiasm for the loyal adherence of our fathers to the Word of God, and for the heroic faith which made them willing to do or die in support of the truths they held. We would be unworthy sons of these noble and sainted sires if we did not bless God for their lives, if we did not consecrate ourselves afresh to the maintenance of the principles for which they were willing to go to the dungeon and the rack, to the gibbet and the stake. In this land of freedom we put the crowns of our gratitude and of their endoring fame on the brows of these martyred and sainted heroes.
