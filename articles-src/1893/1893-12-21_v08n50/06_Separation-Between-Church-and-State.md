## A Living Issue.

I AM not alarmist, but I agree with the late General Grant, who wisely said at Des Moines, Iowa, in 1875, that "if we are to have another contest in the near future of our national existence, I predict that the dividing line will not be Mason and Dixon's, but it will be between patriotism and intelligence on one side, and superstition, ambition and ignorance on the other." There are those in this country now taking public money for the sectarian purposes of education. The amounts now pointed to Protestant denominations for the past year is $402,001, and to the Roman Catholic $394,756. I am no pessimist, but I think, if it will, we do nothing to regard the opinions which refuses to see existing tendencies and the logic of current events. The subject is, then, a living, a tremendous, a question, which will demand and receive during the closing years of this century the earnest thought of the most profound and patriotic minds of this great Republic.

That is, the entire separation of Church and State brings to us, as citizens and Christians, into sympathy with the teachings of Christ and the apostles. Our Lord, while living here, recognized the authority of the State in all secular affairs.

Yet—it is that way which the power of God. And what is the purpose to which our attention should thus be called to the power of God? It is not that we may discover his is in power for creating the things not done. If we be the mastered ourselves. We look up and the heaven declares the glory of God. But the purpose of all is that we may be reminded, whichever way we look, whatever things appear, the way the power of God is there, and that the same power can create things in the power pledged for the salvation of every one who in it.

Standing beside him and then we know that we are right. Here we have was saved; and God helping us, how we shall overcome.

## THE GROWTH OF A STATE CHURCH.

Limitations upon religious freedom grow with Church and State brings in its intolerably with subtle strength at the outskirts. Too early Christians, as we have already seen, obeyed civil law in secular matters, but they dared to disobey when their Christian faith was in peril. Then they refused and received punishment with Christian submission and heroic endurance. Their persecutions arose chiefly from the ancient laws which forbids the worship of deities which the State did not recognize. The Roman Government was tolerant of native religions, when their representatives were quiescent, but when they became active in propagating their faith they encountered fierce civil opposition.

With the conversion of Constantine, we enter upon a new era of relation between Church and State. Then privileges were granted to the officers of the church, giving them rights similar to those which belonged to heathen priests. The first establishments of State churches thus introduced into the Church, the emperor not bearing the sword in vain, he assumed for the purpose of conscience, to place the cross on one side of the medal and the double-headed eagle of the god on the other side. The emperors soon began to take cognizance of questions of faith and to determine on the policy of the Church. It is true that, previously, by their councils and synods, by their creeds and colors, vigorously denied the right of the emperors to pronounce on these questions and abides. Thus the conflict between bishops and emperors continued, now one, and now the other, exercising the determining power.

In the Middle Ages that same struggle affected the serenity of the ecclesiastical authority and the purity of the church. Bishop Boniface of Rome, and in 501, Bishop Symmachus received the sanction of King Odoacer the right of investigating heresy.

Charlemagne conceived the idea of a Christianized State. He vigorously ordered it his right to oppose or to tolerate the claims of every, His bishop, as well as every one of his bishops. The successors, however, were too weak to carry into effect the whole which he had first promulgated. From this time the popes international their powers at the expenses of those of the emperors. But in the ninth and 10th centuries the papal throne was nearly overthrown by the interference of some of the popes, and a revolt, the aristocratic families, against intruders. About the middle of the 11th century Gregory VII. at this time forth exorbitant claims for the papal authority. And we find the assertion of the selection of popes was annulled and given to the college of cardinals. Later the states of Gregory VII., Hildebrand, in 1073, took a new step in the papal behalf, and boldly claimed that the Church was the highest power in the world, and that the secular governments owed their existence to the extension of the Church. These assumptions led to unceasing conflicts with the German Emperors, especially as the claims were intensified by Popes Alexander III. and Innocent III. Boniface VIII., in 1302, in his famous bull, "Unam Sanctam," held the belief that it was necessary for salvation to believe that the Roman church had power over everything earthly; but he suffered severely for his utterances.

His own death, the transfer of the papal see to Avignon, and the great schism, were the direct fruits of the unholy revolt which Boniface had sown. One of the Avignon popes revoked his blasphemous claims, as far as concerned France, although it was afterwards restored by Leo X. in 1516.

When we come to the time of the Reformation, we find all these principles existing. Luther and Calvin, at certain stages of their careers, condemned the claims of the Church of Rome to political power; but at other times spoke through a glassy darkly; at other times they saw only spiritual authority, and saw very correctly, in Egyptian darkness. Some of their writings show that they wished to keep the two powers separate, and that they resented the encroachments of the Church's, but, as many reformers did, they used this as a Christian State, whose magistrates had a right to punish heresy, there was no settled or consistent opposition of their principles of Church and State. It did not comport with Calvin and the council that he was not exercising his Christian authority for him for previously his not exercising the power which belonged to the State. And so it is that the State churches came finally to be established, in the early Protestant as in the Catholic countries. The Roman Church used force to propagate its teachings in European Protestants, who were themselves, justified itself in using force to maintain its teachings. Missionary endeavor and infidelity later exercised some influence in the direction of tolerance. The Puritans, the French Revolution, in 1789, struck some powerful blows for liberty, and some horrible ones. The Congress of Vienna, in 1815, led eventually to the disestablishment of the State and Reformed churches, as well as the old and Roman, as State churches in different lands.

## ERRONEOUS TRUTHS MAINTAINED BY FORCE.

The persecutions in the Old World which drove many dissenters to the New World opposed the demands afresh as the Virgin soil first of the American colonies. But in particular there were brave Baptists who saw, almost from the outset, the evils of a union of Church and the truth. They held substantially the very principles which are maintained by Puritans to this hour. They opposed infant baptism, which was the corner of many of the religious civil laws they discovered a beginning of the greatest evil which ever challenged the name of Church liberty. They condemned vigorously the doctrine of salvation by baptism. They were persecuted, Puritanism of Eastern Europe, and the Puritans and Huguenots in the West, and in almost every Christian country, because of their tenacious and uncompromising maintenance of salvation by faith alone. They felt the heavy hand of State interference, in large part, for the union of Church and State made it a serious offense to deny the saving power of the so-called sacraments which resulted from that union. In the time of the Reformation there the gospel of Christ were known in Switzerland, Bavaria, Germany, the Thuringia, the Netherlands and the country. They rightly saw that infant baptism in all Anabaptist, declaring that infant baptism was no baptism at all.

In bearing testimony against infant baptism and in favor of infant salvation, Baptists bore a consistent testimony for the complete separation of relations between a State church, between Church and State. The main contention of their faith was the principle of all of astute Baptist philosophers; it was the logical sequence of distinction of principles. How came they to be as much wiser than all other religious bodies? that he was a Baptist. A glance at the bloody pages of history, in which heroes and martyrs have made through the centuries, sufficiently show why. A people a holy enthusiasm for the loyal defense of our faithless are, for the Word of God, and for the heroic faith which made them willing to die or do all in support of the principles they held. We would be unworthy of them if we surrendered to-day what they did not know God for their lives, if we did not consciously carry on the work which they began. We stand on the ground that were they were willing to go to the scaffold. In this land of freedom we put the crown of civic and religious liberty over the grave fame on the brows of those martyred and consecrated defenders of the truth.
