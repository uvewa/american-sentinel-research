A TELEGRAPHIC news item from Chicago says that the clergy of that city will "form a central union religious body for aggressive work in municipal affairs." This is about the time when the "unco guid" of Chicago should give all their time and attention to the management of municipal affairs, otherwise their attention might be uncomfortably drawn to the fact that there are many tens of thousands more of the poor this winter than they always have with them, needing the immediate exercise of their Christian charity. Will this religious central union feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and visit the widow and the fatherless in their affliction?
