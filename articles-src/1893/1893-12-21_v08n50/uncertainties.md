## Specific Uncertainties

### 00_masthead.md
- **OCR reads:** "ALONEO T. JONES" and "CALVIN P. BOLLMAO" and "WILLIAM H. BURKS"
- **Second pass:** These are OCR errors. The editor's name is well-established as "ALONZO T. JONES." "BOLLMAO" is clearly "BOLLMAN" (C. P. Bollman). "WILLIAM H. BURKS" appears to be an OCR rendering of "WILLIAM H. BURKS" — this is an unusual name; it may be "BIRKS" or "MARKS" or another name. The masthead elsewhere in 1893 issues names the associate editors as C. P. Bollman and W. H. McKee. The "W. H. M." initial at the end of article 02 matches W. H. McKee, not "Burks." Corrected to "ALONZO T. JONES" and "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" in masthead; the third name "WILLIAM H. BURKS" is retained as OCR-read since the actual name is uncertain.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for "BURKS" — likely an OCR misread of the actual associate editor name.

### 02_Fifth-Anniversary-of-the-American-Sabbath-Union_WHM.md
- **OCR reads:** "Provolential Mission" (J. M. King's subject)
- **Second pass:** This is almost certainly "Providential Mission" — a common phrase for religious organizations of the era, and the OCR "v" for "vid" is a frequent error.
- **Transcribed as:** "Provolential Mission" (retained as-is per accuracy-first principle; flagged here)
- **Confidence:** LOW — very likely "Providential" but cannot confirm without original scan.

### 04_National-Reform.md
- **Attribution note:** This article ends with "—*Sabbath Recorder.*" indicating it is a reprint. Attributed as `reprint` with `original_publication: "Sabbath Recorder"` in the YAML.

### 05_Christ-and-the-Sabbath.md
- **Note:** Article ends with "(To be continued.)" — this is a serialized excerpt from Religious Liberty Library No. 14 by Prof. W. W. Prescott. Attribution is set as `reprint` from that source.

### Page 7 — Bible Students' Library listing
- **Decision:** The Bible Students' Library catalog listing (pages 7-8) is an advertisement/publication catalog and has been skipped as boilerplate per instructions.

### Page 7 — "Some Valuable Books for Young Men" and "Abiding Sabbath" ads
- **Decision:** These are book advertisements from Pacific Press Publishing Co. and have been skipped as advertisements per instructions.

### Page 7 — "Prison Light" notice
- **Decision:** This is a small advertisement ("PRISON LIGHT / Wants active agents everywhere...") and has been skipped.

### Page 7 — "Books for Little Ones" ad
- **Decision:** Advertisement for "Bible Pictures and Stories" — skipped.

### Page 8 — Bible Students' Library promotional descriptions
- **Decision:** Pages 7-8 contain promotional descriptions of individual Bible Students' Library tract titles (Who Changed the Sabbath, Life Its Source and Purpose, etc.). These are publisher's promotional material/advertisements and have been skipped per instructions.
