# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, December 21, 1893 (v08n50)

## General Note
The scan quality for this issue is notably poor throughout, with small text, significant blur, and low contrast in many areas. Multiple passages across all articles required careful interpretation and some remain uncertain.

## Article 01: Christ and the Sabbath (pages 393-395)

- **Page 1, Column 1, Paragraph 3**: "the one to be ever be worshiped as a Sabbathbreaker" — The word "worshiped" may be "worshipped" or the phrase may read differently. The text is somewhat unclear.
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** Scan is blurry in this area; the phrasing seems unusual.

- **Page 2, Right column**: Multiple paragraphs about the Pharisees' self-convicting charge — the text becomes very difficult to read in places. Phrases like "they did the Sabbath before and swept all the people into the train" and "the culmination of the depends upon the idea of the possession of some of the heads of wheat" are uncertain.
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** Very blurry text; the logical flow is hard to follow.

- **Page 3, Left column**: Several passages in the continuation about the Pharisees going to Herod and Pilate are difficult to read due to scan quality.
  - **Confidence:** LOW

- **Page 3, Middle column**: The text near "the Sabbath course of the Saviour was in every instance that of the man of sin" — this passage seems unusual and may be misread.

- **Page 3, Middle column**: "God forbid that any of the true people of God shall so depart from God and from the truth as to come to even so much as withstand as this!" — "withstand" may be a different word.
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 02: Fifth Anniversary of the American Sabbath Union (page 395)

- **Page 3, Right column**: Much of this article is very hard to read due to poor scan quality. Many sentences had to be reconstructed from partial letter shapes.

## Article 03: National Reform Convention (page 396)
