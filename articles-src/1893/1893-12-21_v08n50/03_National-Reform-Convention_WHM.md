THE late National Reform Convention at Allegheny embraced a large number of themes; and its utterances on Temperance, Social Purity, Divorce Reform, the Labor Question, the Marriage Laws, the Anti-Lynching Legislation, etc., were worthy of careful study.

But the supreme question in the convention is contained in "The Statement of Principles" declared as follows:—

*Fourth.*—"That one of the most prominent of national sins is the prevalent desecration of the Lord's day, the Christian Sabbath." "Fifth.—The sabbath being the sign of the relation of our Nation to the Lord's day. The Act of Congress closing the World's Columbian Exposition, on the first day of the week, was a most significant national utterance, and a determined effort was made to repeal this act, in the interest of the Sunday opening."

Art. 3. In the year 1892, decisions were given in the United States Circuit Court and in the courts of nearly all our States, and with the sentiments of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, that of, of which expressed the Sabbath sentiment and confession of the courts of the country.

Art. 3. The debate of Sabbath sentiment and confession of the Sabbath in the courts of the country, along with the great tide of Sabbath breaking which has been sweeping over the country and especially in the great Cities, and which is increasing in paper companies, and the United States mail. This Christian nation has confessed in the courts of the country, that one of the most prominent of national sins is the desecration of the seventh day of the week—the Lord's Day—the Christian Sabbath. In other words, this whole thing of Sunday, or its must become wholly the one or the other. It must become wholly religious or wholly secular. It must become wholly a religious command or a mere civil holiday. We do not accept the former and reject the latter, the advocacy of civil or merely human authority, but we call upon it to right itself in its true nature and to acknowledge itself as the tribute of a Christian nation to the true Christian Sabbath, and therefore the tribute of a Christian nation to the Lord of the Sabbath.

Although defeated in their efforts to accomplish the closing of the World's Fair on the Lord's day, through congressional action, several things have been accomplished. . . . "The action upon the 'recent victories' for Sunday," . . . as shown in modern legislation and the World's Fair. Nothing less than blind infatuation would insist upon calling these repeated defeats "recent victories." We admire faith and optimism, but there comes a time when faith becomes credulity, and optimism calls black, white, it seems a little discourteous to cite defeats as victories.

"It is not so; it is so, because my mother say it is so." This quotation given down from the mentality of this convention, before us, and it is so, because we say it is so, it is so. That is the authority for these things victories for Sunday. The wall of opposition is as high as ever.

But the practical and significant point of the statement of the Examination is found in the last item, which reads as follows:—

*Fifteenth.*—"That we request the executive committee of the National Reform Association to select one or more agents to Washington to press at every opportunity the interests of National Reform through our government; and to present to Congress as may be before Congress in defense of our public schools. Sixteenth.—That it be the great purpose of this movement, that the committee take so far as possible for the enactment of a national Sabbath law, and

be insisted upon, it will be received,— and through them the people, by congregations, will be coerced. It is a great thing. It will succeed,—until the twelfth hour, when, at Christ's second coming, the clay of it will be expelled to meet all things and themselves as they are.
