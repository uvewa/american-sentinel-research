THAT the movement for Sunday closing of barber shops and other places of business is purely selfish, will be seen from the following report in the Providence, R. I., Journal of October 6, 1893:—

The Olneyville Barbers' Association met Wednesday evening to consider the proposed re-opening of shops on Sunday morning. The association voted that the practice of keeping the shops closed on Sundays shall be continued, and that action shall be taken to compel all barbers in Olneyville and vicinity to observe the Sabbath closing law. The association will station watchers near the shops which will be opened Sundays, and will produce evidence to prosecute. They will summon customers as witnesses against proprietors and workmen, and this is likely to make customers shun the shops to avoid being drawn into court.

Nothing could be more selfish than this. First, the Olneyville Association propose "to compel all barbers" "to observe the Sabbath closing law." Why? Because that should any keep their shops open on Sunday morning and get a little money this would prevent the others from standing an equal chance to get a little of it on Monday; and so, for the love of gain, they propose to compel, by law, all to comply with their wishes; no matter if one should happen to differ from conscientious motives, not believing in Sunday keeping, he would have to be watched by the "association," which would procure evidence to prosecute him. In so doing they deny him the right to the use of one seventh of his time. In this, "the god of this world," mammon, is exercising authority over the rights of others. Truly, the words of the Apostle Paul are fulfilled: "For the love of money is the root of all evil." To make their prospect of equal gain sure they "will summon customers" as witnesses against workmen and proprietors so as to close the shops, and that the customers may be frightened from the shops on Sunday as they will want to "avoid being drawn into court." The customer is frightened, the barber is wronged, and all done in the name of the Sunday closing law to gratify the greed for gain. What greater tyranny could there be?

At the same meeting a proposition was made by the Providence Association to unite with the Olneyville Association that these measures might be carried out.

November 2nd, another meeting was held and reported by the same paper, which says:—

The matter of Sunday closing was discussed. The committee reported that one shop on Plainfield Street was open on the Sabbath, and that a complaint had been entered with the town sergeant. The committee stated that the town sergeant was slow, and they proposed to do something to expedite the closing of this store.

By this report we see that the association is carrying out its plans of watching and entering complaints against those who still open their shops on Sunday. Moreover, because the town sergeant was a little slow to carry out their wishes in enforcing the Sunday closing law, they propose to hurry up the town sergeant, or, perhaps, boycott him at the next election.

By this we see that oppression and selfishness are constantly increasing, and the words of Paul in 2 Tim. 3:1-5, are being fast fulfilled: "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers," etc. Cannot all see by the signs of the times that we are in the last days, and that perils are thickening all around us? Are we ready to meet the Lord when he shall appear to gather his jewels?
