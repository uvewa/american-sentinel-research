# Uncertainties — v08n49 (1893-12-14)

## Article 01 — "The Situation in This Country" (WHM)

- The masthead lists "WILLIAM H. BURKE" as associate editor, but the article is signed "W. H. M." Known initials WHM = W. H. McKee. The masthead spelling of the editor's name ("ALONEO T. JONES" instead of "Alonzo") is an OCR artifact; transcribed as it appears.

## Article 06 — "The Crime and the Punishment"

- Page 4-5: "the door was in pursuit of a useful occupation" — likely OCR error for "the doer" but transcribed exactly as it appears in the OCR source.
- "Urucify him!" — likely OCR error for "Crucify him!" but transcribed exactly as it appears.

## Article 07 — "A Few Straws" (S. B. Horton)

- The article begins on page 5 and contains two subheadings: the main body with Cardinal Gibbons quotes, and "THE BOYCOTT IN THE CHURCH" section. Both are part of the same article by S. B. Horton. The article text mid-page ("but this intolerance is the logical...") on page 6 continues from a footnote-interrupted passage from page 5. The text has been joined as continuous.
- "lapsus linguae or lapsus memoriae" — Latin phrases preserved exactly.
- "accusay the fact" — likely OCR error for "gainsay the fact" but transcribed exactly as it appears.
- Footnote text includes "opening innovation" — likely OCR for "opening invocation"; transcribed as it appears.
- "a principal inveterate" — unclear OCR rendering; transcribed as it appears.
- "bestly herself" — likely OCR error; transcribed as it appears.
- The footnote marker † refers to AMERICAN SENTINEL Nos. 37-40 of the current volume.

## Article 09 — "The Bible Sabbath" (W. Wood)

- "Proc. 30:6" — likely "Prov. 30:6" (Proverbs); transcribed as it appears.
- "the first of the Cassars" — likely "Caesars"; transcribed as it appears.

## Article 13 — "Sample Copy Notice"

- "Sancho Copy" — likely OCR error for "Sample Copy"; transcribed as it appears.
- "levantals rule" — likely OCR error for "invariable rule" or similar; transcribed as it appears.
