THE STATE of Massachusetts has an annual "fast," proclaimed by the governor in the republican, with a recommendation that the people assemble in their respective places of worship, etc.

But while the day is called a "fast," it is not observed as one. Instead of a day of fasting and general rejecting, it has become simply a holiday, with something like the following:—

It is not observed as an occasion for worship, let the people come from their labors and rest one day. Instead of making this a day of approaching God for blessings, it has become a day of expanding tastes of earthly favor. Let the appropriate name be given this annual holiday. The day to come forth in imparting away and reassuring the faith of the populace is one. The government prescribes both the day of the imaginary practice and the halt tones minister for the general observance—in the churches, the hymns of thanksgiving have been so beautifully rehearsed, the burden be restored, and the trucks move up and down, the factory begins its hum, and the harness and pole organizations take their places in the social regime, each trying to accommodate the best trained and most earnest activity.

This indicates the manner in which the day is kept; but it is not one with more than the name of the so-called "fast" day in Massachusetts than it is of "Thanksgiving day all over the United States. The President and the several governors call upon the people to "lay aside all secular affairs," and to "assemble in their respective places of worship," and to "render thanks," "give thanks," etc., etc. But by the vast majority the day is devoted to no such purpose. A low worship, but the materialistic, is conveyed in the practical offerings to the god spoken of in Phil. 3:19. Like Massachusetts' "fast," the national "thanksgiving" is a burlesque on the worship of God.

It is an universal custom among Protestants to hold prayer meetings Wednesdays. What would be thought of a church which, while dropping the feature of the meeting from Wednesday, continued to hold it on Wednesday evening, held a festival instead, and called the festival a "prayer meeting," the pastor gravely announcing the preceding Sunday that there will be a "prayer meeting" at the church on next Wednesday evening; let all come in the true spirit of devotion, prepared to suitably multiply the Divine favor, but knowing full well that the only religious service on the occasion would be a single introductory invocation or a sentence address by a young member with a burning desire to establish a reputation, brilliancy, and that all the evening would be devoted to festivities at at least doubtful Christian propriety—wouldn't we, any one, would he thought of much of a church and such a minister? But that is virtually what the State of Massachusetts does every year by her governor, and what the whole United States does by the President.

If a church and its ministers set apart, by public proclamation to a purpose to which they know, not merely from the show of piety which they probably do not possess, but from their utter disregard for the real purpose—the chief executives of this State of the Nation, and the people in no nation, give services which they know not one in a thousand will render, it is nothing less than that for the credit of true religion, the proclaiming of faith and thanksgiving be left with the churches where it properly belongs; for there is a wide margin between a national holiday known as Thanksgiving, let us call by its proper name other name, and short of the mock piety that gives birth to what has neither been colonial, nor let it stand forth in its true character as a day sacred in the American almanac.
