THERE is at present a widespread agitation over the Sabbath question. For nearly half a century considerable attention has been called to this subject by the teaching of those who observe the seventh day of the week, but a growing tendency to religious legislation in recent years, and especially the efforts to enforce the observance of Sunday by civil law, have done more than anything else to bring it into living notice of the day. But the nature of the institution itself is purely spiritual thing, with which civil government has nothing whatever to do. The conception of a "civil sabbath," or "the civil side of the Sabbath," is a recent invention, adopted under the stress of the situation, and intended to open the door for Sunday laws. The Sabbath question recognizes only Sabbath days without committing itself to a course of action which begins right at the foundations of the Christian religion and the law of God, and every one ought to know about it. We want to know just what things, Christ, the Son, is the agent in creation; and how the power and glory of God is manifested to the world. "Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him." 1 Cor. 8: 6. This text embraces all, as also the next text is very broad, extending to this, that all things visible and invisible are his creation, and every manifestation of God, farther still, in any way, has been through Christ. He is the power and wisdom of God in the fullest and broadest sense. God does nothing for man or to man, in person, but always in the person of his Son, and through him as a representative. Every particular of the plan of salvation is wrought out through the Son. We have this statement of Christ when he was upon the earth: "All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him." Matt. 11:27. That is the only way to know the Father, through Jesus Christ.

It is through Christ that all revelation of God comes to us. This is through faith that the experience of Jacob when he saw the heavenly ladder, the Lord standing beside it, reading the angels ascending and descending upon it. It was with reference to this that Jesus said to Nathanael. See the first chapter of John, the fifty-first verse. "And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man." Of this character is a fact—Christ is the way by which all things were created in the first place. "All things were created in the beginning, and without him was nothing made that was made." John 1:3. And this refers not merely to material things, for we read in Col. 1:16: "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him, and for him." More and more appears the fullness of the Son of God. All revelation is by him.

It is well to know how all things were created. "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." Ps. 33:6. He spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. Ps. 33:9. And in Genesis the record of creation reads, "God said, Let there be light; and there was light, and there was light." But Christ was the Word, as is shown in John 1. The record is explicit. God said it, in Christ and through Christ. God's Word is Christ. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Jesus Christ. He was the spoken word, as the creative force for the creation of all things. All things are through Jesus Christ. It was through Christ that God has wrought in every place in the Scriptures where we have this record, "And God spake all these words, saying," "And the Lord spake," and "God called"—the whole Bible is the writing of the Scriptures. For we read in 2 Peter 1:21, "Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." And wondering what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify. 1 Peter 1:11. All revelation is of Christ, and the glory that should follow, he testified beforehand, speaking through the prophets. So all the revelation of God in the Scriptures is giving to the world history in advance, it was revealed through the Spirit of Christ. We can look for nothing from the Father to come. So it is in Christ, it is all the way through, Christ the agent in everything,—the creation and the revelation of God; and not only Christ the Creator whose Spirit inspired the prophets.

There is a very interesting fact to be found in connection with the general that the ten commandments at Mount Sinai. This man, one in the name, it was Christ who was the spokesman. Notice what is said in Acts 7:37, 38: "This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the Sinai, and with our fathers." In the thirty-eighth and the ninth verse, we have these words: "To all that affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them." Read in connection with that Ex. 23:20, 21: "Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him." Put this with the passage in Isa. 63:9. "And he bare them and carried them." And "in his love and in his pity he redeemed them." THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME. The Scriptures brought together show of themselves, without any forced interpretation or explanation, that the Angel of God's presence was Christ; that when God spake all these words from Sinai, it was Jesus Christ, and when God spake, it was Christ who spoke to our first parents.

CONSIDER BEFORE HIS FIRST ADVENT.

Notice two or three marked instances to show that Christ was present before he was manifested in the flesh. We have the record, in Exodus, the third chapter, of Moses' experience at the burning bush. It says, in the second verse: "And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed." There follows an account of why it was that this fire, burning so visibly, did not consume. The record says: God called unto him out of the midst of the bush. "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Now it is proper to say that God speaks to those but days by his Son, as it was true that he spoke by his Son at the burning bush and who spoke in the creation.

In the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, the faith chapter as it is sometimes mentioned; the twenty-sixth verse reads: "Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt." Hebrew eleven. Jesus Christ said to the Jews: "For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me." It is true that Moses knew Christ, and Christ was to Moses, a living presence, and when he chose to join himself, and this though they were a little given to identifying himself with a people with reproach, he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater. It was because he realized that Christ was there. It was because he understood Christ that he could make the choice.

Joshua was commissioned to take Moses' place, which we find in the last portion of his record in the 5th chapter, just before the walls of Jericho fell, most fraternally verse. Joshua went out to battle and standing before him a Man with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua inquiring whether he was for or against him, and he said, "Nay; but as Captain of the host of the Lord am I now come." The margin says "the Prince"—"As the Prince of the host of the Lord I am come." Who is it that stands at the head of the armies? Who is it that stands as the principle of the house of God—"King of kings and Lord of lords," "who rode upon white horses, and he that sat upon him was called The Word of God"—and by his statesmanship he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called The Word of God. And he rules with the nations; "He hath trodden upon white horses." Rev. 19:11-14. In the gospel by John, the first chapter, "In the beginning was the Word, and the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." The same was in the beginning with God. His name was called the Word of God, which was none other that Christ. So it was that Christ who appeared to Joshua and announced himself as the Prince of the Lord's host, and thus gave information as to how everything was to be done. In fact, in all these experiences we have a record that it was Christ who was with them. 1 Cor. 10:4. "And did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them and *was with them*;" and that Rock was Christ.

It is not necessary to multiply instances; there are many of them. But the point I am making brings the very close Christ to us in that

IT WAS CHRIST

by which all things were created in the first place. "All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made." John 1:3. And this refers not merely to material things, for we read in Col. 1:16: "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him, and for him." More and more appears the fullness of the Son of God.

It is well to know how all things were created. "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." Ps. 33:6. "He spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast." Ps. 33:9. And in Genesis it is, "God said, Let there be light; and there was light." But Christ was the Word. The record is explicit. God said it, in Christ and through Christ. God's word is Jesus Christ. He was the spoken word, as the creative force for the creation of all things are through Jesus Christ. It was through Christ that God has wrought in every place in the Scriptures where we have the record, "And God spake," "And the Lord spake," and "God called"—the whole Bible is the writing of the Scriptures. For we read in 2 Peter 1:21 that holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. And wondering what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. 1 Peter 1:11. So it was revealed through the Spirit of Christ, speaking through the prophets. So all the revelation of God in the Scriptures is giving to the world history in advance, it was revealed through the Spirit of Christ to come. It was his Spirit that inspired the prophets.

And how the Sabbath and the observance of the Sabbath and how it was given are to be considered.

There has never been any change in this matter. The blessings which the Creator gave us have never been changed. The blessings and privileges of the Sabbath have been given among men whereby we can now see the wonderful creation. Christ is not only now the revelation of God, but Christ in not only now the agent of creation. He was always the agent. Christ is not only now the power through which God works for us in the world, but he has always been the agent. These people who were saved of old, they are saved now; it has always been so. Christ is always the one. Noah's faith redeemed because of his faith in the merits of Christ. The whole matter of the plan of redemption as stated in the eleventh chapter of record of faith, in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews; and the first one named is Abel. Noah, "by faith Abraham," and time after these who are mentioned—those who wrought everything through faith. Now just one thought upon this point, that in whose name can we have a mind which is upon whom we have rest. John 14: in whom it is upon whom I called the Author and Finisher of our faith. So for rest on the Sabbath we have Christ.
