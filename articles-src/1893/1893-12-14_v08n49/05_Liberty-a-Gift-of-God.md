LIBERTY is something that every man has. It is the very first gift of God. The Creator has bestowed upon all his human creation the faculty of free will and thought. What will make a man happy? To have to have liberty,—to be free to go where he pleases, and to do as he pleases? It is just as natural, for God to be free, and expect, freedom as it is for him to breathe;—this is the reason men have fought to the death in the past, and will continue to fight in the future. A man rather than lose that most precious of all things,—liberty is dearer to man than even life. If this is so, it is because God came down, his life to bring liberty to his fallen children. Liberty is not a gift of man. God has made him.

True liberty consists not in being free to do as he pleases, or go where he pleases; it is being free from that which is lord it over him, and compel him to do as the owner pleases. As long as a man is going free, is not in chains, he is not in bondage, but when he is free, happiness is gone, too. Life is a burden. It is altogether impossible, contrary to his nature to be a slave. We know that it was only by God's grace and mercy, knew that man would be a wretched creature without freedom, and he made it that a free moral agent, that is, so that he could choose his own way. "If a man be in sin, he is a captive, yet he has that which is the real thing of all his nature,—liberty to serve Him or to serve sin and Satan. Freedom of choice is freedom, no matter if that man may be in ever so wretched a condition,—and why? And as freedom is, even in chains, a man outside of Christ in is a wretched creature, and he would have no more happiness that he would not have if he had never existed at all.

But the child of God is the happiest of all his creatures. He is the one who is in Christ Jesus, whom the truth, the Son, makes free is free indeed." He is freed from the bondage of sin. Through faith he looks forward to an eternal life of happiness. It is liberty that he must have. Liberty is joined freedom to life, and when sin is that leaves for just sensible half of every one? Truly? To whom has he given the right to take away that liberty which he has so graciously bestowed upon man?

We begin to see that it was not man's to have; and every one who accepts the truth the reality in him who made him; he can not make to live; also his love; his power; and neither can he make to live without him. Every blessing he has in this life is from God, and to him he owes everything, as does he to man his fellow man. Everything man has is a gift from God; and the gift of life is a gift from him, social joys are a gift of God, liberty also is a gift from God.

Then, if liberty is a gift from God, he certainly does not wish to favor any of his creatures to serve him. The service he requires is a service of love. Man serves the Creator of the manifold nature of his tender mercies; because of a higher love. Love therefore, God, by the cords of love, draws man to himself; by love and not force.

But certain men, by their actions, say that God's way is not right; that they have a better way to bring sinners to Christ. God's way is too slow for them. Sinners are reluctant, and will not of themselves come to God; therefore, the compulsion of law must be resorted to, to bring them in. And what will the compulsion of law to come, and by this means to bring them in, and what will the compulsion of law be by, can. To make God's people a large majority of the country is the object. But all this is done in opposition to the will of God, just the opposite way to be won. His command to his ministers is, "Go ye into all the world, teach and baptize" and not call nations, No., no. That is not his way. His way is a loving way; any other way is just the contrary. The time will come, "Yes, my sons," the Lord will inquire of those who are free to bring sinners to him. "Who has required these things at your hand. What did they say at your Sinai?" And what they say the Lord.

Isaiah says the true followers of the Lord did must not look for peace; he must not look for the triumph of right while in this world. Struggle, and trial, and warfare, for righteous, for prophecy must be fulfilled. Struggle and fight, but not with carnal ways, and therefore will not be going this way. And as for the Sabbath, in itself his just the contrary to God's way. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts." And when Christ, his Lord, was persecuted. He did not resist. His commandment was not to bring peace, but a sword. "Suppose not that I am come to give peace on earth. I came not to send peace, but a sword. I am come to set from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."

They certainly have or the advantages of education and training and should know much more should they. God made man free, and purposes that he shall be free, and so continue in happiness.
