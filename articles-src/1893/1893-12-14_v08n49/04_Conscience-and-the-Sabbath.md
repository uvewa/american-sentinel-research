**Conscience and the Sabbath.**

The average American citizen has little or no conscience in the matter of Sabbath observance. The question has been so long treated as a subordinate one, and the human and utilitarian element has been made so prominent, that even religious men have little conscience in the matter. Customs and prevalent modes of teaching have combined to put Sabbath observance outside the realm of religious duty in a very large degree. The mere "rest day" theory is a popular one; i.e., if body or brain need rest, it is well to rest. Upon this theory it is easy to invent methods of resting (?) which will gratify worldly tastes and desires, and benumb conscience. Upon the same low plane is the average notion concerning church going and religious culture. Popular opinion says if there be a service conveniently near, where music and oratory will entertain one, it is a pleasant way of spending a part of a leisure day; but if the music be second class and the preaching commonplace there is little or no conscience to compel men even to attend service on their "rest day." The rest-day theory does not necessarily, nor usually, involve the idea of sacred time, or of a divine obligation in the matter of Sabbath keeping.

The Church and the pulpit are in no small degree responsible for this state of things. The current discussion shows that even Christian men are loth to discuss the Sabbath from a religious point of view so much do they plead with railroads and pleasure seekers about the "utility of a rest day." We do not object to these lower elements in the discussion, but they are merely secondary; and if men make these the prominent or foundation idea, all conscience as of duty toward God is at an end. The same is true when the "civil Sabbath" is made the prominent thing. Religious conscience is neither awakened nor cultivated by an appeal to civil law. If the Church does not take high religious ground the world will certainly drift far away from it. The work of awakening the latent conscience of the people, if it exists, or of creating it, must be done by the Church if it is done at all. Evils do not cure themselves. A revival of Sabbathism will never be attained on the rest-day theory of utilitarianism nor the testimony of medical experts! Conscience toward God alone will form the permanent foundation for such a revival. The resolutions of synods and conferences and the wisdom of creed makers will prove useless unless the masses are trained to a higher religious conception of the Sabbath as a divine and especially religious institution. It would not be far from the entire truth to say that one of the first steps toward reform is the creating of a conscience on the Sabbath issues.

All this has come because men have discarded the Sabbath, and they know that Sunday has no basis in the Bible; hence they dare not meet the issue on biblical and religious ground.—*Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.*
