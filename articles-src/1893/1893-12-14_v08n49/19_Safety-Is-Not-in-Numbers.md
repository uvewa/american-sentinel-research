THE *Political Dissenter* quotes the "Homiletic Commentary" as follows:—

> Numbers have a wonderful influence in begetting confidence. They inspire men with hope of success. It seems impossible that so many can be defeated. The fact that the wicked are in the majority in this world is often a strong point with them. This was the hope of Pharaoh and Sennacherib. The first Napoleon made his heart that Providence fought always on the side of the great battalions. . . . Men think there is safety in being one of many. But it is not so.

The *Political Dissenter* adds this pertinent comment:—

> The plain teaching, therefore, is, no matter what the size of the crowd, or the sphere of its activity if it does wrong, apply the principle of dissent.

Has the *Dissenter* thought to apply this principle to the boasted millions that petitioned for Sunday legislation in the matter of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and who are expected to make renewed demands for additional measures of religious legislation, and who justify themselves in what they have done and in that which they propose to do, on the ground that they are "the majority" and "the best people of the land"? The only prop that the Sunday institution has is the fact that the majority keep it to a greater or less extent. It is without foundation in right or in the word of God.
