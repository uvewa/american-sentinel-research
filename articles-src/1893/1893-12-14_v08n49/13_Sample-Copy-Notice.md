I AM one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend, unless plainly marked "Sancho Copy." It is our levantals rule to send out no papers without pay in advance, except by special arrangement, therefore, there who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office.
