THE Romanists acknowledge that they accept some 80,000 of worship and prayer from the United States: "but good judges," says the Primitive Catholic, "admit it is double this."

A CONSERVATIVE note,—"In popery-governed liberal [?]—is in popery-governed countries—protestants are simply groping candles of their liberties and revenue to earned State duties.—"Rome never changes."

THE Bible says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." "The first day is the Sabbath." Is there any reason why we should doubt the Lord's word? If not, can these be any reason why we should believe those who contradict that word?

THE *Sabbath Outlook* says that "judicial decision has virtually annulled the Sunday law of Texas." But that decision annulled the assumption of the right of the State to legislate upon religious questions. If not, the top of the occasions were simply been cut off of leaving the root in the earth, to again send forth a stock and branches as vigorous as before.

DECEMBER 1, the German Reichstag, by a vote of 173 to 36, revoked a decree which passed more than a score of years ago, expelling the Jesuits from Germany. Germany is to be no exception to the implied conduct of Rev. 13:8, "All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him [the papal beast], whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."

THE *Political Dissenter* quotes the *Homiletic Commentator* "as follows:

Narrows has a wonderful influence on all classes. They suggest the man with hope of success. It imposes their mind on the right thing to act at the proper time. For the very tendency in the world is often a strong point with them, and to meet them at the right moment in time. The first Napoleon made his boast that Providence had always on the side of the victorious battalions. Not think there is safety in being one of them. But it is not so."

THE *Political Dissenter* adds another observation:

The plain teaching, therefore, is, no matter what the size of the crowd, or the space of its activity or done wrong, apply the principle of dissent.

Has the *Dissenter* thought to apply this principle to the loudest militants that petitioned for Sunday legislation in the matter of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and who are expected to make renewed demands for additional measures of religious legislation, and only justify themselves in what they have done and in that which they propose to do, on the ground that they are "the majority" and "the best people of the land"? The only thing that the Sunday institution has is the fact that the majority keep it in its place of assertion. It is without foundation in right or in the word of God.

THOSE in a republic. Says a writer of Philadelphia's note, all have no return of property "until Christianity shall be recognized as the law of the land." Judge quotes this and adds the comment: "Here is your Church and State arranged—a very neat working arrangement as would leave no free-thinker or Jew, or unbeliever a single point to man on his shoulders. Oh, let us have no so good in any the way that we can't be somebody also be good in his way."

THE Oxford union, upon the authority of the American republic was but interfered the directors upon the subject, that the Midwinter Exposition in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, will be open on Sunday. The *Outlook* (formerly the *Christian Union*) expresses the opinion that "the university would best subserve the moral interests, and even the interests of Sunday preservation, were they to open the fair in the afternoon and evening, stop the machinery, forbid sales, and not provide special and extraordinary attractions, meals as formerly on Sunday evening."

A LARGE number of subscriptions are about to expire. These should be promptly renewed in order to avoid missing a single number of this paper. The opening of the new volume will be the beginning of a series of articles from the Editor on the Catholic question, now one of the living issues in this country. We do not want to lose a single old subscriber, but on the contrary to gain many new ones; and certainly no old subscriber can afford to be without this paper in view of the important themes to be discussed in its pages in the near future. Any person sending in four new subscriptions, with four dollars, will receive the SENTINEL free for the year 1894.

OCTOBER, we printed an article from the *Christian Statesman*, written by Mr. Jones, on a theme which he then called "One Great Danger." The article was sent to us, and the date of the paper from which it was taken was so furnished. Its authenticity was subsequently challenged, but we are happy to say that we now have in this office the paper in which the article first appeared, namely, the *Christian Statesman* of August 15, 1893. The Gosling Thompson may satisfy themselves of the genuineness of the article by writing to the *Christian Statesman* 16-20 East Main Street, Cincinnati, Ohio. It appeared on page 38 of the paper, 644 of the volume.

THE *Enquirer*, William E., of Sarasota, is a recent speech to speak of it very recently, is a recent speech to speak of the country, its recent to the political affairs, and now the Christian statesman also say that their "recommendation" are very valuable to them. You have not dealt with it yet.

It is difficult to determine from just this what position is at issue. You can, however, be so an assertion of divine right, be so an assertion of divine right when identical with that of the Author of the universe. "But in the days of those Kings will be done," the "Christian warfare" shall be finished. How wonderful is the Grand Chief of Emperor William! And yet we are living in the land of the living; some of the old institutions, the old customs have changed, but have not been changed. Institutions are as much to be considered as ever.
