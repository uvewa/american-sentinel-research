**Satolli.**

Satolli got out of bed yesterday morning and put on appropriate millinery. Satolli ate breakfast and probably took a potato, as he is said to be fond of them. Satolli ate dinner and probably drank a half-glass of wine, as he is announced to be in the habit of doing occasionally. Satolli read books and newspapers and was probably pleased at the amount of notice given him. Satolli wrote some letters to priests and other people. Satolli ate supper. Satolli went to church. Satolli turned around. Satolli sat down. Satolli changed his millinery several times. Satolli spoke to a man. Satolli shook hands with a bishop. Satolli took a ride on the cars. Satolli smiled. Satolli was gracious. Satolli took a walk. Satolli said that he liked America, and was in favor of freedom and the Constitution and the flag and American constitutions and other things. Satolli pulled the wool over some eyes, browbeat some people, did what he could to Romanize America, and destroy its liberties and prepare the way for making a Mexico, a Spain, or a South America out of the United States. And the secular papers will continue to tell us of his uprisings and his downsittings, his incomings and his outgoings, in all the wearisome details, but will omit to tell the people why he is in America.—*Herald and Presbyter.*
