[The *Sabbath Recorder* publishes the following account of the attendance of a Seventh-day Baptist at the recent National Reform Convention lately held at Allegheny City, and his speech before the convention. We insert it as a matter of interest.]

WHEN I was called for to call this convention, and the scope of the themes to be discussed thereat, I at once felt it my duty to testify to the defenders of the claims of the Sabbath as we important factor in that convention. I received from the Rev. T. P. Stevenson a letter enclosing a "call" for the convention with the following remark in his letter, "As to the uses to which your committee on 'enrolment' has desired me to put your name, I have not as yet received your acceptance. In reply to the 'call,' I thank you for the courtesy of the call to the convention. I shall come, not to make an address before you touching the questions of Temperance, Exclusion, Labor Problem, Negro Problem, etc. We Seventh-day Baptists recognize the Bible and the religion of Christ and the principles of Christian government, and adjustment of those problems. But the larger question on which I desire to get the ear of this convention has to do with the Sabbath question, not as a Christian man to fix his attention upon my own efforts toward Sabbath reform. The Bible is the only standard by which this question can be settled, and according to that Book the present trouble, and the paramount error, lies with Christians. You say in Pittsburgh, patronize the Sunday trains. Enter. If you say you are Christians, then began the work of denunciation, of disturbing conscience, just when you threw out the Sabbath and God's law aside, and just Sunday and the law in their places. In the English Reformation, just England, and Scotch, more standing, between the fire from the Roman Catholics on the side and the English Seventh-day Baptists on the other, undertook to compromise the matter by transferring the law of God to the Sunday. Honest at the effort they have been, and earnest and sincere, but here is the Achilles heel, and out of it the inconsistency in the national guarding of the Sabbath and God's law has on this forty years, a rising Church that complains that men disrupted Sunday and do not keep your, a Christian the setting, the example by first disregarding God's law and his Sabbath.

This is not a matter between you and the Seventh-day Baptists. It is between you and God. The important question is not whether you shall grant this convention ship or courtesy in this convention, but can you will meet within yourselves God's demand for a day of worship. Day after to-morrow you will come to God's day, the holy day Sabbath, the day which Christ established, kept, honored, obeyed, and purified to the conscience of each and every one. It is going to make it your "busy Saturday" regardless of any human law of divine law. Don't you think that the question of the "changed" or "transferred" Sabbath or sabbath day, is a granite fact. Christ's observance of the Sabbath was on a Saturday, to-day on Saturday, early or late, you, and the Christian world, should see that this is man's work. I speak courteously, not with an acrimonious bore of conviction.

This is my present claim to speak to you. I desire to defend God's Sabbath, and to urge its claims, and I think it again fits the splendid opportunity of suggesting this in the matter error as in poplar "Sabbath Reform."
