DECEMBER 1, the German Reichstag, by a vote of 173 to 136, revoked the decree, passed more than a score of years ago, expelling the Jesuits from Germany. Germany is to be no exception to the inspired prediction of Rev. 13:8, "All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him [the papal beast], whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
