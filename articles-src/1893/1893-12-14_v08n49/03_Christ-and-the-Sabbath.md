## Christ and the Sabbath.

There is at present a widespread agitation over the Sabbath question. For nearly half a century the attention of the public has been called to this subject by the teaching of those who observe the seventh day of the week, but a growing tendency to religious legislation in recent years, and especially the efforts to enforce Sunday keeping by pains and penalties, have done more than anything else to make this topic a living issue of the day. It is therefore important to understand the real nature of the institution in behalf of which the State is so strongly urged to legislate. When its real character is understood, it will be apparent that it is a purely spiritual thing, with which civil government can properly have nothing whatever to do. The conception of a "civil Sabbath," or "the civil side of the Sabbath," is a recent invention, adopted under the stress of the situation, in order to open the door for Sunday laws. The State cannot recognize any distinction in days without committing itself to a course of action whose logical result is persecution. This is the danger of the present hour, and every one ought to know it.

God, the Father, is the source of all things; Christ, the Son, is the agent in all things. Christ is the one through whom God is manifested to the world. "Yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him." 1 Cor. 8:6, Revised Version. The meaning of the text is very broad, extending to this, that all communication, of every kind and nature, and every manifestation of God, to this world, in any way, has been through Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and that in the fullest and broadest sense.

God has never manifested himself in person, but always in the person of his Son, and through his Son he speaks to us. Every particular of the plan of salvation is wrought out through his Son. We have this statement of Christ when he was here upon the earth: "All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him." Matt. 11:27. That is, the only way to know God is in and through Jesus Christ.

It is through Christ that all revelation of God comes to us. This is illustrated in that experience of Jacob when he dreamed and saw a ladder, the bottom of it resting upon the earth, and the top reaching to heaven, and angels of God ascending and descending upon it. It was with reference to this that Christ spoke, as recorded in the first chapter of John, the fifty-first verse: "And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man." Of the angels it is said, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" But Christ is primarily the means of communication. He unites earth with heaven. And it is through a knowledge of Christ that we come to know God. It is God as revealed in Christ whom we are to learn.

It is evident from the Scripture that there has never been any change in this plan. "There is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." And it has always been so. Christ is not only now the revelation of God to man, but he has always been the same. Christ is not only now the agent through whom God works in this world, but he has always been the agent. It is through faith in Jesus Christ that we are saved now; it has always been so. Whoever is redeemed from this earth is redeemed because of his faith in the merits of Jesus Christ, and that whether it be the first generation or the last. Read the record of faith, in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews: "By faith Abel," "by faith Noah," "by faith Abraham," and time would fall to tell of all the other worthies who wrought everything through faith. The only one revealed to us in the Scripture in whom we can have faith is Jesus Christ, who is spoken of as the Author and Finisher of our faith. So from first to last it has been faith in Jesus Christ.

It makes no difference in the general plan of salvation at what particular point of time Jesus Christ was manifested in the flesh. If he had been manifested in the first generation, it would have been the same. If he were not manifested until the last generation, it would be the same. When God gave his Son to die, the efficacy of that promise and gift was just the same as after he had actually come to this earth and died. It was always faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Before his first advent there were certain ordinances introduced which were to be as symbols, occupying the same place and serving the same purpose as the ordinances of the Church at the present time. With reference to these ordinances it is declared: "For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come." 1 Cor. 11:26. And as often as they offered the sacrifices provided, as often as they performed any of those ceremonies in that time, it was always to show the Lord's death, because that was the central point. The Saviour was promised in the beginning, and there was just as much efficacy in that promise to save as in any promise of God at this time. The only difference has been that, as time went on, more clearly were the purposes of God in Christ revealed, more fully were the plans of God laid out, until Christ came himself, to bring in the fullness of the light, and we live now in the full blaze of that light which he brought to the world. The light of the knowledge of the glory, or the character, of God, is always manifested in Jesus Christ.

## CHRIST BEFORE HIS FIRST ADVENT.

Notice two or three marked instances to show that Christ was present before he was manifested in the flesh. We have the record in Exodus, the third chapter, of Moses' experience at the burning bush. It says, in the second verse: "And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed." Moses turned aside to see why it was that this fire, burning so briskly, did not consume the bush. God called unto him out of the midst of the bush: "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." But as it is true now that God speaks in these last days by his Son, so it was true then that he spoke by his Son, and it was Christ who was there at the burning bush and who spoke to Moses.

In the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews the experience of Moses is mentioned; the twenty-sixth verse reads: "Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt." Moses knew Christ. Jesus Christ said to the Jews: "For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me." It is true that Moses knew Christ, and Christ was to Moses a living presence, and when he chose to join himself with that people who were in slavery, to identify himself with a people with whom to identify one's self was a reproach, it was because he realized that Christ was there. It was because he esteemed Christ more than all the riches in Egypt.

When Joshua was commissioned to take up the work left by Moses, we find an experience of his recorded in the fifth chapter of the book of Joshua, thirteenth and fourteenth verses. Joshua went out to pray. While there, one appeared to him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua inquired whether he was for him or against him, and he said, "Nay; but as Captain of the host of the Lord am I now come." The margin says "the Prince"—"as the Prince of the host of the Lord am I come." Who is the Prince of the host of the Lord? Who is it that leads the armies of heaven? "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses." Rev. 19:11-14. In the gospel by John, the first chapter, the first verse and following, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God." His name was called the Word of God, which was none other than Christ. So it was Christ who appeared to Joshua and announced himself as the Prince of the Lord's host, and then gave him instruction as to how everything was to be done. In fact, in all those experiences we have the record that it was Christ who was with them. 1 Cor. 10:4: "And did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them [or 'went with them']; and that Rock was Christ."

It is not necessary to multiply instances; there are many of them. But the point to be emphasized is this, that from the very beginning to the very close Christ is all and in all. Nay,

## CHRIST WAS THE AGENT

by which all things were created in the first place. "All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made." John 1:3. And this refers not merely to material things, for we read in Col. 1:16: "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him, and for him." More and more appears the fullness of the meaning of the statement, "Through whom are all things."

It is worth while to know how all things were created. "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." "For he spoke, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast." Ps. 33:6, 9. So when, in the beginning, God said, "Let there be light, and there was light," it was Christ who is himself the "light of the world," who spoke that word. So in every act of creation. God said let it be so, and it was so, but the word was spoken through Jesus Christ. He was the spokesman for God. All things are of God, but all things are through Jesus Christ. It was through Christ that God has spoken in every place in the Scripture where we have the record "God said," or "Jehovah said," and "the Lord spoke and said." It was Christ who indited all the writings of the Scripture. For we read in 1 Peter 1:11, speaking of the prophets: "Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow." It was the Spirit of Christ speaking through the prophets. So all the way through the prophetic record in giving to the world history in advance, it was Christ who told the world what was to come. It was his Spirit that inspired the prophets. So it is Christ, it is Christ all the way through, Christ the agent in creation, Christ the spokesman for God, Christ whose Spirit inspired the prophets.

## CHRIST GAVE THE LAW.

There is a very interesting fact to be noted in connection with the speaking of the ten commandments at Mount Sinai. In this case, as in the others, it was Christ who was the spokesman. Notice what is said in Acts 7:37, 38: "This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the Mount Sinai." In Isaiah, the sixty-third chapter and the ninth verse, we have these words: "In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them." Read in connection with that Ex. 23:20, 21: "Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him and obey his voice, . . . for my name is in him." Put this with Jer. 33:6: "And this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS." These texts of Scripture brought together show of themselves, without any particular interpretation or explanation, that the Angel of God's presence who went with them, who spoke to Moses in Sinai, was our Lord Jesus Christ, and when God spoke "all these words," it was the voice of Christ that was heard. So all the way through: let it be repeated again and again. It is the point to be impressed upon our minds that, from the very beginning to the very ending, expressed in several places, where he says, "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last," it has been Christ. There has been but one Saviour, and that Christ. There has been but one way of salvation, and that through Christ. Faith in one has saved always, and that one is Christ. It is always so.
