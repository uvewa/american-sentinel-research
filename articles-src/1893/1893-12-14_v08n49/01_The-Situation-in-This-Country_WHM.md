"LET the principle once be established in the United States, that the Church may employ or control the power of the State; that religious observances may be enforced by secular laws; in short, that the authority of Church and State is to dominate the conscience, and the triumph of Rome in this country is assured."

EVERY statute and municipal ordinance in this country, enforcing or promoting religion and religious observances, has had its origin in the Church and State laws of the original codes from which our system of jurisprudence is derived. The same spirit of Church and State union which established these laws in the first place, has retained them in our statute books.

THESE dormant seeds of persecution, which have lain covered and uncultivated in the statute books now for three generations, have, within the last few years, been brought to the light with the promise of an immediate and rapid growth. A body of associated religious organizations, such as never before existed, has undertaken to foster and cherish the growing iniquity.

IN every State there has been agitation for the enforcement of Sunday laws. Cases under the Sunday laws, in one form or another, have been brought before the courts of almost all the States. In several States these laws have been avowedly used for religious persecution. Although the religious statutes, under which this is done, contradict both the spirit and the terms of the bills of rights of the Constitutions of the different States, and of the United States, still they have been, without exception, thus far, sustained by the decisions of the higher State courts. The Supreme Court of the United States has, by concurring in Justice Brewer's opinion in the Trinity Church case, February 29, 1892, that this is "a Christian Nation," given notice what position it will take on any case involving this question which it may be called upon to decide. The Congress of the United States has realized this, and acted upon it in advance, in the legislation which it passed in reference to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The principle, then, that the Church may employ the power of the State,—that secular laws may enforce religious observances, and that the authority of Church and State, combined, shall dominate the conscience, is settled in the affirmative in this country.

THAT principle, which is the basis of papal policy, is now firmly fixed in the statutes and judicial precedents of the different States. The farther development of this destructive policy is being rapidly hastened, not only by the machinations of the Roman Catholic Church itself, but, even in a much greater degree, by the mistaken course of Protestant denominations and the various other organizations, more or less avowedly religious in character. Some of these organizations are willing to join hands with the Roman Catholic Church in securing strict legislation as to the observance of Sunday, and are, in fact, desirous that the Catholic power should join with them in obtaining a severe interpretation, and enforcement, of those laws by the courts. Other organizations believe themselves to be antagonizing Roman Catholicism, and even confessedly make that the main, and, in some instances, the only purpose of their existence,—still they ignorantly serve the same ends by accomplishing the same thing, only under the name of Protestantism, instead of Catholicism. To be sure there is a difference between Catholicizing and Protestantizing the civil and political institutions of this country; but it is more a distinction than a difference, as this apostate Protestantism is the offspring and the image of its progenitor.

ONE strong and persistent influence continues, with increased energy, to assault Congress and the Nation's executive, to obtain, if possible, still greater and more explicit acknowledgment of the union of the State with religion. While this is not strictly necessary, for their real purpose is already accomplished, still it will go far towards familiarizing the lawmakers of the country with the requirements which their religious advisers are putting upon them. It will also materially hasten the progress of their cause. If, by some such means as secured the passage of the act to close the World's Fair on Sunday, the acknowledgment of a State religion should be inserted in the fundamental law, then the cloak of pretended allegiance to the principle of civil liberty in religious things could be thrown off entirely, and the ascendancy of the papal principle be openly asserted. This is what the more candid and logical, of those who call themselves National Reformers, desire, and for this they are planning to bring great influence to bear upon Congress during this session. It is not at all clear that they will succeed in accomplishing the definite thing which they wish, but it is quite possible that they will succeed in effect, as the Sunday closing of the World's Fair was a practical failure, and yet a theoretical success of their principles.

THOSE who are assisting to create a Protestant similitude to the Papacy while ardently fighting Roman Catholicism, as they see it, are legion. The subtle deception under which these labor and the delusion which they throw around those whom they draw into their ranks is unique. Roman Catholicism may well cherish them as its dearest friends, the enemy. It is a frequent, though paradoxical, statement that the longest way round is the shortest way there,—this is vividly exemplified in the case of those who are now antagonizing the progress of the Papacy in this country by the use of papal methods. No quicker way of securing a papal-Protestant domination in civil affairs could possibly be devised than that which has been taken. The possibility of the Roman Catholic Church, as now existing and organized in this country, obtaining the political ascendancy has aroused a selfish opposition which demands the same thing for itself, and proceeds to obtain it by means which are in themselves Romanizing, and will very shortly bring both parties into companionship in a mutual attack on the same fold.

Just how all will be accomplished that must be done no man can know; but one can see both by the prediction of prophecy and the light which the evidences of history throw on the probabilities of the future, that these strange things will be consummated. Just how quickly all that is to be, will be brought about, cannot be known by any man, but every intelligent observer of the progress of events must conclude, that it need not necessarily be long, and every one who accepts the word of Scripture, and sees with the eye of faith, knows that the time is near, "even at the door."
