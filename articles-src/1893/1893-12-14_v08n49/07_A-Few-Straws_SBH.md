## A Few Straws.

In the Catholic Mirror of October 28, is published a reprint of an interview with Cardinal Gibbons concerning the growth of the Catholic Church, etc. Some statements made by the cardinal may be of interest to readers of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, since he is the second highest representative of the Papacy in the United States. Of the growth of the church in America, he said:—

It is by the light of her past that we must read the future. Here, as in the Old World, with the passage of time, everything else has changed. Her organization [the church's], her principles, her doctrines, her rites, are precisely the same to-day as they were when Columbus first landed. The forms of government have altered, new nationalities with new customs and new ideas have come in; there are a hundred new religions that have been established, and others are constantly springing up daily; but the teachings, the procedure, the forms, the structure of the Catholic Church, are identically what they were when the first Catholic priest raised the cross on American soil.

By a lapsus linguae or lapsus memoriae the cardinal speaks volumes in this much of his interview. The Catholic Church, in the past, has been a persecuting power, denouncing all who were outside of her realm as heretics. A few references on this point from Catholic authority may be opportune.* Pope Marcellus decreed:—

> It is permitted neither to think nor to teach otherwise than the Court of Rome directs.—Corpus Juris Canotii, part 2, chap. 16.

Pope Innocent III. decreed:—

> The secular powers shall swear to exterminate all heretics condemned by the Church; and if they do not they shall be anathema.—Decretals of Gregory IX., book 5, title 7.

These quotations may be alleged to be ancient and of no moment in this enlightened age of civilization. If this be urged, let us quote some Catholic literature of recent date.

Says the Shepherd of the Valley (1876), published in St. Louis under the supervision of Archbishop Kendrick:—

> We confess that the Roman Catholic Church is but this intolerance is the logical and necessary consequence of her infallibility. She alone has the right to be intolerant, because she alone has the truth. The church tolerates heretics where she is obliged to do so, but she hates them mortally, and employs all her force to secure their annihilation. When the Catholics shall here be in possession of a considerable majority—which will certainly be the case by and by, although the time may be long deferred—then religious liberty will have come to an end in the Republic of the United States. Our enemies say this, and we believe with them. Our enemies know that we do not pretend to be better than our Church, and in what concerns this, her history is open to all. They know, then, how the Roman Church dealt with heretics in the middle ages, and how she deals with them to-day whenever she has the power. We no more think of denying these historic facts than we do of blaming the saints of God and the princes of the church for what they have done or approved in these matters.

Put with this the following from Mgr. Ségur, in his "Plain Talk about the Protestantism of To-day":—

> The church is certainly intolerant in matters of doctrine. True; and we glory in it! In religion, in mathematics, what is true is true, and what is false is false. No compromise between truth and error; truth cannot compromise. Such concession, however small, would prove an immediate destruction of truth. Two and two make four; it is a truth. Hence, whoever asserts the contrary, utters a falsehood.

> The church proclaims and maintains truths as certain as the mathematical ones. She teaches and defends her truths with as much intolerance as the science of mathematics defends hers. And what is more logical? The Catholic Church alone, in the midst of so many different sects, avers the possession of absolute truth, out of which there cannot be true Christianity. She alone has the right to be, she alone must be intolerant. She alone will and must say, as she has said in all ages in her councils, "If any one saith or believeth contrary to what I teach, which is truth, let him be anathema."

Here we have the record in part of the Roman Church. Testimony could be multiplied upon this point of intolerance, but sufficient is quoted, and coupled with the words of one of her princes, shows that that church is beginning to bestly herself, and come to the front, boldly asserting her queenship and her right to rule the consciences of men. It would be well if Protestantism would stop and consider whether in its efforts to make theology a branch of politics, it is not doing the foundation work for the future of the Roman Church in this country. The great badge of Roman authority is the establishment of the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the Sabbath, contrary to the Bible (the guide of Protestantism at one time), which the Romanists admit; and Protestantism has been challenged by Rome, through the Catholic Mirror,† to accusay the fact that Sunday observance is purely a creation of the Roman Catholic Church; and this was done lately, in September of this year. How about this, Protestantism? Who will answer for her?

## THE BOYCOTT IN THE CHURCH.

It is a curious illustration of the moral weakness, but also perhaps of the numerical strength, of the present majority in the Presbyterian Church, that some of its distinguished representatives should seriously propose to resort to the boycott in making war against the Union Theological Seminary. The boycott was first introduced into civilized society by the [Papal] Church. It was called by another name; it was termed excommunication. It was supposed to carry with it other penalties in the future state, but on earth to cut the excommunicated person off from all fellowship

*Before quoting these references, we will give what the cardinal says in this same interview in reference to his being chosen to open the Parliament of Religious with prayer and to make the closing address:—

"He it not significant that your eminence should have been invited to lead in the opening prayer and make the closing address."

"There can be no other view. Here were assembled representatives of all the religions and most of the leading sects in the world. I, as the representative of the Catholic Church, was invited to make the opening innovation. Not only was this a high compliment, but it was an circumstance that the deepest significance since it was a virtual acknowledgment that the Catholic Church is the rightful and supreme exponent and teacher of Christian truth. And I may say that when I led the prayer, I followed the Catholic form, and stipulated that I should do so in advance. I could not have done otherwise, because there was a principal inveterate."

"But then, with this interview, place the requirement of the Roman Church authorities, and the reader will not have much difficulty in determining the future of the church in this country when opportunity shall present itself."
