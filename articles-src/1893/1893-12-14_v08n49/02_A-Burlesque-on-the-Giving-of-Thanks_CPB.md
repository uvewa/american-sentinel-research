## A Burlesque on the Giving of Thanks.

The State of Massachusetts has an annual "fast day," proclaimed by the governor in the springtime, with a recommendation that the people assemble in their respective places of worship, etc., etc. But while the day is called a "fast," it is nothing of the kind; it is, rather, a day of feasting and general rejoicing. Last spring the Boston Post suggested that the language of the gubernatorial proclamation ought to be changed to something like the following:

In accordance with the new adaptation of an old custom, let the people cease from their labors and devote themselves to those cheerful and exuberant pastimes which the opening springtime and the expanding tastes of society invite. Let the sporting organizations of every character improve the day to come forth in imposing array and inaugurate their respective campaigns for the season. Let the bicycle clubs form for inspection and preliminary practice and the ball tossers unlinker for the glorious contests in which they will be called upon to engage. Let the lawn tennis not be drawn, and the lacrosse and polo organizations take their reckonings. Let the courses for fox and hounds be resurrected, the hurdles be restored, and the tracks placed in order. Let all the people prepare for the season of sport on sea and on land that is soon to engage their best trained and most earnest activities.

This indicates the manner in which the day is spent; but it is not one whit more true of the so-called "fast" day in Massachusetts than it is of Thanksgiving day all over the United States. The President and the several governors call upon the people to "lay aside all secular affairs," etc., and to "assemble in their respective places of worship," etc., and "unitedly give thanks," etc., etc. But by the vast majority the day is not devoted to any such purpose. A few worship, but the masses play; and all make more substantial offerings to the god spoken of in Phil. 3:19, than they do to the God of heaven. Like the Massachusetts "fast," the national "thanksgiving" is a burlesque on the worship of God.

It is an almost universal custom among Protestants to hold prayer meetings Wednesday evening. What would be thought of a church which, while dropping the feature of the meeting from which it takes its name, should, every Wednesday evening, hold a festival instead, but still retain the name, "prayer-meeting;" the pastor gravely announcing every Sunday, "Prayer-meeting as usual next Wednesday evening: let all come in the true spirit of devotion, prepared to unitedly supplicate the Divine favor;" but knowing full well that the only religious service on the occasion would be a single perfunctory invocation or a sensational address by a young member with a burning desire to establish a reputation for brilliancy, and that all the evening would be devoted to festivities of at least doubtful Christian propriety—what, we ask, would be thought of such a church and of such a minister? But that is virtually what the State of Massachusetts does every year by her governor, and what the whole United States does by the President. A day is with mock reverence set apart by public proclamation to a purpose to which it will not be devoted; and with a show of piety which they probably do not possess, and in many cases do not profess to possess, the chief executives of the States and of the Nation call the people to a religious service which they know not one in a thousand will render. Is it not time, that for the credit of true religion, the proclaiming of fasts and thanksgivings be left with the churches where it properly belongs? And if we must have the annual holiday known as Thanksgiving, let it be called by some other name and be shorn of the mock religious garb in which it has hitherto been clothed, and let it stand forth in its true character as a day sacred to the American stomach.
