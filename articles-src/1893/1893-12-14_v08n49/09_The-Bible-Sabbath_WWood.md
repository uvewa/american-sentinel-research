**The Bible Sabbath.**

In Genesis 2:2 we read: "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."

This is the foundation of the weekly cycle. God here declares the seventh day to be "sanctified," a character which it must forever retain, unless God himself declares it off. Man is not competent to do it. We are cautioned, "Add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar." Proc. 30:6.

In Genesis 8:10, 12 we have a glimpse of this weekly cycle, for "Noah stayed yet other seven days in sending out the doves."

It is sometimes stated that God gave no law to mankind until he gave it at Sinai. On the contrary the existence of sin proves the existence of law, for where no law is, there is no transgression. "Sin is the transgression of the law." 1 John 3:4. "And God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth." Gen. 6:12. "His way" must have been made known to men before they could be held responsible for corrupting it.

In Genesis 13:13, the men of Sodom are spoken of as "sinners exceedingly," so they must have been gross violators of God's law. This is made plain in Genesis 26, where God renews with Isaac his covenant made with Abraham, and gives as the reason of his favor towards him in verse 5, "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws." Abraham was contemporaneous with the Sodomites. He obeyed the laws which they violated, and became "sinners exceedingly," and as such, were destroyed.

The existence of the Sabbath laws is made certain before the Israelites reached Sinai. In Exodus 16, when the children of Israel were in the wilderness of sin, which lies between Elim and Sinai, and six weeks or more before the giving of the law at the "mount which burned with fire," and before the giving of the manna, the Sabbath law was made a test of their loyalty, "That I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no." Then followed the wonderful provision of manna, with its miraculous adjustments, which continued for forty years, until they entered into the land of Canaan. God thus honoring his own day of rest by an object lesson of weekly occurrence and of long continuance.

This eliminates all possible errors of dates or seasons or countings between creation and the settlement in Canaan. There can be no possible error left. To suggest the possibility of one, or to ask for evidence concerning the Sabbath and the antediluvians is but an impertinence towards God. The Sabbath was made for man, and man has, no doubt, always had its observance commanded.

Gal. 4:4, 5: "But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons," that is, he came down into our place that he might lift us up, to be partakers with him in his place. It is said of this "Son" in Col. 1:16, "For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities or powers; all things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things and by him all things consist." When this Son came he doubtless knew his own Sabbath day, for he was the Creator of it, and he was the one who "sanctified" it. He still kept it as his Sabbath day, for he was born under the law in his humanity, and he still declared himself to be "the Lord of the Sabbath day." He cleared away the rubbish that the Jews had gathered around it, taught us how to keep it as Christians should, and wound up his teaching by declaring that it "was lawful to do well on the Sabbath days." He justified acts of necessity and of mercy. This leaves the seventh day in full force, as his only recognized Sabbath day. Ours is the "Julian Calendar," established by Julius Caesar, from whom it derives its name, as does the month of July. He established his calendar on the basis of a better knowledge of the length of a year than had before obtained. He was the first of the Cassars, and was followed by Augustus, just as the month of August follows July.

It was the decree of Caesar Augustus "that all the world should be taxed," as given by Luke, that brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. Caesar's estimate of the length of a year was not absolutely correct, and this led to the correction by Pope Gregory, when Catholic nations passed from old style to what is called new style. Russia still rejects this new style, and her dates are to this day purely Julian. The weekly cycle was not affected by this change, for the Russian Church has the same order of days in the week as does the Catholic countries of the west of Europe. When it is Saturday at London it is Saturday at St. Petersburg. This brings us down to our own day, with no possibility of error in the weekly cycle.

Saturday is still the seventh day of the week, and it is "the Sabbath of the Lord our God."
