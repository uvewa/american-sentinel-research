## A Seventh-day Baptist in the National Reform Convention.

*[The Sabbath Recorder publishes the following from the Pittsburg Press as the timely and apt language of Rev. A. H. Lewis, in the National Reform Convention lately held at Allegheny. Dr. Lewis was given five minutes at the close of a forenoon session, after twelve o'clock.]*

WHEN I saw the call for this convention, and the scope of the themes to be considered, I thought it large enough to include the discussion of the claims of the Sabbath as an important factor in the question of Sabbath reform, hence I came here as an accredited delegate from the American Sabbath Tract Society. But as your committee on "enrollment" has decided that I may not be recognized under the "call," I thank you for the courtesy of these minutes. I am in hearty accord with you touching the questions of Temperance, Social Purity, Divorce, Chinese Exclusion, Labor Problem, Negro Problem, etc. We Seventh-day Baptists recognize the Bible and the religion of Christ as the only source of help in the solution and adjustment of these problems. But the larger question on which I desire to speak to you, not merely as a Seventh-day Baptist, but as a Christian man to Christian men, is the fundamental error in your efforts toward Sabbath reform. The Bible is the only standard by which that question can be settled, and according to that Book the primary trouble, and the paramount error, lies with Christians. You say that Christians support the Sunday papers in Pittsburg, patronize the Sunday trains, etc. In this you are right. Christians began the work of demoralization, of destroying conscience, long ago when they cast the Sabbath and God's law aside, and put Sunday and the civil law in their place. In the English Reformation, your English and Scotch ancestors, standing between the fire from the Roman Catholics on one side and the English Seventh-day Baptists on the other, undertook to compromise the matter by transferring the law of God to the Sunday. Honest as the effort may have been, and earnest and conscientious as you may now be, this disregarding of the Sabbath and God's law has destroyed the public conscience. You complain that men disregard Sunday and the civil law; you, as Christians, set the example by first disregarding God's law and his Sabbath.

This is not a matter between you and the Seventh-day Baptists. It is between you and God. The important question is not whether you shall grant me membership or courtesy in this convention, but how you will settle your attitude toward God's day with him. Day after to-morrow you will come to God's day, his holy Sabbath, the day which Christ de-Judaized, kept, honored, enlarged, and purified to make it the Christian Sabbath; will you make it your "busy Saturday" regardless of what God's Word says? You may think that the question of the "change of the Sabbath" is settled. It is not. Sinai is a granite fact. Christ's observance of the Sabbath—not Sunday—is a fact; soon or late, you, and the Christian world, must meet this issue. I speak courteously but with an earnestness born of conviction. This is my present mission to you. I stand to defend God's Sabbath, and to urge its claims, and I thank you again for this brief opportunity of suggesting this the fundamental error in popular "Sabbath reform."
