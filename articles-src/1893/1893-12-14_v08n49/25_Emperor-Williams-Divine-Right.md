THE Emperor William, Germany's young war lord, is credited with this utterance, in a recent speech to his soldiers:—

> I want Christian soldiers who say their Lord's Prayer. Soldiers are not to have a will of their own. You must have but one will, and that is my will; one law, and that is my law.

It is difficult to determine from this just what the emperor means. It seems, however, to be an assertion of divine right, and that to the extent that his will is identical with that of the Author of the Lord's Prayer, so that in praying "Thy will be done," the "Christian" soldier might have in mind equally the will of Christ and of Emperor William! And yet we are living in the last decade of the nineteenth century. Times have, in some respects changed, but have men changed with them as much as we sometimes imagine?
