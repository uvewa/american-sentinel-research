THE Papists having felt the public pulse upon the question of State aid to parochial schools, and ascertained that their proposed concerted raid upon the treasuries of several of the States will probably meet with successful opposition, are preparing for a graceful retreat. The recent circular advocating State aid to sectarian schools was, at the time of its issue, credited to Cardinal Gibbons, and it was positively stated that it was issued with his approval. Now the Baltimore Sun denies positively that the circular emanated from the cardinal, and states that the Catholics of Maryland are divided in opinion on the question of State aid for parochial schools.

A Roman Catholic, who is supposed to know the sentiments of Catholics on this question, is credited with this utterance:—

> I believe the majority of intelligent Catholics are opposed to the plan. I further believe Cardinal Gibbons has no hand in the plan and is lending it neither active nor moral support. He would undoubtedly see that to urge the appropriation asked for would be bad politics, if there were no other considerations. Personally, I think the cardinal has too much reverence for American institutions to favor any such movement.

> I do not know what the outcome of the movement in New York will be, but you can safely say that in Maryland the legislature will not, at this session, be asked for aid for Roman Catholic parochial schools.

Doubtless the cardinal has too much "reverence" for public opinion to do anything that he has reason to believe would arouse successful opposition on the part of Protestants. But the closing words of this quotation amount to a confession that a raid on the public treasury in the interest of sectarian schools is contemplated, but that it is not to be made at this session of the legislature. Very unfortunately for the positive denial of the Baltimore Sun, the *Catholic Review* of the 9th inst. states that the circular in question was issued "by the direction of Cardinal Gibbons."
