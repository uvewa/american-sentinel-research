OCTOBER 5, we printed an article from the *Christian Standard*, written by Jas. A. DeMoss, M.D., and entitled, "Our One Great Danger." The article was sent to us, and the date of the paper from which it was taken was not furnished. Its authenticity was subsequently challenged, but we are happy to say that we now have in this office the paper in which the article first appeared, namely, the *Christian Standard* of August 12, 1893. The doubting Thomases may satisfy themselves of the genuineness of the article by writing to the *Christian Standard* 16-20 East Ninth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio. It appeared on page 18 of the paper, 644 of the volume.
