[This article is from the editorial page of the daily newspaper published and edited by the editors Eliot McCormick and Professor Kick for the instruction of the community.]

ON Monday the pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, of this city, and a teacher of a school at a Grange, were arrested each 80 and costs for the offense of disorderly conduct, which consisted in their employing carpenters to do some repair work in the new church building. They were, no doubt, technically guilty of Sabbath-breaking, which is a State offense. A fine of $80 each, or 60 days for disorderly conduct, in which life, limb, or property were not endangered, and in which the deed was done in a pursuit of a useful occupation of the community for the service of those whose foundation for such a revival. The continuance of synods and conferences and the wisdom of great makers will prove more wise but the measure was treated to a higher spirit of the gospel. A few words to the faithful concerning ourselves in this matter: It would not be far from the entire truth to say that one of the first steps toward reform is the creating of a conscience on these matters.

All this the ones because men have disturbed the Sabbath, and they know from honest opinion and conscience. The horror they dare not mourn for these on biblical grounds and those so faithful.

Shall statute grounds —"Exempt of the institution of synods and conferences and the wisdom of great makers will prove more wise the measure was treated to a higher spirit of the faith.

A few days ago several persons, men and females, were up before the mayor's court for raising the tallied Kind of Cain in the community in celebration. It was proved that they indulged in fighting, the neighbor testified that he was exceedingly disorderly, that he had a big drum, and the officer was the nearest in his line of thorns while the carousel lasted. The judge assessed the offenders only $1 which seemed to satisfy the ends of justice.

Now our Seventh-day Adventist friends were, not guilty of disorderly conduct. Their conduct was orderly and useful and not an element in creating a case of disorder. Their fine was $80.

The carnival offenders were guilty of disorderly. The use of saw and hammer in each of these establishments is not a disorderly conduct. Sabbath-breaking, and and when their use becomes on as Sunday has nothing to do with disorder. If the man cannot be distracted on Sunday by a hiding place in which his occupation is pursued, it seemed to bear an unreasonable aspect on the whole, shut that in and on the public peace, the Adventist could not then be disorderly, hammer on Sunday would be as much an element of disturbance as on any other day. But as far as this can be questioned, these men with heavenly meditations were as orderly as any body of men in the city, while to go to the expense of protecting others from their noise.

We are opposed to all forms of Sabbath legislation, as we have stated and as we are committed to the very letter. But the point we are making is that the Sabbath by continuing to a concentration of conviction, this seems to be its focal point. It is better in this particular for a worker for the Adventist to saw lumber on the inside of a building than it is for the farmer of horses that have worked all week to stand at the post and be devoured by flies all day Sunday, but that is not to be made an issue of disturbance. What for? To furnish a case for the prosecution of the Sunday law that is on the statute—is it is for its own purpose to persecute in pursuit of that narrow-minded intolerance from which no brutes are robbed of their God-given right to rest.

It is commanded of God that our homes are to be preserved from harm. It is right, and we cannot take that right away from any one, for any purpose. From this comes the case of another kind. A man who was, on Sunday, walking, holidaying, sitting on his step, fishing, or going out in his buggy, man, on a Sunday, hitting his horse and driving his family out on a jaunt to his neighbors, or taking his family to a camp meeting, commits a worse sin in the eyes of the law. And the man who stands and works in the field, for he not only "desecrates the day of rest," but incites the unwilling animals to do likewise and to eat. But there is no penalty. He is not convicted of disorderly conduct.

He is a carpous case. A good old gentleman of the Seventh-day Baptist persuasion escapes from his orns in his pasture lot. He eats all the sweet corn between him and his last Sunday call. Hunting— he finds him absorbed in the contemplation of the daisies in a meadow and picks him up and drives him home. He passes the drug store where the man stands on the step and smokes cigars which the druggist has just sold him. And as he drives home he is arrested at the crossing for the dead to abolish, for driving his horse on Sunday. Now an old kitchen and thither on pleasure bent, he has an asset in the case, were it to were with jingles bells and horses starting their fine qualities in the morning air.
