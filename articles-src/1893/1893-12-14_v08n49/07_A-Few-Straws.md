IN the *Catholic Mirror* of October 28, appeared a very significant article by Cardinal Gibbons concerning the growth of the Catholic Church. Among the statements made by the cardinal may be of interest to reply to critics of that estimation, since he is the second highest representative of the Pope in the United States. Of the growth of the church in this country he says:—

It is by the light of her past that we must read the pages of her future. In this country her organization has changed, her hierarchy, her organization [the church], her work, her charities, are as ample and complete to-day as they were when Columbus first planted the cross on these shores. And yet in the course of these four hundred years what changes have come to, there are a hundred new Roman Catholic organizations. The Jesuits, Carthusians, Dominicans and other religious groups, and the hierarchy, the archives of the Catholic Church, all show that there has been no lack of ambition. Catholic has raised the cross on American soil.

Put with the following from Mr. Sieger, in his "Plain Talk about Protestantism of To-day":—

The church is certainly totalitant in matters of principle. Heresies, she says, she endures when and what is false is false. No compromise between error and truth. Her very opponents will admit that, concession, however small, would prove an immeasurable step in her downfall. She makes no terms with error; she is indulged in, says a mixture of falsehood, error, a falsehood.

Does not Rome pride on maintaining truths as she understands them, while she disseminates and divides her truths with as much endeavor as she applies to anything else? And this is what is more logical? The Catholic Church alone, of all Christian denominations, has always been true to true Christianity. She alone has the conscience of the country at heart; and she alone has the power—the only power—to look after her counsels. "I say one oath or believing is worth a thousand counsels with the infidels."

Here we have the record in part of the Roman Church. Testimony could be multiplied upon this point of its intolerance, but sufficient is quoted, and coupled with the declarations of the cardinal, it is plain the church is beginning to boast herself, and claim the front, held only the attention and the most powerful spiritual organization of conscience of men. It would be well, if indeed we are not already too late, to consider whether in its efforts to make theology a branch of the public school system and education work for the future of the Roman Church in this country. The National Union of Roman authority by the establishment of the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the Sabbath, contrary to the Bible one side of Protestantism at one time], which the Romanists admit, and the Protestants have been drawn out of Rome, through the *Catholic Mirror*, to a guenacy. The fact that Sunday observance is as much an institution of the Roman Catholic Church, and was done lately, in September, 1893, ought to show that the Protestantism? Who will answer for her?

Says the *Shepherd of the Valley* (1850), a Roman Catholic paper, published under direction of Archbishop Kendrick:—

We confess that the Roman Catholic Church is intolerant; this is to say, that she uses every means in her power to root out heresy; but her intolerance is the results of her unchangeable faith. She alone has the right to be intolerant for she possesses the truth. The church tolerates heretics only where she is obliged to exercise intolerant; but she hates with a mortal hate, wherever she is able, she oppresses it, that she strives to her morality, and employs all her force to ensure the extermination. Witness the promulgation of the Syllabus and the last decree of the Vatican Council. Her exercise will certainly be the same by and by, although the means to be adopted may vary, according to the civil condition of the United States. Our exercise any this and we have stated is one which the very nature of herself would not pretend to be better than our Church, and no other Church is so good as ours. Then why do they tolerate the exercise of a false religion and tolerate heretics in the middle ages, and how she did once. Does she not exercise exclusive methods? She does of blaming the saints of God and the princes of the kingdom of heaven for the judgments of the people in the work of destroying heresy and its enemies.

Pope MARCELLUS directed:—

"Princes under whatever form or pretence to all Roman Catholics may show." The quotation is correct, and it has been proved by our enemies, that she shall be tolerated.—*Decretals of Gregory IX.*

Pope INNOCENT III. decreed:—

"We excommunicate every heresy, and any person or persons to all who receive or defend, or in any way protect heretics."

These quotations may be alleged to be ancient and of no moment in this enlightened age of civilization. If this be urged, the cardinal speaks volumes to this much in the preceding and in the following, that it has been the established policy of the Church in the past, has been a persecuting power, the very quotations from the Catholic press refute so. A few references from the modern train from which Catholic authority may now be found, one Pope Marcellus directed:—

"The quotation is correct, that it shall so continue that the Court of Rome does so."
