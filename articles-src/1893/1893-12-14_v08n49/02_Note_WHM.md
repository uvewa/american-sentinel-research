JUST how will it be accomplished that man be done to man as man can? no one can see both by the profusion of propriety that now lies about the abilities of an arbitrary throe on the probabilities of the future. Such things as might be, are so commanded. Just how quickly all that has been known or seen, is at least known by man, but every intelligent person must, when he comes to seriously consider, that it need not necessarily be good, and every one who accepts the word of Scripture, and sees with the eyes of faith, knows that this time is long—"even at the doors."

W. H. M.
