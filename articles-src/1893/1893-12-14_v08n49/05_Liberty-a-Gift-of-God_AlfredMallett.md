**Liberty a Gift of God.**

LIBERTY is something that every man loves. It is one of the many blessings the Creator has bestowed upon the human family; in fact, one of the chiefest blessings. What will make a man happier than to have his liberty,—to be free to go where he pleases, and to do as he pleases? It is just as natural for man to look for, and expect, freedom as it is for him to breathe,—this is the reason men have fought to the death in the past, and will do so until the consummation of all things rather than lose that most precious of all gifts. Liberty is dearer to man than even life itself. He will lay, and even has laid down, his life to bring liberty to his fellows. It is natural for him to do so, for God has made him so.

How miserable is the slave, who cannot do as he pleases, or go where he pleases; who is continually watched by those who lord it over him, and compel him to do as they order, or be punished! When freedom is gone, happiness is gone, too. Life is to that man as an empty dream. It is contrary to his nature to be a slave. God did not make him a bondman. He, in his mercy, knew that man would be a wretched creature without freedom, and so he made him a free moral agent, that is, a being that could either obey him or not obey him just as he chose. When man is living in sin, he is a captive, yet he has that liberty which God gave him in the beginning,—liberty to serve Him or to serve self. With this freedom there is happiness, no matter if that man may be in ever so wretched a condition—and every man outside of Christ is in a wretched condition—yet there is a certain degree of happiness that he would not have if he were bound even by his Creator.

But the child of God is the happiest of all his creatures. He is the one who is free, for Christ says: "Whom the Son makes free is free indeed." He is freed from sin, therefore he is happy, for he looks forward to an eternal life of happiness and bliss beyond this. God has joined freedom to him, and who is it that dares to put sounder that which God has joined? To whom has he given the right to take away that liberty which he has so graciously bestowed upon man?

We often hear it said that man was not made to live alone; he loves company, and neither was he made to live without liberty, for he loves that as much and more than he does society. Everything that man enjoys is a gift from God. Thus life is a gift from him, social joye are a gift from him, and liberty is a gift from him.

Then, if liberty is a gift from God, he certainly does not wish to force any of his creatures to serve him. The service he requires is a service of love. Man serves his Creator because of the multitude of his tender mercies; because of his love to him. Love draws; therefore, God, by the cords of love, draws man to himself; he does not force him.

But certain men, by their actions, say that God's way is not the right way; they have a better way to bring sinners to Christ; God's way is too slow for them. Sinners are rebellious, and will not of themselves come to God; therefore, the next best thing, to their mind, is to force men to come, and by this means to bring them in by the wholesale instead of one by one. To make God's people a large flock, instead of a "little flock." And all this is done in opposition to the will of God, just the opposite way to his way. His command to his ministers is, "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations;" not force all nations. No, no. That is not his way. His way is a loving way; any other way is just the contrary. The time is coming, yes, is near, when the Lord will inquire of those who use force to bring sinners to him, "Who hath required this at your hands?" What will they answer?

Until that time the true follower of God must not look for peace; he must not think he can get to heaven without a struggle, for prophecy must be fulfilled. The "little flock" will be going God's way, and therefore will not be going the way that suits the enemy, for his way is just the contrary to God's way. The child of God must expect persecution even as Christ, his Lord, was persecuted. He will not find peace, for the Saviour came not to bring peace, but a sword. "Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law." And so it is that whenever a little company steps out to serve God in God's way, it brings division, and others step in and say, you shall not serve God in that way, but our way; and so force is used, the only power at their hands. Have they a right to do this? They certainly have not, for where God himself repudiates that right, how much more should they. God made man free. Let him forever stay free, and so continue in happiness.
