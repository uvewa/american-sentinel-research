THAT the principle can be established in the United States, that the power of the Church or State to compel the observance of the State, that religious observances may be enforced by secular laws; in short, that the authority of Church and State to dominate the conscience, and the triumph of theocracy in this country is assured.

EVERY statute and municipal ordinance in this country, enforcing or promoting religion and religious observances, has had its origin in the Church and State theory, and been enacted from which our system of jurisprudence is derived. The theocratic spirit of Church and State which established these laws in the first place, has retained them in our statute books.

THEIR dormant seeds of persecution, which have lain covered and unnoticed in the statute books now for two generations, have, within the last few years, been brought to the light by the warmth of an immensely rapid growth. A body of associated religious organizations, such as never before existed, has undertaken to foster and cherish the growing iniquity.

IN every State there has been agitation for the enforcement of Sunday laws. Cases under the Sunday law, in one form or another, have been brought before the courts of almost all the States. In several States those laws have been avowedly used for religious persecution. Although the religious statute, standing thus in the doom, constrains both the spirit and the terms of the bill of rights of the Constitutions of the different States, and of the United States, still they have been, without exception, thus far, sustained by the decisions of the higher State courts. The Supreme Court of the United States, also, by concurring in Justice Brewer's opinion in the Trinity Church case, February 29, that this is a "Christian Nation," has given notice what position it will take on any case involving this question which it may be called upon to decide. The Congress of the United States has ratified this, and acted upon it in advance, in its legislation which it passed in reference to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The principles, then, that the Church may employ the power of the State,—that secular laws may enforce religious observances; and that the authority of Church and State, combined, shall dominate the conscience, is settled in the affirmative in this country.

THAT principle, which is the basis of papal policy, is now firmly fixed in the national statute, and in the judicial precedents of the different States. The farther development of this disastrous policy is being rapidly hastened, not only by the machinations of the Roman Catholic Church itself, but, even in a much greater degree, by the mistakes of Protestant denominations and the various other organizations, more or less avowedly religious in character. Some of these organizations are willing to join hands with the Roman Catholic Church in securing settled legislation as to the observance of Sunday, and, in fact, the declaration that the Catholic power should join them in obtaining a severe interpretation, and enforcement, of these laws by the courts. Other organizations believe themselves to be antagonistic to Roman Catholicism, and convincingly make that the main, and, in some instances, the only purport of their association,—still they generally serve the same end, for they can accomplish the same thing, only under the name of Protestantism, instead of Catholicism. To be sure there is a difference between Catholicizing and Protestantizing the civil and political institutions of this country; but it is not so great a distinction as a difference, as the sequel between Protestantism to the offspring and the image of its progenitor.

ONE strong and persistent influence continues, with increased energy, to assault Congress and the Nation's executive, to obtain, if possible, still greater and more the State with religion. While this is not strictly necessary, for their real purpose is already accomplished, still it will go far towards familiarizing the lawmakers of the country with the requirements which their religious advisers are putting upon them. It will also materially hasten the progress of their cause. If, by some such means as secured the passage of the act to close the World's Fair on Sunday, the acknowledgment of a State religion should be inserted in the fundamental law, then the cloak of pretended allegiance to the principles of civil liberty in religious things could be thrown off entirely, and the ascendancy of the papal principle, the very opposite of civil and religious liberty, would be complete. And that is what the most candid and logical, both of Roman Catholics and National Reformers, desire, and that is what they are planning to bring great influence to bear upon Congress during this session. It is not at all clear that they will succeed in getting the great and definite thing which they wish, but it is quite possible that they will succeed in effect, as the Sunday closing of the World's Fair was a practical and yet a theoretical success at the same time.

THOSE who are assisting to create a Protestant satellite to the Papacy with a view to, or against fighting Roman Catholicism, they are, it is, are thin. This conclusion is based not merely upon a demonstration of the principle, which they throw around when they draw into the ranks the realm of civil religion. No; Roman Catholicism may well cherish them as its dearest friends, the enemy. It is a fraternal foe. The Christian world know that the longest way round is the shortest way home, this is vividly exemplified in the case of those who are now advancing the progress of the Papacy under the disguise of anti-papal methods. No significant resistance in civil affairs could possibly be denied than that which has been taken. By religious teaching in State-supported Church, or ever setting out organized and in this country, the one holding the Pontifical authority has aroused a selfish opposition which demands the same thing of its own faith, and proceeds to obtain it by means which are in themselves Romanizing of the country.
