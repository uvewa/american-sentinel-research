THE *Outlook* states, upon the authority of a correspondent who has interviewed the directors upon the subject, that the Midwinter Exposition in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, will be open on Sunday. The *Outlook* (formerly the *Christian Union*) expresses the opinion that "the directors would best subserve the moral interests, and even the interests of Sunday preservation, were they to open the fair in the afternoon and evenings, stop the machinery, forbid sales, and not provide for special and extraordinary attractions, such as fireworks on Sunday evening."
