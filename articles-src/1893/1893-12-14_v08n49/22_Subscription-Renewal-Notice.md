A LARGE number of subscriptions are about to expire. These should be promptly renewed in order to avoid missing a single number of this paper. The opening of the new volume will be signalized by a series of articles from the Editor on the Catholic question, now one of the living issues in this country. We do not want to lose a single old subscriber, but on the contrary to gain many new ones; and certainly no old subscriber can afford to be without the paper in view of the important themes to be discussed in its pages in the near future. Any person sending us four new subscriptions, with four dollars, will receive the SENTINEL free for the year 1894.
