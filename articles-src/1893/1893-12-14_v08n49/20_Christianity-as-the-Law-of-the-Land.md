A CLERGYMAN of Philadelphia says we shall have no return of prosperity "until Christianity shall be recognized as the law of the land." *Judge* quotes this and adds this comment: "Here is your Church and State with a vengeance—such a vengeance as would leave no free-thinker or honest questioner with a head safe to remain on his shoulders. Oh, let us never be so good in our way that we can't let somebody else be good in his way."
