IT is a curious illustration of the moral weakness, but also perhaps of the numerical strength, of the present majority in the Presbyterian Church, that some of its distinguished representatives are ostensibly proposing to resort to the boycott for shutting out some who attract from their Seminary. The boycott was first introduced into civilization mainly by the [Papal] institution, and it was a method by which was termed excommunication. It was applied to not only put the offender off from a future state, but on earth to cut the excommunicated person of from all material connection to serve him. The service from the Church by the union those who have made a vigorous effort to introduce it into American civil and political affairs on the whole, with much distinct ill success. It is, therefore, a significant fact that, with a curious anachronism that it should be adopted by a wing of the Presbyterian Church.

This fuss will be found given in some quarters an importance which it does not deserve. The Briggs controversy between scholars of the New York Presbytery and other officials of the Church had involved a great deal of strong feeling upon both sides. Now the effort is to prevent their own faithful students under its care to correspond or to have intercourse, in their seminary while under the ban of the General Assembly. This has caused a proposition by which no minister can present himself for license to the Presbytery if he has studied his education in that Seminary. The broad interest of this measure lies in its claimed nature, by opposing the same principle to be applied in civil and political affairs.

Suppose, for example, that the College or the medical school of Bellevue, or the University were to announce to the general public that it would be a disadvantage to be instructive to any one who had studied in the Columbia Law School, or Union College, or that Columbia College, from which two or three of the great universities have sprung, should establish an institution on the outside a new Law School down town, and that the Medical School should publish to the country in the newspapers that no men shall be admitted to the Bar who were graduates of that institution. These methods of conducting warfare are not less narrow-minded than they are tyrannical. When produced by doctrines of divinity in secular institutions they are tyrannical; produced by a presbytery in a somewhat antiquated fashion they would be tyrannical also, but with the additional objection that they are an inconsistency and practically of the Protestant pulpit; and they have no more legal force than the bull of the Pope from that corner where he got his clothes.—*The Christian Union.*
