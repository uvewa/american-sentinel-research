"It is now in order," remarks the *Buffalo Courier,* "to decorate Good Justice Fuller as a heretic." It will doubtless be done by a certain part of the religious press. Even before the final decision of the Court of Appeals, the Christian Alliance intimated that the Chief Justice granted the representatives because "his duty to represent that office it was not of a Chicago lawyer." "Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad." The Statesman is mad.
