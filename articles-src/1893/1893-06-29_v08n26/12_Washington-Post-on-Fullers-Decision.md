THE WASHINGTON POST Says of Chief Justice Fuller's decision in the Sunday, closing injunction suit, that it "is final and decisive; and while the Sunday-closers may regret it and still be disposed to agree with the lower court, there is no alternative left them but to accept the situation as it is defined by the highest of all judicial tribunals. It is a decision that, aside from the legal points on which it was handed down, will be regarded by a vast majority of the liberal-minded and intelligent citizens of the country as in entire consonance with the principles of justice, fairness and equity, contravening neither the divine nor the moral law, and in the nature of a benefaction to hundreds of thousands who were otherwise debarred from the educational privileges of the Exposition."
