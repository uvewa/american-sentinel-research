It is to be regretted that the decision of the Court of Appeals in the World's Fair injunction suit did not touch the constitutional questions involved; namely, the right of Congress to do by indirection that which it is by the Constitution forbidden to do directly.

The Constitution provides that "Congress shall not make a law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." But in championing the cause of Sunday observance by conditioning an appropriation on Sunday closing of the Fair, Congress certainly interfered in a religious matter and took sides as between contending religious factions, and that on strictly religious grounds. It would have been interesting to know, to say the least, had this question of the Court of Appeals on the meaning and scope of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

SUNDAY is a religious institution. The Sunday-closing proviso was urged and passed on religious grounds. Senator Quay's argument in favor of the measure quoted the fourth commandment which he went so far as to find that the church might read from his family Bible. These facts are not denied; they are even the boast of the friends of the Sunday-closing proviso; for it is admitted that our national legislation has made a set of but concerning religion and religious observance. Did it in this go outside the Constitution?

It was certainly the purpose of the framers of the Constitution to prohibit to Congress all acts affecting the free exercise of religious faith and practice. This was the opinion entertained by President Jefferson, who refused on this ground to issue thanksgiving proclamations. Both the Senate and the House refused on the same ground in 1829 and 1830 to suspend Sunday mails. Has the Constitution changed in this respect? Hardly; though the times have. Now if Congress can condition one appropriation on a religious observance, on the observance of a religious institution, it can certainly make similar conditions to all appropriations. Then we might have in a little while all state-route mail contracts made with the provision that the mail carriers must be professors of the Christian religion; and the River and Harbor Bill might be passed with the proviso: "Provided, however, that all contractors for work authorized by this bill shall be church members and shall call all their employes together at least once a day during the progress of the work, for reading of the Scriptures and for prayer." This, it might plausibly be argued, would not be in violation of the Constitution, for no ecclesiastical organization would be established by it; and every man would be left free to belong to the church of his choice. But it would be generally recognized as a violation of the spirit of the Constitution, it would, however, be no more so than was the attempt to bolster up the Sunday institution by act of Congress.

THE World's Fair makes the point against the attitude of certain Methodists:—

> Some Protestant Methodism believes have already decided that "it would be cowardice for all Christians and loyal Americans to withhold their patronage from an exhibition kept open on the Christian Sabbath in defiance of the claim of Christians against the voice of religion of Christians and the law of the land." But the United States Court of Appeals has expressly decided that the courts of the World's Fair on Sunday is not contrary to the law of the land; and further that the decision of the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals is now authoritative upon that subject against Methodists.

Both the preachers and the World are mistaken. The preachers, because the Sunday-closing proviso is not in any sense law. If it were law it could be enforced by the courts, and some penalty would attach to its violation. It is a legal maxim that "a law without a penalty is no law at all." Congress does not make a law for the government of a State corporation, as the Columbian Exposition is. The World is mistaken, because the United States Court of Appeals did not decide that to run the World's Fair on Sunday is not contrary to "the law of the land." That which the court decided was simply that that opening could not be prevented by injunction. It seems altogether probable, however, that a suit to recover the value of the seven-cent court would be entertained, for there has certainly been a violation of contract. But it likewise seems plain to us that it was a contract which Congress had no right to make, and which would not be sustained by an impartial court. If Congress can use public funds to purchase the observance of a religious institution, then the First Amendment to the Constitution is of very much less value than was formerly supposed. This question ought to be settled.

But the Methodists should remember that they, in common with other exhibitors, are under contract not to remove their exhibits until the close of the Fair. They are not justified in violating their contract with the Fair because the managers violated their contract with the Government.
