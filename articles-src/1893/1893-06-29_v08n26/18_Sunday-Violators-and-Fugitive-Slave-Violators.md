There is a good point made in the article, "A Convention of the Forty Millions," on page 202, wherein it is related that one of the speakers, while denouncing violators of the Sunday-closing proviso, boasted of how he had violated the Fugitive Slave law. The fact is that no man who is a man will obey any law that involves a surrender of conscience. The Sunday law advocates are, however, slow to admit the right of any one to violate their pet measures. But there are thousands of people who can no more observe Sunday than the old minister could betray an escaped slave.
