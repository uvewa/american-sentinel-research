God will care for his own truth; he has never authorized any man or set of men to enforce it. But he has commissioned all the powers of the world above to work in its behalf. He who stands on the side of truth stands with the great and only victorious majority. Even though, compassed with and overfaced forms of opposition, the strength of the truth may appear small.

> Be patient to endure well in all ages. The enemies of God are but a trodden worm.

Jesus Christ is the embodiment of truth. He said: "I am the way, the truth, and the life." The same truths that Jesus taught and lived and exemplified in his life are contained in the written Book. Jesus says, "Thy word is truth." Since God has committed himself to the truth as it is in Jesus, except to his received and written Word, and since Christ Jesus will certainly have the mind of Christ. He has the less reason to be anything that is not in harmony with the followers. "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross." Phil. 2:5-8. He said "I am not come to judge all men." Jesus was Judge of all men, and yet while on earth. Matt. 18:11. He had "power over all flesh," and it was given to him to be equal to the Father. But although he possessed such power, he never descended from the true dignity of his real power to compel any man to receive his truth. He disclaimed any disposition to do anything of the kind. He draws men to himself, but he never drives them. Men cannot be driven toward the truth or toward God. "My sheep know my voice before me flock, and they follow." He cannot drive but he calls, in a still gentle voice, and his irresistible devotion to others of grace. He encourages his followers with these words: "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." John 8:31, 32.
