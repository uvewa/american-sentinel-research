*(Concluded.)*

"Then Seventh-day Adventists actually believe that they follow their convictions and work on Sunday?" was asked. The speaker was so hopelessly entangled and made no effort to escape but failed. When this question was asked of one of the leaders of the movement that the suggestion that the enemy was in the camp, rushed up to the speaker and whispered a warning, after which the speaking adjourned in hot haste. And this was a meeting of the "forty million." The men and the women who are really in sympathy with the constitution and not in sympathy with this unconstitutional legislation, because they are men who are in sympathy with the crucifixion of Christ. As above, no, to a far greater number, the leaders that are working to the ruin.

W. H. BALLENGER.

The broad historical protestations of the Reformers, strong as they were in the hearty spirit against the abuses and evil of the papal church and hierarchy, one might reasonably expect them to repudiate both Church and State as a natural consequence; but this the Reformers failed to do. While deserving the merit of having bravely, yet clearly reserved for later times, insomuch as the Reformation itself was concerned, and the church organization was concerned, the Reformation champions did not get much beyond the relation of dependence which the Church had heretofore maintained in a national sense.

As far as the organization of the reformatory matters, Luther had fair to bring the church back to her ultimate ground of all independence, and independence. He took the position, that the Scriptures are the well in all ourselves of believers in Christ, throughout the world, no one, according to his teachings, is to acknowledge any power started office whatever, without the sanction of the community or congregation; further, that the Church herself was to take no part in politics, but was to contain the necessary source of its maintenance and work by direct levies upon its own members and none others. In this which he then drew up the organizations and maintenance of active work and of churches, he says among other things, the following:

> Jesus does nothing in Christian reality and society in a worldly but in a godly manner, by word and deed, at all times and every where, freely, and without the exercise of authority or temporal effect, and should assemble in private houses, by common and mutual consent, and do whatever is Christian and good.

These political disturbances of those times would, inevitably at least, were connected with the freedom of thought advocated by the reformers, caused Luther to doubt the practicability of his ideal, on that, in spite of the telling testimonies concerning the true relation of the Church to the civil government. The fact that "Luther found that his true communion was not a properly ordered body work as it should be." In fact, it was the increasing bold adversaries to introduce and establish confusion, caused him "with much reluctance" to issue a pamphlet, published later, he went even so far as to set up a definition which struck a direct blow at his own views as expressed formerly, in regard to the Church; for he therein says: "Where baptism, preaching, Christians." And the gospel are found let no one doubt that Christians units are there too, as those they be nothing but babes in the cradle." He maintained also he was led to make the 'outward' form the essential thing, and the issue manifests a matter of minor import. State churches have the former but not the latter.

In the commencement of his measures of reform, Luther expressed himself very freely and freely to regard the relation the church should sustain to the State. When, as then appears even from the other "side," he said: he, "I respect to religion, government can give no commands to the conscience. The State has no right to interfere, neither in preaching and teaching, nor in worship against heretics, he is by public punishment, or in any other way." But in this important point, also, Luther allowed himself, and in later years, to go, and went in the opposite direction. After the protest of Spires, in 1529, the Reformers thus not only placed directly under State protection, but Luther made it out to be the duty of the government to care for the Christian education of its youth, and to regulate church affairs, to their material buildings at east. This action, of transferring the authority over the Church, in good faith and confidence, to the civil ruler, meant the sacrifice of the Church her inalienable right of self-government, a deplorable step toward making the Church a department of and subject to the State. Thereby, however, the life of the Church at once most decidedly weakened, for henceforth her material interests was in a very large degree made dependent upon the government and her spiritual condition, instead of being directly dependent on God and the resources they manifested toward them, was to be shaped by whatever views or convictions the ruling power held, in that line. The bitter fruit-fruits of the most fatal harvest that are to come from this pernicious seed, Luther himself was destined to see and taste; for in his later life we find him in a position in which to bemoan and deplore, the serious defects and all but life-killing evils that prevailed, and that the glorious work of the Reformation was in mighty danger of being overthrown by the evil within the churches, partly force of the time existing circumstances, but largely through the shortcomings and of morals of those in the progress of morals as revolutionary, and brought to a stand-still, so that he could see in the line, instead of being a naturalized the primitive and apostolic order of things in a living church, free from the State, an institution, guided directly by the Spirit of God, a mere lifeless institution, governed and settled in the—it stopped short of fully reaching the point of a correction of the doctrine, retaining a number of the errors, and some forms and strongly poisonous one at that, of its parent body, and with all the freedom of entire subjection to, and dependence upon, the secular arm, for independence and protection.

Whilst we must concede to Luther the pre-eminence, as the chief instrument of bringing into recognition again of the principle of justification by faith, taught by the Apostle Paul, of justification by faith in Christ, the great majority of the German-speaking peoples, for giving them in his to a fair and in his organized faith's style and style, yet terse and forcible in language—the Holy Scriptures in their own, mother-tongue, which ever since stood to them as a lofty beacon light of eternal truth; yet the apostolical organization, the soul independence of the Church has been in a large measure kept from the people mainly in consequence of his later and public work. A prominent German Reformed (Bidden) says of the Lutheran Church, that she is not of so much authority in the active exercise of some most important rights, as an object, carrying out perfect rights, as an object, carrying out the most deposed power.

Singularly enough, the relation of the Church to the State, in Switzerland, being an outcome of the Swiss Reformation, took shape quite similarly to that in Germany, and since the Reformation itself in its characteristic features was essentially proper has now, under its comparatively freer institutions, established a measure of rights and privileges in ecclesiastical matters, essentially more liberal than the contribution from the government to the Church, and commenced that it should be for the Christian education of the young; are now conceded to the State the right to direct ecclesiastical matters. The head of the government, and its council, together with the clergy, consider the ecclesiastical and spiritual affairs of the Church, and make all binding arrangements for the same; the Church, however, has the liberty to raise objections, and the council upon the administration, of the latter make suggestions to the government for its consideration.

The churches generally guard, under the governments, the privileges of the Church in matters of organization, for their material existence, and give in so doing of for more and direct the selection as to the rules of membership. Calvin agreed with Luther that God is in the Church, and of the church from Zwingli in the same, but in matters of more rigid severity upon church discipline. "No secular authorities should be allowed to install a preacher into office without the consent of the Church and a consistent, composed of clergy and ruling elders, the existence of the right and administrated the rights of full church government." This naturally does not suit with both clergy and laity enslaved subjects any more than it suits many in civil government. The French Reformed, likewise the Holland, or more correctly the (Dutch) Reformed Churches were all organized upon the after model of the church at Geneva.

All these churches guard, under the governments, the privileges of the Church. The Church in the Greek Catholic Church of Russia, where the emperor, or czar, is also the patriarch, the united priestly head of the realm; and a Romism relation can read as a member of the Greek Church, for the special reason of its great political control of its life, though acceptance by immersion is required and faith in God, worshipped under special names as by the Greek ritual in Russia, is also the true fold. Bishop Benjamin, of Northern Russia, who has been for years a publicist hurt every year, which harbored the unfortunate Baptists far more than is improved there. A certain number of tracts, and otherwise, have been summarily off, and inscribed in a special list as enemies for so much of his work. The term "vagabonds and tramps, baptized," and on the dais fired would be driven, from the terms of the country, a sentence, and him left in the prisons of Lancastria as found. I made a letter from a devout Baptist, who was arrested on Sunday, and who describes himself as hiding in the forest, then coming in at night to his wife, all unwilling to be baptized, and earnestly praying to be ready yet another day. In January last year, who had come to St. Petersburg to plead for toleration. As the bulk of these unfortunate people are Jason the facilities right of the

meaning of Christianity, and cannot reach the only language understood by their apostles, they can only appeal to the upper things from to them in the field. Prince Meschcerky, that reformed traveler of the Turishen, published a detailed account of the matter some months ago, in consequence of which inquiries warranted in the Russian government. "I cannot, they are Christ's; I would, was the reply. The cases of these are very much alike." But the point in this difference: his Roman Catholic liberty; although, though his impunity censures them—

"But of all the Christian sects in Russia, the Stundists are by far the most cruelly treated. They may be truly broadly described as Evangelical Christians, who endeavor to worship God in spirit and in truth, and put doctrines for his will—or they conceive it—above compliance with the claims of the Russian Orthodox rule. These, who take life as a statement and face only God, who are a statement, who are the direct spokesmen of God and Their God's love, be the results that the Saviour came to solve in the mass, are cast into the foulest dens, separated from their families of practice, Jesus lovers, and all liberty. If men will not accept, it can melt but there is consciousness of strength in the cause of God that give to the believer unspeakable confidence in him in whom "all fullness dwells"; and who is alone able to do and to bear, knowing that his cause will triumph."

But when we contrast this into the modern era of modern-day sect and human practice, Error requires the assistance of carnal weapons. As it cannot have left alone, it must seek that which compels it from benefit. This is the only advantage it has ever had. Error does always employ force; it more frequently uses its repetitions and persecution. It uses every possible art to win followers and is as scrupulous as to the character of the means, so long as it attained its purposes.

But we may set it down, that what employs it as at stake, represented by physical force, the truth of religious and civil freedom cannot be destroyed; cannot be and can only be used in connection with that which is not true.

If coercion be introduced into any church, in the name of God and its sacredness, to that when any religious or even any exclusive, employs force in its prosecution, we may know that that is not the work of God.

It is a tacit confession of the weakness of that cause when those who advocate it believe that the people cannot be won. In working for God appeal to Christ for assistance. No one who has the truth has any need of such help, nor can he afford to accept it if it be offered.

But the frequency of error leads in advance to seek such help. Those who acknowledge that they are not right, search the Lord, and can point to the evidence that men, when left free to investigate what they seek, are not found at Christ's patriotism, for, constrained by love, desire to give force to their doctrine. Those who teach the pure Word of God have the energy of the Holy Spirit to attend their teaching, and they need use no earthly force. But when the gospel becomes divine; when the word of man takes place of the Word of God, then the heavenly energies are withdrawn, and to support the tottering house the carnal arm is brought into requisition.
