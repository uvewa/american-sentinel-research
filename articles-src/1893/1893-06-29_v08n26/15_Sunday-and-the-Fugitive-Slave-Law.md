IT is a good point made in the article, "A Convention of the Forty Million" on page 202, wherein it is related that certain of the speakers, while denouncing violators of the Sunday-closing proviso, boasted of how he had violated the Fugitive-slave law. The fact is that no man who is a man will obey any law that involves a surrender of conscience. The Sunday law advocates can, however, allow to submit that the right of any one to violate their pet measure. But there are thousands of people who can no more observe Sunday than the 46 minister can refuse an escaped slave.
