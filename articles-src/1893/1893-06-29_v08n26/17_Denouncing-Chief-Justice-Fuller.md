"It is now in order," remarks the Buffalo Courier, "to denounce Chief Justice Fuller as a heretic." It will doubtless be done by a certain part of the religious press. Even before the final decision of the Court of Appeals, the Christian Statesman insinuated that the Chief Justice granted the supersedeas because "until his appointment to that office he was a Chicago lawyer." "Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad." The Statesman is mad.
