It was stated in Chicago on the 22d inst., that a large number of exhibitors who installed their exhibits under a contract with the Exposition authorities that the Exposition should be open only for six days in the week unless otherwise provided and authorized by Congress, had determined to ask an injunction from the United States Court to close the Fair on Sundays. Prominent in the movement were the Keystone Driller Company, of Beaver Falls, Pa.; the Downie Pump Company, Valencia, Pa.; and the Elastic Tip Company, Boston, Mass. It is said that within an hour after the paper was circulated it had received over one hundred signatures. The same morning an address to the country was adopted appealing to persons interested either on the grounds of patriotism, morality, national commercial honor, or personal interest, for sympathy and financial aid in "dispelling the stigma surrounding the matter, and making the Fair a brilliant national success worthy Americans." The address says three-fifths of the exhibits have been covered on Sundays; that a great number of exhibitors requiring power have utterly refused to set their machinery in motion at all while the Fair is open on Sunday, and that exhibitors will be seriously injured by the action of religiously inclined people East and West in deciding to stay away from the Fair while open Sundays.

Several responses to the address were received. A dispatch from a minister in Steubenville, stated that in one hour one hundred people signed a pledge to keep away from the Fair if open Sundays. A dispatch from Connersville, Ind., said five ministers and six hundred laymen had taken similar action. A dispatch from Cleveland stated that ten thousand eastern delegates to the forthcoming Epworth League Convention had made arrangements to buy tickets through to Chicago, with a stop over privilege at Cleveland. After the decision of the Appellate Court all arrangements were changed and none of them will go to Chicago.
