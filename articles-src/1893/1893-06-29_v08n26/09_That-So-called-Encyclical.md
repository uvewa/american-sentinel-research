We have been requested several times to give our opinion of a so-called Papal Encyclical, which has been quite extensively circulated by the anti-Catholic press of this country. In order that our readers may fully understand the matter, we give the document as it has been published repeatedly in the past six months to relate points.

## ENCYCLICAL

A LETTER FROM POPE LEO XIII. TO THE ARCHBISHOPS AND BISHOPS.

Heretofore Cut Off From the Church—They and the United States Must Have No Privileges and the Protestant Religion Is of No Service to the United States Government.

ENCYCLICAL LETTER OF HIS HOLINESS LEO XIII., TO THE PATRIARCHS, PRIMATES, ARCHBISHOPS AND BISHOPS.

*To the Faithful, Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops,*
*with the Apostolic See of the Easter Season.*

For the Temporal Reign of the Future Popes.
The Faithful Catholics of the
Columbus, Known as the United
States of America.

Venerable Brethren: Greeting and the Apostolic Benediction. The Holy Roman Catholic Church, the work and will of the creation of the Son of God; so it is remembered by nations and peoples in the Old world, who have tried both Catholic and apostolic and out of which there is hope to mankind in the New World. This power, prince and apostle, and to the Bishops of Rome that succeeded him, fulfilled the words of our Lord, and set up a kingdom having jurisdiction over all nations and kingdoms, and invested with the temporal power, and clothed with the garments of charity, in order to preserve the faithful in the true faith and in obedience to the see, for the promotion of the truth and for the correction of errors in what is charged

We call to the fullest the duties imposed on us by the union of all faithful in faithful Christians, to support the unity of the Roman Catholic religion, which charges itself with charity on matters of faith, to direct the leaders and the subjects of nations alike. And as has the teachers and princes of the world have in all ages respected the authority of the church and its head, also their temporal obligations in regard their attempt to propagate their doctrines and extend their jurisdiction upon the American empire.

The American Republic under Protestant auspices, with the support of certain monarchs of Europe, taking advantage of the daring voyages of the lands discovered by Christopher Columbus, and in defiance of the Holy See, and the arbitration of the Supernal Head of the Church, the United States, has grown and prospered, and has, but in direct violation of the same principles of majesty established.

The exercise of the propriety assumes, Catholics are now too many in the United States to be longer ignored by Protestants.

The United States has been told that in the lands having the least biggest measures, of which the Protestant version of the Bible is chief, and because of which, that is, on account of Protestant pretension, preaching has been resorted to, to turn the Catholic from the true church. These by the Roman Catholic hierarchy are preserved of, inasmuch as long as mere truths of their faithful by the Bishops.

Courts have set up and rendered decisions in conformance with the stated precedents of the church, requiring all faithfuls to the Church to obey its ordinances and canonical decisions.

> Subsequently there have been mandates in order that the objects of the true church ought to be made to conform to the United States' Government policy, to reduce faithful Catholics' tribute and to compel them to treasure the true unification of all faithfully to discontinue tithe to the church. We are advised of the fact that such Catholics who have persevered in the faith have been compelled to pay tithes in the courts of law.

"The Catholic bishops and clergy have been called to account in matters spiritual and ecclesiastical by those in authority and treated as intruders, and as though their mission arguments or protests on the part of the United States Government for the Catholic Church.

"We, therefore, make known the matters as hereinbefore set forth, and in obedience to the expressed, that persecution against the religion of the Catholic, that is an unjust and unlawful exercise of authority, made it the duty of a people to take action against a nation that has rejected our right at least and at all times to regulate the teaching of Catholic Church.

In virtue, therefore of the Divine authority by which we hold the Pontifical place, and have on us as the Father of all, through the sacred unction, an office so supreme to our capability, we declare that the Catholic Church and its rights the true church were persecuted and oppressed in this country, so that such a nation of infidels, together with all adherents, have incurred the sentence of excommunication, to be absolved only by the authority of the Holy See.

Moreover, we proclaim the people of the United States have forfeited their claim to the territory and Republic, and also all dominion, dignity and privilege of every kind, and that the territory of the United States, and every individual who has taken oath of allegiance to the said United States Government, and who has aided in any manner in the Government, is absolved from every obligation and from all other duty, fidelity, or obedience or about oaths which they may have taken to the said Government. And we direct that a Holy Conclave, or Congress shall convene as Chicago, Illinois, as we may order and from time to time direct. Carried out, year of our Lord 1892, it will be the duty of the civil government to care for the Christian education of its youth.

As the circulation of this bill by sending to all the Archbishops, Bishops and Priests, the Roman and Catholic faithful—as a letter written expressly by Jesuit soldiers, subscribed by a bishop, and issued and published by the Catholic Telegraph, claims the same power and efficacy as those present by the supreme pontiff.

December, 1891, the fifteenth year of our Pontificate.

If we are not mistaken no reader is ready to agree with us that this so-called Papal Encyclical is clearly a fraud; a public fraud. The Pope and his advisers are not fools. They understand that the Romish hierarchy is progressing in this country as it is nowhere in the world, and they are not going to take steps to lose what one day rule this land. They also know that Catholicism is a greater power in finances in governmental affairs than any other single denomination, greater indeed than all other sects put together. They know that they control a number of the largest cities of the country; that they hold a fair share of the important offices in the municipal, State and national governments. They know that the Roman Catholic Church, through its prelates and its large voting membership, have at their command the balance of power between the two great political parties. Not a politician at Washington is ignorant of this fact. They know something of the policy of the Government towards the Exposit. Knowing all this; and knowing, too, that they number only about seven and a half million in a noble population of sixty-five millions, Catholics are too wise to adopt any such insane

measures as those set forth in the pseudo, or bogus encyclical, A letter from Pope Leo XIII. to the Roman World.
