INASMUCH as the highest law-making power known to the Constitution of the United States has declared that the Government is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion, Congress knows no difference between one religion and another; would it not be as well for any question of Sunday observance at the Fair to be treated on that basis? Congress now the following has been law the last the Washington's admittance.

As the Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion—as is has been in no character of enmity against the law, religion, or tranquillity of Musselmen—and as the said States never have an act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.

This paragraph forms an important article in a treaty of "peace and friendship" made between the United States of America and the Bey and subjects of Tripoli, of Barbary, under date of November 4, 1796. This treaty was negotiated by order of the session at standing in other treads established with the ability for better observing during the administration of Jefferson and Madison, who so have we therefore was the three greatest names in our constitutional history, and ought to have some weight.

If by the United States became the supreme law of the land and no text in the way of law, and the purposes of government as set forth at the Constitution and act of Congress, why should lawyers and statesmen and legislators be governed by a sentiment being a Christian government and some of its incidental measures?

The one great thing that the fathers of the Constitution did it was the way Church and State. They framed a Government that absolutely had no connection with religion. They had known what it was in all the to have a Government with the power, not only in England, but in the new world, by legislation, to compel conformance with the principles of the church. And the Federal Government should be free from that alliance. If the apostle of a to that under the they should not require religious tests for office, that was the limit which they could do with that; the General Government's power was settled beyond about, and nothing further it can do nothing that would require religious observance or would interfere therewith. It is a subject as much of common right, as the creation of orders of nobility.

The *Herald* yields to none in respect for the Christian religion or in sympathy with its objects. Its spirit has been of the great civilizing forces of the world, though its methods have sometimes been of the earth, earthy. That was inevitable, so long as men only could carry it forward. It was because, after centuries of experiment, it was perceived that human passions too often forget and ignored the spirit of Christian teachings, that the great founders of this Republic deliberately severed religion from the Government.

Enforced religion is not a part of the common law, and none of its sanctions can be enforced in the courts. We may be, as it is, we are a Christian Government, a Government, not a Christian Nation.—

*New York Herald.*
