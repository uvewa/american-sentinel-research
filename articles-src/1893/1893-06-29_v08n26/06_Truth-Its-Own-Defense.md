God will care for his own truth; he has never authorized any man or government to enforce it. But he has commissioned all the powers of the world above to work in its behalf. He who stands on the side of truth stands with the great and finally victorious majority. Even though, compared with self-exultant forces of oppression, the strength of the truth may appear small, still—

"Truth crushed to earth will rise again;
The eternal years of God are here."

Jesus Christ is the embodiment of truth. He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." The same truths that Jesus taught and that find exemplification in his life are contained in the written Book. Jesus says, "Thy word is truth." Since Jesus is the truth, no man can receive the truth as it is in Jesus, except he receives Jesus himself. And he who has Christ Jesus will certainly have the mind of Christ. If this be the case, then his character will be in harmony with the following: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross." Nothing will be done through strife or vangitory; but in lowliness of mind, each will esteem others better than themselves. Phil. 2:5-8.

To Jesus was given all power in heaven and in earth. Matt. 28:18. He had "power over all flesh." John 17:2. He was equal to the Father. But although he possessed such power, he never descended from the true dignity of his great work to compel any man to receive him or his word. He disclaimed any disposition to do anything of the kind. He draws men to himself, but he never drives them. Men cannot be driven toward the driver. Like the true shepherd, Jesus goes before his flock, and they follow, attracted by the power of his love, his gentle voice, and his unselfish devotion to the good of others. He encourages his followers with these words: "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." John 8:31, 32. There is freedom and joy with the truth of God as it finds its way to the hearts of men. How free from every taint of oppression and persecution! It has behind it power of the Infinite One; it is urged upon the conscience by the heavenly agencies under the gentle nuasion of offers of pardon, peace, love, and liberty. If men will not accept, it can wait; but there is consciousness of strength in the cause of God that gives to the believer unspeakable confidence in him in whom he lives. It arms him with fortitude to do and to bear, knowing that his cause will be vindicated at last.

But when we cross the line into the dominion of error, how changed all things become. Error requires the assistance of carnal measures. As it cannot have help from above, it must seek that which comes from beneath. This is the only strength it has ever had. Error does not always employ force; it more frequently uses deception and persuasion. It uses every possible art to win followers and is not scrupulous as to the character of the means, so long as the end is accomplished. But we may set it down, that while error is not always represented by physical force, the truth of religion never is. It can only be used in connection with that which is earthly, and not with the spiritual. If coercion be introduced into any sacred work it would at that moment lose its sacredness. So that when any religious work or system employs human force in its prosecutions, we may know that that is not the work of God.

It is a tacit confession of the weakness of their cause when those who profess to be working for God appeal to Caesar for assistance. No one who has the truth has any need of such help, nor can he afford to accept it if it were offered him. But the impotency of error leads its advocates to seek such help. Those who have for their faith and practice, thus saith the Lord, and can point to the example and precept of Christ as a basis for what they teach, are not found at Caesar's gate pleading for enactments and decrees to give force to their doctrines. Those who teach the pure Word of God have the energy of the Holy Spirit to attend their words, and they need no earthly alliance. But when the gold becomes dross, when the words of man take the place of the Word of God, then the heavenly energies are withdrawn, and to support the tottering cause the civil arm is brought into requisition.

Persecution is never used except in support of a cause that is morally weak and rotten, and scripturally unsound. Hence we place moral weakness among the causes and sources of persecution. Persecution is made to supply the place of moral power. What a wretched substitute!—G. C. Tenney, in the Religious Liberty Library.
