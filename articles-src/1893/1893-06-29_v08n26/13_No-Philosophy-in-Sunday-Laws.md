INSTEAD of this Sunday legislation, it would be better if the State would try to make a whole lot of fellows work who do not now earn their salt. There is no more philosophy or sound sense in the legal requirement that a man shall rest on Sunday than there would be in a law that he should regularly get out of bed at five o'clock in the morning and take a cold bath.—*Silver Creek Times*.
