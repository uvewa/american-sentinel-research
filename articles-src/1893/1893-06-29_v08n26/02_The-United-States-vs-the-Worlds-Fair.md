generally, in the city of Chicago, that the Fair is to be open on Sunday. Although the decision of the question will surely extend upon technical grounds, the true discussion of the principle which was involved, however carefully avoided, still the agitation has resulted in bringing to the consciousness of many minds, the true state of the case, and the true principles involved.

It is of considerable importance, and the counsel for the Government that the decision does not extend beyond the scope of the Court of Appeals, but should go directly to the Supreme Court of the United States, and over-ruling the motion to dismiss, the case on which was based upon the plea, Chief Justice Fuller said:—

> A court, before which a preliminary injunction should have been applied for and obtained, has no right to assume powers belonging over the case from another court, nor can the courts, by a series of injunctions, assume to wrest the management of the concerns of a corporation from the control of its own officers. A preliminary injunction restraining the acts of a State Corporation—interference, so that where any allegation of fraud is involved, or any showing that the corporation was being managed for the purpose of despoiling the corporation of its assets, or being conducted for improper purposes, is to be regarded as an effort to control the policies of the corporation. The further cost of $1,500,000 and the giving to the corporation of the use of the park does not appear to have been conditioned upon "the complete construction of the work prior to the opening" nor upon a condition arising subsequent, namely, the payment by the corporation to the Government of an amount equal to the souvenir coins. No conditions are attached to the Exposition on Sunday.

Touching the religious expenditure of the Government in this matter, which is not the ground upon which the decision is sustained, the right of all parties concerned, and the obligation on the part of the Government, apparent, we do not think this a proper case for the enforcement of any claim of this sort. The appropriation and the souvenir coins having been accounted to a charitable trust, upon certain conditions, among them Sunday closing; these conditions were complied with as to the completion of the work and is to be put over to certain conditions on the part of the Government. It was an appropriation for the benefit of the local exhibitors, and the nation at large. If the purpose of the corporation was properly accomplished to its complete its undertaking; and as to the means of doing this, the management is in the discretion of the corporation, to carry forward its purposes. So far as the purposes of the appropriation were concerned, those purposes had been accomplished. The souvenir coins had been fully paid for by the corporation. That the court might interpose to protect the United States in its possession, but it is impossible for a court of equity to restrain the corporation from performing the acts of the South Park commissioners. The possession is with the corporation and must be protected as against any wrongful interference by any other authority by the corporation. In that construction the assumption that the United States had control over the corporation, or its officers, is a construction that preclude the view that the United States has a right to enforce a stipulation to close on Sundays from a religious standpoint, since Congress never intended that Congress should or could establish a religious test to be maintained and observed by a corporation as a condition for aid, or for by the appropriation. However, it was a political expenditure by the congressional direction of the Government, and in that sense, an expenditure for a public purpose of a "national and international character." Of course the Government can not, through its own agency, act as the promoter of religion or of church interests, though of course a court of equity on that ground.

> A court had a preliminary injunction should have necessary to be considered, but which will be regarded in its purpose to bind. It is sufficient that, by its appropriation and the souvenir coins, the entirely rule, which requires to the exercise of principles, on whatever care some effect to property,

whether actual or prospective, some feature of spiritual or of right, seems always immolated to "business." This is not such a case and the result is we hope a successful one, where it is sought to be shown that proceedings are inconsistent with those by which the best results have been obtained.

It will be seen, that in this decision, the court does agree entirely with the plan that the World's Fair is a great charitable institution, and the appropriation of Congress was to the aid of a charitable trust; and also refuses to give any consideration to the claim that the State has entire authority over the World's Fair directorate and holdings, both of which were claims urged very earnestly and depended upon with much assurance by the counsel for the Government. As foreshadowed in this paper on representative expression, it seems evident that the full decision of the courts will be very clear and lucid upon all the points which have been raised below. As it is, however, the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, free or paying, in the decision of the court means of real liberty of conscience and freedom from civil restraint in religion. The whole question touches, in one way directly, the authority of Congress to appropriate public money in aid of the Sunday closing proviso, neither now to enact any subsequent legislation on the subject. The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity of New York against the United States, but herein that subject wholly in abeyance, and open to the interpretation, that the views which were intended to be upheld in the decision could many be better promoted by an open Fair than by a closed one.

President Higginbotham expressed this as an interview published yesterday in the *Chicago Evening Post,* in which he said:—

> It will be observed in the most eminent degree. . . . There will not be any objection, I feel sure, if we act consistently and give the grounds to reserve. We will have to be conspicuous in our determination that no one that attends, either exhibitor or employé or visitor, will be required to do any religious service or labor.

The views on which Mr. Durfouree ruled out the consideration of the constitutional questions, in the consideration of the matter before the House Committee at the World's Fair, the question is not between two forms of religious observance the observance of Sunday, the closing of the Fair entirely, or the opening of it to provide a peaceful with the stoppage of machinery and the presentation of sacred music and pastimes, a gross affirmation was a contest between the views and opinions, represented on the one hand by the Church of England, and on the other by the Roman Catholic Church in Europe—each making claim to ancient authority in this country or to colonies. Obviously, on this side, this instance the Roman Catholic liberal views and methods of Sunday observance have triumphed. It means nothing whatever to the cause of religious liberty, except as to the influences it may have upon agitation of the question, and upon the further presentation of the principles of civil liberty in religious matters. The decision and the matters that have led to it, and the decision that has been had in it, will have an influence both ways.

*Chicago,* June 13.

It seems that in the World's Fair principle is to be sacrificed for gain throughout.
