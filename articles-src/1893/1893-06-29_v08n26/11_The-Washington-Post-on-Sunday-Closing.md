The *Washington Post* says of the Sunday closing agitation, that it is "the final decision with the Sunday-closing matter; may regret it and still be disposed to agree that it has been the wisest that could be given under the circumstances. The minority may not yet accept but the majority of the right law is defined by the highest of all judicial authorities. This ought to be satisfactory, from the legal point on which it was discussed. But there ought to be something that ought to be, externally as well as internally to the majority of the liberal-minded and intelligent people in this country, in a broader sense of the word—all the Reformers and terms of one level, but in their philosophy or sound sense in the legal requirement that a man shall make one day of rest, there would be in a law or ordinance that shall regularly set out of bed at five o'clock in the morning and take a cold bath."—*Short Items.*
