Every candid man and woman in the United States knows, and has known from the first, that the claim of the World's Fair Sunday-closing agitators that they represent forty millions of the people of this country, is false, and no more evidence need be advanced in addition to what has been advanced, to prove this. However, there are occurring from time to time events which add emphasis to the falsity of this claim, that are worth noticing. The convention called to meet at Indianapolis the 13th and 14th instants is one of these. The meeting was largely advertised and was a call for the "friends of the Sabbath" everywhere to attend the meeting. All the local papers of the city announced it. According to the population of Indianapolis and the percentage claimed for Sunday closing, there should have been seventy-five thousand people from the city alone, at this meeting. But the cold facts are, there were but fifty-six persons present at the first meeting, including speakers and reporters, of whom at least twenty were opposed to the whole movement. So small was the attendance of the "friends of the Sabbath," that the leaders dared not organize the meeting for fear it would be captured by the enemy, and so postponed organization until the next day hoping for reinforcements. Instead of reinforcements arriving during the night, there were desertions under cover of the darkness, and but forty were present with an increased proportion of opposers of the movement.

It was expected at the meeting to organize and adopt resolutions, but after a whispered consultation between the representation of the "forty millions," they announced that they had decided to adjourn the meeting, after which the leaders would meet privately and pass resolutions, and so they abruptly adjourned the meeting, retired out of reach of the "insignificant minority," and the newspapers next morning chronicled the wishes of the "forty millions."

The first meeting was devoted to discussing the advisability of urging a boycott of the Fair, should the United States Court of Appeals decide that it could lawfully be opened on Sunday. The leaders of the "forty millions" supposing that the clergy of Indianapolis had degenerated equally with themselves toward this un-American, unchristian method of enforcing their religious views upon others, boldly advocated the boycotting program. After the leaders had spoken along this line, Rev. Lucas, pastor of a local Christian church spoke, urging that it was no more a sin to attend the Fair, should it be open on Sunday, than it would be to ride on a railroad that run Sunday trains. Rev. Haynes, Presbyterian, ex-President Harrison's pastor, arose and denounced the proposed boycott as "contrary to the New Testament and wicked."

Those well merited rebukes threw a wet blanket over the managers from which they never recovered.

After calling the World's Fair Directors "bold anarchists," "gilt-edged anarchists," etc., one of the speakers had occasion to tell how he violated the Fugitive Slave Law by helping slaves to escape. At this point the writer asked, "Were you an anarchist?" To which he answered, "Oh, no!" "But you violated law," was the reply. "We must obey God rather than man," was the speaker's reply.

"Then are Seventh-day Adventists anarchists when they follow their convictions and work on Sunday?" was asked. The speaker saw he was hopelessly entangled and made an effort to escape but failed. When this last question was asked one of the leaders of the movement who recognized that the enemy was in the camp, rushed up to the speaker and whispered a warning, after which the meeting adjourned in hot haste. And this was a meeting of the "forty millions"! The rank and file of the people are no more in sympathy with this unconstitutional movement than were the "common people" in sympathy with the crucifixion of Christ. As then, so now, it is a few self-appointed leaders that are working the ruin.
