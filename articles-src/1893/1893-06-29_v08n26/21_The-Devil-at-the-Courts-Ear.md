In a minister's meeting in Chicago on the 19th inst., Dr. P. S. Henson, of the First Baptist Church, read a paper entitled, "My Theological Crotchets." Among other things the doctor said:—

I believe in a personal devil, and the more I see of it the more I believe the devil makes Chicago his headquarters. I further believe he instigated the finding of the court in the World's Fair case. He was squatted like a toad at the ear of the Justice and when the decision was rendered patted him on the back and said: "Good boy, old fellow; couldn't have done it better myself."

This is quite in keeping with the spirit of the whole Sunday movement; it berates and slanders everything and everybody that it cannot control. The only reason the ultra Sunday advocates do not burn those who do not agree with them is because they have not the power; but they do the next best thing, namely, they invoke the divine wrath against them in a manner which indicates that the wish is father to the thought. A clergyman in this city informed his audience on a recent Sunday that—

No one need be surprised if God, in his righteous wrath, should hurl an electric shower upon the World's Fair buildings, that will leave Jackson Park a scene of desolation.

More recently another clergyman in this State said, in his sermon:—

Let the cholera spread its black wings over us this summer, and let ten million people die of this dread disease, and, oh, how those sinners will flock to our altars. The Lord knows how to close the doors of the Fair on Sundays and he will do it. When the Lord has tough work to do he finds tough instruments to do it with. Chicago, unless the repents, will be swept out to sea as shells, from which the life has forever gone.

Such utterances, a correspondent of a Chicago paper properly characterizes as blasphemous. The Lord has a controversy with the people of Chicago, in common with other sinners, but it is not about their disregard of Sunday. Everybody ought to understand, and never forget, that the Lord has no more regard for Sunday than for Monday or Tuesday. It is simply one of "the six working days" given to man by the Creator. The Lord's day, the Sabbath, is quite another day.
