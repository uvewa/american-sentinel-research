THE YORK, Pa., *Dispatch* is authority for the statement that the ministers of that city are taking steps to stop the running of the cars that carry people to a park on Sunday. At a meeting held June 8, a committee was appointed to wait on the directors of the street railway and request them to close the park on Sunday. At a subsequent meeting the committee reported that the directors refused to close the park. A lively discussion ensued in which the sentiment expressed went to the effect that the running of cars on Sunday was contrary to "the ideas of this Christian community and a desecration of the Sabbath."

Some favored the boycott as the most effective course to be pursued, while others thought it should be made a matter of the conscience, and recommended that the directors and stockholders be appealed to personally by their pastors and urged to use their influence against the Sunday park care.

It is very evident the Sunday preachers would be satisfied with nothing short of an entire monopoly of the Sunday, with the people left to choose between going to church or staying at home.
