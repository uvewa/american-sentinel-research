Attorney-General Olney is credited with the opinion that the decision of the Court of Appeals in the World's Fair injunction suit is certain to affect the Government exhibits. These exhibits represent every governmental department. But, as every appropriation made for these exhibits is coupled with the Sunday-closing condition, it is clear that they cannot be open on Sunday, and the decision may result in permanently closing them. Thus far the Government through its accredited representatives has consistently maintained the attitude that it assumed by the closing act, as the champion of Sunday sacredness.
