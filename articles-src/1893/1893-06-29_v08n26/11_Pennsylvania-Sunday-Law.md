In Pennsylvania the penalty for violation of the Sunday law is a fine of four dollars; but thirty-eight years ago a special law was passed making the penalty twenty-five dollars in Allegheny County. An act was passed by the legislature only a few days since making the fine uniform throughout the State, namely, four dollars; but Governor Pattison vetoed the bill. He said:—

It was placed upon the statute books, and has been continued there in the recognition of a sound public sentiment. The instincts of a moral and law-abiding people find it as much needed to-day as when first written into the laws a hundred years ago. No popular demand is made for its repeal. It is broad, liberal, and flexible. Therefore its penalties should be sufficient to secure its observance and enforcement, in order to preserve and secure the salutary objects for which it was enacted. For thirty-eight years the penalty of $25 for its violation has been in force in Allegheny County, during which time the population there has increased from 159,182 to 551,939. It is the unconcealed object of this repealing clause to weaken its enforcement among this population, and to render its violation more easy and less expensive. The offer of a premium for the violation of a law is indeed a novel proposition. I am of the opinion that if the increased penalty has had the effect to secure the better observance and stricter enforcement of the law, the effort of sound legislation should rather be to make the penalty general than to impair the effectiveness of the law in a particular community. Most wholesome statutes are wholly destroyed by a failure to provide proper penalties.

After very deliberate examination of this bill, and liberal indulgence to all of the considerations which have been advanced in its favor, I am strengthened in my conclusion that its approval would be a step backward and an encouragement toward the violation of a reasonable statute, and I therefore decline to approve the bill.

Doubtless a bill making the fine twenty-five dollars throughout the State would receive Governor Pattison's prompt approval. He has already made quite a record as a National Reformer. He is one of the politicians who have secured front seats in the Church and State coach.
