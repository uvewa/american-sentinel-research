ATTORNEY-GENERAL OLNEY is credited with the opinion that the decision of the Court of Appeals in the World's Fair injunction suit is certain to affect the Government's position. These exhibits represent every governmental department. But as yet, every appropriation made for these the Fair in to comply with the Sunday-closing condition, it is clear that they cannot be open on Sunday, without a decided result in permanently closing them. Thus far the Government through its accredited ministers and national commission have turned the attitude that it assumed by the closing act, as the changing of State proceedings.
