INASMICH as the highest law-making power known to the Constitution of the United States has declared that the Federal Government is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion, and knows no difference between one religion and another, would it not be well for lawyers and others engaged in discussing the question of Sunday observance at the Fair to recognize that fact? For nearly a century now the following has been the law of this country, having been adopted in the last year of Washington's administration:

As the Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion—as it has itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Massulmen—and as the said States never have entered into any war nor act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.

This paragraph forms an important article in the treaty of peace and friendship made between the United States of America and the Bey and the subjects of Tripoli, under date of November 4, 1796. And the same provision appears in substance and meaning in other treaties negotiated with the Barbary powers during the administrations of Jefferson and Madison, so that we have the sanction of the three greatest names in our constitutional history to this law. As all treaties made by the United States become the supreme law of the land and are to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of Congress, why should lawyers and statesmen still talk about the American Government being a Christian government and the Nation a Christian nation?

The one great thing that the framers of the Constitution did was to sever Church and State. They framed a Government that had absolutely no connection with religion. They had known what it was to have religion associated with political power, not only in England, but in the different colonies, and they determined that the Federal Government should be free from that alliance. If the separate States choose to enact Sunday laws, or require religious tests for office, that was the affair of the people of those States, but the General Government's power was strictly hedged about, and even indirectly it can do nothing that would require religious observance or would interfere therewith. It is a subject as much beyond its control as the creation of orders of nobility.

The Herald yields to none in respect for the Christian religion or in sympathy with its objects. Its spirit has been of the great-civilizing forces of the world, though its methods have sometimes been of the earth, earthy. That was inevitable, so long as men only must carry it forward. And it was because, after centuries of experience, it was perceived that human passion too often forgot and ignored the spirit of Christ's teachings, that the founders of the American Republic entirely severed religion from the Government.

Christianity is not a part of the common law, and none of its sanctions can be enforced in the courts. We may be a Christian people. We are not a Christian Government, nor a Christian Nation.—*Chicago Herald*.
