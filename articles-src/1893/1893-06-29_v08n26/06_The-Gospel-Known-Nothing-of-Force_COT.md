Christianity is the religion of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the only Son of God, and is himself divine. God the Father "saw the Son, and his to whom the Son will to reveal him." Therefore whatever religion is not the religion of Jesus Christ, is not the worship of God, and must be heathenism. There are only two systems of religion in the world—Christianity and heathenism. Christianity is the religion of love. "God is love," and "love is the fulfilling of the law." Jesus Christ is the manifestation of God's love to man; "for God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16. Whatever religion practices that, or is but a departure from love, are not a part of Christianity, but of heathenism.

But love knows nothing of force. It cannot be forced. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God." "How can I love him?" replied the lad; "he knows that love begets love, and that constrains it down." Such "love" as that does not permit of force; its very thought compels. Forced service is not love, but is slavery. Therefore coercion, religious coercion, cannot being a service of love, is not Christianity, but is essentially heathenism. Be it always more force, for a law that caused be enforced is not a law. Therefore it is absolutely impossible that religion be law on the one Christianity. Whatever religious observers, no matter of what kind, are no part of Christianity.
