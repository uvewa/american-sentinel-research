Chicago Correspondence.

THE Court of Appeals, with Chief Justice Fuller on the bench, together with Justices Bunn and Allen, has rendered its decision in the case of the United States against the World's Fair, appealed from the United States Circuit Court. The decision was a sweeping reversal of the decision of the lower court on almost every point, and makes it certain that the Fair will now be open every Sunday during the remainder of its continuance. The decision was unanimous, and read by Chief Justice Fuller, who gave a condensed statement of the points upon which the decision is based and said that the detailed opinion would be filed later. The counsel for the United States have announced that the matter will not be dropped here, but that what is known as the Wanamaker suit, brought by Wanamaker & Brown, a New Jersey corporation, and others, in the United States Circuit Court, will be pushed. It is not probable, however, that this case can be so used as to nullify the decision of the Court of Appeals, or in any way destroy its effect.

There is unrestrained rejoicing, quite generally, in the city of Chicago, that the Fair is to be open on Sunday. Although the decision of the question has been entirely upon technical grounds, and the discussion of the principles which govern the question carefully avoided, still the agitation has resulted in bringing to the comprehension of many minds, the true state of the case, and the real principles involved.

After replying to the contention of the counsel for the Government that this question was not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, but should go direct to the Supreme Court of the United States, and over-ruling the motion to dismiss the case which was based upon that plea, Chief Justice Fuller said:—

The question to be determined is whether upon this record a preliminary injunction should have been granted. The bill avers that the defendants are usurping powers involving authority over the Exposition and the grounds, and in virtue thereof assumes to open the Exposition on Sunday in contravention of the acts of Congress—notwithstanding such opening would be "of great injury, and a grievous prejudice to the common public good and to the welfare of the people of the United States." It is not contended that any property interest of the complainant will be injured by the threatened action, nor is there any allegation of irreparable injury or probable loss by such action. But it is said that the intervention of the court may be rested upon the protection of the United States in its possession of the grounds of the Exposition for the purpose of protecting the United States in its possession. The furnishing of the five million souvenir coins was a condition upon the local corporation by the United States, in addition to the many millions it had already contributed, the further sum of $2,500,000 and the giving to the Government of a satisfactory guaranty that it would provide all additional sums necessary for the complete construction of the work prior to May 1, 1893, and was subject to two conditions subsequent, namely, the payment by the corporation of all expense, costs and charges, of the great departments of the Exposition and the closing of the Exposition on Sunday.

In view of the vast previous expenditure of the corporation and the extent of the obligations assumed, the right of all parties concerned, and the nature of these conditions, and the conditions subsequent, was do not think this a proper case for the rule in question, nor can we concur in the proposition that the appropriation of the $2,500,000 amounted to a charitable trust, upon certain conditions warranted. The appropriation was made for the purpose of aiding in defraying the cost of the completion of the work and to be paid over on vouchers for labor done, material furnished, and services performed in the prosecution of the work. It was an appropriation for the benefit of the local corporation to help it out of its financial difficulty and to enable it to complete its undertaking, and as such does not come under the accepted definition of a charitable gift for the benefit of an indefinite class of persons. So far as the purpose of the appropriation subsequently made is concerned, that purpose had to be accomplished before the money could be paid over.

The decision of the court might interpose to protect the United States in its possession, but it is the local corporation that is in actual possession under the law of the State and of the ordinance of the South Park commissioners. The possession is recognized by the acts of Congress as essential to the construction and administration of the Exposition by the corporation. In that construction the corporation has invested sixteen millions of dollars under circumstances that preclude the view that the United States have exclusive administration and authority in the premises. It is perfectly clear that Congress never intended that Congress should become responsible for the construction of any of the buildings except its own for the work provided for by the appropriation. However, it was intended that the Exposition should receive the sanction of the Government, and in that sense, as remarked by Chief Justice Waite, in the Philadelphia case, "be impressed by a national or international character." Of course the Government has a qualified possession, but we find nothing in this regard upon which to base an intervention of a court of equity on that ground.

We cannot now discuss the various questions necessary to be considered, but which will be treated of in the opinion to be filed. It is sufficient to say that we cannot except this case from the ordinary rule, which requires to the exercise of jurisdiction in chancery some injury to property, whether actual or prospective, some invasion of property or civil rights, some injury irreparable in its nature, and which cannot be redressed at law. This is not such a case and the result is we hereby refuse the order and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with these conclusions.

It will be seen, that in this decision, Justice Fuller does away entirely with the plea that the World's Fair is a great charitable institution, and the appropriations of Congress to it amounted to a charitable trust; and also refuses to give any support to the claim that the United States has entire authority over the World's Fair grounds and buildings; both of which were claims urged very earnestly and depended upon with much assurance by the counsel for the Government. As foreshadowed in this preliminary expression, it seems evident that the full decision of the court will be very clear and lucid upon all the points which have been raised before it. As it is, however, the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday means nothing in the furtherance of the cause of real liberty of conscience and freedom from civil restraint in religious things, because it does not combat directly, the authority of Congress to take the action which it did in reference to the Sunday closing proviso, neither does it antagonize the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity of New York against the United States, but leaves that subject wholly in abeyance, and open to the interpretation, that the views which were intended to be upheld in both these cases may be better promoted by an open Fair than by a closed Fair.

President Higinbotham expressed this in an interview published yesterday in the Chicago Evening Post, in which he said:—

Sunday is not to be desecrated on the grounds. It will be observed in the most eminent degree. It is too late now to prepare for religious services on the grounds to-morrow. We will have to be content with concern of sacred music. These will be provided, and on each succeeding Sunday there will be religious services.

From the time in which Mr. Durborow ruled out the consideration of the constitutional question in the presentation of the matter before the House Committee on the World's Fair, the contention has been between two forms of religious observance; the observance of Sunday by the closing of the Fair entirely, or its observance by a modified closing with the stoppage of machinery and the presentation of sacred music, and perhaps religious addresses. This was a contest between the views and opinions, represented at the one hand by the Puritans of New England, and on the other by the Roman Catholic element which lays an equal claim to ancient authority in this country through Columbus, its discoverer. In this instance the Roman Catholic liberal views and methods of Sunday observance have triumphed. It means nothing whatever to the cause of religious liberty, except as to the influence it may have upon the agitation of the question and the further presentation of the principles of civil liberty in religious matters. The real question at issue has been avoided, and the decision that has been had is in reality nothing but a compromise.

Chicago, June 18.
