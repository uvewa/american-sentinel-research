Every candid man and woman in the United States knows, and have known from the first, that the claim of the World's Fair Sunday-closing petitioners, to represent forty millions of the people of this country, is false, and so patent as scarcely need be answered, in addition to that has been advanced, to prove this. Nevertheless, the following account of the events which did emphasize it may be allowed here as curious and interesting. The convention called to meet at Chicago was intended to represent every one of those. This meeting was largely attended and was a call for the observance of the Sabbath "everywhere to attend the meeting." All the local papers of the day announced it. According to the population of Illinois and the proportion who claimed for Sunday closing, there should have been 600,000 representatives from the city alone, at this meeting. But the cold facts are, there were but fifty or sixty persons at the first call, some including speakers and reporters, of whom many came from a distance. One hundred and sixty was the largest attendance reported. So small was the attendance that the managing committee of those leaders dared not organize the meeting for any comprehensive deliberative purpose, and so postponed organization until the next and hoped for reinforcements. Instead of reinforcements arriving from under cover of the darkness, and forty were all that could be mustered to withstand the opposers of the movement.

After calling the World's Fair Directory to order and adopt resolutions, but after a whispered consultation between the representatives of the "forty million" it became evident that no deliberative body could maintain "deliberation;" that the leaders would meet privately and pass what resolutions they pleased. Accordingly, on the next day, after a private meeting, retiring out of reach of the dissenting element, the papers of the next morning chronicled the wishes of this body.

The first meeting was devoted to discussion of the single question, what the cost of the Fair, should the United States Court of Appeals decide that it was unlawful to expect on Sunday. The leaders of the "forty million" supposed that things would be practically settled, especially with themselves toward the close; but they were so constantly heckled regarding their religious views upon other points that they lost their balance.

After the leaders and spoken along this line, George Cook, a prominent Chicagoan, spoke, urging that it was as absurd for the "forty million" to keep the Fair closed on Sunday, than it would be to ride as a man should, as this truly meant. Robert Hayes, Presbyterian, ex-President Harrison, and others, arose and supported a proposal beyond and "contrary to the New England" spirit toward the movement.

After calling the World's Fair Directory to order the next morning, at which nothing practical was accomplished, George Cook arose in behalf of the Fugitive Slave Law by helping slaves to escape. At this point he was asked: "When are you an anarchist." To which he was the reply: "We must obey God rather than man," was the speaker's rejoinder.

"Then Seventh-day Adventists actually believe that they follow their convictions and work on Sunday?" was asked. The speaker was so hopelessly entangled and made no effort to escape but failed. When this question was asked of one of the leaders of the movement that the suggestion that the enemy was in the camp, rushed up to the speaker and whispered a warning, after which the speaking adjourned in hot haste. And this was a meeting of the "forty million." The men and the women who are really in sympathy with the constitution and not in sympathy with this unconstitutional legislation, because they are men who are in sympathy with the crucifixion of Christ. As above, no, to a far greater number, the leaders that are working to the ruin.
