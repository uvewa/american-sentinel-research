Now that the United States Court of Appeals has set the example, the courts all seem more kindly disposed toward Sunday opening of the Fair, and on the 20th inst. the Wanamaker & Brown bill, which sought an injunction to close the great show on Sunday, was thrown out of court. Judge Jenkins granted the motion.
