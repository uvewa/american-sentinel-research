# Uncertainties — v08n26, 1893-06-29

## Author attributions

### Article 04: "A Convention of the 'Forty Millions.'"
- OCR renders the author as "A. F. BALLINGER" at the end of the article. Known initials list has AFB = A. F. Ballenger. This appears to be the same person; the OCR likely misread the final letter of the surname (Ballenger vs. Ballinger). Transcribed as "Ballinger" exactly as it appears in the OCR, but flagged here as a probable OCR error for "Ballenger."
- Confidence: MEDIUM — the initials AFB match A. F. Ballenger from the known authors list; "Ballinger" vs "Ballenger" is likely an OCR misread of the n/ng ending.

### Article 05: "The Union of Church and State in Europe (Concluded.)"
- Author signed as "AUGUST KUNZ" — not in the known authors list. Used initials "AK" for file naming. New contributor; no uncertainty about the name itself as it is clearly spelled in caps.

## OCR quality notes

### Page 1, editorial paragraph
- The word "vangitory" appears in Article 06 ("Truth Its Own Defense") in the phrase "Nothing will be done through strife or vangitory." This appears to be an OCR misread of "vainglory." Transcribed as it appears in the OCR (which may itself be a faithful rendering of the printed text). Flagged for verification against the original scan.
- Confidence: LOW — "vangitory" is not a recognized word; almost certainly "vainglory" in the original.

### Page 1, column break
- The phrase "gentle nuasion" in Article 06 appears to be an OCR misread of "gentle persuasion." Transcribed as it appears. Flagged for verification.
- Confidence: LOW — "nuasion" is not a word; likely "persuasion" with the "per" dropped by OCR.

### Page 6, volume number
- The running header on page 6 reads "Vol. 8, No. 2b." — likely an OCR misread of "No. 26." This is a page header artifact and was not transcribed into any article.

### Page 8, date line
- The OCR shows "New York, June 29, 1890." at the top of page 8. This appears to be an OCR error for 1893 (the correct year of the issue). Not transcribed into article content.
