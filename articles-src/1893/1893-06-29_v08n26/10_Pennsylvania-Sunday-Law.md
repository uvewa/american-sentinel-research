In Pennsylvania the penalty for violation of the Sunday law is a fine of four dollars, but thirty-odd years ago a special law was passed making the penalty twenty-five dollars in Allegheny County alone.

An act was passed by the legislature only the other day for making the fine throughout the State, namely, four dollars, but Governor Pattison vetoed the measure.

It was placed upon the statute books and has ever since been sustained by a strong public sentiment. The instance of a noted and wide-spread desire for its repeal is not to be found. No popular demand is made for its repeal. It has been justly said that the approval of public duties should be sufficient to secure its observance without the enforcement of the law. For thirty-eight years the people of the county of Allegheny have sustained the provisions of the law. The object was to reduce the penalty from $25.00 to $13.50. It is the unsuccessful object of members of this legislature to disregard the religious sentiment of a majority of the people among this population, and to render of less effect a law whose rigorous enforcement has heretofore been found to be a necessary protection. I am of the opinion that if the liberty of the State is recognized by such law, the effect of actual legislation should notice of recognition of the law, and in the end to further to materially weaken the moral effectiveness of the law in a particular community where it has been productive of the greatest good.

After very deliberate examination of this bill, and of the circumstances under which it was passed, I have reached the conclusion that its approval by me would be an injustice to the community in which the law is now in force. It is also my conviction that its approval would be a step toward the repeal of the entire law, which is an expression of a reasonable statute, and I therefore decline to approve it.

Doubtless a bill making the fine twenty-five dollars in every county would be approved. Governor Pattison's principal apparent objection to this bill is that it might hurt the politicians who have secured front seats in the Church and State coach.
