Under the energetic protestations of the great Reformers, aimed as they were directly against the abuses and evils of the papal church and hierarchy, one might have expected the entire separation of Church and State as a natural consequence, at least as far as Protestant Christianity and its church organization was concerned. But the solution of this problem was evidently reserved for later times, inasmuch as the Reformers themselves did not get much beyond the relation of dependence which the Church had heretofore sustained to the State, as we will show directly.

In the beginning of his reformatory measures, Luther bid fair to bring the Church back to her divinely granted liberty and independence. He took the position, that in the Church as well as in any assemblies of believers in Christ, throughout the world, no one, according to his (Luther's) conviction, should accept any sacred office whatever, without the sanction or appointment of the Church; and further, that the Church herself was to keep control of her own property, and obtain the necessary means for its maintenance and work by direct levies upon its own members and none others. In the rules which he drew up for the organization and maintenance of active and wide-awake churches, he says among other things, the following:

Those who desire to be Christians in reality and in all earnest, and want to confess the gospel by word and deed, at all times and everywhere, ought, individually, by name, to sign a covenant to that effect, and should assemble in private houses, by themselves, for prayer, the reading of the Scriptures, to attend to the ordinances, and other Christian work.

The political disturbances of those times, which, seemingly at least, were connected with the freedom of thought advocated by the Reformers, caused Luther to doubt the practicability of his ideas, so that, in spite of his telling testimonies concerning the then existing state of the Christian Church, viz., that the Church of his time was not a properly ordered body such as it should be—he nevertheless thought it was not advisable to introduce and establish once for all this missing order of things. In a polemic pamphlet, published later, he went even so far as to set up a definition which struck a direct blow at his own views as expressed formerly, in regard to the Church; for he therein says: "Where baptism [meaning 'Christening'] and the gospel are found let no one doubt that Christian saints are there, too, even though they be nothing but babes in the cradle." By these statements he evidently makes the outward form the essential thing, and the inner sanctification a matter of minor import. State churches have the former but not the latter.

In the commencement of his measures of reform, Luther expressed himself very freely with regard to the relations the Church should sustain to the State; he wanted to see them separate from each other; "for," said he, "in respect to men's faith and conscience, the government has no right to interfere; neither has the civil power any right to proceed against heretics, be it by public punishments, or in any other way." But in this important point also, Luther allowed himself, alas! in later years, to yield, and went to the opposite direction. After the protest of Spires, in 1526, the Reformation was not only placed directly under State protection, but Luther made it out to be the duty of the government to care for the Christian education of the youth, and to regulate church affairs, in their material bearings, at least. This action, of transferring the authority over the Church, in good faith and confidence, to the secular powers, took away from the Church her inalienable right of self-government, as well as her independent relation to the State. Thereby, however, the life of the Church was most seriously endangered, for henceforth her material prosperity was in a very large measure made dependent upon the government; and her spiritual condition, instead of being directly dependent on God and the relations they maintained toward him, was to be shaped by whatever views or convictions the ruling powers had, in that line. The bitter first-fruits of the most fatal harvest that was to come from this pernicious seed, Luther himself was destined to see and taste; for in his own lifetime, yet, he was forced to "lament over, and deplore, the serious defects and ailments of the Church." Thus it came, that the glorious work of the Reformation, with its mighty impulses of that faith which overcomes the world, was, partly by force of the then existing circumstances, but largely through the short-sightedness of men, checked in its progress at renovation, and brought to a stand-still, so that its final outcome—instead of being a restoration of the primitive and apostolic order of things, a living Church, free from the State, or human control, guided directly by the Spirit of God, aggressive for the truth, and rooted, grounded and settled in it—it stopped short with only a partial renovation and correction of its doctrines, retaining a number of the errors, and some fatal and strongly poisonous ones at that, of its former state, and with all the fetters of entire subjection to, and dependence upon, the secular arm, for leadership and protection.

Whilst we must concede to Luther the preliminode, as the chief instrumentality in bringing into recognition again the long neglected doctrine, so plainly taught by the Apostle Paul, of justification by faith, as well as the indebtedness of all German-speaking peoples, for giving them—to be sure somewhat faulty in transaction and style, yet terse and forcible in language—the Holy Scriptures in their own mother-tongue, which ever since stood to them as a lofty beacon light of eternal truth; yet the apostolical organization and independence of the Church has been in a large measure kept from the people mainly in consequence of his later church-policy. A prominent German writer (Richter) says of the Lutheran Church, that she is not so much a subject in the active exercise of her divinely appointed rights, as an object, carrying out the duties imposed upon her by the State.

Singularly enough, the relation of the Church to the State, in Switzerland, being an outcome of the Swiss Reformation, took shape quite similarly to that in Germany, although the Swiss State Church proper has now, under its comparatively more liberal republican government, more rights and privileges in ecclesiastical matters. Zwingle, like Luther, sought protection from the government for the Church, and demanded that it should care for the Christian education of the youth; he even conceded to the State the right to direct ecclesiastical matters. The head of the government, and his council, together with the clergy, consider the ecclesiastical and spiritual affairs of the Church, and make all leading arrangements for the same; the Church, however, has the right to raise objections, and may even reject the administration, if the latter make unchristian and unreasonable demands of the people.

The presbyteries guard, under the government, the privileges of the Church in the Swiss (Reformed) State Church organization, and give in so doing far more satisfaction than is the case in the Lutheran Church. Calvin agreed with Luther and Zwingle in the main, but he insisted with more rigid severity upon church discipline throughout the land. It was not allowed to install a preacher into office without the consent of the Church: and a consistory, composed of clergy and laity, exercised the rights and functions of a regular court of administrative discipline; but both clergy and laity became subject to the same moral surveillance from the government. The French Reformed, likewise the English, Scotch and Netherlandish (Dutch) Reformed Churches were all organized after the sample of the model church at Geneva.

The most complete amalgamation between Church and State, in the world, is found in the Greek Catholic Church of Russia, where the emperor, or czar, is both the spiritual and the temporal head of the realm; and a Russian citizen cannot, as a member of the Greek Church, leave the same, without forfeiting likewise his Russian citizenship.

Concerning the ideal of what a church ought to be, externally as well as internally—namely holy, and catholic, in the true sense of the word—all the Reformers were of one mind; but in their attempts to realize their ideal they differed, without even a single one of them ever succeeding in reaching the desired end, i.e., without ever establishing any ecclesiastical organization after the pattern of the first apostolic church, either in form or in doctrine.

Since the time of the Reformation neither the Lutheran nor the Reformed State Churches, even though they changed their name in some instances—as, for example, in Germany, or more correctly, in Prussia, where both Lutheran and Reformed were merged into one, the Evangelical State Church, concerning which union, a clergyman, himself a member of the latter church, once very truthfully remarked to the writer: "When the Lutheran and the Reformed Churches united in Germany, a pair of twins were buried whilst still alive, but no living church ever arose out of it as the result." They have indeed not undergone any radical change for the better, as far as their relation to the State and their real spiritual life is concerned. Indeed, they still stand as they always stood, tied, so to speak, hands and feet, and this is the very reason why free churches of various sects have arisen in their very midst, offering as they do the privileges and liberties of freedom from the State, in religious matters, both in doctrine and practice. Whilst in some governments, and above all in Russia, the State makes it exceedingly difficult for these dissenting churches to exist and prosper, they, in spite of it all, do both, because the salvation of souls makes their existence imperative; and they will continue to exist as long as the gospel is to be preached in all the world, in spite of all that human powers can do to the contrary.
