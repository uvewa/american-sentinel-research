IN a minister's meeting in Chicago on the 19th inst., Dr. P. S. Henson, of the First Baptist Church, read a paper entitled, "My Theological Crockeries." Among other things the doctor said:—

> I believe a personal God, and not a mere evolution of force.

He then makes a distinction between a personal God and the finding of the court in the World's Fair; and when the doctrine was rendered painful from on the rock and—"take my yoke, and deliver you."

This is quite in keeping with the spirit of the whole Sunday movement; it berates and slanders everything and everybody that it cannot control. The clergy reads the ultra Sunday advocate do not burn those who do not agree with them now because they have not the power; but they do the next best thing, namely, they invoke the divine wrath against them in a weakness which indicates that the wish is father to the thought. A clergyman in a big city informed his audience on a recent Sunday that—

> No one need be surprised if God, in his righteous wrath, should start an electric shower upon the World's Fair buildings, that will leave Jackson Park a scene of desolation.

More recently another clergyman in this State said, in his sermon:—

> Let the cholera spread its black wings over us like a cloud, and the earth open and show us its dread disease, and oh, how those sinners will flock to our ones. Let the Lord know how to close the doors of the Fair on Sunday and he will do it. Where the last hand of man works not, the Lord has made every move.

Such utterances, a correspondent of a Chicago paper properly characterizes as blasphemous. The Lord's controversy is not with the people of Chicago, in common with other sinners, but it is not about their disregard of Sunday. Everybody ought to understand, and never forget, that the Lord has no more respect for Sunday that for Monday or Tuesday. It is even known to be "the venerable day of the sun," as many by the Creator. The Lord's day, the Sabbath, is quite another day.
