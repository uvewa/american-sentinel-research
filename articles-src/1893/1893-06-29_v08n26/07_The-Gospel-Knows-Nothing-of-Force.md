**CHRISTIANITY** is the religion of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the only manifestation of God. No man knoweth the Father "save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him." Matt. 11:27. Therefore whatever religion is not the religion of Jesus Christ, is not the worship of God, and must be heathenism. There are only two systems of religion in the world—Christianity and heathenism.

Christianity is the religion of love.

"God is love," and love is the fulfilling of his law. Jesus Christ is the manifestation of God's love to man; "for God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16. Whatever religious practices therefore do not spring from love, are not a part of Christianity, but are a part of heathenism.

But love knows nothing of force. It cannot be forced. "Does your dog love you?" said a man to a boy. "Indeed he does," replied the lad; "he knows that I'll pound the life out of him if he doesn't." Such "love" as that does not afford any satisfaction to either party. Forced service is not love, but is slavery. Therefore compulsory religious service, not being a service of love, is not Christianity, but is essentially heathenism. But law means force, for a law that cannot be enforced is not a law. Therefore it is absolutely impossible that religion by law can be Christianity. Enforced religious observances, no matter of what kind, are no part of Christianity.—*Present Truth*, London.
