We have been requested several times to give our opinion of a so-called Papal Encyclical, which has been very extensively circulated by the anti-Catholic press of this country. In order that our readers may fully understand the matter, we give the "letter" entire, just as it has been published repeatedly in the past six months by other papers:—

**ENCYCLICAL.**

**A LETTER FROM POPE LEO XIII. TO THE ROMISH WORLD.**

Heretics Cut Off From the Church—They Have No Rights—Non-Romish Citizens of the United States Must Have No Privileges—All Papists Absolved From Their Allegiance to the United States Government.

---

**ENCYCLICAL LETTER OF HIS HOSTNESS LEO XIII., BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE, POPE.**

To the Jesuits, Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and other Ordinaries in Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See of the Entire World.

For the Temporal Reign of the Future Popes in a Land Discovered by Christopher Columbus, Known as the United States of America.

Venerable Brethren: Greeting and the Apostolic Benediction, Leo, Bishop and servant of the servants of God; be it remembered by posterity that He who is Omnipotent in Heaven and on Earth had confided His Church, which is One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic, and out of which there is no salvation, to one man upon earth, namely, to Peter, prince and apostle, and to the Bishops of Rome, his successors, with full power to rule over it.

This pontiff alone hath been constituted head over all nations and kingdoms, and invested with power to destroy, to separate, to scatter and subvert, to plant, build up, link together by mutual charity, in order to preserve the faithful in the spirit of unity, and surrender them whole and entire to their Saviour.

In order to fulfill the duties imposed on us by the Divine Goodness, we labor incessantly to maintain the unity of the Roman Catholic religion, which God hath visited with heavy conflicts, to the end that his own may be tried, and for our correction; but the numbers and powers of the wicked have so far prevailed, that no portion of the earth has escaped their attempts to propagate their infectious and detested dogmas, being supported, among others, by that slave to every species of crime.

The American Republic under Protestant rulers is with the worst enemies of the Church, where security is offered; this Republic having seized upon the lands discovered by Christopher Columbus, a Catholic, and usurped the authority and jurisdiction of the Supreme Head of the Church, the United States is filled with obscure heretics.

The Catholics have been oppressed, and the preachers of iniquity established.

The sacrifice of the mass, prayers, fastings, abstinence, celibacy and all the rights of Catholicity have been ignored by Protestants.

The United States has been filled with books containing the most flagrant heresies, of which the Protestant version of the Bible is chief. And not content with adopting its false and impious doctrines, prosilyting has been resorted to, to turn the Catholics from the one true church. The whole Roman Catholic hierarchy and priesthood of the world have been deprived of their livings by the Protestant heretics of America.

Courts have been set up and rendered decisions in ecclesiastical causes, and the people forbidden to acknowledge the authority of the Roman Church, or to obey its ordinances and canonical decisions.

Naturalization oaths have been demanded in order that the subjects of the true church might be made to subscribe to the United States Constitution, with its impious laws and nefarious teachings, to compel them to renounce the true authority of the Catholic pontiff; to disacknowledge him to be the head of both Church and State, whereby those who have persevered in the faith have been compelled to suffer spiritual afflictions.

The Catholic bishops and clergy have been deprived of vast lands, and this is known to all nations, and so clearly proved, that all palliation, argument or protest on the part of the United States is unavailing.

We find, moreover, that impiety and crime have increased, that persecution against the religion of Rome has been redoubled by the Protestants dwelling in the United States of America.

With deep sorrow we are now constrained to have recourse to the arm of justice, and are obliged to take action against a nation that has rejected the Pope as head of all Church and State governments.

In virtue, therefore, of the Divine authority by which we have been placed on this supreme throne of justice, an office so superior to our capability, we do, in the plenitude of apostolic power, declare that all heretics and the encouragers of heresy, together with all adherents, have incurred the sentence of excommunication, and they are hereby cut off from the unity of the body of Jesus Christ.

Moreover, we proclaim the people of the United States of America to have forfeited all right to rule said Republic, and also all dominion, dignity and privileges appertaining to it. We likewise declare that all subjects of every rank and condition in the United States, and every individual who has taken any oath of loyalty to the United States in any way whatever, may be absolved from said oath, so from all other duty, fidelity, or obedience on about the fifth of September, 1893, when the Catholic Congress shall convene at Chicago, Illinois, as we shall exonerate them from all engagements, and on or about the Feast of Ignatius Loyola, in the year of our Lord 1893, it will be the duty of the faithful to exterminate all heretics found within the jurisdiction of the United States of America.

As the circulation of this bull, by sending to all places, would become a matter of difficulty, it is commanded that copies of it be taken and signed by Jesuit notaries, subscribed by a bishop, and sealed with the seal of our court; they will then have the same power and efficacy as these present here.

Given at St. Peter, Rome, on the twenty-fifth of December, 1891, the fifteenth year of our Pontificate.

**LEO XIII., Pope.**

If we are not mistaken the reader is ready to agree with us that this so-called Encyclical is a stupid forgery, a most palpable fraud. The Pope and his advisers are not fools. They understand that the Romish Church is prospering in this country as it is nowhere else in the world, and that in the natural course of events it will one day rule this land. They also know that Catholics even now have a larger influence in governmental affairs than any Protestant denomination, larger indeed than all other sects put together. They know that they control a number of the largest cities of the country; that they hold a fair share of the important offices in the municipal, State and national governments. They know that the Roman Catholic Church, through its priesthood and its large voting membership, now holds the balance of power in this country between the two great political parties, and that for this reason it is able to dictate the policy of the Government towards "the Church." Knowing all this and knowing, too, that they number only about seven and a half millions in a total population of sixty-five millions, Catholics are too wise to adopt any such measures as those set forth in the jumble of vagaries dubbed, "A letter from Pope Leo XIII. to the Romish World."
