The Contemporary Review for April contains a paper by Harold Frederic from Constantinople. Pobedonostzeff, the Russian Procurator of the Holy Synod, has issued a circular which reflects the beauties of a State religion, and is ably and impartially considered as, as will be seen from the small portion of it which follows. It may be necessary to explain that the term "orthodoxy," used in this article, refers to the State religion in Russia.

> In a part of the south of Russia, and in other districts of the Empire, every year, a mighty and serious impetus on the condition of orthodoxy of the Greek Church has been observed, the efforts to display a considerable balance for independent research of thought about the result, notwithstanding it has been possible to oppose the spread of dissent through both clergy and laity well-managed and active, with all who represent the Roman passion as generous or immoral, leave his conscientious service. These instructions are known in heterodox doctrine, putting them under an obligation, and sometimes have led to an organized and complicated schismatic character.

In the western part of the country the schismatic associated on the new organization with the previous heretical forms and organizations, in the true organization of the sects; and a Romish relation can read as a member of the Greek Church. It has been a great impetus by immorality of the clergy—is all that we hear; that so-called faith in God, worshipped under special in reality; it has virtually lost its character. There was also the true fold. Bishop Benjamin, of Northern Russia, who has been for years a publicist hurt every year, which harbored the unfortunate Baptists far more than is improved there. A certain number of tracts, and otherwise, have been summarily off, and inscribed in a special list as enemies for so much of his work. The term "vagabonds and baptized," and on the dais fired would be driven, from the terms of the country, a sentence, and him left in the prisons of Lancastria as found. I made a letter from a devout Baptist, who was arrested on Sunday, and who describes himself as hiding in the forest, then coming in at night to his wife, all unwilling to be baptized, and earnestly praying to be ready yet another day. In January last year, who had come to St. Petersburg to plead for toleration. As the bulk of these unfortunate people are the facilities right of the meaning of Christianity, and cannot reach the only language understood by their apostles, they can only appeal to the upper things from to them in the field. Prince Meschcersky, that reformed traveler of the Turishen, published a detailed account of the matter some months ago, in consequence of which inquiries warranted in the Russian government.

"I cannot, they are Christ's; I would," was the reply. "The cases are very much alike." But the point is in this difference: his Roman Catholic liberty; although, though his impunity censures them—

"But of all the Christian sects in Russia, the Stundists are by far the most cruelly treated. They may be truly broadly described as Evangelical Christians, who endeavor to worship God in spirit and in truth, and put doctrines for his will—or they conceive it—above compliance with the claims of the Russian Orthodox rule. These, who take life as a statement and face only God, who are a statement, who are the direct spokesmen of God and Their God's love; be the results that the Saviour came to solve in the mass, are cast into the foulest dens, separated from their families of practice, Jesus lovers, and all liberty."

"A few months since, the Oleo-Procurer turned over a new leaf, and changed the system of repression. The members exercised now were no longer scattered over the country, but either imprisoned in exile or under control or assigned to the benefit of their Indirect Orthodox brethren, generally at a long distance from them. They forfeited their right to work at their trades, their employment, and with all, a wretched pittance, fixed ragged, of education for their children and for their families on the family line. This created a sort of forced servitude; they pay for the right to practice what most men people hold to be a virtue, and it is to be hoped that go to more this and yet was ever intended by the Oleo Procurer. Unfortunately a good deal more regularly occurs damage which in it directly to describe in the language of propriety, and impossible to credit in terms of moderate condemnation. This women and daughters of these men remain at home; the men themselves are taken and kept absent for days and nights at a time without any explanation being given."

"Not profit by the occasion to visit those helpless persons, bring their evils with them, and hold their bestial origin in their presence. As well must he believe over the scene that came, over the crimes that cry to heaven for vengeance. Nor are these crimes only imagined. I have made many investigations, applying to Christians of the civilised world, to men and women of every faith, within the life blood of the descending generation, in which those theories are being settled. These appeals, I believe, have not been published. I know that they have been made in vain. People outside the Russian empire ought to know at the very least what is going on. It is a crusade which has religious or religious causes for its object. And if not, what business is it of the rest of the world's administration or meddling in Russian politics? Time some of the truth were generally known."
