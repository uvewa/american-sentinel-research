BY proofs as abundant as it has been shown in these columns, and as demonstrated in their own actions, that the professed Protestant churches of the United States have completely apostatized, and are joined in principles and in practice to Rome.

There is the literal truth in regard to the subject; and Rome recognizes these churches as they stand, in organizations, in influence, in leadership, as useful instruments. There are however noble instances of individuals in these churches who have refused to go to Rome, and have protested and still continue to protest against this course.

There are in those churches individuals who still remain Protestant and Christian, for which we sincerely thank the Lord. And as these churches, in their leadership and management, have not only gone over to Rome, but have actually carried the United States Government with them and propose now to use the power of the Government to compel all others to pay court and allegiance to Rome too, it is evident that as these individuals remain Protestant and Christian their protest will become more decided and more emphatic and consequently their numbers will certainly grow. And for this too we sincerely thank the Lord.

If these church misbuilders and mismanagers had carried only the churches with them in their apostasy, this in itself would have been bad enough; but when this was made the means of subverting the Government of the United States and carrying it also over to Rome, in all of their apostasy was infinitely increased. Because they are not the only ones who will now use the power of the Government for the purposes of religious oppression and despotism. If they have the power for such apostolic purposes, this would be bad enough, in all conscience; but having delivered the Government over to Romish principles, Rome herself, too, will use the governmental power for purposes of oppression; she will not only use those professed but apostatic Protestant purposes as puppets to accomplish her ulterior purposes, but as occasion demands, she will act directly and with her old-time audacity.

That it may be further seen how directly opposed are the principles of Rome and those of the Government of the United States as the Government was made and as it was ordained by our fathers to remain, we cite here three "errors" which Rome says "are *condemned and proscribed*" in the "infallible" decree of Rome speaking, *ex cathedra*, through Pope Pius IX. One of these "errors" is this:—

Every man is free to embrace and profess the religion he shall believe true, guided by the light of reason.—*Sects and the Encyclical Fidelism in Relation by Christianity,* Ct. III., Art. XV.

Now, although this is a *condemned* error at Rome, yet everybody knows that this very thing is one of the very fundamental principles of the Government of the United States.

Another of these "errors" is that:—

The Church has no power of availing herself of force, or of any direct or indirect temporal power.

Everybody, even Rome herself, knows that this, too, is one of the very foundation principles of the Government of the United States as our fathers established it.

Yet another of these condemned "errors" is that:—

The Church ought to be separated from the State, and the State from the Church.—*Id.*, 77.

It is hardly necessary to say that this is a fundamental principle, it is *THE* fundamental principle—the very foundation of the foundation of the Government of the United States as it was originally established. And it was made so with the direct purpose of keeping away from Rome, Pope-ism and this—

To oblige for ourselves, and to engage in the exercise of religion agreeable to the dictates of our own consciences; to an instrument, which retains the principles on which the gospel was first

propagated, and *the reformation from popery carried on*, never to be transferred to another use.

And they further said:—

It is impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects that profess the Christian faith, without erecting a claim to infallibility which would lead us back to the Church of Rome.

Now, although the principles of Rome and the principles of the Government of the United States are directly opposite to each other; although the fundamental principles of the Government of the United States are condemned as "errors" under "anathema" by Rome; and although the Government was established and framed upon the direct purpose of keeping away from Rome, yet, in spite of all this, the professed Protestant churches of the United States have subverted the principles of the Government of the United States, and have adopted and forced upon the Government and people of the United States the principles of Rome. These professed Protestant churches have gone over to Rome. And in going over to Rome, instead of maintaining that the Church has no power of availing herself of force and of direct and indirect temporal power, and they have used this force and have availed themselves of this force instead of maintaining the American and Protestant and Christian principle that the Church has no power to be separated from the State, and the State from the Church, these professed Protestant churches—having Rome's principles—have joined themselves to the churches to the State binding and to enforce their decrees even by arresting and imprisoning those who will not obey. Instead of allowing the Government of the United States to abide by the principles that profess the Christian faith, and this, too, in spite of the warning given by our governmental fathers that "to *do* this is to do such a thing without leading us back to the Church of Rome." They have got up and accepted the Congress of the United States as an authoritative judge, arbiter of the Scriptures, in spite of the faithful warning bequeathed by the suffering of ages that "the establishment of Christianity" with the interpretation of the Bible had ended only in the subjection of man to man in that which should be man's individual conscience toward his faith." They have abandoned the

Protestant and Christian principle, and have adopted the principles of Rome instead. Their apostasy is complete, and there remains only the appearance of the thing—not the inevitable fruits of it.

But it is not only the appearing but the gathering of the bitter and destructive fruit of this apostasy as it is demanded. That is what we would now call attention to; it places the situation as it is to-day. When Congress was asked to close the World's Fair on Sunday, and the demand was made by the Protestants, and this interpretation of the scripture, was made by Congress, the demand was under the threats of the professed Protestant churches of the United States, aided by the Catholic Church, in the latter especially of Cardinal Gibbons, who pointed to which day is the True Sabbath. Those who herein demanded that Congress should decide the question of religion in favor of the land; their interpretation of the law of God in their favor, and Congress did it, in their demand. And now they have begun to present the "Sunday closing question." They were able to make their demand to Congress in a sufficient degree to accomplish their will in this matter, and having satisfied themselves, perhaps, now declare that that question is settled.

BUT all the question between Catholics and Protestants is not settled. We suppose some question arises between the Catholics and the Protestants as to whom suppose the Catholic Church is able to exert sufficient influence to secure the decisions of Congress in her favor. What, then, can Protestants say? If Rome proposes to deny the right of Congress to take such a question, the Catholic Church must say, simply—"You did it and deny simply all its virtue—You did and we deny that Congress had any power to decide it. So far from denying the right of Congress to do this, you practically appealed to Congress. It was then competent to decide a controversy between Protestant sects; it is competent to decide between Protestant and Catholic. You appealed to Congress. If in your favor there, you gladly claimed the right of Congress to decide such a question in your favor; to settle a question, and when it is a question in your favor, "that is a decision of Congress, and in our favor does not settle a question." Then Congress adopted your view and fixed it in the law; you said that you had asked Congress to *decide*, and then that this has adopted and expressed the law as your view, and we ask the same for us. You said it was right, and we say so too. We did this question right. You say it is right, And you cannot deny it."

WHAT can these Protestants answer!— Not a word. Their mouths will be absolutely stopped. And then they will find that the compliment they have sold themselves into the hands of Rome, in the principles of Rome in a Roman Catholic nation.

Nor is such a courtesy a far-off thing. It is at hand in more shapes than one. Every point is already raised. It came about in this way:—In 1886, by a scheme of the Catholic Church, the Catholics in Church and about fourteen professed Protestant churches secured donations of money from the treasury of the United States to

aid them in carrying on their missionary work among the Indians. And at the very first move the Catholic Church obtained more money than all the Protestant put together—the Catholics $118,343.61, and all the others together only $109,316.

The second year the Catholics got $194,635, while all the others got but $140,079; the third year the Catholic Church got $347,672, and the rest only $181,610; the fourth year the Catholic Church got $356,957, while all the rest together got but $193,060; the fifth year the Catholic Church got $363,349, while all the others got only $201,901; and the sixth year the Catholic Church got $400,000, while all the Protestants together got but the mere sum $233,186. The Catholic Church, even, is only six years the Catholic Church succeeded in increasing her percentage of the whole amount, from a little more than that of all the others together—and this too while there was a steady decrease all the time too.

In 1893 an effort was made by the Massachusetts legislature to make a large appropriation of public money "as it was before to confine expediency on the floor" of the House and of the Senate. The record shows that "it found it of impossible to do so." And when the motion to stop it, it was next proposed to stop all; to pay no more to the Protestants or to any, over that which they had received the year before, and with this the Protestants were content. Not so the Catholic Church, however. She claims the right to get more also would have, and more she got. But how could she get more when the whole sum was limited to the amount that was no particular hindrance to her. She simply dropped in her "card" a little "slaughter" and went into the House of Representatives and secured $70,000 added to her share of the year before; and when she had to face the Senate she went there too, and got $15,000 more added, making $85,000, which was accounted to her great victory in addition to her share for the year before, and this in spite of the determination of Congress. And while that was done all of the Protestant churches engaged in this business of getting public money, had consented that the Catholic Church was getting more than her share. And as she continued to increase, they all began to be pressed against it. But the Protestants consented to yielding, because they were taking money from the public treasury and were afraid that the Catholic Church would rebel because she was getting more than they were. And the Catholic Church was growing and succeeded in reducing the appropriation for the Protestant Indians—$143,607, and to the Catholic Church to $363,349, of all this public money the Catholics $394,756—the Catholics were getting more than the dollar, to one hundred.

WELL, the Protestants seeing the Catholic Church was beating them at Congress got together and with the Harrison administration on their side, have now taken another step and propose to take no more public money at all. The Methodist, the Episcopalian, the Congregationalist, and the Baptist churches have all refused to take any more; and yet now is the Presbyterian Church on trying to get their church to refuse likewise. The object of this is to have all the Protestant churches refuse to receive any more public money, and then together make one united act against such appropriation to the Catholic Church. But here again they will find themselves defeated and will feel the power of Rome by its selfish blunders against this Protestantism.

First, when they declare it wrong to make appropriation of public money to the churches, the Catholic Church will say:

"You yourselves took public money in this way year after year—as many as six years straight along. If it was wrong, it was wrong from the first and all the time. If you have since found out that it is wrong, it does not follow that I must acknowledge it to be wrong. Moreover, you were the ones who set the example and showed the way. While you yourselves took the money, you had nothing to say against our getting it. The Catholic Church goes to Congress for what the Protestants went for and for what the Catholics." "And what answer can the Protestants make?—Not a word."

Again, the Catholic Church can argue with perfect propriety: "The Supreme Court of the United States has unanimously declared that this is a Christian Nation. The starting point and leading proof of this, the court tells us is the fact that "the commission to discover Columbus, 'prior to his sail west,' recited that 'it is hoped that by God's assistance some of the continents and islands,' etc., which recites that 'it is hoped that by God's assistance some of the continents and islands in the ocean will be discovered.' The argument for America to be propagated by established religion would have had the introduction, which Columbus revealed and which has been the religious character and effort of the nation ever since. Therefore, as an American religious establishment, we claim to be the 'religious people' and 'a Christian people.' As such, the Catholic Church is the first, the mother church of America."

In all these points the Catholic Church is absolutely correct. We have shown in these columns that the Catholic Church was the first Christian church in America, the mother church, and the one that has done and is doing the most for the advancement of religion; as all but Catholics are heretics any way, the appropriation of money by the Government to the Catholic in the Catholic religion is one of the most appropriate things that the Government can do. It is perfectly right that the Catholic Church should receive the bulk of the appropriation. She has the right based upon precedent, national authority and the fitness of things.

And, again, what can the Protestants say against this?—Not a single word.

The fathers of this Republic saw well what would come of this kind of thing, and said sensibly: Christianity is established not by civil but by religious power; each sect has its own method of establishing itself; therefore, the Government must not be called to answer to establish any religious sect or Christian in exclusion of all other sects. The Government of the United States was ever forbidden to recognize any religion. This they saw, and this they said, was from the Christian stand-point. They asked for years that the Christian religion would be the best friend of national religion. They refused to establish any. But the Protestants today, in exclusion of all other denominations, the Catholic sect of the "Christian religion" is getting more than all the others. They have but themselves to blame for it. They cannot deny her rank and right; and judgment by the Catholic upon the Supreme Court must be in her favor of it and in favor of her right. Neither can they call in question the right, fitness of the demand, for the same reasons. And if the Protestants have already proved that devotion to their advantage in influencing Congress to recognize Sunday
