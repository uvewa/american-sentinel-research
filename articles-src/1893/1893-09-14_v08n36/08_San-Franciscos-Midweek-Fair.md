AUGUST 21 was the occasion of an enthusiastic demonstration in San Francisco when ground was broken for the contemplated buildings and other improvements connected with the Midwinter Fair. A number of invitations were sent out by the Executive Committee, the ministers being not a small proportion of those invited. One of these, Rev. E. R. Stow, of the Second Presiding Presbyterian Church, sent a letter in reply, in which he said:—

I have been requested by a member of my congregation to be present at the ceremonies upon the World's Fair at Chicago and, therefore, shall be unable to attend. While there, as the pastor of a church that has a Sabbath law, duty is clearly setting before me the duty to make plain that a California State Fair shall be closed on the Sabbath. Such I announced from my pulpit, and I shall present a petition from my church.

The committee did not take any formal action on the letter, but Gen. W. H. L. Wallace, vice-president of the association, made what caustic response, in which occurred the following:—

In common with all other clergymen of all denominations whose invitations have been sent, I recognize your right to express your personal opinion as to the Sunday opening of the Fair, which we regard as a matter of the utmost importance to the Fair, to the general economy and the sentiment and interests of this community. But your right to thus attempt—to convert—at this time to exaggerate. We disclaim any right in ourselves to interfere with the exercise and preempt so such an occasion. . . . We cannot help observing, too, that this premature agitation of a question relating to religious institutions, implies of that Forum Power which we are sure you would be among the last to claim and invoke.

This is what the *Examiner* calls Reverend Stow a "premature attempt at Sunday-closing idea." But the "Sunday-Reading" of the SENTINEL will remember the celebrated "equal" with its management which has in the regular Sunday columns intentionally make the desired connection. The Presbyterian ministers of San Francisco and Oakland have taken their stand for closing, but the Christian Sunday Society has also spoken, and other religious associations, temperance societies, and army gentlemen have indicated their purpose to join the crusade. Inasmuch as the leading men, financial and social, of San Francisco will take a deep interest in the Fair, we may expect to see a determined trial of strength on the part of all the forces arrayed on in all the opposition to the advocacy of Sunday.

Surely all classes of men are predicting an approaching time of trouble and the

Whatever may be the case with individuals, it is certain that the majority of men are not only willingly in its *long* journey and temporal contemplation. And when the temptation comes to them in the abuse of power and enchantment, they are too often only to profess the fundamental principle, and doubted, not indeed their belief, but the external, make by an by which their belief is made public. Every man, except a very wise one, is prone to detect this. Protestantism, is an abetter of hypocrisy and a creator of hypocrites. Well, therefore, may we say, that when a government builds on a basis, that those who profess certain opinions shall enjoy certain privileges, it plays the part of the tempter of old, and, like the evil one, barely offers the good things of the world to him who will bow down and worship him.—*Sunday Gazette.*
