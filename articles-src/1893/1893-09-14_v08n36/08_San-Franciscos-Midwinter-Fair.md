August 24 was the occasion of an enthusiastic demonstration in San Francisco, when ground was broken for the contemplated buildings and other improvements connected with the Midwinter Fair. A large number of invitations were sent out by the Executive Committee, the ministers of the city being amongst the number thus honored. One of these, Rev. E. B. Stewart, of the Second United Presbyterian Church, sent a letter in reply, in which was this statement:—

> As one who entered emphatic protest against attendance upon the World's Fair at Chicago because of the violation both of rational and of divine laws, duty is clearly setting before me the necessity of avoiding even so much complicity in this enterprise until assurance is had that its gates shall be closed on the Sabbath. Such assurance I do not have at present, and therefore must beg leave to decline with regret the invitation so courteously given.

The committee did not take any formal action on the letter, but Gen. W. H. L. Barnes, of the committee, returned a somewhat caustic response, in which occurred these sentiments:—

> In common with all other clergymen of all religious denominations of San Francisco, you were invited to be present at the inauguration of an enterprise whose importance to the State, to the general education, and to the highest expression of Christianity—charity to the poor and labor to the labor less—cannot at this time be exaggerated. We regret that, as a teacher of the people, you withhold your sanction and presence on such an occasion. The celebration will, nevertheless, take place. It will be opened with prayer and finished with a benediction, implored of that Divine Power whose aid in our work we seek. We hope he will be present, if you are not, and we believe he will.

This is what the Examiner calls Executive Committee's "first brush with the Sunday-closing idea." But the "Sunday-closing idea" has been preparing for an extended "brush" with the management of the Fair if the latter does not unconditionally make the desired concession. The Presbyterian ministers of San Francisco and Oakland have taken their stand for closing; the Christian Endeavor Society has also spoken, and other religious associations, temperance societies, and some industrial organizations are also expected to join the crusade. Inasmuch as the leading counties and principal cities of the State will take a deep interest in the Fair, we may expect to see a determined trial of strength on the part of all the forces usually conspicuous in the advocacy of Sunday laws.

Nearly all classes of men are predicting an approaching time of trouble and disaster. We believe there is an hour of spiritual darkness even now upon the world, and nothing more forcibly portends this prophetic fact than the intolerant spirit now being manifested in the increasing clamor for Sunday laws and their rigid enforcement.—*Signs of the Times.*
