A Sunday law paper remarks that "the decision rendered by Chief Justice Fuller, of the Supreme Court of the United States, has served to encourage and entabolden the lawless, godless element of this country and their abettors, the Seventh-day Adventists, in opposing the Sabbath." It has done nothing of the kind. Chief Justice Fuller's decision had nothing to do with either Sunday or the Sabbath. The only question before Judge Fuller was the right of the United States to assume jurisdiction over the Fair grounds and usurp the powers both of the State of Illinois and of a corporation created under the laws of that State. So far as the fling at Seventh-day Adventists is concerned, it is true only in this, that they from the first consistently opposed any governmental interference in the matter, because it was a purely religious question, and legislation upon religious matters is forbidden by the Federal Constitution. Seventh-day Adventists respect that instrument as it reads.
