THE series of religious congresses, which will occupy the entire month of September, formally and authoritatively opened yesterday with the Catholic congress, which a leading morning paper characterizes, in its headlines as "The most important gathering of church dignitaries ever held in America." Cardinal Gibbons was present, and a long list of archbishops, bishops and priests, together with delegates from every State in the Union. It was an august and impressive spectacle. The intellect and culture, the authority and power, of the Roman Catholic Church in America were assembled there.

W. J. Onahan, secretary of the committee on organization, introduced Archbishop Peshan who first addressed the members of the congress, and presented C. C. Bonney, President of the World's Congress Auxiliary. In the course of his address Mr. Bonney expressed some suggestive thoughts. The following paragraph, in its first sentence, states a fact, the truth of which all will realize:—

> That a great change has come in the relations of the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches with each other is known throughout the world. That this change has largely increased human happiness and has in many ways promoted the cause of peace and progress is also widely acknowledged. A brief reference to some of the leading causes of this change seems, however, especially appropriate to this occasion and may serve to strengthen the gracious bonds of charity and affection which are now gently drawing nearer and nearer to each other all the various branches of the great family of mankind.

One paragraph of Mr. Bonney's address in reference to education may bear almost any interpretation which he might think it politic to put upon it, but if the American doctrine of popular education is in accord with the Roman Catholic idea as practically realized, wherever that hierarchy has had the opportunity, Mr. Bonney has been the first to discover it. This is what he said:—

> There is one important particular in which the ideas of Catholic educational leaders are in peculiar accord with the original American doctrine of popular education. The third article of the great ordinance of 1797 for the government of the territory of which Chicago is the metropolis declared that, "religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged."
>
> Not knowledge only: not knowledge and morality merely, but religion, morality and knowledge, sacred trinity of the powers of human progress, are essential to the proper education of the people.

The welcoming address concluded thus, the references to Pope Leo eliciting most hearty applause:—

> But a greater agency of union and progress still remains to be named—the illustrious head of the Catholic Church, Pope Leo XIII., than whom no more able, enlightened and benign pontiff has borne the name of holy father in a thousand years. Like the morning bell of a new age, his earnest words in speaking of the American people are: "I love them and I love their country. I have a great tenderness for those who live in that land. Protestants and all. Under the Constitution religion has perfect liberty, and is a growing power. Where the church is free, it will increase; and I bless, I love Americans for their frank, open unaffected character and for the respect which they pay to Christianity and Christian morals. My only desire is to use my power for the good of the whole people Protestant and Catholics alike. I want the Protestants as well as the Catholics to subsum me." Is it any wonder that Pope Leo XIII., is respected and beloved by the Protestants to whom these words were addressed?

On the Protestant side similar causes have been at work, producing similar results. The time now at command will not permit a presentation of these results, but it may suffice to say that they have culminated in the arrangements for the World's Religious Congresses of 1893.

Blind, indeed, must be the eyes that cannot see in these events the quickened march of the ages of human progress toward the fulfillment of the divine prophecy of one fold and one shepherd, when all forms of government shall be one in liberty and justice and all forms of faith and worship one in charity and human service.

With these sentiments I greet and welcome the Catholic congress of 1893. [Applause.]

Cardinal Gibbons followed with an address expressed with the utmost grace and filled with well-turned phrases which brought out his thought so skillfully and tactfully that none who heard failed to be impressed.

Chairman O'Brien in describing the common platform upon which churchmen both Catholics and non-Catholic stood, said:—

> And against irreligion the implacable foe to our present civilization—whatever form it may assume—all those, whether Protestant or Catholic, who believe in the vital force of religion have a common ground upon which they stand. Not only in this have we a bond of union with our Protestant countrymen, who in good faith are engaged in disseminating virtue and religion, but there are also general charities, which look to the amelioration of the condition of the poor, the sick and the aged, as well as measures designed to suppress intemperance and gambling and prevent the desecration of the Sunday. These are among the subjects which will receive consideration by this congress, and it is in a spirit of generous rivalry—according to all the same religious freedom which we claim for ourselves—that we will endeavor to discharge that duty which we owe to our church and to our country.

No doubt the so-called orthodox as represented by the American Sabbath Union and its following would accept every plank of this platform, and be willing to join in a Roman Catholic anathema upon all who are unwilling to stand upon it.

A large number of addresses and papers were presented during the day, all marked in the highest degree by ability, skill, and expression, deep research, thorough learning and culture, such as has not been seen before at these congresses, and such as is likely the Protestant congresses which are to follow cannot equal.

This World's Fair season, and this Religious Congress in particular, marks an era in the religious history of this country. What it portends is clear to those who believe that Revelation reveals.
