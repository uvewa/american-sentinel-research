A COMMUNICATION from Canada says that the Catholic priests, who were formerly opposed to annexation, are discarding their misconceptions of the effect of entering the Union. They are becoming familiar with the fact that, under our Federal Constitution, Quebec, transformed from a Canadian province into an American State, would have full power to uphold the Catholic religion and its other local institutions. The account adds that the reason of this new advocacy on the part of the priests is that "they, like their parishioners, are suffering from the impoverishment of the province and from the increasing exodus of French Canadians to the United States." In other words, having eaten up clean everything about the houses and gardens of their victims, these priestly rats desire a flow of good things from a new source to be turned on.

As to the fact that Quebec when made one of our United States could continue under an established religion, that is perfectly true. It seems to be the vague belief of many that there is about the United States something antagonistic to religious despotism—that that form of tyranny cannot be practiced within the jurisdiction of our national Government. But this is not the case. The Constitution declares that Congress shall not establish any religion, but the States are left at perfect freedom, except where prevented by their own constitutions, to establish as many religions as they wish, and persecute other faiths as severely as devout heart shall crave. Even in those States whose constitutions forbid the establishment of a religion, any church becoming powerful enough could reverse that provision and set itself up in legal domination.

Of course, in a certain sense, Church establishment, or any connection of Church and State, is un-American, and repugnant to our political spirit and traditions. . . . The intention was that it should keep Church and State separate. And one of the factors of its success over the old nations has been its abstinence from the sectarian coercion common in them. To be sure, the separation of Church and State here is not complete yet.

Thus, no national law is against State religious establishment, but an unwritten sentiment, a public spirit, is.

Quebec, however, is not to be expected to heed this spirit. When she gets admitted as a State she will, it may be supposed, at once set up laws favoring the Catholic Church, and persecuting Protestants, even beyond her present ones, which she is obliged to keep within measure by the Protestant British general government over her.

Interest is naturally turned to the character of our new sister. In one account we find a history of the Quebec peasant. He attended mass every Sunday if the church was within reach, welcomed the Récollets, or poor friars, who tramped through the settlements; offered the first salmon of the year for sale at the church door for the good of the souls in purgatory; prayed at the angelus; sought a blessing when he began any serious work, such as building a barn, and prided himself on his loyalty to his king and religion. There were no schools outside of Quebec, Montreal, and Three Rivers, and no books save the catechism. Everybody was superstitious. Fortune-tellers cast his horoscope for two sons, a meal, or a bed; faux-follets and witches sought to lure him to destruction; a loup garou or werwolf, under the corporal form of a beggar, except that it had four legs, haunted Kamouraska as late as 1767. Happily, the St. Lawrence was consecrated, and these Satanic agents could not cross it, but fled howling into the forest when the frightened habitant reached its shores. The peasant's life was without intellectual interest, and intolerably laborious. He was hard ground by lord and priest. Besides the seigneurial dues and restrictions the habitant paid tithes to the clergy. Originally one-thirteenth of his cereals, they were reduced to one twenty-sixth, the present figure. On a petition from a bare majority of the Roman Catholic freeholders in a parish, the priest and bishop may proceed with the erection of a new church or priest's dwelling, and the cost is levied as a fabrique tax on all the freeholders. The fabrique tax and tithes are a first charge on the soil. Protestants are exempt. It cannot be said, continues this account, that these imposts fleece the people; they would probably pay as much if the church were supported on the voluntary principle. The main grievance which they have against her is that her vast estates, estimated to be worth $100,000,000, do not pay their fair share of municipal taxation, and that there is an excessive number of "religious" both in the church itself and in the conventual bodies of men and women. The official handbook in 1892 shows nearly eight thousand.
