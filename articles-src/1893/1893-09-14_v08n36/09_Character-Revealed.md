THE following from the *New York Christian Advocate* of the 7th ult., is of interest, especially to those of our readers who remember the controversy of some four years ago between the gentleman referred to and the editors of the SENTINEL:

The Rev. W. F. Crafts sends this memorandum:—

We observe a disposition in the *Evening Post* and in the *Tribune* to call the weekly rest day "the Sabbath" rather than "Sunday." This is a significant straw.

> We observe a disposition in the Evening Post and in the Tribune to call the weekly rest day "the Sabbath" rather than "Sunday." This is a significant straw. Is it not the correct name? The fourth commandment says so, and so does every other reference to it in Scripture.

What Mr. Crafts wishes to regard it as is from the side of the law only.

> As we have to say that this is not a correct statement. The Sabbath is another name for Saturday. The members of the old and now have been transferred by apostolic authority to the first day of the week which they call the "Lord's day." . . . Mr. Crafts knows all this. He prefers to designate his character which has been already "done to a turn" in these columns. He surely has the courage of his convictions. He did not hesitate to avow himself opposed to religious liberty. No doubt he wishes his fellow-citizens to know him better.

Like the Scarab of Rev. 3:10, the sting of the discovery is not in the sting, but in its similarity deserved. But it is not at all surprising. Mr. Crafts started out with the advocacy of a Sunday rest law. No man has once acquired the unfortunate distinction of becoming a Sunday legislator but as he would have them, he is a solemnist. Not only political but ecclesiastical dimensions are still nigh hopeless.
