The following from the New York Christian Advocate of the 24th ult., will be of interest, especially to those of our readers who remember the controversy of some four years ago between the gentleman referred to and the editors of the SENTINEL:—

The Rev. W. F. Crafts sends this note:—

> Editor Christian Advocate: Please publish the statements made in your editorial of July 20, page 1, third column, from, "Nor do we" to the end, in parallel columns with your editorial of Aug. 10, two paragraphs, same part of page 1, beginning, and end, and in the same column, the statement in the telegram of the World's Fair Sabbath-closing Committee that you believe or suspected that the State injunction would be used as "a trick" was warranted by your words.

In the above Mr. Crafts misquotes his telegram. It was this:—

> Many, including the editor of the Christian Advocate, Dr. Buckley, think the State injunction is passively used as a trick.

On that telegram we said:—

> We observe a telegram in the Tribune stating that the editor of this paper is of the opinion that that is a trick, a collusion between the directory and the local courts, and they may get the benefits of endeavoring to close—the sympathy of Christian people, increased attendance on west days, and still under the appearance of being compelled to do so, keep open on Sunday. The letter is authority to that statement. What we have said is that there is nothing in the past conduct of the directory to afford a guarantee that they would not do this, and that nothing they do affords a guarantee that the Fair will be closed so long as this injunction case is unsettled.

What Mr. Crafts wishes us to reprint is from the Christian Advocate of July 20:—

> Nor do we know now that there is not a secret understanding that local courts shall prevent closing, and thus the directory stock responsibility.

But there are no facts of the evil one have been illustrated; he has gone about "roaring," and now he may be trying the role of air "aged of light." When it is settled that the Fair is to be closed, then, and not till then, can those whose consciences would compel them to remain away be justified in attending.

It is dangerous to do business with a person who will transform "Nor do we know" and "may be" into "think."

"We do not know" but this transaction "may" reveal the elements of his character which have developed the genius for misunderstanding with which we "think" he and his acquaintances have to contend.

Like the locusts of Rev. 9:10, the sting of the Advocate's reply is in its tail; but it is eminently deserved. But it is not at all likely that any reformation will be effected in the case in hand. When a man has once acquired the unfortunate habit of stating things not as they are but as he would have them, he is seldom able to break away from it. Constitutional diseases are well-nigh hopeless.
