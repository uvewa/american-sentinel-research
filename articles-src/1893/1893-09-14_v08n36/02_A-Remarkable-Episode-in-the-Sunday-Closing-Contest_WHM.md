Chicago Correspondence.

ANOTHER remarkable chapter was added last week to the history of the agitation for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The decision of Judge Stein of the Superior Court, in the Clingman case, enjoining the World's Fair authorities from closing Jackson Park, in which the World's Fair is situated, to the people on Sundays or any other day of the week, because a source of dissatisfaction to the management when it was discovered that the Sunday receipts would, at the best fall far short of reimbursing them for the return of the conditional appropriation of two million five hundred thousand dollars.

This being so, and Judge Stein having not only refused to modify his decree, but having heavily fined the members of the World's Fair management for their disregard of it, a motion to dissolve Judge Stein's injunction was made before Judge Goggin of the same court. Judges Brentano and Dunne, also of the Superior Court, were asked to sit with him in hearing and determining the case. The matter was argued,—its presentation being, in the main, as previously argued before Judge Stein, and for more than a week a decision had been anxiously awaited. On Thursday, August 31, one of the most unexpected and surprising episodes of this whole contest, strange as it has been, occurred. Judge Goggin had determined to sustain the injunction granted by Judge Stein, while Judges Brentano and Dunne, sitting on the bench with him by invitation had decided that it should be dissolved. Judge Goggin determined that his own purpose should not be defeated, asked the dissenting judges to withdraw from the hearing of the case, which they did, after reading their opinion, and he then continued the matter for sixty days, which is until the close of the Fair.

This action of Judge Goggin has brought upon him, probably, as severe criticism, couched in as vituperative language, as ever was visited upon any judge in this country. There was no precedent for such a course. Never before, undoubtedly, in the history of our courts has judicial courtesy been so violated, yet Judge Goggin has kept wholly within his rights as judge of that court. He is not legally in the wrong. He has violated only the judicial code of ethics. He had, no doubt, strictly, as much right to disregard the views of the judges whom he had asked to counsel with him and request them to withdraw, as he would have had to refuse to accept the decision of a jury which he considered contrary to the law and the evidence and to dismiss such a jury. But the breach of courtesy remains, both in the act and the manner in which it was done, and that will rankle long.

An attempt is to be made to have the matter reheard before Judge Ewing, of a court of concurrent jurisdiction, but it is difficult to see how another judge will find any sufficient reason for taking the case out of the hands of Judge Goggin, and it seems probable that the matter has now reached the status in which it will remain for the rest of the period of the continuance of the World's Fair. Still nothing is more certain than that this subject will not be dropped, even for a moment, and the most unexpected and improbable complications are liable to arise in it at any time.

The attendance at the Fair upon the Sunday following Judge Goggin's action increased five thousand, there being, on that day, twenty-five thousand paid admissions, as against twenty thousand of the preceding Sunday.

The agitation for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and its results in legislative and judicial action mark an era in the history of this Republic. The Rubicon has been passed and it can never be recrossed. The character of the contest which is now before us already begins to be apparent. The ordinary observer, if he will but open his eyes to that which has been done, and the way in which it has been done, can understand what the result will be.
