THE Catholic Review complains of Protestant missionaries, that "in India, China and other parts of Asia, in Central Africa, with the help of British officers, they are exterminating the native Catholics and banishing priests and native rulers." The Independent takes this as an evidence that the missionaries are meeting with success in their work. They certainly are, but if the Review states the case correctly, it is certainly not Christian work.
