THE trite interrogation, "What's in a name?" may receive enlargement. While just now the question, "What's in a Sunday law?" is all should arouse the greatest apprehension in the minds of the good people of the communities generally, especially when the Sunday law idea of general application is this boasted land of the free.

The readers of the SENTINEL, have been aware for years, with especial explanation of the principles involved in the movement of these laws, and the claims made to them to attend their execution. If men could see a principle as they might in a trial at a court in many instances; but of not, all the consequences may be, yes, must be the same. There is no principle involved in any species of Sunday law with a very liberal exemption clause, that is not involved in one requiring nothing another day as the Sabbath. Every principle is the same in each case.

The following from the *St. Louis Re-Examiner*:—

CHARLESTON, MO. JUNE 21—A formal arrest was today and an action begun in the county court, for a violation of the Sunday law against two men of this place, who were arrested for a violation of the Sunday law last week. It had been previously announced in the local paper approximately three weeks day ago that the law against working on the Sabbath, had no examination on the day mentioned. But as there is no exemption in the Missouri law for any purpose whatever, the men were indicted.

Now we can consider that the living issue, "What's in a Sunday law?" There was only a full compliance with the law.

The mark's a full compliance with the exact question. The thinking man can see that on the logic of the present movement by the law-making power in enacting a Sunday law, however mild on its face, has nothing for but that same results, the answer, by realizing active penalties on whomsoever the law makers may see to inflict; and will have much longer to wait if the people will not much longer to wait the legal will have much longer to wait for.

There are two important points illustrated in the tableau incident; the clause tending to show that the Sunday law must be made an exact duplicate of the provisions of the exemption boards of exemption or even if it were, it would be none the less. Both forcibly impress the fact that a species of religious intolerance from the State must always and everywhere exist and only exist.

The exemption clause works no injustice to those whom it presumes to favor by furnishing a resort for persons who have no regard for truth. They impose their ill reputation upon the exempted class for the purposes of gaining an advantage. As has been shown in these columns, a false claim even to evade an unjust law is like any those who are accustomed to suffer the influx of similar characters and evil, and present the case. Exemption clauses do not protect as has been supposed and are, therefore, deceptive. This will also require more of the persons exempted,

than of any one class, under them. Those enjoying the full force of the law are only required to abstain from ordinary labor, while those exempted are required to observe the day as a Sabbath, or as it seems to "conscientiously observe another day."

Again, exemption from a general law is but tolerative, and hardly carries natural right. Here is evidence establishing the second point, that the courts must be the final arbiters as to what constitutes religious laws in force. In this case the two men referred to were put to work in order to make the test of criminality, and sends a criminal for one reason, and a criminal for another. This courts must decide. If the law in and by itself is itself to be just no criminal for an Adventist or for any one could be found.

In the face of such facts how long will public sentiment be content that these are merely religious questions or that the safety of our dismist institutions are not involved? When the laws are such as to allow to all and an exemption is a confession of injustice in the law. To secure a legal religious the courts must be better informed in definition and theology than the minister for to present even a semblance of compulsory justice duty must be made universal.

It seems that any one might see that the only absolute and satisfactory and clear-headed doctrine of equality before the law can be sustained by adherence to the fundamental truth "that all men are created equal," guaranteeing to all men "their just" power from the consent of the governed. This involves the civil and religious rights of the people. "What's in a Sunday law?" Take it in and shake, know what it claims, of all our boasted liberty? Nothing but the misery of a charitable land.
