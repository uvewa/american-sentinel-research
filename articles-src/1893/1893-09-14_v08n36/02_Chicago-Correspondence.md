A REMARKABLE EPISODE IN THE SUNDAY CLOSING CONTROVERSY.

ANOTHER remarkable chapter was added last week to the history of the agitation for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The decision of Judge Stein of the Superior Court, in his charge enjoining the World's Fair authorities from closing Jackson Park, in which the judge declared in substance that as the law does not compel the closing of the Fair on Sundays or any other day of the week, it cannot be closed by any private arrangement—was—when it was discovered that this mandate of the court had taken the full far short of reimbursing them for the return of the outstanding appropriation of two millions five hundred thousand dollars.

This was, and Judge Stein having been kept away from the bench the next day, not only refused to modify his decree, but swept lovingly loved the mandates of the court by issuing a further order, in the form of a special order, as it was, continuing granting the power of the original grant of a motion to dissolve Judge Goggin of the same court. Judges Brentano and Dunne, also of the Superior Court, were asked to sit with him in hearing the motion—but before the constitutional matter was argued—its presentation being, in the main, as previously agreed before Judge Stein, and for more than a week a decision has been delayed. The subsequent decisions have been eagerly awaited as unexpected, and surprising episodes of this kind are just what people look for in this period. Judge Goggin had determined to sustain the injunctions granted by Judge Stein, while Judges Brentano and Dunne, sitting on the bench with him by invitation, had decided that it should be dissolved. Judge Goggin determined that his own decision should prevail, and consequently dissolving Judges to withdraw from the bench and their names from the paper. After reading their opinion, and he then continued the matter for four days, when it then dissolved of its own force, and it was until the close of the Fair.

This *Christian Statesman* says that since closing of the World's Fair has been "practically achieved," nevertheless the number of paid admissions on Sunday, September 3, was 23,105, of which 12,332 were adults who paid full fare, while only 1,103 were children at twenty-five cents each. The receipts of the day including carpenters received from commissioning for this issue of Sunday closing outside the Sunday people, it must be because they are so accustomed to frauds and fakes the article if they were to see it. But no wonder, a counterfeit Sabbath naturally blinds them to every thing else. Moreover, they all want to go to the Fair, but they pledged themselves not to go unless the gates were closed on Sunday; but now that the gates are not closed, nor are

they likely to be, the Sunday forces close their eyes instead to the open gates and visit the Fair just as every day knew they would, notwithstanding all their bluster and pledges.

*Chicago, Sept. 5.*
