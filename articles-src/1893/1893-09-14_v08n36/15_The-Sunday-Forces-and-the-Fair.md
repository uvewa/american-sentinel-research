The Christian Salesman says that Sunday closing of the World's Fair has been "practically achieved," nevertheless the number of paid admissions on Sunday, September 3, was 25,439, of which 24,284 were adults who paid full price, while only 1,155 were children at twenty-five cents per head. The receipts for the day were, therefore, $12,307.75, beside the percentages received from concessionaires. If this sort of Sunday closing satisfies the Sunday people, it must be because they are so accustomed to frauds and fakes that they would not know a genuine article if they were to see it. But no wonder, a counterfeit Sabbath naturally blinds them to every thing else. Moreover, they all want to go to the Fair, but they pledged themselves not to go unless the gates were closed on Sunday; but now that the gates are not closed, nor are they likely to be, the Sunday forces close their eyes instead to the open gates and visit the Fair just as everybody knew they would, notwithstanding all their bluster and pledges.
