THE Evangel and Sabbath Outlook very pertinently remarks that the "growth of Roman Catholicism in New England is well known to those who study current events. Neither is it surprising when one remembers that 'Church authority' forms so large a part of the basis of Protestant faith. The end is not yet and Protestants must open their eyes to these facts or suffer the defeat which always accompanies blindness, whether induced by indifference or disobedience."
