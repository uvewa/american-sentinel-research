NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 14, 1893.

ANY one sending the names and addresses of twenty-five or more persons interested in the American Sentinel, to this office, or to any State Tract Society, can have specimen copies of the paper sent to them. Any person wishing a general distribution of the paper in any city or town, can have it by notifying the nearest State Tract Society, or by sending the matter directly to us.

THE Central Railroad Railway of Wisconsin. Mass. recently did some Sunday work on their tracks, upon which an indignation was expressed by the ministers of that city to protect and assume a resolution of the "desecration."

IT is a little surprising to read that "Mr. Sadi's" recent visit to Cincinnati was not made without danger of attack at the hands of sectarian cranks. He was constantly attended by a body guard; but there was "one venturous crank . . . who was ready to attack him, but Protestants were ready to fawn upon him.

GOVERNOR ALTGELD, of Illinois, has gone on record as saying that in all America there are not more than fifty anarchists. The Governor evidently forgot to count the American Sabbath Union, or else, why its head and its institutions, complied Congress to violate the fundamental of the civil law of the land in the passage of the Sunday closing provision.

AN effort was made to impose Judge Goggin of Chicago, to set aside Judge Goggin's continued refusal for sixty days; the proceedings in the Chapman injunction, but on the 6th instant His Honor denied the motion, on the ground that it was made by a forced authority contrary to take jurisdiction of the hearing. It was current this evening in the Big Fair that the gates remained open and that the gates are finally closed the last of October.

THE *Christian Advocate* of the 5th ult., referring to mob violence in the South and West, says: "The evils that this bind society together are being outraged at a fearful rate." It is too true; but what can we expect when the churches themselves lead and set the example of mob law by overthrowing the fundamental law of the Nation in compelling Congress by threats of political boycott to enact unconstitutional legislation.

The *Catholic Review* complains of Protestant missionaries, that "in India, China and other parts of Asia, in Central Africa, with the help of British officers, they are exterminating the native Catholics and humbling priests and native rulers." The *Independent* takes this as an evidence that the missionaries are meeting with success in their work. They certainly are; but if the *Review* states the case correctly, it is in unchristian work.

A SIXTY law paper reminds that the decision rendered by Chief Justice Fuller, of the Supreme Court of the United States, has served to encourage and establish the lawless, godless element of this country and their elections, the Sunday Adventists, in opposing the Sabbath. It has done nothing of the sort.

Chief Justice Fuller's decision had nothing to do with either Sunday or the Sabbath. The only question before Judge Fuller was the right of the United States to assume jurisdiction over Fair grounds and usurp the powers both of the State of Illinois and of a corporation created under the laws of that State. So far as the position of that court is concerned, it is in force only in this, that from the fact counselors who opposed any governmental interference in the matter, in behalf of the American exposition, and legislation upon religious matters is forbidden by the Federal Constitution. *Seventh-day Adventists* report that instrument as it reads.

The Nebraska City *Evangelical* says that Chief Justice Fuller, in his famous decision in respect to Sunday opening of the Columbus Exposition, has produced in us the impression that as to the Sunday it is a sham, because and has no moral binding force. He does not say this about the law, but is evidently implied in what he does say.

The *Evangelist* ought to remember that whatever may be true of ourselves, the ninth commandment is still of binding force. Even religious papers have no right to bear false witness. Chief Justice Fuller's decision was simply to the effect that the United States had no jurisdiction over Jackson Park, in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois. The suit was not

brought to enforce a contract, but was brought on the assumption that the United States had control of the Fair. There is no excuse for lying about this matter.

"The Turkish authorities," remarks the *Mail and Express*, "have protested to protect American missionaries in that country. It is hoped that the State Department officials at Washington will insist on this promise being kept. If any thing happens in this country to the interest of an inferior nation, the effect will be to work immediately, and we are called on for explanations or reparations,—and so far these our countries our own medicines and show to the world our deportation, and censure of missionary work to protect the field fasting men and women who have abandoned the comforts of homes to spend the light of the gospel among the ignorant."

This is a strange instance of religious cast and of treacherous bullying. It is the duty of the Government to protect its citizens everywhere, whatever profession may be, and it is not Christian in spirit, but it is domineering on the part of that government to coerce the customs of their own medicine.—*The Christian at Work*, all, the demand's evil spirit would that man should do unto you, do ye even so to them." But governments are not Christians; they are only civil, and hence properly was foes in persuading themselves and by defending their subjects, but they have no more duty to this respect, towards missionaries than toward any other persons entitled to their protection.

The *Evangel* and *Sabbath Outlook* pertinently remarks that the "growth" of Roman Catholicism in New York City will be known to those who study other works. Neither is it surprising in any respect. Notices in surprising other works the "Church authority" forms a great part of the standard of Protestant faith. The end is not yet and Protestants must open their eyes to face the situation and admit the denial which always accompanies false principles, whether induced by individuals or nations.

"Numerous instances of conversion from Romanism" pastors to the Sabbath and of others, "says the *Independent*," has aroused the Rev. Harrison, S. J., where the pastor of the Knox Presbyterian minister says that church to Father Kellner for the use of his newly organized congregation, that they would arrange for their own building. . . . What relation of practical utility to this is to be seen will be in the facts."
