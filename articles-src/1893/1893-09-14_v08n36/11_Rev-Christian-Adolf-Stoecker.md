REV. CHRISTIAN ADOLF STOECKER, a chaplain of the Court of Berlin, arrived in New York a few days since. He said in substance, it is stated he has no intends to deliver a series of lectures only and to preach and that the ex-chaplain is but here for his health. But a Berlin sympathizer on "The East Side" the recently informed us that his influence would only transfer to the United States and make Adventists instead of Jews the objects of his wrath, in which crusade he expects from certain Lutherans some sympathy with his American Adventist Sabbath Union and to follow. It would require no change of principle.
