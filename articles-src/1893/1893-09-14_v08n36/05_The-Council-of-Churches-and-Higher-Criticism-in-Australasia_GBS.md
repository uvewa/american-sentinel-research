TWO AGENCIES FOR THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PAPACY.

In the colonies, as in England, Sunday laws already exist; and exist as relics of the Papacy, brought from England by the early settlers, but inoperative, as such laws usually are, in a new country. What is demanded here is not Sunday laws, but agencies to arouse public sentiment to enforce existing laws. And these agencies, we believe, are already at work, and though at present, working independently, and with no apparent connection, or union of purpose, yet we believe, are both designed by Satan to play into each other's hands in the re-establishment of papal institutions.

In the Colony of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital city, a council of all the Protestant churches has been organized. In this council each church is to be represented in proportion to its numbers; and its intentional practical working is stated, as follows, by one of its most confident friends and advocates:—

> The work the Council has taken in hand is to review the various political measures as they are brought forward, and judge them by a moral standard. If they decide that any proposed measure is morally right, the churches will support it. If they decide that it is wrong, then the churches will oppose it with all their united strength.

Doubtless it will not be difficult for those who are studying the religio-political movements in the United States, to see that we have in this council all the phases of Church and State workings, seen in the so-called National Amendment Party movement in the States. The churches uniting to form a "representative body" to wield political influence, and institute a religious boycott upon any men or measures they think "morally wrong."

The advocate of the movement further adds, "That the council of churches will exercise a beneficial influence in politics cannot be doubted," and also, "It is difficult to foresee the enormous influence for good that this council will exercise both on the Church and on the world."

Of course, we think it is not so difficult to foresee the enormous influence for evil this council will exercise, both upon the Church and the world, when viewed in the light of past history. That this is a movement, adopting papal policy, some of its advocates see, and do not hesitate to present the Papacy as an example of the practical and successful working of their plans. In recommending the organization of a similar council in New Zealand, the writer above quoted, says: "The Church of Rome always has taken a part in the political questions of the day, and has rendered the world much good service in this direction. Which of the Protestant churches in this city will take the lead?" The lead back to Romanism, he might have added, for that is certainly the road these councils are taking.

While the council of churches is being organized in Australia, and recommended to New Zealand, New Zealand is receiving and publishing the deductions of higher criticism, and higher criticism through undermining faith in the Bible, and exalting human reason and the opinions of men is opening the way for multiplying, manifoldly, the already existing disagreements in regard to the teaching of the Word; but higher criticism sees this difficulty and proposes a remedy, and that in the "collective consciousness of the church" and the church council. The following are a few of the extracts upon this subject from the leading conference address, delivered by C. H. Garland, by the request of the president and committee of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference, held at Dunedin, New Zealand, in March, 1893:—

Of the Books of Moses, Mr. Garland says, beyond a doubt we can no longer attribute the original composition of the story of the creation and the antediluvian history to Moses. The traditional idea that God revealed these facts to Moses, who, under the Divine inspiration, penned them for the first time, and penned them without error, must be abandoned.

This is the first deduction, and of its correctness, the speaker further says:—

> It would be quite impossible, in a public address of this kind, to study the premises from which this conclusion is drawn. . . . All I can do here is to produce the names and conclusions of trustworthy men, or of men that we Methodists are prepared to trust.

Then follows a long list of quotations from ministerial sceptics, ventilating their doubts for others to feed upon. Thus the Bible testimony is rejected and the words of men "trusted" instead.

But another deduction includes the whole Bible:—

> But higher criticism has not stopped at the consideration of dates and authorship and modes of construction; it has looked with keen eye on certain statements and difficulties, and not suffering us to gloss them over, has openly and loudly condemned them, or rather, has adduced them in condemnation of our traditional Bible theories; for it pronounces them errors, misstatements, inaccuracies, defects; and concludes that the Bible is not an infallible book.

That these conclusions have not been reached suddenly by the Methodists, the speaker proceeded to show, by presenting evidence that they had "at least two years ago abandoned the position of the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures." May we not thank God that at the very time many are laying down the banner of truth, long carried upon this subject; that he grants us the privilege of picking it up and carrying it to final victory? That belief in the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures constitute then the final authority in matters of faith, the higher critics see, but this position they willingly and knowingly abandon, as another extract from this conference address will show:—

> The belief in verbal inspiration necessarily constitute the Scriptures the seat of authority—the final tribunal to which all must bow; but, as we do not hold to the belief in verbal inspiration, . . . it seems inevitable that we must no longer teach that the Bible is the word of God, but that the Bible contains the word of God.

But if ministers teach that the Bible only contains the word of God, who is to determine what portion is that word? Why, every man for himself, of course. And do they teach this? Yes, and also that much trust and confidence is to be placed in the living speaker, the minister. Again, we quote from the address:—

> Let it then be remembered that the believer's safety is assured not by the infallibility of the record, but the infallibility of the Spirit. We use the Book, but we trust the living speaker.

And so does the Romanist, and this is the Papacy. But further:—

> When Paul wrote to the Romans, and touched upon the doubtful disputations concerning the eating of herbs and the observance of particular days, he directed them to no external authority, but said, "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind," and pointed them to the only authority a man could recognize in the matter, viz., himself.

Here, then, we have the standard plainly stated—SELF. Higher criticism thus begins with tearing down faith in the Bible, and ends with exalting man above the Bible as its judge. But he who first sits as judge will never afterwards take the place of a true believer before the declaration of what he may call the word of God, which but for his decision must have remained doubtful or uninspired; and should he profess faith in the divinity of the passage, it is not in the word that he has faith, but in himself, who, by the power delegated to him by latter day teachers, has canonized the passage as the priests canonize the saints.

But as the Bible is rejected as the final tribunal to which appeal is to be made, what is to be that tribunal? certainly not the individual, layman, or preacher? No. This tribunal to which final appeal is to be made is to be the church council, and so it is suggested in the closing words of this conference document:—

> But when the external authority of the Bible, as it now is, is removed, what check have we upon the vagaries of an ill-informed and self-ophisticated mind? None. Neither have we had any with our supposed external authority. Absurd interpretations abound.

Yes, but absurd interpretations are quite innocent things as compared with the tearing down of the authority of the word by which the interpretation may always be tested, and leaving us with interpretation only. But we are not to be left with individual interpretation.

> Neither must the collective consciousness of the church be ignored as a providential means of formulating revealed truth. For the apostles, with minds illuminated by the Spirit, advanced in their apprehension of developing truth by taking council together at Jerusalem.

But we do not read of the disciples ever raising the question of the inspiration of a single portion of the Scriptures. They were sent to preach it and did so.

But the church council, this is the remedy, and this is the very Papacy itself, and this higher criticism by breaking down confidence in the word of God, and exalting confidence in the "collective conscience," is paving the way fast for the re-establishment of the Papacy. Then comes the general council, and then the teaching of that council as to what constitutes the word of God and the teaching of that word, and then follows for unity's sake only, as it was in the days of Rome, the branding as heretics of all who dissent, and "abide the literal text," and finally, the persecution of all who persistently protest. And thus, we believe, history will repeat itself here.
