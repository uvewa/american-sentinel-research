Rev. Christian Adolf Stuecker, ex-chaplain of the Court of Berlin, arrived in New York from Europe on Friday last. It is stated that he intends to deliver a series of lectures on Christian socialism, and also on anti-Semitism. It is as a Jew-baiter that the ex-chaplain is best known in his native land. He will find sympathizers on "the East Side," the "tough quarter" of this city. If the doctor would only transfer the scene of his operations to Maryland or Tennessee, and make Adventists instead of Jews the objects of his wrath, he would doubtless be warmly welcomed by the American Sabbath Union and its allies. It would require no change of principle.
