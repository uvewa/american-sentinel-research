THE series of religious congresses, which have been formally and authoritatively opened by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, in a most striking and noteworthy manner, with a leading morning paper characterizing its inauguration as "The most important gathering of church dignitaries ever held in America." There was a vast ecclesiastical assembly, and a long list of archbishops, and a great prelacy, together with laity of the highest distinction. A correspondent says it was an august and impressive spectacle, bearing witness to the growth, influence and power, of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States.

J. O. Orsahan, secretary of the committee on organization, introduced Bishop Foley who first addressed the members of the congress, and presented C. E. Bonney, President of the World's Congress Auxiliary. In the course of his address he gave utterance to the following suggestive thoughts. The following paragraph presents a germ, the full development, the fruit of which all will realize:—

Not a great event in the history of the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches of this country has been so immediately beneficial as the exposition in Chicago, both to the church and the world. It has proved a stimulus and has in many ways promoted the cause of religion; . . . This attitude of the American people toward matters of religion can never change; it may, however, suffer change, if the churches change; sooner, especially appropriate when confidence can be said to be upon grounds already drawing nearer and nearer to mutual understanding.

One paragraph of Mr. Bonney's address in reference to colonization may bear almost any interpretation which he might think it politic to put upon it, but if the American political of popular education in this accord with the Roman Catholic idea as

practically realized, whatever, that his, rarely has had the opportunity, Mr. Bonney means to say the same thing. Here is what he said:—

"Knowledge only; not knowledge and mental discipline only; but knowledge, and mental discipline, and morality and knowledge being regarded as the corner-stone of good citizenship and of national power, to all alike."

"Knowledge only; not knowledge and mental discipline only, but knowledge, and the moral trusts of the powers of human progress, to all alike."

The welcoming address concludes with sentiments expressed by Pope Leo similar in lively applause:—

Has a great storm of noise and progress still continued to ascend—the illustrious bells of the churches, the various schools and universities of education. Was it for love of country? This is the name of holly father in a thousand years. After many years I have come abroad to see my country—I should say your country; but I love those and I love their country. I have a great desire to show it.

That liberty of which our constitution speaks is a perfect liberty, and is a growing power. "Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." Those Americans for their frank, open, confident, fearless spirits. Americans go ahead—as we say in French, *en avant*, do good. What is there to fear? Something to do but a little prayer will give for ever the good of the whole nation. Give us liberty, and give us the noble work, and I shall try to give you the word of encouragement that other countries want that Pope Leo XIII, is respected and honored throughout the world. . . .

On the Protestant side similar causes have been acting to produce similar results, and a movement toward union, notably the Evangelical Alliance, appears to have begun.

The Congress of the last year created what is called the "Parliament of Religions"—a great event and an indication of marked human progress toward the fulfillment of our divine Lord's prediction, "That they may be one"—a practical event which by its very nature and scope passes and all forms of faith and worship one in character.

Cardinal Gibbons added:—

I am happy to welcome you to the Catholic Congress, in the name of the hierarchy of the United States. This is a grand day for the American church. The programme of your congress of this afternoon is a splendid one.

O'Brien of Wis. is describing the Christian platform upon which churchmen and all should stand. . . .

And against exclusion the implications of this address included a reply upon the same lines as before from the congress itself. Of political addresses to the congress we report upon one that particularly stands out in greater spirit and which most be fully reported:—

I do not wish to occupy a single moment, for I see that you are engaged in greater works. I speak to you as American citizens. Let me say, that our Church recognizes and respects and aids virtuous citizens and religion, but there are also those we will not recognize; any man who is vicious, or an enemy or opposed to the institutions we all share as citizens designed to support this country. Our mission is to support this country, our Church is at one with our citizenship. This address attracted very considerable attention and widespread commentary by this congress, and it is in this connection that we present it before our readers.

No doubt the so-called orthodox or regular denomination would accept every word of this and would naturally be glad to join a Roman Catholic and all. There would be those who would accept the idea following would accept every word of this article, and, with their hands upon their mouths, join in a Roman Catholic congress.
