The *Soldier*, a National Reform paper published at Nashville, published the following report by a Texas grand jury:—

*District of Fannin County, Texas.*

Sirs:—To you, the undersigned [names] would respectfully report that we have made full and diligent inquiry into all violations of the criminal law of said county, and found indictment in all cases of indictment, a heavy portion of them being violations of the Sabbath law. Violations of the Sabbath seems to be growing to an alarming extent in this county, and we urge its enforcement. The grand jury would call special attention to this ruinful effect on the part of all low abiding citizens and ask that the general public assist them, as all the larger crimes are a result of disregard of the Sabbath.

It is urged that Sunday laws are only civil, and that they are not designed to enforce Sabbath observance, but this is

squarely by this report. The law of Texas uses the word "Sabbath" only refers to what we shall consider what the jury evidently understand its intent, as the report calls only it, "the Sabbath law." It is not the law which is thereby violated. It is the "Sabbath" which is desecrated; and into what great many business men try to disregard the Sabbath. What better proof could be asked than this is required that this law is regarded as religious and is used to compel men to holiness in the observance of the Sabbath?

In attempting it to be their duty under this law to compel every man under it to keep the Sabbath, as we would say, what is "Sabbath," the grand jury is doing the same thing what the Sunday laws do with the law. The statute under which the grand jury acts, expressly forbids the use the term "Sabbath" only once, and that in title, it is in the title only, not in the body, but in the spirit of law. Reading it, but it more the less the clear principle that it is the purpose of the law itself; or at least these people, to stop all forms of labor and business on Sunday the law clearly seems, can not clearly be used it, and others, "Nor to any person who conscientiously observes the Sabbath, or any other day of the week ought to be relieved from this law which ought to be relieved from business and labor" is the day for religious reasons. This fully demonstrates the character of the law, in the interpretation which they put upon it, is that it is compulsory religious observance, and that people for religious reasons to observe the day in this fashion opportunity to choose the day upon which they shall so observe.

THE HOME RULE bill provides that the powers of the Irish legislature shall not extend to make any law "either directly or indirectly to establish or endow any religion, or prohibit the free exercise thereof, or imposing any disability, or conferring any privilege on account of religious belief, or abrogating or prejudicially affecting the right to establish or maintain any place of denomination of religious worship or any denomination of religious institution, or abrogating the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious instruction at the school;" or "whereby any person may be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or may be denied the equal protection of the laws, or whereby private property may be taken without just compensation." The adoption of such an act by the British Parliament would be a grand thing, but notice that it is not to apply in this case only to Roman Catholic.
