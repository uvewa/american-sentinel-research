The Soldier, a National Reform paper published in South Carolina, publishes the following report by a Texas grand jury:—

> To Hon. S. P. Green, Judge of the Forty-eighth District of Tarrant County, Texas.
>
> Dear Sir: We, the undersigned grand jury, would respectfully report that we have made diligent inquiry into all crimes and misdemeanors that have come to our knowledge: that we have found 333 bills of indictment, a large portion of them being for violations of the Sabbath law. The disposition of a great many business men to disregard the Sabbath seems to be growing to an alarming extent. While this does not apply to all lines of business, yet it does exist, and unless there is a united effort on the part of all law-abiding citizens to enforce the law, no one can foretell the result, as all the larger crimes are a result of disregard for law in minor offenses.

It is urged that Sunday laws are only civil, and that they are not designed to enforce Sabbath observance, but this is negatived by this report. The law of Texas uses the word "Sabbath" only once, to which we shall recur later; but the jury evidently understand its intent, as the report deals only with "the Sabbath law." It is not the law which is disregarded, but "the disposition of a great many business men to disregard the Sabbath seems to be growing." And the jury seem to have regarded it as their duty to compel these business men to regard "the Sabbath."

In esteeming it to be their duty under the law to compel men to regard "the Sabbath," the grand jury of Tarrant County, Texas, were in perfect accord with the law. The statute under which they were acting, as before remarked, uses the term "Sabbath" only once, and that not to forbid labor or business upon it, but it none the less does show plainly that it is the purpose of the law to compel men to regard the "Sabbath," or the day which is popularly supposed to be the Sabbath; for after forbidding common labor and business on Sunday the law makes certain exemptions, and among others, this: "Nor do any person who conscientiously believes that the seventh or any other day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath, and who actually refrains from business and labor on that day for religious reasons." This fully justifies the Tarrant County grand jury in the interpretation which they put upon the law: its intent is to compel Sabbath observance, and that for religious reasons. It simply gives the people of Texas opportunity to choose the day upon which they will practice such observance.

The Home Rule bill provides that "the powers of the Irish legislature shall not extend to the making of any law respecting the establishment or endowment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or imposing any disability, or conferring any privilege on account of religious belief, or abrogating or prejudicially affecting the right to establish or maintain any place of denominational education or any denominational institution or charity, or prejudicially affecting the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious instruction at the school; or whereby any person will be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or may be denied the equal protection of the laws, or whereby private property may be taken without just compensation." A similar prohibition on the British Parliament would be a good thing; or are such things supposed to be wrong only in Roman Catholics?
