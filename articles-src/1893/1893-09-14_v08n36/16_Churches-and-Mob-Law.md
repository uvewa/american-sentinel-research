THE Christian Advocate of the 24th ult., referring to mob violence in the South and West, says: "The cords that bind society together are being snapped at a fearful rate." It is too true; but what can we expect when the churches of the land set the example of mob law by overriding the fundamental law of the Nation in compelling Congress by threats of political boycott to enact unconstitutional laws?
