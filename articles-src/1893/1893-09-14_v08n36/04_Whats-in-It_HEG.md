The trite interrogative, "What's in a name?" implies unimportance. While just now the question, "What's in a Sunday law?" should arouse the greatest apprehension in the minds of the good people of this once free land, especially when there are so many illustrations of their practical application in this boasted land of religious liberty.

The readers of the SENTINEL have been favored for years with lucid explanations of the principles involved in the enactment of these laws, and the dire results sure to attend their execution. If men could see a principle they might avoid a catastrophe in many instances; but if not, all the consequences may be, yea, must be realized.

Here in Missouri, we have the ordinary species of Sunday law with a very liberal exemption clause for those who belong to a society holding another day as the Sabbath, "so that he observe such Sabbath."

The following from the St. Louis Republic is significant:—

> CHILLICOTHE, MO., June 27.—A female acronant and two male assistants can't here last Sunday and gave a parachute jump at the Fair grounds. They were arrested for a violation of the Sunday law and the men were to-day commuted and fined in a justice court, the fine and costs aggregating twenty-five dollars.
>
> They set up for defense that they were Seventh-day Adventists, but on cross-examination on the doctrines and tenets of that denomination they showed themselves so ignorant that their defense failed. The case against the woman failed.

Now we can consider the living issue, "What's in a Sunday law?" There are two ways to find the answer to this important question. 1. The thinking man reasons out the logic of the premise assumed by the law-making power in enacting a Sunday law. 2. The conservative passes along hoping for the best until he learns the answer by realizing active results. Those who have been loath to accept the logic will not have much longer to wait to have the answer given in unmistakable form.

There are two important points illustrated in the balloon incident. One is the deception and impropriety of exemption clauses, The other shows that the courts must be ecclesiastical boards of examination where religious laws are in force. Both forcibly impress the fact that a union of the interests of the Church and State must always and everywhere work evil and only evil.

The exemption clause works an injustice upon those whom it presumes to favor by furnishing a covert for persons who have no regard for truth. They impose their ill reputation upon the exempted class for the purpose of gaining an advantage over those who are too manly to make a false claim even to evade an unjust law. In this way those who are exempted suffer the influx of sinister characters and evil, designing men. Exemption clauses do not protect as has been supposed and are, therefore, deceptive. Such exemptions also require more of the persons exempted, than of any one else, under them. Those enjoying the full force of the law are only required to abstain from certain labor, while those exempted are required to observe the day as a Sabbath or, as in some cases to "conscientiously observe another day."

Again, exemption from a general law is but toleration, and tacitly denies natural right. Here is evidence establishing the second count, that the courts must be ecclesiastical boards of examination where religious laws are in force. In this case the tenets and doctrines of a religious order is made the test of criminality, and a certain act is criminal for one class and not for another. This the courts must decide. If the act was evil in itself it would be just as criminal for an Adventist as for a Methodist or Catholic.

In the face of such facts how long will people continue to assert that these are not religious laws, and that the peace and safety of our dearest institutions are not endangered by them? Just laws apply alike to all and an exemption is a confession of injustice in the law. To carry on legal religion the courts must be better informed in doctrine and theology than the minister for to present even a semblance of comparative justice they must be familiar with all beliefs.

It seems that any one might see that with the introduction of a Sunday law the cherished doctrine of equality before the law is forever swept away, and with it the fundamental truth "that all men are created equal" and "governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed." This involves the civil and religious rights of the people. "What's in a Sunday law?" What's left, after it takes what it claims, of all our boasted nationality? Nothing but the memory of a cherished land of liberty.
