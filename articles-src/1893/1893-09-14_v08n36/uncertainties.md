# Uncertainties — v08n36, September 14, 1893

## Article 01 (ATJ lead article)

- **Page 1, paragraph near bottom:** The OCR reads "prior to his salt westward" — this appears to be an OCR error for "sail westward." Transcribed as "sail westward."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — context makes the correct reading certain.

## Article 02 (WHM, Chicago Correspondence)

- No uncertainties noted.

## Article 03 (WHM, Roman Catholic Congress)

- **Page 3, Pope Leo XIII. quote:** The OCR reads "I want the Protestants as well as the Catholics to subsum me." This appears to be an OCR error for "sub-sum me" or possibly a garbled rendering. The sentence is unusual; it may be "subsume me" or another word. Transcribed as the OCR reads ("subsum me") since the original word cannot be determined from context alone.
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR artifact; original word unclear.

## Article 04 (H. E. Giddings)

- **Page 3, St. Louis Republic quotation:** The OCR reads "A female acronant" — this is almost certainly an OCR error for "aeronaut." However, as the original newspaper text is quoted directly, and the error may be in the OCR of either the Republic text or the Sentinel reprint, the word was transcribed as the OCR reads in the original ("acronant"). Note: this may have been "aeronaut" in the original.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — context strongly suggests "aeronaut" but direct OCR artifact preserved.

- **Page 3:** OCR reads "those who are too munly to make a false claim" — likely "manly." Transcribed as "manly."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — context is clear.

## Article 05 (G. B. Starr)

- **Page 4:** The OCR reads "Ab-urd interpretations abound" — this is an OCR line-break artifact for "Absurd." Transcribed as "Absurd."
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

## Article 10 (Editorial, "The Jury Understands It")

- **Page 6, note about Rev. Stuecker:** This item appears on page 6 between the grand jury article and the page break. It was filed as article 23 rather than part of the grand jury article.

## General Notes

- Page 8 OCR (masthead area) reads "NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 14, 1890" — this is an OCR error for 1893 (consistent with all other date evidence in the issue). Not transcribed as article content.
- **Author H. E. Giddings** (article 04) is not in the known authors list. The full name "H. E. GIDDINGS" appears at the end of the article. Added as new author: HEG=H. E. Giddings.
- **Author G. B. Starr** (article 05): The OCR reads "G. B. STARR" which has been used. Previously tentatively listed as "G. B. Stane(?)" in project memory — this issue confirms "STARR" as the correct spelling. GBS=G. B. Starr.
- **Associate editor listed as "CALVIN P. HOLLMAN"** in OCR masthead (page 1) — this is likely an OCR error for "BOLLMAN" (C. P. Bollman). Transcribed the masthead as OCR reads but flagged here.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "HOLLMAN" vs "BOLLMAN" is a known OCR confusion; all other evidence points to C. P. Bollman.
- Page 7 advertisements (Apples of Gold Library, Medical Missionary, Waterman's Fountain Pen, West Shore Railroad, Ten Lectures on Nasal Catarrh, Battle Creek Sanitarium foods) were skipped as commercial/subscription content.
