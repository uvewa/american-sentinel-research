# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, September 14, 1893 (v08n36)

## General Note

This issue presented exceptional difficulty for OCR transcription. The 300 DPI B&W scans have significant quality issues throughout, with small, dense text in narrow columns that is frequently unclear. Many passages throughout all articles contain text that could not be read with high confidence.

## Article 01 - The Principles of Rome vs. the Principles of the Government (Pages 1-3, 5)

This is a very long editorial spanning approximately 4 pages of dense text. The scan quality makes many individual words and phrases difficult to read with certainty.

- **Pages 1-2, throughout**: The dense column text is frequently blurry, making individual words uncertain. Many sentences may contain minor reading errors.
- **Page 1, Column 2**: The citation "Sects and the Encyclical Fidelism in Relation by Christianity, Ct. III., Art. XV." - the exact title of this reference is uncertain due to small text.
- **Page 2, Column 1-3**: Multiple passages about Congressional appropriations to Catholic and Protestant churches for Indian missions contain specific dollar amounts that are difficult to read precisely. The figures transcribed ($118,343.61, $109,316, $194,635, $140,079, etc.) are best readings but some digits may be incorrect.
- **Page 2, bottom**: Several passages about the Protestant-Catholic financial competition are garbled in the original scan.
- **Page 3, top-left**: Continuation text about the Christian Sabbath, verbal inspiration, and Bible interpretation. This section connects page 2 to page 5 left column. Many passages are unclear.
- **Page 5, left column**: Continuation of the editorial. Text about Paul, Romans, verbal inspiration, and the Bible. Much of this text is difficult to read accurately.
- **Confidence: LOW** for many specific passages throughout this very long article.

## Article 02 - Chicago Correspondence (Page 3)

- **Page 3, middle-left**: The account of Judge Stein, Judge Goggin, and the Sunday closing controversy contains several passages where the exact wording is uncertain.

## Article 05 - The Council of Churches and Higher Criticism in Australasia (Pages 4-5)

## Overall Assessment

This issue of the American Sentinel was particularly challenging to transcribe due to the poor quality of the B&W scans at 300 DPI. The very long main editorial (Article 01) spanning multiple pages was especially difficult. Many passages throughout the issue should be verified against the original document if possible. The transcription represents best-effort readings throughout, but readers should be aware that individual words and phrases may contain errors, particularly in Articles 01, 05, and 06.
