It is a little surprising to read that "Mgr. Satolli's recent visit to Cincinnati was not made without danger of attack at the hands of sectarian cranks." He was constantly attended by a body guard. But where one "sectarian crank" may have been ready to attack him, ten thousand milk-and-water Protestants(?) were ready to fawn upon him.
