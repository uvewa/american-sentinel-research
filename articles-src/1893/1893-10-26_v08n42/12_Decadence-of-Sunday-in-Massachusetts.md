Nothing could better show how the former regard for Sunday has departed, than the following extract from correspondence of Dr. A. P. Foster, in the *Advance* for March 30, 1893:—

> He declared that Massachusetts, once first in morale, is now the last in New England in respect to Sabbath law and Sabbath practice. The license laws of the State, he affirmed, permit the licensing of Sabbath breaking. It seems that according to law in Massachusetts, steam, gas and electricity may be manufactured on the Sabbath for light, heat and power; the telegraph and telephone may be used; horses, yachts and boats may be let; newspapers may be manufactured, transported and sold; butter and cheese may be made; public bathhouses may be kept open; food in bakeries may be made and sold before 10 a. m., and between 4 and 6 50 p. m.; steambeats and railroad trains may be run "as the public necessity and convenience may require, having regard to the due observance of the day." This list is exceedingly suggestive as to the modern ideas in regard to what work is necessary on the Sabbath day. Undoubtedly the same things are done in other States, but it would seem without permission of law.

The deep significance of the general statement concerning Sunday lawlessness in Massachusetts, cannot be overestimated. Massachusetts, originally, had the most rigid civil laws concerning Sunday. The earlier laws and practices covered the time from "Sunset on Saturday to sunset on Sunday." During this time all business and recreation were forbidden, with a strictness more than "Mosaic." If Sunday laws are of supreme value in preventing disregard for the day, how has it come to pass that this legislation which was once supported by such public conscience as insured its enforcement, has not only fallen into disuse, but has been actually repealed? Do men expect to begin with this ruin and accomplish reformation through a system of laws which have not only failed to check the downward drift, but have been actually swept away? Can the fragments of the overthrown system be drawn from their place in the mud of the overflowing deluge, and made into barriers which will turn back the tide, and restore the drowned conscience of the State? No one can expect such a result.

The evil lies far deeper than decaying civil law. The Puritan Sunday was built upon a compromise with God's law and the Bible. It assumed a falsehood, namely, that the Sabbath could be ignored and disregarded in the name of Christianity, could be stigmatized as "Jewish" and "obsolete," and that the Sunday, by the fiction of transferred law, could be built on that compromise. The inherent weakness of that error insured present results. When God and his law were eliminated from the question there was no ground left for religious conscience. The "Civil Sabbath" took the place of the divine. It was "New England's day," against "God's day." The only result that could come has come. Massachusetts is practically Sabbathless. Her mistaken Christian citizens sowed to the wind, and have reaped the whirlwind. They took the sword of "Civil Sabbathism" and now lie slain with that sword thrust through the heart of the dead Sunday.

Come back to God; there is no help in Egypt.
