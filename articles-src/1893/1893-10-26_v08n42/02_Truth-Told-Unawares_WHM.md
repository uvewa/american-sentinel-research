The *Independent* lately published a symposium on the subject—"Is the World Growing Better?" In expressing his views upon this, Mr. Moody said:—

> There is every indication that the present dispensation will end in a great smash-up; but I believe that out of that smash-up the most glorious age in the world's history will come.

Without the evidence of any adequate perception of the significance of the language he was using, C. C. Bonney, President of the World's Congress Auxiliary, said, in his address at the closing of the Parliament of Religions:—

> "This congress of the world's religions is the most marvelous evidence yet given of the approaching fulfillment of the apocalyptic prophecy. 'Beloch! I make all things new.'"

When men, brought prominently before the world, give voice to such expressions as these, it is not impossible that their words may sometimes contain a deeper meaning and significance than they themselves are aware. As Paul said to the men of Athens: "Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you;" so, not infrequently, is it possible, with justice, to say to men, "The truth which you ignorantly speak, that truth the Bible declares unto you." And so it is here, whether unaware of the full meaning of what they have said, or, with a vague foreshadowing of the truth in their minds; or, whether it be in searching for an effective phrase and thought with which to dramatically bring to an end the great religious conclave, this thought and these words appealed to Mr. Bonney, as being the most rhetorically striking that he could use, yet they, no less than Mr. Moody's plain and earnest language, embody facts which are, and are to be, the fulfillment of the sure word of prophecy. In these paragraphs there are heralded to the world through the public prints, not the words, or thoughts, or opinions of Mr. Moody or Mr. Bonney, but the truth for this hour and day, a repetition of the warning and the promise which Christ gave to his disciples, for their benefit, and for ours upon whom the last days of which he spoke have come; and a repetition of the vision of the new heaven and the new earth where there should be no more death, nor sorrow, nor pain, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, which God vouchsafed to the seer of Patmos, as a revelation to us.

With what effective simplicity John has emphasized to us these prophetic words, "And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful."

This is the gospel, the message, the living word of warning and of promise for this day and this hour. Do Mr. Moody, and Mr. Bonney, know this? and if they do, will they let the whole world know that they do?
