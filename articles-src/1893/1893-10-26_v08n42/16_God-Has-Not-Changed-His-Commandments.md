OF God it was written commandments mean Sunday, but God has not said. His meaning and purpose remain the same. "The seventh day is the Sabbath," on Commanding and National Reformers to the contrary notwithstanding.

THE *Cleveland Leader,* one of the very foremost papers of the country say does not feel good of its purpose, published recently the following:

A pupil in St. Joseph's Academy, Marquette, Mich., Shaw a book entitled—"History of Liberty, from the earliest times" and the line of which to be the Pope and King John signing the Magna Charta, was asked to write a summary relating thereto. The following is a portion of his synopsis:—

"King John was a very bad king, and was addicted to the practices of the monastery, by Father Benedictino. He was also a very illiterate ruler. I insist that no such outrageous work shall be brought to our school, and the children forced to learn therefrom a false and distorted view of history. It was never intended for grownup people who were admitted, and not in this sense. It was a book of adult instruction; and must be no further used, in our classes," but in truth, since from their history they do live, it was their daily text book.

The pastor says the day to day with it is like the day with the other text books. When asked "Is it really," his answer "I hope so."

Rome is becoming more and more aggressive, and will, if not well withstood, dictate terms or annex municipality in the public schools.
