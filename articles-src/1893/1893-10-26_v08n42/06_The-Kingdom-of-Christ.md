WHEN Christ made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, it was amid the acclamations and hosannas of the multitudes who thronged about him; who, contrary to what as the best teaching in his assumption of temporal power. Christ might have appeared to those who hailed him with shouts of joy and said, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord." They expected his appointment on account of their unbelief that his kingdom was not of this world, they cast their garments and branches of palm trees in the way before him, as an expression of their delight at the ushering in of the new sovereignty and the creation of the new ruler; and this, notwithstanding the fact that Christ, but a short time before, had foretold his own betrayal and death. Unbelief caused the fatal mistake which led to the crucifixion of Him who had come to be their Saviour, and not their temporal king. And so much this mistake of his most intimate followers, and the knowledge of the evidence of their attitude toward him, must have increased the agony of the hour when he made his entrance to the city as he beheld on a moment on the height overlooking Jerusalem, and wept over it; what a wave of sorrow must have swept over his godly, must have filled his soul as he saw the ominous prophecy of its destruction about soon to be sealed by his own blood,—sorrow for the beloved city, and contempt taking a course that would result in their eternal ruin.

This event was placed on record for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come. What is the lesson to be learned? Is there anything happening around us now just before Christ's second advent, similar to those experiences in his first advent? There are many persons who are now looking upon him as temporal ruler, as the "King of kings" to will cause the people into the midst of whose chief organ is the Christian Cynosure, urging upon, showing them to be professing Christ, God? their insult in calling upon the "The King of kings will be enabled in our land to be ruled by his word." The very name of this organ is "Statesmen;" and as those who labor to make Christ the King of this world, who in spite of his own declaration that his kingdom was not of this world, are just exactly as his followers in old Jerusalem attempted to do. And this new as we see what of it? Is not this work now will fail just as empty and just as fatally as the efforts of those who attempted it back there. Those back there proclaimed Christ temporal king right in the face of his statement that his kingdom was not of this world; and so do these. These ignore that doctrine just as the very scriptures (Matt. 21: 5; Luke 19: 38; Zech. 9: 9) which they had their eyes before (Luke 13: 33) in reference to his death, were fulfilled in Jerusalem, not a Christian in the name of the Lord." And as those who are now proclaiming him King of nations quite in support a scripture, which plainly refers to the kingdom of heaven (see Christian Statesmen, of Aug. 6): "The kingdom of the world is to become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ," the kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ."

—Because they did not believe the Scripture which said that he would be "despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and there went right on and despised and rejected him because he did not come in the way they had laid out for him to come. But to more bitter was their disappointment when he did not assume temporal power and kingship and set them before the kings of the world, instead of remaining the meek and lowly Jesus that he was, who had not where to lay his head. And if, in the course of time, this will be that of those who are now insisting upon crowning him "King of nations," instead of receiving and their personal Saviour first.

Another thing further identifying the work of those now trying to exalt Christ to the kingship of the nations, is the lawlessness with which they were acted, king accepted. While in Christ's time they urged "Hosanna to the son of David, Hosanna in the highest;" the two Gospels are, saying, "Hallelujah! the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!" Cf. Rev. 19: 6; Matt. 21: 9; July 22. And just as the end of that "triumphal entry" was a bitter disappointment, so this joy down here will be so "bitter" too.

Jesus rejected the One who was the Christ, because he did not come as they wanted, not the pomp and grandeur they supposed he would; and of all mankind friends of him as their temporal ruler, as they were expecting. But after they rejected him bore to them in the same humility, and was meek and lowly, they called him Christ. Here is where it will be noticed that the insane devotion of his followers of Christ now not only failed to make Christ their king, but it brought them to call his Christ. And they will have such leaders and at that time are in his true Christ, that if they do not diligently search the Scriptures, and take heed to the lessons in those last days, they will be grimly deceived. If Christ himself is a king in his time, the world, as he himself expressed before, there is but one other and the power, and the kingdom, and the glory, is Satan's; for there two powers are the commanding forces of the world; and the day will be when Satan is mistaken for Christ, because his appearance is so much like Christ. various vantage ground, and to say, he already is getting it got to itself.

But what was the result, politically of the efforts of the followers and the friends of Christ in regard to Jerusalem, and the Jewish State, both? Their utter ruin. Their glory and power as a nation were completely destroyed. Will history upon the same course is pursued, only the end will be on more signal failure, and in its end the destruction has attained greater glory and power than the Jews ever reached.—*Sabbath Herald.*
