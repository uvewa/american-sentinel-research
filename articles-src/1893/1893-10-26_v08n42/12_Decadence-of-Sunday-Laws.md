NOTHING could better show how the former regard for Sunday has departed, than the following extract, being certain predictions of Mr. A. H. Foster, in the *Christian Mirror:*—

He declared that Massachusetts, now first in its public Sabbath-breaking, was once first in its Sunday-keeping. While first in this country to close of the time, he suffered, permit the licensing of the sale of liquor on that day. In Massachusetts all kinds of food, newspapers, ice, and tobacco may be manufactured on the Sabbath for light, except candles, have been exempted. Sunday newspapers may be manufactured, transported and delivered on Sunday. The operation of Sunday trains and boats and telephone, and railroad shops, books and bell boys; it, to barbers we to their, have it, is indulgence to them that to our fathers "as the public necessity and convenience may require." The very language of the former when it admits these its regard to what work is none, the present result being the substitution of this most precious of laws.

Most pernicious of the general statement concerning Sunday lawlessness and Massachusetts of historical movement. Massachusetts, originally, had the most stringent Sunday laws in the land and her earlier laws and practices covered the time of the day named as the "Sabbath" and "Lord's Day." During this time all business or avocations were forbidden with an impartiality which declared that Sunday laws are of supreme value in preventing Sabbath-breaking. There is not the least chance pain that this legislation which was once supported by all public conscience, so far inured in its enforcement, has not been of little value this times, but has been actually repealed? Do men expect to begin with such and accomplish regeneration of law through a system of laws which have not only failed to check the downward drift, but under which Sunday, as we see it, the very fragments of the overthrown system may be employed as a means of building the overthrown dodge, and made into barriers which will turn, turn back the tide, and restore the drowned conscience of the State? No one can expect such a result. The evil lies far deeper than decaying civil law. The Puritan Sunday was built upon a compromise with God's law and the Bible. It assumed a falsehood, namely, that the Sabbath could be ignored and disregard in the name of Christian religion, could be stigmatized as "Jewish" and of "contempt;" and that by applying the fiction of "transferred" law, could be built up on that compromise. The inherent error worked its legitimate result.

When God and his law were brought into contempt by the Puritans, the national conscience was led to the lower ground left for religious conscience. The Puritan Sunday was not a divine institution. It was "New England's day." It was a man-made institution, and that was all that could save has come. Massachusetts' attitude toward this "New England Day" is but the outcome of the times. The Christian citizen awakened to the wind, and law, except the law universal. They took now it stands with that eternal threat of dissolution, against the God who made the world and all therein. Come back to God; there is no help in the arm of flesh!
