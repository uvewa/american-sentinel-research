The *Signs of the Times*, Oakland, Cal., reprints an article written from Nine, or Savage Island, Pacific Ocean, to the *Fiji Times*, by Dr. M. G. Kellogg, medical missionary accompanying the missionary brigantine Pitcairu, in the course of which he presents this very suggestive and instructive information:—

> The island has no well-established government. It is independent, no foreign power having considered it worth looking after. The missionaries have been industrious in their efforts to civilize and Christianize the people, and on the adoption of Christianity by them the missionaries have endeavored to have what they consider Christian laws and customs adopted. As a consequence, none but church members are allowed to hold office, and sin is punished instead of crime.
>
> The same mistake has been made in all the islands that I have visited where the London Missionary Society has been at work. Strict laws are enacted against what the good missionary considers great sins, such as working on Sunday, for instance. Heavy fines are imposed, and zealous church members are set to spy out the transgressor. The judges, or fakefali, as they call them, are also church members, and they impose certain fines. The fine when collected is divided between the judges, the spies (police they call them on some isles), and the native teachers. On Mangia I was informed by a white resident that the white missionary received a portion of the fine, claiming that he was entitled to it for services as general counselor. The system of laws concocted by the missionaries, and the manner of executing them, have not resulted in arousing the individual conscience to a sense of what is right and to the importance of doing right for the sake of the right. Instead of this the natives who are disposed to do wrong have learned to practice deceit to avoid detection, but, if detected, they, by paying the fine, condone the offense and are again in good social standing, with no real reformation of character. On some of the islands the missionaries have not only been "regal" in authority, but, to use the language of an English resident on one of the islands, their reign has been as autocratic as that of the Czar of Russia.

Here is the paradise of the National Reform Association and the American Sabbath Union. Where is that hot-headed and cold-hearted advocate of their principles, who has been so often quoted as desiring to exile all who disagreed with him and his confreres to some desert island, etc.? Let his attention be called to this far away rest for his own soul.

To be "led by the Spirit" is not to be dragged by it. The soul that has to be dragged is not born of the Spirit. Forced obedience is not the sign of Sonship.—*The Christian Index*.
