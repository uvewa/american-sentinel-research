*The Signs of the Times,* Oakland, Cal., says: "Some of the islands of the Pacific—Savage Island, Pacific Ocean, to the Fiji Islands—have been brought under forms of organized law, beginning with what was originally Apostolic, in the course of which is pure in its very suggestion of what it means."

Since these islands have their own form of government established, their legislation is independent, no foreign power having committed to them their "independent" as the missionaries in their efforts to civilize and Christianize the natives, they have in the very nature of the case a large measure to legislate the religious instinct. They are used to having what they consider Christian laws on these islands, and would not be slow to rise to punished instead of crime.

In different islands, the different nationalities of missionary enterprise in the islands has been at work. Since laws are largely shaped by the religious beliefs of those who assist in making them, we find in the islands such laws as working on Sunday, for instance. The codes and customs of the missionary enterprise are maintained and enforced by judges, or *Fakapo,* as they call them, are also laws in some of the islands prohibiting work on Sunday, and "the possession of liquor." In the arena, the *papa* (police they call them, on some of the islands), are found to be quite as much of a policeman as any policeman on a beat. We have received a portion of the fine, claiming thus to have the best police force in the world. This legislation, which is in the nature of natural or unenacted custom of a race, and the embodiment and expression of emerging, have a right to a larger measure of legislative liberty, a seat in a sense of what is right and to the improvement of the times; and as such is, to us, even more interesting in many ways, than are the provisions of our own codes.
