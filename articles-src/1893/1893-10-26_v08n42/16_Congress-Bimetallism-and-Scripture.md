The *New York Sun*, Senator Morgan, of Alabama, and Representative Wheeler, also of Alabama, have been studying the Bible very thoroughly of late on the subject of bimetallism. The results of their unusual industry in scriptural investigation have been spread upon the pages of the Congressional Record to the extent of several columns. The hundreds of scriptural references to the production and utilization of silver and gold have been used to adorn the tales which these congressional orators have told, whether they have been able by their use to point any practical moral on the silver bill or not. At least these things do point this moral,— that the Congress of the United States is not behind its religious constituency in the development of a superficial religiosity.
