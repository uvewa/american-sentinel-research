It has frequently been declared that selfishness was behind the efforts of Sunday law advocates, and especially when the law was advocated by men with closed places of business, and whose competitors in trade kept open on Sunday. This statement has been questioned more than once, and those who have made it have been taken to task for it, but there appears in the *Mail and Express*, in the Pearl of Days Department, of October 4, a note concerning the arrest of four barbers in Knoxville, Tennessee, at the instigation of one E. J. Jennings, for a violation of the State law prohibiting the opening of barber shops for business on Sunday. In justification of his action, Mr. Jennings said:—

> In 1890 a law was enacted which prohibited barbering on the Sabbath in the State. There were many reasons for the enactment of the law. It grew out of a desire on the part of some of our barbers to carry out the spirit of the Scriptures, which read that "six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."
>
> It grew out of a desire not only to respect the Christian Sabbath, but to have a day of rest, a day which the law establishes and which is one of its most wise and humane provisions.
>
> When I see so many of my customers walking the streets on the Sabbath with a clean shave, fresh from the barber shop of some one who has violated the law, it makes me feel like asking the Legislature to repeal the law, something I asked them not to do two years ago, which request was granted.
>
> I am a law-abiding citizen, and so long as this law remains on the statute books I shall cheerfully abide by it and observe it, but if other barbers are allowed to violate its provisions, unless this law is enforced or repealed. I shall shut up my shop and go out of the business.
>
> That is why I caused the arrest of the violators of this law. On next Sunday every suspicious shop will be shadowed.

If Mr. Jennings closes his place of business on Sunday because of a conscientious regard for the day, his clamor for the enforcement or repeal of the law, and the reason that "many of my customers walk the streets on the Sabbath with a clean shave, fresh from the barber shop of some one who has violated the law,"—is a sad commentary on his moral backbone; if he does it simply because he is "a law-abiding citizen," then selfishness is behind his motive, and in either case it is the love of money that is at the bottom of his action in causing the arrest of these four men, and love of money, we are told, "is the root of all evil."
