A National Reform organ says: "There can be no doubt of a combined effort on the part of the enemies of righteousness to destroy the Sabbath." This is true, and nobody has a better right to know than the National Reformers, for they are the enemies of the true Sabbath. For years they have been opposing it with a counterfeit, and failing to destroy it they now invoke the national power and propose to enforce the counterfeit by force of arms. So far as man is concerned their efforts will doubtless be crowned with success, but God has a controversy with them, and he will one day demand, "Who hath required this at your hands?" Truth can afford to wait. "The eternal years of God are hers." Congress has officially interpreted the fourth commandment to mean Sunday, but God has not. His meaning and purpose remain the same. "The seventh day is the Sabbath," Congress and National Reformers to the contrary notwithstanding.
