The *Cleveland Leader*, one of the very few daily papers of the country not dominated by papists, published recently this item:—

> A pupil in St. Joseph's Academy, Marquette, Mich., drew a book entitled "Story of Liberty," from the public library, and the Mother Superior consigned it to the flames. A section regarding the Pope and King John was distasteful to her. It caused a sensation, and the city authorities threatened a lawsuit to have the book replaced. At the graduating exercises of the academy to-day, Father Lanagan declared that the book "smelled of lies." He also said: "It was an insult to every Catholic. We pay taxes for the support of that library, and as half of the citizens of Marquette, we have a right to insist that no such outrageous work shall be kept in it. Do not permit your children to read it, the iniquitous volume; do not touch it yourself. If it were intended for grown people, who were able to judge of its statements, it would not be so dangerous. No Protestant could read it without saying to himself, these are lies upon their very face. This volume we burned here, very properly, a few days ago. The paper says to-day that it will be replaced, but we will see whether it will or not."

Rome is becoming more and more aggressive, and will soon if unchecked, dictate terms to every municipality in the land.
