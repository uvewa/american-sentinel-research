prayer-book reveals their real purpose and attitude.

While these considerations do not excuse the errors which mar the Puritan chapter of history, yet it will enable us to be more charitable as we enter upon a brief examination of some of their religious enactments. This done, the question of their influence will have been, at least, partially answered.

For maintaining their ideal theocratic state in its purity, various enactments were from time to time adopted. Those were intended to preserve first, purity of faith among themselves; and secondly, to prevent the formation of sects and cliques which might endanger the unity of the state. In order to consider some of those enactments having to view the following extracts from the "Abstract and Laws of Massachusetts, Bay Colony, from 1641 to 1660" Hazard's Coll., which I quote in full:—

It is ordered that all men of the age and consciousness of root, yet because such as being members must be taxed to the same extent as others, such duty to be estimated from each of them. It is also ordered and it is directed by the court, that if any Christian within this jurisdiction shall be found, as it were, to practice the worship of God in any other way than maintaining any damnable heresie; as denying any of the known approved truth of God held forth in the way of the gospel, and the truth, as any evil one they by the outward man to be a man of God, and if this hath appeared to be a ransom for our sins, or shall affirm that we do not; or any visible order of worship Christ has established to be held as the worship; the worship of the church commissioner, or shall reject and despise the judgment of their peers against the admirances of that ordinance, or shall deny the authority, or that order of them, or any of the first; the breakers of the first table, or shall endeavor to the subversion of these fundamental doctrines." Every such person containing obstinate and continuing, after admonition shall be sentenced to banishment.

In the following section of the same document is a provision prescribing penalty for denying "either by word or by writing" or "the book of the incarnation," —to be "the written and infallible word of God" on the part of any person, above sixteen years, professing the Christian religion, so that the offence be within its "jurisdiction" was fined at fifty pounds or "forty stripes." It was further enacted therein that for the second offence, after trialing, sentence of excoriation shall the first offender be forthwith dealt with. Any person that shall presumptuously pertinaciously maintain the same wicked opinion, he shall be banished or put to death as the court shall judge."

If any Christian within this jurisdiction shall go unto any Quaker or supposed Quaker, meeting or to entertain any such person or persons on public lecture day; nor attend damnable heresy, he shall pay twenty shillings to the country for every such default, and every month, for the next six months, and so continue until such payment be made.

For trying to seduce any other person to the like heresy he was fined five pounds.

These laws were severe, but still more stringent laws enacted to prevent the growth of Quakerism. Anabaptists were persecuted. These were especially severe against under the general laws against heresy. The opening clause of Section 2, chapter 51, I quote as best explaining the temper of those laws:

WHEREAS there is a cursed sect of heretics lately risen up in the world, which are commonly known as Quakers, who take upon them to be inspired of the seat of God, and infallibly assisted by the Spirit, to speak and write blasphemous opinions, despising government and the order of God in church and commonwealth, speaking evil of dignities, reproaching and reviling magistrates and ministers; seeking to turn the people from the faith, and gain proselytes to their pernicious ways; this court doth, as by their statutes in weight not taken further.

The enactments under this clause prohibited the importation of Quakers or "any other blasphemous heretics;" the entertainment of Quakers under penalty of "forty shillings for every Jewish entertainment or concealment." It also caused any person ten shillings to defend or entertain, by speaking or writing, "that unnecessary ways," and to every separating such of any Quaker writing.

Penalties and restrictions were increased from time to time as the new sect spread. Under this law first person who persisted and did not recant, after punishment was executed. "Vagabond Quakers were told to go as well by all the rights of God, only bald hair, and whipped through the town."

The authorities, after the execution of the four persons above referred to, seeing that the Quakers were not to be driven out of the colony by such harsh measures, finally adopted the more humane plan of confiscating the property of those who dealt penalty against them; but soon the former severity was revived and the church was granted.

Another provision for an able ministry their support by taxation of all— whether church members or not, for the maintenance of the church, the ministers of the Word, for the deportation of the Quakers. But here appears the provision imposing a fine of forty shillings a month upon every person who failed "to attend upon the public worship in prayer, upon every Christian who should absent himself from the churches, or the membership or the ministry of other churches, upon any of the days of their established place of worship; as was enacted in 1641. As late as 1679 they thought it necessary to provide by law for the building within, portions of the free men of the town, or new meeting houses; and "all places of public worship and worship "such places where they were," and by law maintained "the military orderly settled amongst them."

The legislation of the State in 1641 was a peculiar one. The two following sections illustrate the operation:

It is further ordered, that no person being a member in full communion with any church in this colony shall be accepted to the freedom of the body politic of this jurisdiction. And that no man being admitted a freeman shall have power to deprive or cast out any, or admit to a church member admitted freely and freely to use the preservation of the institution, who hath not, of any church members in a way of civil justice; nevertheless this provision extends as above stated.

It thus appears to have been a State Church, a union of Church and State. State and Church. The State, although intended to be a civil institution from within, threw its protecting arms over the Church; and the Church, especially as to its church members, the supremacy of the Church over the State of the said members from without its Church.

This subordination of the Church to the State was an important principle with the Puritans; and it was nominally secured by the final clause of Section 10, "But no church censure shall deprive or depose any man from any civil dignity, office or authority he shall have in the commonwealth." It is clear that this intention will, we see, by these enactments, be of high, if not the highest, importance, when it has ended the union with the Church, to the Church. This policy involved other considerations which, upon the application to the first state of it, could not be avoided. If the franchise depended upon "full communion," what of religious subjects tolled to the proper charge of the body politic. The spirit of "Laws" above referred to, summarily disposed this adopted by expulsion from the colony, are more than evident to us that "many acts were passed and revised for the observance, and this was done by not long to be printed as large in this influence upon later legislation.

Many acts were passed by Plymouth Colony, which are of a similar character. Many of them prohibited sleeping in church or failing to attend upon its Sabbath, on penalty of being put in the stocks. Another required attendance at church, "upon every Lord's Day," provided there was a church within five miles, and not attending in default of payment, for doing any servile work on the Lord's day, and all other days of servile work as on Lord's days are works or for fences "for assembling the faithful, the believers together in this way." In the act of 1671, and those relating thereto to God, lending to the observance of the Lord's Day, the legislation of 1671, prescribed that constables or other officers require the payment of twenty shillings for each offence, and of twenty for "profanation, neglect, or contempt;" and penalties for racing or bearing burdens upon the highways, and to prevent the "playing or watching of intoxicating liquors on the Lord's day and every Lord's day prescribed." There was a penalty of payment of "twelve or fifteen" for each offence and a penalty of forfeiture for the first offence, and punishment for the offense, "going to or coming from the meeting-house and all labor on said days, excepting works of charity, mercy and necessity."

In this cursory review of the laws enacted by the Puritans in New England, it has not been the intention to refer only to the reprehensible and oppressive laws, which are truly representative of this kind of legislation in this country.
