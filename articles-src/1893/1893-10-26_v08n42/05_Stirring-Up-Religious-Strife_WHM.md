The *Independent Herald*, of Bertrand, Nebraska, expresses some very apt and accurate views in reference to the American Protective Association. The *Herald* says:—

> The A. P. A. is doing all it can to stir up religious strife in this country for political purposes. Its leaders declare that the United States must be Protestantized and that no Catholic shall be allowed to hold public office. With this as its avowed object it is easy to see what the work of this association, carried on under the cover of a secret organization, will eventually lead to. If the A. P. A. succeeds in carrying out its full programme it will bring about open violence between Protestants and Catholics in all parts of the country. This is exactly what some are seeking. They want a religious war; or, if not that, then as near it as possible—riots and disorder growing out of religious controversy—so that they may use it for the forming of new political lines, and to draw attention from more important issues. To this end are all their plans being laid. If this country must be Protestantized or Catholicism, we care not which it is, but we want neither. There is no reason why the adherents of either sect should hold all the offices. Unless the Federal Constitution is the biggest fraud on earth, this is a country where Protestant, Catholic and heretic have the same right to the offices and to everything else. When opposing sects begin to tug at the civil power with the object of gaining exclusive possession of the machinery of government it is time for thoughtful people, who value liberty and equality above religious prejudice, to give earnest heed to the situation.

There are a number of organizations, nominally Protestant, the purpose of which is to antagonize Roman Catholicism in politics, in business, and in social and daily life. Among these the American Protective Association has become most prominent. These associations are all secret or semi-secret in character. They are Protestant Jesuits. Because Roman Catholicism is what it is does not excuse the American Protective Association in degrading the name of Protestantism to the same level. The spirit which animates this association and all its kin is not that of Protestantism or of true religion,—it is that of bigotry, fanaticism, religious prejudice, animosity and strife. It is using the name of religion to conceal its irreligious motives and purposes. It is stealing the livery of heaven that it may the more effectually cover itself with the dress of deceit, and thereby be able the more efficiently to serve the satanic lord of violence and misrule.

With the American Protective Association, Protestantism stands for no real principle, it is nothing but a battle-cry, a campaign watchword. But it merits more attention than the ordinary catchword adopted to gain the ear, and attention, and following of a political party rabble. It is dealing with the most dangerous prejudices of mankind. It is confessedly massing and organizing those same forces which have filled the darkest pages of human history with such stories of blood and cruelty that humanity almost refuses to believe its kind capable of such unreason, inhumanity, and fiendishness. It is to these same prejudices and passions that the American Protective Association appeals; and by the use of these same terrible instrumentalities, which in previous centuries have darkened the world with inconceivable horrors, it expects to achieve the results it desires. Human nature does not materially change from century to century, or from generation to generation. Similar appeals to the same prejudices will bring about results in the nineteenth century not different in character from those which earlier centuries have seen. The laws of cause and effect are just as immutable in the moral and social world as in the physical. Moral forces may not be tampered with any more than material forces, and no untoward result follow. These antagonistic religious organizations are storehouses of social dynamite already filled with such destructive possibilities as should arouse the immediate and earnest attention of all liberty-loving and peace-loving citizens. And the faithful and prayerful effort of all true Christians is needed to convert these followers of the religion of force and violence to the religion of the God of peace, and the gospel of that Saviour who told us that the second great commandment was to love our neighbors as ourselves.
