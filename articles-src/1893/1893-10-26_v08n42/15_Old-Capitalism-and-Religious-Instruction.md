IN the *Independent* of August 31, is an article by Mrs. Mary Rogers Clay, in which she gives the history of a devoted woman, "Old Capitain," who considering over one hundred years ago was illustrated by its master and rescued from Caroline County, Va., to Kentucky, where his life was devoted to the religious instructing of his race. Peter, or the "Old Capitain" was recaptured, and at that time the Puritan spirit was not was suffering rigorous persecution for their faith. Of the Old Capitain's early opportunity for religious instruction Mrs. Clay says:—

The Established Church had awakened such a spirit of inquiry in Virginia [in the preservation of the Sabbath] that in violent hatred to all other exercise of all claims, was religious freedom. The jail houses bore tokens; these and signs, and bore full testimony that Waller, Craig, Childs, Ford, Young, and Elijah Craig—men of whom the present generation are better able to tell than us, they that is, they caused mass a man in the road that led from the churches and meeting houses to the court house.

Peter, with a quick perception, was an eager and interested spectator at religious meetings of the village; often led/ned by the way to hear the songs of these great hard veterans of the Cross, as they mingled behind the barred doors of the "various jail."

Persecution never hindered the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and it never will.
