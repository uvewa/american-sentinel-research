CAPE COLONY has a strictly religious legislation, which, according to the ethics of National Reform in the United States, the statute books a Sunday law, never enforced, would delight the hearts of the wisest of the most enthusiastic of those who are endeavoring to demonstrate that this inspirational relic of a barbarous age.

1. Any person who shall sell, or offer for sale any goods, wares or merchandise, or shall keep open any shop, warehouse, store or work shop, or other place for the purpose of trade or business, or shall by any other means carry on business on Sunday (except with perishable goods, or the fruits of the earth in cases of urgent necessity), or any person who shall do or exercise any worldly labor, business or work of his ordinary calling upon law ordinance, on the Lord's day, shall upon conviction thereof, before any justice, be liable to a fine not exceeding one pound, or to imprisonment for any period not exceeding one day's confinement. Provided that this section shall not apply to such persons as sell exclusively milk, fresh fish, and other perishable instruments, cattle, or other live stock, or any fuel or coals, or to persons selling or otherwise disposing of drugs, medicines, or other medical instruments.

2. This penal enactment not only seizes hold on the bodies of those who dare to think for themselves, and imprison them, thereby, by confiscating all their property for the benefit of the State. After making provision for druggists, selling broken bones, broken-down horses, calves, and meat. Enforcement, between the hours of 4 A. M. and 4 E. M. it sets up the town as a prison, and does not allow any person law to muzzle around and invade the private life of the inhabitants of Cape Colony, for the following of that law.

3. And be it enacted that all offences against this ordinance shall be cognizable by the court of the district in which the offence is committed; and any magistrate within the said district may try, determine, award and direct what, if any of the amount of any fine or forfeiture recovered in virtue of this law, over and above expenses, allowed shall be paid to any person who may have been instrumental in discovering such offence.

This law, though strange to say, is recognized as law and as existing law in South Africa. It was enacted by Parliament in 1838, and is on the statute books as good law. It was re-passed in 1861; the Parliament legislated to preserve certain statutes, imposed through the time when they were under the control of the Great Dutch, upon Catholicize others and to repeal others. This law was left as it was.

This law is a specimen; it is representative. It is more than such, it carries with it its own, and penalties as absurd and severe as itself the law that are not to be enforced, but are used as religious instruments of persecution, to be brought to bear at will upon those with the advice and consent of the pious and painstaking informers.

The several sections of the said ordinance, No. 5 of 1838, herein repealed, are set forth in a schedule hereunto annexed.

So far this law of 1868 does not specifically, by name, state that any work whatsoever, or any business, of any character, or of any resort, where any religious community, shall not continue in the exercise of their religious faith; and it provides that no penalties or disabilities are or were imposed upon any one on account, it would appear not, of their religious belief or profession, are, so far as we now understand it, aimed to be, and to be against any particular person or persons of any kind and sort of effect.

What this law did enact there were as "religious communities, orders or persons who wished to settle in the colony and upon whom the Sunday law imposed any" penalties. This was "not with the view" of those to impress on the minds of Parliament that this law did not interfere with the observance of the seventh day. And they do not now seem to be conscious of the influence that this law exercises in the Cape Colony. But the fact that there has arisen in different parts of the colony religious communities who honestly keep the seventh day and work on Sundays, brings the law to the front again. They are a loyal, honest, industrious people, who in every way desire the good of the state and their fellow-citizens of all denominations, and no doubt are here to stay. No one has ever complained of their honest example; it does not place them in the attitude of malefactors, who might be "instrumental in discovering" the "religious beliefs" of conscientious, Christian Sabbath observers, as the "offences" in this law "so to do; provisions," is but a bit of one seventh of their time that is not their own. This old law enacted in 1838 in South Africa, inarticulate from age, and yet remaining on her statute books in force in this colony, if any," are ever enforced, are alike injurious to the rights and liberties of all good people.

So as any intent of the law-making power to interfere with the rights of conscience. And as yet it never seems to have been enforced that way any more than the other. But the are two or three facts loving those God-fearing people who do to their standard of right, which pressing observation make plain to them even more sharply than they know.

Lives in the paradise of the National Reformed Seventh-day Adventists and Sabbath Union. Where is that land without the Puritan spirit. There is a little old physician, who has been so often quoted so aptly in these columns, who was born near Cape Town, and his conference to some desert islands, set "far in oblivion to be called this is far away for our time here."
