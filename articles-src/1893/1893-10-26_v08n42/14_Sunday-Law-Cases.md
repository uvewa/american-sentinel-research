ON Monday, Oct. 16, sixty-three tailors, all Jews, were arraigned before Justice Kock for violation of the Sunday law in carrying on their ordinary occupations on Sunday. They were held for examination on Nov. 16, and gave bail for their appearance in the sum of one hundred dollars each.

An opinion rendered by Attorney-General Little of Kansas provokes the interest of members of the American Protective Association, in that State. The opinion holds the ground that the option only abolishes the religious rights of citizens, and therefore connect and the associate of the State, which, through the Constitution, grants religious liberty without restriction, to all its citizens. Why should the State charter the American Protective Association any more than it should incorporate a Roman Catholic society to restrict the religious privileges and the civil privileges of Protestants?

THE New York *Sun,* Senator Morgan, of Alabama, and Representative Wheeler, also of Alabama, have been studying the case very thoroughly of late on the subject of bimetallism. The results of their individual attainment in scriptural investigation have been spread upon the pages of the *Congressional Record* to the extent of several columns. The hundred and scriptural references to the production and utilization of silver and gold have now been used to adorn the table which those congressional representatives of the people of the free silver have been able by their use to point any practical moral on the silver bill or not. At least these things do point the moral, that the Congress of the United States at least behind its religious constituency in the development of a superficial religiosity.

AT a recent Sunday-closing meeting in Chicago, "President" Bonney said:—

It is obvious since the Sunday closing movement started, and many and great changes have taken place. At one but this interest was manifested, but to-day there is hardly a town or hamlet in which the majority of citizens do not advocate the setting apart of one day in seven for rest, whatever be their set value.

The statement so to the universality of the Sunday agitation is true. Everywhere men are exalting Sunday to a place never occupied by any other day in any country except Palestine. All the world are worshiping the beast by wreaking the badge of his authority—the "wild solar holiday of all pagan times," foisted upon the world as a Christian institution by the "man of sin;" the "mystery of iniquity." The latter part of the statement is disingenuous. The purpose is not by any agent "one day in seven" as "a day of rest, but to exalt Sunday as a religious institution. The rest is an accessory, and, indeed, a very unimportant matter if only the day is honored.
