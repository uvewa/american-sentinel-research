*The Independent Herald,* of Bozeman, Montana, expresses some very sane and accurate views in reference to the American Protective Association. The *Herald* says:—

The A. P. A. is doing all it can to stir up religious strife in this country for political purposes. It claims that no Roman Catholic should be permitted to hold public office. With this as its avowed purpose it is really aimed at the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion for all, and its present assumption, will eventually lead to. If the A. P. A. is doing right in denouncing Catholics and in trying to bring about open violence between Protestants and Catholics, then it is doing what it has no right to bring about any religious controversy or war; or if not that, then as near it as possible. Their main aim is to use any and all means to keep them from attaining political power, new or old political lines, and to draw attention. The motive is to get hold of the political machinery. Protestants, we care not which Protestant or Catholicized. We care not which of the adherents of either sect should hold all the offices, but let us be men—American men—not political. And whether a man is a Roman Catholic, Catholic and heretic have the same right to freedom of opinion and religious worship, regardless of political position, and any movement for the purpose of gaining exclusive possession of the machinery of political government by either party is against toleration liberty and equality above religious prejudice.

There are a number of organizations, one more in this country, which, under the plea of securing the rights of Protestantism in politics, in business, and in social and moral affairs; but the sole purpose of the American Protective Association has become most objectionable. These American Associations are all secret or semi-secret in character. They are a Protestant, Catholic; they call themselves Catholics. But the real animus of the Catholicism is what it is does not scrape against the name of Protestantism to degrading the name of Protestantism to the uses. The special aim which commands the most attention in the movement is to unite the cause of Protestantism of true religion,—it is simply an unprincipled appeal to prejudice, jealousy, animosity and strife. It is using the name of religion to conceal its temptation motive and purposes. It is stealing the livery of heaven that it may the more effectually cover itself with the dress of deceit, and thereby be able the more effectually to serve the sinister ends of ambition and avarice.

The American Protective Association, like Protestantism stands for no real principle. It is nothing but a religio-political campaign watchword. But it merits more attention than the ordinary catch-word adopted to gain the ear, and attention, and following of a political party rabble. It is dealing with the most dangerous prejudice and organizing those more forces which have lined the darkest pages of the world's history with records of violence and cruelty that humanity almost shudders to contemplate. In a word, it is religious rancor, inhumanity, and fiendishness. It is not for us to say how far this movement that the American Protective Association appeals and by one of those most terrible instrumentalities, which in previous centuries have darkened the world; but with inconceivable horrors, it expects to subserve the results of its designs. Human nature does not materially change from century to century, or from generation to generation. Religious bigotry in one age will bring about results in the same vein in another age. And the forces which are set in motion in this country at the present from those which earlier centuries sent to the stake or the scaffold in Europe are just as immutable in the moral and in the physical realm, and the effect of forces may not be tampered with any more than material forces, and with as much result follow. These antagonistic religious organizations are destruction of social dynamite already filled with combustible possibilities and should arouse every patriot, every Christian, and every liberty loving and peace-loving citizen, to stand as a watchman on the walls. If all true Christians is needed to correct all and violence to the religion of the God of peace, and the gospel of that Christendom told us that the second great commandment was to love our neighbor as ourselves.
