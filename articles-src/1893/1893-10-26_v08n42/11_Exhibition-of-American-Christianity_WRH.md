An idea which obtained considerable currency the past year among a certain class of religionists, was to the effect that the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair, by the authority of the national Government of the United States, would be the most striking exhibition to foreign nations of "American Christianity"; and that this action would convince the most sceptical, or at least ought to do so, that "this is a Christian Nation."

Most of the readers of the SENTINEL, however, heartily disagree with any such notion; and it would be a good thing for the Nation, if every intelligent individual in it, understood the true bearings of this question. I am glad to know, that, by the Lord's blessing, the SENTINEL has opened the eyes of thousands upon thousands to see the light of truth in this matter.

It would seem that, if it were possible for National Reformers to open their eyes to see clearly, such paragraphs as the following, from the secular press, would convince them of the erroneous nature of the ideas for which they so earnestly contend. Under the title of "Foreign Reverence," a World's Fair correspondent to the daily press says:—

> There is here a chapel which ranks high among the wonders of the Fair and of the world.
>
> In this chapel I observe a little difference between our folks and foreigners, which is, at least, worth noting, be the moral what it may.
>
> Every Italian, Frenchman, or Spanish American, and almost every European of more northern nations, reverently removes his bat and maintains a profound silence; while Americans tramp through and chatter, without a sign that the place is any more to them than Machinery Hall.
>
> It is the same in other places where religion is illustrated.
>
> It would be interesting to know what these foreigners think of us.

Indeed, it would be interesting. If this sufficiently indicates "foreign reverence," it no less clearly shows that American irreverence is a national characteristic. Just as straws indicate the direction from which the wind is blowing, so such records as these show that National Reformers are cultivating a spurious Christianity, which falls short of gaining even the observance of the formalities which they seek.
