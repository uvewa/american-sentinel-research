As we study the legislation of the Puritans we see by what steps they have, them, by keeping two or three ideas in mind.

The age in which Puritanism was born was an age of intolerance, of bigotry, and of intellectual awakening.

The mind was just awakening from its long night, its incoherent dreams; but it was only just becoming conscious of its new liberty in any conception of it; when "go to," it says, "let us think upon these things." It was thus carried from the strongholds of error being in danger, in the very act of breaking away from them, of taking a course that would result in their strongholds of truth also. Beware! rest not! Tarry in truth. Settle not thyself with the strength of giants, into error! sovereignty of truth, and learn afresh that something unknown to them in their previous bondage to the traditions of men; but not conceiving of its true proportions, and the extent of the blessings of which it is not altogether unprepared, therefore, was the Puritan legislation, both.
