In the *Independent* of August 31, is an article by Mrs. Mary Rogers Clay, in which she gives the history of a devoted slave, "Old Captain," who something over one hundred years ago was liberated by his master and removed from Caroline County, Va., to Kentucky, where his life was devoted to the religious instruction of his race. Peter, or the "Old Captain," was a Baptist, and at the time the story opens that sect was suffering rigorous persecution for their faith. Of the old slave's early opportunities for religious instruction Mrs. Clay says:—

> The Established Church had awakened such a spirit of inquiry in Virginia [by its persecution of the Baptists] that the whole theme of conversation, among all classes, was religious freedom. The jail in the village below, time and again, had been full to the brim with such men as John Waller, Edward Young, and Elijah Craig—men of whom the prosecuting attorney said: "May it please your worship, sir, they cannot meet a man in the road but they must cram a text of Scripture down his throat."
>
> Peter, with a quick perception, was an eager observer of all this, and when upon errands to the village, often loitered by the way to hear the songs of praise and words of exhortation from the lips of those gray-haired veterans of the Cross, as they stood behind the barred doors of the Caroline jail.

Persecution never hindered the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and never can.
