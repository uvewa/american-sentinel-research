An opinion rendered by Attorney-General Little of Kansas precludes the issuance of a charter to the American Protective Association, in that State. The opinion takes the ground that the order seeks to abridge the religious rights of citizens, and therefore cannot ask the sanction of the State, which, through its Constitution, grants religious liberty without restriction, to all its citizens. Why should the State charter the American Protective Association any more than it should incorporate a Roman Catholic society to restrict the business, social, and political privileges of Protestants?
