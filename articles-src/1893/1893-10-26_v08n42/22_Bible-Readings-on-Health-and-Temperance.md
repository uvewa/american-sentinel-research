The Good Health Publishing Company, of Battle Creek, Mich., has just issued a pamphlet of some ninety pages, entitled, "Bible Readings on Health and Temperance Topics," by W. H. Wakeham. The subject of the care of the body, and general hygiene, is treated from a Bible standpoint. The method used in the presentation of the subject is that of question and answer,—the replies to the queries raised being, almost invariably, direct quotations from Scripture; serving to elaborate this, somewhat, are extracts, in illustration and explanation, from scientific and medical works, commentaries, the writings of Mrs. E. G. White, etc. This is a valuable condensation. It contains matter for much thought, which might be extended into volumes of comparative research. The retail price of the pamphlet is 30 cents.
