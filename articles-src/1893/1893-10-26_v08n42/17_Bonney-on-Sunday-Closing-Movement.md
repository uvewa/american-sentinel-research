At a recent Sunday-closing meeting in Chicago, "President" Bonney said:—

> It is thirteen years since the Sunday-closing movement started, and many and great changes have taken place. At first but little interest was manifested, but to-day there is hardly a town or hamlet in which the majority of citizens do not advocate the setting apart of one day in seven for rest, whatever be the day set aside.

The statement as to the universality of the Sunday agitation is true. Everywhere men are exalting Sunday to a place never occupied by any other day in any country except Palestine. All the world are worshiping the beast by worshiping the badge of his authority—the "wild solar holiday of all pagan times," foisted upon the world as a Christian institution by the "man of sin," the "mystery of iniquity."

The latter part of the statement is disingenuous. The purpose is not to set apart "one day in seven" as a day of rest, but to exalt Sunday as a religious institution. The rest is a secondary, and, indeed, a very unimportant matter if only Sunday is honored.
