For years they have been opposing it with a combined, and failing to destroy it they now invoke the national power and proposes to enforce the counterfeit by force of arms. So far as man is concerned their efforts will doubtless be crowned with success, but God has a controversy with them, and he will one day demand: "Who hath required this at your hands?" Truth can afford to wait." "The eternal years of God are hers."

And one of these days the "sabbath" men will get it.

Lives in the paradise of the National Reformed Seventh-day Adventists and Sabbath Union.
