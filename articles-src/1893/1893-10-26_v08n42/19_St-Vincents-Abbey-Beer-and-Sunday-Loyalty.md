"THERE is," says the *Independent*, "a St. Vincent's Abbey, in Beatty, Penn., of the Benedictine order, which has a seminary and college attached, with two hundred students and twenty-five professors. It makes money in part by manufacturing beer, which is freely advertised for public sale and use." Yet the Roman Catholic Church is simply "one of the great divisions of the Redeemer's army," with which the National Reformers have gladly joined hands, while Seventh-day Adventists who have not the most remote connection with the liquor traffic in any of its branches, are cast out as evil, and are classed with saloon-keepers. What makes this difference? Simply this: the papists are loyal to Sunday, while the Adventists denounce it as a base counterfeit of the true Sabbath. Loyalty to Sunday has now become the test of Christianity.
