THE *Independent* lately published a comparison on the subject of "Is the World Growing Better" by expressing its views upon Mr. Moody and said:—

There is every indication that the present grand parliament of all the religions most glorious object which the world exhibits is the most glorious in the eyes of thoughtful men.

Without the evidence of any adequate perception of the significance of its words the *Independent* suggests what the President of the World's Congress Auxiliary, said in his address at the opening of the Parliament of Religions:—

The scope and the wisdom of the approaching religions can not be measured by the most cautious yet given of the approaching event.

When men, brought prominently before the American public as leaders, talk as they do, it is not impossible that their words may have a far-reaching meaning and significance than they themselves mean? Of those men may be said what the men of Athens,—"Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you"; so, not infrequently, in it possible, as prophets, so to men, to talk that which you ignorantly speak, that truth the Bible declares unto men. And so it is here, whether these leaders of the Parliament were conscious of what they have uttered, or with the true prophecy of the condition, what these things mean in their minds; or, whether he in searching the Scriptures in order to see with which to dramatically bring to an end the great assembly this, this thought and these words appealed to Mr. Bonney, as being the most rhetorically striking that he could use, yet they, as has been seen, he has said and women language, entirely each with are, and are to be, the fulfillment of the sure word heralded to the world through the AMERICAN SENTINEL, and not the arguments or opinions of Mr. Moody or Mr. Bonney, but truth the this bear and—hey, a repetition of the warning and the promise which Christ gave to his disciples, for their hearts, and for care upon whom the last days of which he spoke have come upon as a repetition of the vision of the new heaven and the new earth where there should be no more death, nor sorrow, nor pain; for the first heaven and the first earth shall have passed away. As Isaiah said to the seer of Patmos, as a revelation to him.

With what effective simplicity John has responded to these prophetic words! "And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful."

This is the gospel, the message, the invitation of worship, and of greeting for this day and this hour. Do Mr. Moody and Mr. Bonney share that if they said it, they will let the whole world know what they do?
