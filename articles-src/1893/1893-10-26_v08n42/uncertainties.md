## OCR Errors and Corrections

### Page 1 — Masthead / Volume number
- **Issue:** OCR reads "VOLUME 5." but context (all other data points, sequence, and internal running headers reading "VOL. 8, NO. 42") confirms this is Volume 8.
- **Second pass:** Yes — running headers on pages 2, 4, 6 all read "VOL. 8, NO. 42."
- **Transcribed as:** Volume 8 throughout.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — OCR misread "8" as "5"; corrected from internal evidence.

### Page 1 — Associate Editor Name
- **Issue:** OCR reads associate editor as "WILLIAM H. BURKE." The masthead lists "WILLIAM H. BURKE" but all article initials at article ends read "W. H. M." This is likely W. H. McKee (WHM), not Burke. However, the masthead text from the OCR explicitly reads "WILLIAM H. BURKE."
- **Second pass:** Yes — the initials at end of three articles read "W. H. M." which matches "W. H. McKee" per the known authors list. However, the masthead clearly names "WILLIAM H. BURKE" as associate editor for this issue.
- **Decision:** Transcribed masthead as it appears. Used WHM initials as they appear on articles. The discrepancy between "W. H. Burke" (masthead) and "W. H. McKee" (known author for WHM initials) is noted — this may be a genuine OCR error in the masthead, or "Burke" may be a different person, or "W. H. M." may stand for "W. H. Murkee" or similar. The known author mapping WHM=W. H. McKee from MEMORY.md is applied to article attribution.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — masthead name possibly OCR error for "McKee" or a different editor named Burke.

### Page 5 — OCR Garbled Text in Puritan Legislation Article
- **Issue:** Section 13 reads "broaching and maintaining any damnable horsey" — clearly an OCR error for "heresy."
- **Second pass:** Yes — context is identical to the previous mention of "damnable heroics" (also an OCR error for "heresies").
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved exactly as OCR text appears ("damnable horsey", "damnable heroics") since these are OCR artifacts of the source scan. The original text would have read "heresies."
- **Confidence:** LOW for exact original wording — preserved OCR transcription faithfully as the OCR is what we are splitting; original word was almost certainly "heresies."
- **Note:** Both "heroics" and "horsey" in this article are OCR misreadings of "heresies."

### Page 4 — "archbiding" in International Congress Article
- **Issue:** OCR reads "co-religionists with the archbiding" — likely OCR error for "archbishop" or "archbishop's."
- **Second pass:** Yes — context makes clear this refers to Archbishop Ireland mentioned just prior.
- **Transcribed as:** "archbiding" (preserved as OCR text).
- **Confidence:** LOW — original likely read "archbishop" or "the archbishop."

### Page 6 — "steambeats" in Massachusetts Article
- **Issue:** OCR reads "steambeats and railroad trains" — clearly should be "steamboats."
- **Transcribed as:** "steambeats" (preserved as OCR text).
- **Confidence:** LOW for original — OCR error for "steamboats."

### Page 3 — "60ft feet" and "56ft feet" in Grand Trunk Railway Advertisement
- These appear on page 7 in an advertisement section, which was correctly skipped.

### Author — Geo. B. Thompson
- **Issue:** "GEO. B. THOMPSON" signs the Cape Colony article with dateline "Cape Town, So. Africa." This author does not appear in the known authors list.
- **Decision:** Used author_short "GBT" and full name "Geo. B. Thompson." Added to article frontmatter as explicit attribution.

### Author — W. R. Herd
- **Issue:** "W. R. HERD." signs the "Exhibition of American Christianity" article. This author does not appear in the known authors list.
- **Decision:** Used author_short "WRH" and full name "W. R. Herd."

### Page 4 — "Kingdom of Christ" attribution
- **Issue:** Article ends with "—*W. E. Howell, in Review and Herald*." This is a reprint from the Review and Herald by W. E. Howell. Treated as reprint with original_publication "Review and Herald."

### Article 01 — "Tolerance and Toleration" Title
- **Issue:** The lead article on page 1 has no printed title in the OCR — it begins directly with "WHAT is tolerance?" The title "Tolerance and Toleration" was derived from the subject matter of the article.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — descriptive title assigned; original may have had no title or a different title not captured by OCR.

### Page 7 — Advertisements Skipped
- Book advertisements (New Historical Atlas, Siberia and the Nihilists, New Bible Atlas, etc.) were correctly identified as advertisements and skipped.
- The Medical Missionary journal advertisement was skipped.
- The Grand Trunk Railway advertisement was skipped.
- The hymn book advertisement was skipped.

### Page 8 — Subscription/Terms Block Skipped
- The AMERICAN SENTINEL subscription rates table and terms were correctly identified as boilerplate and skipped.
- The note about papers sent without ordering was skipped as boilerplate.
