GOOD Health Publishing Company, of Battle Creek, Mich., has just issued a book of great value and practical interest. "The Stomach; Its Disorders and How to Cure Them," a comprehensive treatise on practical hygiene, is treated from a Biblical stand-point. It discusses every phase and relation of the subject is of that question to the public health, and the suggestions for restraining it. The subject is earnestly raised being, almost irrespectively, to these Christians, this, somewhat, are extants, at the end their works contemporaneous, also the old and useful work, "Constipation, the Most Insidious Disease of Civilized Mankind," a matter for much thought, which might be called a supplement to the former, in many strange pieces of statesmanship, but when to those they do strange things.

To be "led by the Spirit" is not to be "dragged by it." The flesh has all it can stand. It does not need more. The Spirit dragged is not born of the Spirit. Forced obedience is not the sign of Sonship.—*The Christian Judge.*
