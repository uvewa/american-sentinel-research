This colony, being the offspring of a nation, which, according to the ethics of National Reformers, is Christian, has on its statute books a Sunday law, severe enough in its requirements to meet the wishes of the most enthusiastic of these self-styled "reformers" in America. This inquisitional relic of a barbarous past reads as follows:—

> 1. Any person who shall sell, or offer for sale any goods, merchandise, cattle, or other live stock, or shall trade or deal or keep open any shop, store, or other place for the purpose of trade or dealing, or shall cut or carry any fuel, or shall engage in any field labor, except as aforesaid (to preserve the fruits of the earth in cases of urgent necessity), or shall discharge any firearm, except as aforesaid (upon lawful occasions), on the Lord's day, shall for each offense incur and be liable to a fine not exceeding three pounds, nor less than five shillings, or to imprisonment for any period not exceeding fourteen days. And it shall be lawful for any constable or police officer to seize any such goods, merchandise, cattle, or other live stock, or any fuel or firearms as aforesaid; and the same shall on the conviction of the offender be and become forfeited to Her Majesty.

This mediaeval document not only seizes hold on the bodies of those who dare to transgress its requirements, but makes them paupers, by confiscating all their goods to the benefit of the State! After making provision for druggists, eating house keepers, butchers, bakers, dairymen and fishmongers, between the hours of 9 A. M., and 4 P. M., it sets up the inquisition, and bids the minions of the law to sneak around and invade the privacy of the home, in the following language:—

> 7. And be it enacted that all offenses against this ordinance shall be cognizable by the court of the resident magistrate. . . . and it shall be lawful for the said governor in each particular case to determine, award and direct what, if any of the amount of any fine or forfeiture recovered in respect of any conviction for any such offense as aforesaid shall be paid to any person who may have given information concerning the same.

This law, though strange to say, is something like what antinomians tell us the Decalogue is, both abolished and in full force. It was enacted by Parliament in 1838, and is on the statute books as operative and in full force. But in 1868, Parliament legislated to remove certain restrictions, imposed during the time when the colony was under the control of the Dutch, upon Catholics because of their religion. The "act" declares that,

> WHEREAS, it is expedient that such laws, so far as the same impose any such restrictions, disabilities, and penalties as aforesaid should be formally declared to be null and void, in order by such declaration to place on an equal footing before the law all religious denominations. . . . Be it therefore enacted by the governor of the Cape of Good Hope, with the advice and consent of the legislative council and house of assembly thereof, as follows:—
>
> 1. The several sections of the said ordinance, No. 68, following the second section thereof shall be and the same are hereby repealed.

So far this law of 1868 does not affect the Sunday law of 1838. But it continues:—

> 2. All other laws heretofore in force in this colony, if any, whereby any religious community, or order or any person whatsoever is or was deprived of any rights or privileges in law, or whereby any penalties or disabilities are or were imposed upon such communities, orders or persons by reason only of their religious belief or profession, are, so far as any such restrictions, penalties and disabilities are or were imposed by the same, hereby declared to be null and void and of no effect.

When this law was enacted there were no "religious communities, orders or persons," in the colony so far as known upon whom the Sunday law imposed any "penalties or disabilities," and it was certainly not in the minds of Parliament that this law should in any way abridge the Sunday edict. And they do not now seem to be conscious of the fact that it does. But during the years since this law was enacted there has arisen in different parts of the colony, a denomination, "persons" who keep the seventh day and work on Sunday, as they believe the Bible requires. They are a loyal, honest, industrious people, have nice churches, and institutions of learning, and no doubt are hers to stay. But the Sunday law, if operative, as Parliament considers it, does not place them on "equal footing" with other denominations, as it deprives them, because of their "religious belief," of one day of labor each week. This is a "disability" a "penalty,"—a tax of one seventh of their time. This being the case, the Sunday law enacted in 1838 is abolished, inasmuch as the law of 1868 declares that "all laws heretofore in force in this colony, if any," which do this are "null and void, and of no effect."

So far as any intent of the law-making power to abolish the Sunday law, there was none. And as yet it never seems to occur to them that the one act destroys the other. Both are the laws of the colony. But they, in the last act, legislated more wisely than they knew.

As to what effect this will have in delivering these God-fearing people from the wickedness of the Sunday law, time will show. It will have none, perhaps, as "equity is fallen in the streets." Putting the two "acts" together they present a strange piece of statesmanship, but when governments assume to legislate on religion they do strange things.

Cape Town, So. Africa.
