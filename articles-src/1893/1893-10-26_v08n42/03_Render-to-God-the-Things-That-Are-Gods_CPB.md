FREQUENT appeal is made to the 13th chapter of Romans to sustain the assumption that unquestioning obedience to civil rulers is a moral duty; but that scripture teaches us no such doctrine. We sometimes hear about harmonizing texts of sacred scripture, but the expression should never be used. Where there is apparent conflict man's duty is, not to harmonize passages in the divine Word, but to discover the harmony which already exists.

The principle so plainly stated in Acts 5:29: "We ought to obey God rather than men," is nowhere contradicted in the divine Word. On the contrary we find it to be the rule of action of the servants of God in all ages. It was fidelity to this principle that brought the three Hebrew worthies face to face with death in the burning fiery furnace, but which also on the same occasion brought them face to face with their Lord, whose form was "like the Son of God," and who gloriously delivered them. It was likewise obedience to the same, then unwritten law, that caused Daniel to be cast alive into the den of lions, from which he came forth also alive, and gloriously vindicated, though he had violated a law of the realm and defied the authority of his earthly sovereign.

The key to the thirteenth of Romans is found in the words of our Lord recorded in Matt. 22:21: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." The Jews were living under Caesar's government and were therefore in duty bound to render to Caesar his due, but this did not release them from their obligation to render to God his due, even if to do so would bring them in conflict with Caesar; for it has ever been true that man's first and highest allegiance is due to his Creator, hence he is to love God with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his mind, more than he loves himself even; while he is to love his neighbor as he loves himself, Matt. 22:37-39.

The whole subject under discussion in the thirteenth of Romans is man's duty to his fellows. This is evident from verses 8-10: "Owe no man anything, but to love one another, for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Love worksth no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."

This the divine law requires and the civil law cannot go beyond it. But even should the civil law strip the Christian of his earthly possessions it would still be his duty to quietly submit trusting his cause to God who judge its rightnessly, and remembering that "all things work together for good to them that love God." Non-resistance is the rule of the Christian life. The Christian must not—yea he cannot do wrong, but he can suffer and will suffer wrong, and that patiently. Said the Saviour: "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain." And again the apostle says: "What glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps."

1 Peter 2:20, 21.

But while the Christian is to yield to man everything, yea and much more than the civil law requires, and this for conscience' sake, he must not render to Caesar that which is God's. The divine mandate is, Render to God the things that are God's. And neither the thirteenth chapter of Romans, nor any other scripture contradicts this in any degree. The whole subject matter of that chapter is concerning the Christian's duty to render to Caesar (the civil authorities) the things that are due to civil authority, and nothing else.
