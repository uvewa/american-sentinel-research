THE *Evangel and Sabbath Outlook*, in its report of the International Sunday Rest Congress at Chicago, September 28–30, says:—

Its printed programme announced over thirty addresses and papers. "A partial list of the Advisory Council" of this congress gives about eighty names from Great Britain, four from Belgium, two from Holland, four from Italy, three from Hungary, eighteen from France, nineteen from Switzerland, twelve from Germany, eight from Canada, two from Denmark, two from Norway, and about eighty from the United States. On paper it was "international," in fact, it was not. There were several papers from abroad, which were read by the officers of the congress.

The attendance was surprisingly and phenomenally small, even when allowance is made for the "reaction" following the "Main Parliament," which closed on the 27th, and the storm which prevailed on the 30th. The largest attendance was on the evening of the 30th, when Archbishop Ireland was the chief speaker. About three hundred were present, the majority of whom were evidently co-religionists with the archbiding and especial sympathizers with the questions touching the "working classes." The morning session on the 30th, at which the archbishop presided, began with fifteen persons and did not reach fifty at any time; actual count at several other sessions showed less than one hundred present. Leading representatives of religious thought were conspicuous by their absence. Roman Catholics made a strong showing in the congress. A paper on the "Place of Sunday observance in Christianity," by "His Eminence Cardinal Gibbons, Baltimore," was read by a Catholic priest of Chicago on the evening of the 28th. It was highly commended by Dr. Atterbury (Presbyterian), chairman of the committee of arrangements, who declared that the cardinal had stated the question as essentially held by evangelical Protestants. This was a surprising avowal of the fact that in spite of the temporary "Puritan Sabbath" episode in modern history, Protestants have never left the fundamental positions held by Roman Catholics on the Sunday question. This congress, developed and carried forward under the management of Presbyterian Protestantism, has had for its key note what puritanism has hitherto called the "low ground Roman Catholic idea," and nothing has occurred in modern "Sunday movements" which so clearly demonstrates the inevitable return of Protestants to the Catholic platform, as the general drift of this congress. We have often shown that this return must come unless Protestants give up their false claims concerning Sunday and accept the Sabbaths—"His Eminence" the cardinal, and the "eloquent archbishop," whose speech formed the main feature of the last session and whose prayer closed the programme, have reason to be abundantly satisfied with the tendencies and the results of the congress.

Some speakers, like Dr. Henson and Joseph Cook, disclaimed vigorously against the indifference and the inconsistencies of Christians, and called loudly for more courage and conscience along the line of religious thought and action. The "increasing evils of Sunday desecration" were vividly portrayed, and the downfall of Christianity and of the Republic were repeatedly predicted "if the disregard for Sunday continues;" but no scriptural basis for Sunday was offered and no ground for conscience was set forth. Denunciatory eloquence concerning things that are, creates more "applause" than real good when it fails to give an adequate and biblical basis for remedy. It is far easier to complain than to cure, and the absence of efforts by "eminent speakers" to give any biblical ground for "Sunday rest" revealed the necessity which drove the congress to lower ground.

Although it is true that the Roman Catholic element took, if anything, the superior place in this congress, still the denomination made the least effort there, and rather, in fact, treated the movement somewhat cavalierly. It was really rather painful to see how the quite small consideration of the Roman Catholics was magnified and made much of by the Protestant promoters of the congress. But the ancient hierarchy had no need to step down from its dignity to propitiate these its minions, for this entire Sunday movement is in reality, though ignorantly, an organized Roman Catholic propaganda. Those who doubt or deny this should read the articles from the *Catholic Mirror* lately published in this paper.
