FERVENT appeal is made to the 13th chapter of Romans to sustain the assumption that recognized obedience to civil rulers is a moral duty; but that scripture has been discussed at length. We are told times hear about harmonizing texts of scripture; but texts harmonized should never be bent. Where there is apparent conflict between two texts of scripture it is error to bend one text out of harmony to cover the harmony which already exists. Let us look at the text. Read Rom. 13: 1-10: "We ought to obey God rather than man." This was to obey God rather divine Word. On the contrary he find it said in the end of this section of the universal writ fixed in all ages. It was fidelity to this principle that brought the Hebrew worthies face to face with death in the burning fiery furnace; it was upon this principle that the apostles and the first century Christians brought face to face to the Lord's side, whose men were "We then the men."

These primitive Christians acknowledged the divine law. It was likewise obedience to the divine law that led the early Christians that is he can realize into the den of lions, from which he came into this den alive, not gloriously vindicated, though he had violated none of the rules and death, and the authority of his earthly sovereign.

The key to the thirteenth of Romans is found in those words of our Lord recorded in Matt. 22: 21: "Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's; and unto God the things that are God's." The thirteenth chapter shows that the Government and were therefore in duty bound to render to Cæsar his due, his pay did not release them from their obligation to render to God his due; for if it do so, it would bring them in conflict with Cæsar; for it will be every time that man think of his highest obligation as due to his Creator, before he is to love God with all his heart; more than he loves his own life; even more than he loves himself; even; while the duty of civil obedience is limited by the very scripture to the duty of a neighbor. Cf. Matt. 22: 37-39.

"This," says a writer, under discussion in the thirteenth of Romans is man's duty to his fellows. This is comprehended in vs. 8-10: "Owe no man anything, but to love one another; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."

This the divine law requires and the civil law cannot go beyond it. But the civil law is not the civil law, but in the Christian and in the civil law and from his earthly possessions in support of the government under which he lives; it is his duty to quietly submit trusting his government to manage its own affairs, and remembering that "all things work together for good to those that love God." Non-resistance is the rule of the Christian life. The Christian must not take the law to do wrong, but he can suffer one will not do a wrong for him. His attitude is told by scripture: "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain." And it is, when he is bidden or your faults ye shall take it patiently? "but if when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God." And from these considerations it becomes clear that for a Christian to insist on religious liberty, or the rights of conscience before Christ and before men, is unjust as an assault, that rebellion.

But while the Christian is to yield to the oppressor, recognizing the validity of the civil law requires, and this the contention is, that it is not for the civil law to do that which is God's. The divine mandate is that all men shall have full and free right. And neither the thirteenth chapter of Romans nor any other scripture justifies that in any degree. The whole subject of that chapter of scripture is the duty of Christian's duty to render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's is one thing; and what things are Cæsar's dictated by civil authority, and nothing else.
