When Christ made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, it was amid the acclamations and hosannas of the multitudes who thronged about him, who, contrary to what he had been teaching them, mistook this as the first step in his assumption of temporal power on earth. Chiefest among those who hailed him with shouts of joy were his own disciples. Doomed to disappointment on account of their unbelief that his kingdom was not of this world, they cast their garments and branches of palm-trees in the way before him, as an expression of their delight at the ushering in of the new sovereignty and the crowning of the new ruler; and this, notwithstanding the fact that Christ, but a short time before, had foretold his humiliation and death. Unbelief caused the fatal error, the result of which was the denial of Him who had come to be their Saviour, and who alone could save them. How much this mistake of his most intimate followers, and the knowledge of the outcome of their attitude toward him, must have increased the agony of the Saviour as he halted a moment on the height overlooking Jerusalem, and wept over her folly, none but he can know. What anguish must have filled his soul as he saw those for whom he had given all,—and this soon to be sealed by his own blood,—those who were nominally his own people, taking a course that would result in their rejecting him wholly.

This event was placed on record for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come. What is the lesson to be learned? Is there anything transpiring now just before Christ's second advent, similar to those experiences in his first advent? Are any of his professed followers now heralding him as temporal ruler, as King of nations? There is a class of people into the title of whose chief organ the "Christian" (Christ-like) enters, thus showing them to be professing Christ. One of their loudest rallying cries is, "The King of kings will be exalted in our land to the throne." The other part of the name of this organ is "Statesman;" and so their scheme is to make Christ the great Christian statesman in a kingdom of this world, in spite of his own declaration that his kingdom is not of this world—just exactly as his followers into Jerusalem attempted to do. And those who are attempting this work now will fail just as surely and just as miserably as did those who attempted it back there. Those back there proclaimed Christ temporal king right in the face of his statement that his kingdom was not of this world; and in doing so, quoted in support of their position the very scripture (Matt. 21: 9; Luke 19: 38) that Christ had used but a short time before (Luke 13: 35) in reference to his future kingdom; "Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord." And so those who are now proclaiming him King of nations quote in support a scripture which plainly refers to Christ's future kingdom (see *Christian Statesman*, of Aug. 5): "The kingdoms of the world will be [the text reads "are become"] the kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ."

Why did those back there reject Christ? —Because they did not believe the Scriptures which said that he would be "despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;" and then went right on and despised and rejected him because he did not come in the way they had laid out for him to come. But no more bitter was their disappointment when he did not assume temporal power and exalt himself and them before the eyes of the world, instead of remaining the meek and lowly Jesus that he was, who had come to be their Saviour and to exalt them in due time, than will be that of those who are now attempting to make him "King of nations," instead of receiving him as their personal Saviour from sin.

Another thing further identifying the work of those now trying to exalt Christ to the kingship of the nations, is the language with which they greet their king-elect. While in Christ's time they cried "Hosanna to the son of David, Hosanna in the highest," their duplicates are now crying, "Hallelujah! the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth" (*Christian Statesman*, July 22). And just as the end of that joy back there was heaviness, so the end of this joy down here will be as "bitter as wormwood."

The Jews rejected the One who was the true Christ, because he did not come with the pomp and grandeur they supposed he would, and did not establish himself as temporal ruler, as they were expecting. But after they rejected him there is no record that they set up another for king and called him Christ. Here is where it will be lamentably worse when the professed followers of Christ now not only reject Christ, but set up another power which they call Christ. And they will have such evidences, to them, that this power is Christ, that if they do not diligently search the Scriptures, and know what is coming in these last days, they will be grossly deceived. If Christ's kingdom is not of this world, as he himself expressly declares, then there is but one other power that could be set up, that which is of the world, Satan's; for these two powers are the competing ones. What a deadly delusion it will be when Satan is mistaken for Christ, and obeyed as Christ. He will never want better vantage ground, and, sad to say, he is gaining it only too rapidly.

But what was the result, politically, of the Jews rejecting Christ?—The accomplishment of all the destruction foretold by Christ in regard to Jerusalem, and the demolishing of the whole nation as a nation. Their glory and power as a nation were lost, never to be regained. And precisely the same course is pursued, only the crash will be as many times greater, as this Nation has attained greater glory and power than that.
