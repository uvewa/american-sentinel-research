WHAT is tolerance? What is tolerant? What is the insane feeling behind the thought of tolerance? What is the mental state behind the express act of tolerance? Are these words expressive of Christian principle, or worthy Christianity?

Tolerance is endurance, or capacity of endurance, of that which is offensive to others; the sufferance of the presence or existence of, that, or of those, which, in the exercise of this special power, or assumed virtue, of tolerance, would be injured and nonexistent. It presupposes that by whom this capacity or virtue is exercised through superior strength, either spiritual or physical, has also its absolute, tolerated, or tolerant-ed presence of that, or of those, which would be otherwise harmless.

Tolerance then is of a not getting into practice this assumption of superiority. Yet, tolerance is patience, not action, simply preventing tyranny from going to venture. It stands a hint, but always carried by the thought behind itself, that it would be better if those things did not exist which call for the exercise of the Christian(?) or, toleration assumes that through its intellectual intentions those things are permitted, for the suppression of which both the natural right and the power exist, and are in the possession of the tolerating agent, though unused.

In order to realize the proportions of the insane feeling of tolerancy, it is necessary that there should be prevalent an insane feeling of superiority, and in religious matters a Pharisaical sense of being holier than the tolerated. The primary feeling, then, is that of the superior to an inferior, and not only to one who is inferior but an inferior possessing a quality, not only unlovable and disagreeable but very likely to be, in greater or lesser measure, dangerous. The insane feeling, therefore, behind the thought of tolerance, in religion, is one of unmistakable Pharisaism.

Where the capacity for tolerance has reached its expression in the exercise of tolerating; when the tolerant religious body has by sufferance permitted the existence and observance of some other creed than its own, the mental state of the full-blown Pharisee has been reached. There is the perfect feeling of superiority combined with the haughty spirit which is developed through the exercise of that superiority,—mingled with, what is the necessary accompaniment of haughtiness, contempt for the inferior. Such is a condition of mind and this is monstrous hypocrisy. In order to maintain the assumption which this has been made, virtues which are not possessed must be assumed, and the commoner flavor of the highest and most common hypocrisy is reached. In that expression the mental state of the religious who professes tolerance is summed up,—hypocrisy. So galling self-assumed is this hypocrisy that it is wont to flaunt itself as the sublimest and highest virtue of those individuals who profess its forms of so-called Christianity, and of those peoples who possess what it calls "Christian civilization."

These two words express Christian civilization? Are the sentiments which they embody such as characterize Christian civilization as a civilization of Christian principles and sentiments held by a false Christianity? They most certainly do. No Christian man will assume to tolerate, or not to tolerate, that is not his place. His place is to carry the message of the gospel to men, whether they receive it or deny it, and leave the rest with God, not bearing to judge lest he himself be judged. He who tolerates his neighbor must presumptuously judge his neighbor, and that is not for the tolerator, nor for any one, not? So Christian will say to his brother, "I am better than thou." He knows that man cannot read the heart and discriminates which requires that the heart of man shall be read is a prerogative of God. Against those who presume to usurp this prerogative the most terrible denunciations of divine wrath are leveled.

Those who exalt themselves, and justify themselves in their own eyes and before men, will surely be abased, for God knows the hearts of all. It is such as these which are described in that scripture which speaks of "certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others." It is one of the first principles of the Christianity which Christ taught to love one's neighbor as oneself; but tolerance and toleration, are words expressive of the very opposite principle,—ostracism and discrimination against one's neighbor.

It is a cardinal principle of biblical Christianity that every soul is in the sight of God, and that he is no respecter of persons, but the doctrine of tolerance supposes that he who tolerates is superior, in the sight of God, to his fellows, and this vain principle but singles him out to be the instrument through which God's will is to be expressed and enforced upon earth. And the expression of tolerance is that this religious self-esteem is in favor so as to be fully possessed of the sovereignty of God upon earth that he is under the seal and signet ring of Divinity and by virtue of delegated omnipotence speaks and acts for God, and among his fellows has the power and authority of God, and of God. He then, who assumes to tolerate, is guilty of the assumption of divine right such as a preacher of the times of God. This is not an expression of Christianity, nor of Christian civilization; but is its great antagonist, the "mystery of iniquity." As fast as the possession of a spirit of toleration and the exercise of toleration is claimed as a virtue, just so fast is a cloak to hide the liberty of which is to follow, when, under the plea that the time has come when "toleration ceases to be a virtue," fanaticism, bigotry and religious prejudice run riot, and he who takes his neighbor's property or his life thinks he does God service.
