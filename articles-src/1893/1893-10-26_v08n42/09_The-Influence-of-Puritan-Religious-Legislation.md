[Continuation of a thesis by T. J. Van Horn of the University of Chicago.]

As we study the legislation of the Puritans, we may better understand it and them, by keeping two or three things in mind.

1st. The age in which Puritanism was born was an age of religious emancipation and of intellectual awakening. The soul was getting free from the tyranny of popes and prelates who had so long kept it bound in the shackles of superstition and error. The mind was just awaking from its long stupor to a consciousness of its own power. "Beware," said Emerson, "when the gods let loose a thinker upon the world." He had reference, no doubt, to strongholds of error being in danger; but the alarm may well be sounded to the defenders of truth also. Beware! men awakening from their slumbers start forth with the strength of giants, but with the indiscretion of children, wielding the weapons of truth, and strike about them in the dazzling light. Tolerance was something unknown to them in their thralldom, and consequently, in their freedom, they knew not how to use it. One is not altogether unprepared, therefore, for what he sees in their religious legislation.

2nd. The Bible was to them a new revelation. They received it from Genesis to Revelation without modification or comment as the very word of God to them. They did not conceive that any part of it was designed for a special people, in a special time, in a certain stage of development. The law for the witch and the Sabbath-breaker in Moses' time was the law for that same class of sinners in their time. The popish church was the antichrist. The defeat of the Spanish armada was to them very much as the tumbling of the walls of Jericho. It was a vindication to them of the righteousness of their cause, and their work henceforth was to rid the world of Romanism and its associated evils, as much as it was Joshua's work to rid the Promised Land of the Canaanites, and the sword was just as legitimate an instrument for that work.

3rd. As to religious intolerance in their colonial history, it should be remembered that they came to America to secure freedom in worship for themselves, according to their standard of right, which privilege had been denied them in their mother land. "We separate not from the Church of England but from its corruption. We came away from the common prayer and ceremonies in our native land where we suffered much for non-conformity, in this place of liberty we cannot, we will not, use them. Their imposition would be a sinful violation of the worship of God." This remark, made when the Brownes, prelatical sympathizers, were sent back to England for refusing to abandon the prayer-book, reveals their real purpose and attitude.

While these considerations do not excuse the errors which mar the Puritan chapter of history, yet it will enable us to be more charitable as we enter upon a brief examination of some of their religious enactments. This done, the question of their influence will have been, at least, partially answered.

For maintaining their ideal theocratic state in its purity, various measures were from time to time adopted. These were intended to secure, first, purity of faith among themselves; and secondly, to prevent the formation of sects and churches which might endanger the unity of the government. 1st—Let us consider some of those enactments having in view the first-named purpose.

In Chapter 51, sec. 1, of the Charters and Laws of Massachusetts Bay Colony, I find the following, enacted in 1646, which I quote in full:—

> Although no human power be Lord over the faith and consciences of men, yet because such as bring in damnable heroics, tending to the subversion of the Christian faith and destruction of the souls of men, ought duly to be restrained from such notorious impisties. It is, therefore, ordered and declared by the court, that if any Christian within this jurisdiction shall go about to subvert and destroy the Christian faith and religion, by broaching and maintaining any damnable heroics; as denying the immortality of the soul, or resurrection of the body, or any sin to be repented of in the regenerate, or any evil done by the outward man to be accounted sin, or denying that Christ gave himself a ransom for our sins, or shall affirm that we are not justified by his death and righteousness, but by the perfections of our own works; or shall deny the morality of the fourth commandment, or shall openly condemn or oppose the baptising of infants, or shall purposely depart the congregation at the administration of that ordinance, or shall deny the ordinance of the magistracy, or their lawful authority, to make war, or to punish the outward breaches of the first table, or shall endeavor to induce others to any of the heroics above mentioned: Every such person continuing obstinate therein, after due means of conviction, shall be sentenced to banishment.

In the following section of the same chapter, the maximum limit of the penalty for denying "either by word or by writing" any of the books of the received canon "to be the written and infallible word of God" on the part of any person, above sixteen years, professing the Christian religion, and "belonging to this jurisdiction," was fined at fifty pounds or "forty strokes." It was further enacted that "if the said offender after his recantation, sentence or execution shall the second time publish, and obstinately and pertinaciously maintain the same wicked opinion, he shall be banished or put to death as the court shall judge."

Section 13 of this chapter decreed that—

> If any Christian within this jurisdiction shall go about to subvert and destroy the Christian faith and religion, by broaching and maintaining any damnable horsey, he shall pay twenty shillings a month for the first six months and forty shillings a month for the next six months, and so continue through his obstinacy.

For trying to seduce any other person to the like heresy he was fined five pounds.

2nd. Let us next consider some of those laws enacted to prevent the growth of what were regarded as dangerous sects. These were especially severe against Quakers. Anabaptists were punished under the general laws against heresy.

The opening clause of Section 4, chapter 51, I quote as best explaining the temper of these laws:—

> Whereas there is a cursed sect of heretics lately risen up in this world, which are commonly called Quakers, who take upon them to be immediately sent of God, and infallibly assisted by the Spirit, to speak and write blasphemous opinions, despising government, and the order of God in church and commonwealth, speaking evil of dignities, reproaching and reviling magistrates and ministers, seeking to turn the people from the faith, and gain proselytes to their pernicious ways. The court considering the premises, and to prevent the like mischief, as by their means is wrought in our native land.

The enactments under this clause prohibited the importation of Quakers or "any other blasphemous hereticks" under penalty of one hundred pounds; the entertainment of Quakers under penalty of "forty shillings for every hour's entertainment or concealment." It cost any person ten shillings to defend or encourage, by speaking or writing, "their pernicious ways," and every one speaking in a Quaker meeting was fined five pounds. Penalties and restrictions were increased until they were banished under pain of death. Under this law four persons who persistently returned contrary to orders were executed.* Vagabond Quakers were tied to a cart's tail, the upper half of the body laid bare, and whipped through the streets of different towns.†

The authorities, after the execution of the four persons above referred to, seeing the utter futility of trying to keep them out of the colony by such harsh measures, repealed corporal punishment and the death penalty against them; but soon re-enacted the law against vagabond Quakers.

Most jealously every encroachment upon the unity of faith and practice of the churches was guarded.

Statutes providing for an able ministry: for their support by taxation of all, whether church members or not; for the regular attendance upon the administration of the Word: for the deposition of unworthy ministers, were enacted one imposing a fine of forty shillings a month "as long as he shall continue in his obstinacy," upon every Christian who should go about openly renouncing his church membership or the ministry or other ordinances upon any "groundless conceit" as enacted in 1646.§ As late as 1679 they thought it necessary to prohibit by statute the building without permission of the free men of the town, of new meetinghouses which might perpetuate divisions and weaken "such places where they dwell, in the comfortable support of the ministry orderly settled amongst them."

3rd. The relation of Church to State was a peculiar one. The two following sections may illustrate this relation:—

> It is further ordered, that no person being a member of any church which shall be gathered without the approbation of the magistrates and the said churches, shall be admitted to the freedom of the commonwealth.† The civil authority here established hath power and liberty to see the peace, ordinances and rules of Christ be observed in every church according to his word: as to deal with any church member in a way of civil justice, notwithstanding any church relation, office or interest.

It thus appears to have been a State within a Church rather than a union of State and Church. The State, although within, threw its protecting arms over the Church. With the limitation of franchise to church members, the supremacy of the State could be acknowledged with no danger from without to the Church.

This subordination of the Church to the State was an important principle with the Puritans, and was nominally secured by the final clause of Section 10, "But no church censure shall degrade or depose any man from any civil dignity, office or authority he shall have in the commonwealth." Yet their intention was, as will be seen by these enactments, to keep the State, in a very important sense, subordinate to the Church. This policy involved endless complications and inconsistencies which, from its very nature, could not be avoided.

4th. By far, most of the legislation on religious subjects related to the proper observance of the Lord's day. The copy of "Laws" above referred to, summarily disposes of the subject by the statement that "many acts were passed and revised for the due observation of the Lord's day, too long to be printed at large in this limited edition of the Colony and Province Laws."

Many acts were passed by Plymouth Colony relating to the same matter. One of these prohibited sleeping in church or remaining out doors to play, or jest, on pain of being set in the stocks.* Another imposed a fine of ten shillings or a whipping in default of payment, for doing any servile work on the Lord's day, another a fine of ten shillings "for assembling themselves upon any pretense whatsoever contrary to God and the allowance of the government, tending to the subversion of religion and churches."† Still another requires the payment of twenty shillings or sitting in the stocks four hours, for travelling or bearing burdens upon the Lord's day, to prohibit the sale or giving away of intoxicating liquors on the Lord's day except for medicinal purposes.‡ One, on penalty of payment of twelve pence forbids smoking tobacco on the Lord's day, "going to or coming from the meetings" within two miles of the meeting house.§

In this cursory review of the laws enacted by our Puritan forefathers, it has not been the intention to refer only to the most fantastic or unjust, but to such as are truly representative of this kind of legislation. What shall be our judgment upon it?
