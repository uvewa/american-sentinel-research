An idea which obtained considerable currency in the past year among a certain class of religionists was to the effect that the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, as being the best evidence that the government of the United States, would be the best proof that could be given of the genuineness of "American Christianity;" and that this action would convince the world of its truth, or at least ought to do so, that "this is a Christian Nation."

Most of the readers of the SENTINEL, however, honestly disagree with any such notions; and it would be a good thing for the Nation, if every individual holding to that position could have been brought in question. I am glad to know, that, by attending the World's Congress, it has opened the eyes of thousands of our countrymen to see the light of truth in this matter.

It would seem that, if it were possible for National Reformers to open their eyes to see clearly, such paragraphs as the following, from the secular press, would convince of the nervousness nativity of the ideas for which they so earnestly contend. Under the title of "Observers at a congress," a World's Fair correspondent to the daily press says:—

There is here a chapel which ranks high among the curiosities to be found at the World's Fair to see folks and foreigners; which is, at least, worth curiosity of it is that its seats are filled. As to the rest, and above every European of more northern nationality the seat is that an American is a man of business and chatter, without a sign that the place is any quieter than anywhere else.

It is the same in other places where religion is a matter of observance.

Remark it would be interesting, if this sufficiently indicates "foreign nervousness," is rather natural, and to suggest that irreverence is a national characteristic, just as straws indicate the direction from which the wind is blowing, as such records as these show that the National Reformers, are wrong; and it was the inevitable result of cultivating a spurious Christianity, which the formalities of which are observed, but of which the spirit has fled. W. E. H.

Some speakers like Dr. Brimon and Judge Cook expressed some vigorous opinions most of which were quite as strong as they were vividly perturbed; and the downfall of Christianity was predicted "if the demand for Sunday congress law not recognized law for Sunday was offered, and in no case of it. There are many severe and various elegancy concerning things that are, and that are not." And the tendency of all this is not to be laid at the door of any one State a costly. It is far easier to complain than to correct the evil of these institutions; but it is not difficult this economy which draws the congress together.

Although it is true that the Roman Catholic element in this congress, still the Church in the meeting did not occupy the superior place in this congress, still the position of the Roman Catholic Church, and rather, in fact, treated the movement partially in the one hand of the congress. It was partial for one that the great majority of the Roman Catholic was magisterially represented by several of the promoters of the congress. But the animus of the movement, for it amounts to be from its eligibility to precipitate them in what is really a serious, and dangerous, is in reality, though ignorantly, an organized effort which will fail of its purpose, any who doubt or deny this should read the article on "The Exhibition of American Christianity" in last SENTINEL and as published in this paper.
