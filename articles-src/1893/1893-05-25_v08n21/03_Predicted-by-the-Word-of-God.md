WE are asked to explain why it is that when God himself organized and ruled the children of Israel it would not be an equally good thing to do now. That is easy to say. God has said that there shall be a theocracy no more till He comes whose right it is; and then the dominion will be given to him. It follows that anything claiming to be a theocracy since the passing away of the Jewish theocracy, is a fraud and a usurpation of the divine authority. The government of ancient Israel was a theocracy; and it was really a government of God. At the burning bush, God commissioned Moses to lead his people out of Egypt. By signs and wonders and mighty miracles, God delivered Israel from Egypt, led them through the Red Sea and through the wilderness, and finally into the promised land. There he ruled by judges, to whom "the divine mandate" he revealed his will "until Samuel."

In the days of Samuel, the people asked for a king. The request was granted, but only under earnest protest; the great judge and prophet called upon them to heed and obey the voice of Samuel, and thus of the Lord. "But if ye will have a king over us; that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles." And Samuel told all the words of the people to the Lord. And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people; make them a king. And Samuel said unto the people, Go ye every man unto his city.

And so Saul was chosen, and Samuel anointed him king over Israel. But Saul failed to do the will of God, and he rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord rejected him from being king, and sent Samuel to anoint David king over Israel; and David's house, and David's throne, God established for evermore.

When Solomon succeeded to the kingdom in the place of David his father, the record is: "Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord" as king instead of David his father. 1 Chron. 29:23. David's throne was the throne of the Lord, and Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king over the earthly kingdom of the Lord. When that earthly throne descended in David's line to Zedekiah, he was made subject to the king of Babylon, and perhaps the kingdom might stand. Zedekiah was told by the messenger of God that he would remain a faithful subject of the king of Babylon. His name was Mattaniah at first, and when he was set upon the throne by the king of Babylon changed his name to Zedekiah. Mattaniah gave his hand, and accepted the obligation to be a faithful servant of the king of Babylon, and in so doing made a solemn covenant. Having broken that, he would incur the judgment of God.

Zedekiah did break this covenant, upon which the Lord said: "As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head." And of the kingdom that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. Eze. 17:16.

Being he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape. Therefore, thus saith the Lord God; As I live, surely my oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.

And in recompensing this sin upon the head of Zedekiah the Lord thus said: "I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him." Eze. 21:27.

And he shall sit upon the throne of the Lord God; God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

But this kingdom is not of this world; nor will he sit upon that throne in this world. For when he was here in this world he was not a ruler but "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;" he refused to exercise any earthly authority or office whatever. When appealed to by one in a dispute between two brothers in regard to their inheritance, he replied to the one

who asked him, "Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?" Luke 12:14. And when the people would have taken him and made him a king, he withdrew himself from them and went to the mountains alone. John 6:15. The last night he spent on earth before his crucifixion, and in his last talk with his disciples before he went to his trial, he said: "My kingdom is not of this world." And the throne of the Lord has been removed from this world. And he will not come in this world as king of this world, until, as King of kings and Lord of lords, he whose right it is shall come. And that time is the end of this world and the beginning of the world to come. Then he will restore all things, some of which it will be in order.

To the twelve disciples the Saviour said: "I appoint unto you a kingdom, as My Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes." Luke 22:29, 30. And as to when this shall be, we are informed by the Word in Matthew 19: "In the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Matt. 19:28.

And of his coming in glory, it is stated by another scripture that, "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory; and before him shall be gathered all the nations." Chap. 25:31, 32. By these scriptures and all others upon the subject, it is certain the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of God on earth, is not of this age, but will be overturned until the end of this world. Therefore, while the present world shall stand, a theocracy can never be in it again. From the days of Christ until now, every effort of any nation to set up a theocracy has been in vain.
