THE question of Sunday observance is of to-day in the location of every observation, and is one of the principal matters that concern all civilized governments, wherein that gambling-roller towns and their allies of the world might institute the American Sabbath Union, which, notwithstanding all, was an effort to compel the people to keep the first day of the week instead of the seventh day. But there was no unanimous consent; neither eloquent nor abounding in new thought. It was altogether a display of determination to keep up the agitation. It is true that in some communities the barbers have stood together with a like determination.

What is the meaning of all this? The Dorsett Commissioners and the police are involved in to keep open poor saloons, gambling houses, and other institutions of the National Reform Association, from insulting the rights of conscience. The Catholic Institute and the committee on Catholic Interests. "A nation of Church and State is where the church attempts to seize the civil power, and use the sword to do its bidding."

This is in harmony with our Federal Constitution, and is exactly the principle that the bill for the establishment of religious freedom in Virginia, which has been called the civil-religious Declaration of Independence, and which, like the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson, and is one of the three things to be placed on Jefferson's monument, the other two being the founding of the University of Virginia and the writing of the Declaration of Independence. It is in the twelfth volume of Henning's Statutes at Large, and it is as follows:—

That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.

That although we are well aware that this Assembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding assemblies constituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act to be irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present, or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right.

Concerning this Act as a reply to the Catholic News and to Father O'Gorman. It is a weightiest document than the Declaration of Independence—weightier than the Articles of Confederation—weightier than any other deliverances based in this world since those mighty words in reply to the Pharisees who were uttered: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." In fact, it is the American Constitution put in the mouth of one of the greatest statesmen who has lived in the world since the death of Christ. It ought to be familiar to every American citizen. It ought to be found in the same volume with Prof. Jones' great speech before Congress.

JOHN BRADFORD.
