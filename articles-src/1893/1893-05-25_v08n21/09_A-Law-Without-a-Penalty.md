CONGRESS passed a law closing the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. But the law has no penalty. Hitherto a law in this Nation that Congress has had a legal or civil force. It remains to be seen whether this one closing the Fair will have any force of its kind. There is seemingly a penalty attached to the law which provides against opening on Sunday. But a more than strange spectacle is presented. Some are arguing that if the managers should open the gates on Sunday, Congress would withhold the $2,500,000 appropriation. In other words Congress imposes a fine of $2,500,000 on those that fail to enforce the law, while the common transgressors of our grounds are not carried out. But dissenters from the requirements, certainly need not be alarmed at any trouble about the real penalty that will soon follow. As the Supreme Court has decided that this is a Christian Nation, it was unconstitutional, the penalty prayer has been surrendered to the Catholics, and they can and will manufacture penalty peculiar to suit every emergency and boycott them through, the same as they boycotted the last Congress of the United States. But outside of, and beyond, the penalty to be exacted upon all

those who dissent from such a municipal declaration, there is a penalty which the Nation will pay, namely: the downfall of the whole theory upon which this "Christian Nation" the Nation is dignified, placed itself, lived and prospered until now. All that is, Slavery itself did not divide this Nation. But you may know from the establishment and this most easily achieved this act, the destiny of a nation, a violated the spirit of the Constitution in destroying all power of their "constitution," and the churches and Congress did everything they could to prevent its violation. The result is that Congress and the President, the Supreme Court and all friends of the Constitution together will die in the terrible struggle yet to come. "A kingdom divided against itself can not stand;" the words of Jesus are true, enforcing them as their laws and oath, politics, but his word abideth forever. "The heavens and the earth shall pass away."

The principal Sunday visitors to the World's Fair were from the manufacturing states. Mr. Crafts announced that the Sunday paper should be put under the ban of the law, that a law was being rapidly superseded. He also advised that it be placed under a ban of the civil law. Rev. George Crafts, a companion of Mr. Crafts said he was the walking example, which abstained from a book and newspaper of his colleagues and the printing press.

However, to explain why it was that the Sunday paper should be put under the ban of the law, when, as Mr. Crafts said, it was being rapidly superseded, and under a law now in force and which was accomplishing the ends so devoutly wished by the two missionaries to darkness and Louisville. Why ask for another law when one at least is doing the suppressing so well?

The fact is there is no excuse. If there were a public sentiment demanding the suppression of the Sunday paper in colonial times, out of this bustling age other thing, until the public can be brought to believe the object of attack is harmful; and the Sunday paper is not more harmful than the paper of the other days of the week; neither is the labor of the printer or the Sunday paper harmful, itself, than the labor of the servants of the gentleman of the convention who prepares their comforting and comfortable Sunday dinner.

If these men so bitterly and persistently attack the paper of Monday morning, there might be some show of objection and what they read; yet the Monday paper requires men to stay up, to set up and set up on that day requiring the labor of editors, compositors, reporters, operators, messenger boys, printers, proof-readers, foremen and engineers. Why did the convention neglect to take action on the slavish condition of these men at the time its indolent solicitude was being exercised on behalf of the men who work on Sunday papers and whom they denominated slaves, yet whose work is mostly all done on Saturday? Were they afraid of the Sunday paper? If so, the remedy is with themselves—at least the fault is!—*Kentucky Journal, May 17.*
