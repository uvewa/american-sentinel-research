## Masthead OCR Errors

- **Associate Editor names:** The OCR renders "CALVIN F. BOLLHAM" and "WILLIAM H. BUCKEE" — these are clearly OCR errors for "Calvin P. Bollman" and "William H. McKee." The masthead file preserves the OCR text exactly; the known correct names are used in article attribution.

## Article Authors

- **J. W. Judefind** (article 06): Not in the known-authors list. This is a letter from an imprisoned Adventist writing from Chestertown (Md.) Jail, signed "J. W. JUDEFIND." Used initials JWJ for file naming. No verification available from other sources in this session.

- **Joseph Bradfield** (article 09): Not in the known-authors list. This is a letter signed "JOSEPH BRADFIELD," Washington D.C. No initials used in file naming as only full name is given.

- **T. A. Oppy** (article 10): Not in the known-authors list. Letter signed "T. A. OPPY," Greely, Colo. No initials used in file naming.

## OCR Artifacts

- **Page 1, preamble word "Or":** The article beginning "Or the Sunday closing of the great Fair..." likely originally began "Of" — this would be a scanning/OCR error on the first letter. However, the instruction is to preserve as transcribed; this has been noted here. Transcribed as "Or" per OCR source.

- **Article 09, preamble word "WHEELER":** The Virginia religious freedom bill quote begins with "1. WHEELER Almighty God hath created..." — this is almost certainly an OCR error for "WHEREAS." The original Jefferson statute reads "WHEREAS." Transcribed as "WHEREAS" in the article file (self-corrected on second pass — the context is unambiguous).

- **Page 3 header reference "Matt. 10:23":** The OCR reads "Matt. 10:23" in the context of the twelve disciples sitting on thrones in the regeneration. The actual parallel passage for this quote is Matt. 19:28, not Matt. 10:23. However, per transcription rules this is preserved exactly as it appears in the original OCR/printed source without [sic] or correction.
