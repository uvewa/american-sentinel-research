IT seems probable at this writing that the entire World's Fair will be thrown open to the public on Sunday, owing to the fact that it deprived of all of its possible Sunday gate receipts the enterprise is seen to be a financial failure. Thus far the average daily attendance has been but about 40,000 persons. This is a very discouraging showing, and only goes to suggest reasons above that the average should be far greater.
