THE question of Sunday observance is the question of to-day; and that it is part of history and prophecy no one can deny. In the prophecy of Daniel, beasts of fierce character, and otherwise, are used to show governments of like character. In Rev. 13, the last power or government is shown coming up, having two horns like a lamb, but speaks as a dragon. It makes an image to the beast—the Papacy—and it is to cause the earth and the inhabitants thereof to worship the first beast, or in other words, to acknowledge its authority. The Roman Catholic Church "changed" the Sabbath, and thus fulfilled Dan. 7:25. History agrees with this; and the Catholic Church claims Sunday as a badge of its authority to "command feasts and holy days."

When the World's Fair Sunday-closing measure was before the United States Senate, they deliberately took the fourth commandment and substituted therein the first day for the seventh. Now look for a parallel. On the occasion of the fifty-third anniversary of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association, Rev. Dr. R. C. Matlock, in an earnest address before this body, discussed the observance of Sunday from the standpoint of religion, morality and patriotism. Rev. Dr. J. A. Worden delivered an address on the proposition that it is God's purpose to make America a great Christian Nation to evangelize the world; that America has a special mission to fulfill in the observance of Sunday; and that such observance largely rests upon the individual. He called attention to the fact that some of the European powers had issued Sunday postage stamps in order to get the sentiment of the people regarding Sunday rest. He spoke of the position this country has taken, and of the present opportunity,—the World's Fair in progress, all nations represented,—our country will thus give new life and impetus to the Sunday question all over the world.

Who can doubt that we shall soon see the fulfillment of Rev. 13:12: "And causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast," or acknowledge his authority?

The ministers and the religious sentiment are the direct agencies in this movement. The Apostle Paul says, "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free." Gal. 5:1. "Why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?" I Cor. 10:29. Where is the Spirit of Christ in this Sunday law? In John 13:34, 35 a new commandment is given, which is quoted by our Sunday friends as showing the old not binding. It is, "That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples." If we take the Bible as our standard, (and all Sunday advocates profess to) and measure their Sunday enforcement by it, not many disciples will be known by any man.

It can not be the love of Christ that constraineth us to force our neighbor's conscience. Whose love is it? A description of this spirit is found in Rom. 10:2, 3. "For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, for they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God." "For all thy commandments are righteousness." Psa. 119:172. Solomon says: "I know that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever; nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God doeth it that men should fear before him." Eccl. 3:14.

Some say that the seventh day can not be the true Sabbath because so few keep it. Look at the words of our Saviour in Luke 12:32—a "little flock" only. Only eight rode safely through the flood, in the ark. The Lord asks if he shall find faith on the earth when he comes. Luke 18:8. In speaking of the Judgment, he bids us remember Lot's wife; for one single act of disobedience—looking back—she was turned to a pillar of salt. He gave the Sabbath as an everlasting memorial of creation and commands us to keep it holy. He will accept no substitute for it. He says: "To obey is better than sacrifice." 1 Sam. 15:22.

Christ says: "Tell ye the daughter of Zion, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass." Matt. 21:5. Christians claim to be of Zion. How about the meekness? Some are pushing toward the kingdom with the power of the dragon, eager to execute judgment in matters of conscience, which is God's right. For even Christ himself said, "I came not to judge the world but to save the world." Wait, my brother, God's time.
