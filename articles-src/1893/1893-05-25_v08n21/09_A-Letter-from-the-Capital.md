408 Mass. Ave., N. W.

Washington, D. C., May 14, 1893.

AMERICAN SENTINEL: By an accident for which I shall be forever thankful I recently came into possession of the argument of Prof. A. T. Jones, delivered before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor in 1888, on the cover of which I find some information respecting the aims and principles of the AMERICAN SENTINEL. I read this argument very carefully, and am persuaded that it is the most masterly defense of the Christian religion and the American Constitution ever set forth. Hence I write to you at this time.

In an address delivered recently, near this city by the Rev. Father Thomas O'Gorman, of the Catholic University of America, at the laying of the corner stone of Carroll Chapel, by His Eminence, Cardinal Gibbons, the orator, referring to the subject of temporal support for the ecclesiastical power, said: "I do not mean to say that such aid and support from the civil powers are unworthy of them or of the Church. To them, it is a glory and a duty; to her, it is an homage and a right." This address is published in the *Church News*, of May 13, 1893; and in the editorial columns of the same respectable journal I find the following:—

Washington has once more been disgraced by the barangues of a so-called converted priest who, in imitation of low variety performances, flooded the streets with obscene dodgers. One of these blasphemous advertisements being shown to the president of the Carroll Institute, Mr. Ed. J. Hanner, that gentleman and Mr. M. I. Weller, chairman of the committee on Catholic interests, called on the District Commissioners to protest against permission being granted for the vile lecture, the character of which was indicated by the dodger.

In another editorial on the same subject, the editor says:—

The sudden appearance of these disreputable scoundrels in so many cities shows a preconcerted movement on the part of the A. P. A., and we may expect that the nuisance will continue until it be suppressed by the police authorities, as other nuisances and obscene performances are prohibited.

What is the meaning of all this? The District Commissioners and the police are invoked to keep some poor ex-priest, hired, as is intimated, by the American Protestant Association, from insulting and disturbing the authorities of Carroll Institute and the committee on Catholic interests. But let me quote from Prof. Jones' speech: "A union of Church and State is where the ecclesiastical power controls the civil power, and uses the civil power in its own interests."

This is in harmony with our Federal Constitution. Now, that Constitution is the fruit of Protestantism and is exactly in line with the bill for establishing religious freedom in Virginia, which has been called the civil definition of Protestantism. It was written by Thomas Jefferson, and is one of the three things mentioned in the inscription on his tomb; the other two being the founding of the University of Virginia and the writing of the Declaration of Independence. It is in the twelfth volume of Hening's Statutes at Large, and is as follows:—

1. WHEREAS Almighty God hath created the mind free—that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion who, being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as it was in his almighty power to do.

That the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them upon others, has established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world and through all time.

That to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagations of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.

That even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness; and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporary rewards which, proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct, is an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labor for the instruction of mankind.

That our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry, and therefore the prescribing of any citizen as unworthy of public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow-citizens he has a natural right, and that it tends only to corrupt the principles of that religion which it is meant to encourage, by bribing with a monopoly of worldly honors and emoluments those who will externally profess and conform to it; and while indeed those are criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet neither are those guiltless who lay the bait in their way.

That to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency is a dangerous fallacy which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he, being of course judge of that tendency, will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own; and it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order.

And finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to itself; that it is the proper and sufficient antagonist of error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of its natural weapons, free argument and debate—errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them.

2. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion; and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.

3. And though we well know that this Assembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding assemblies constituted with powers equal to our own; and that therefore to declare this act to be irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare that the rights hereby asserted are among the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present, or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right.

I submit this Act as a reply to the *Church News* and to Father O'Gorman. It is a weightier document than the Declaration of Independence—weightier than the Augsburg Confession—weightier than any other deliverance heard in this world since those mighty words in reply to the Pharisees were uttered: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things which are God's." In fact, it is the American interpretation of the words of Christ by the greatest statesman who has lived in the world since the death of Christ. It ought to be familiar to every American citizen. It ought to be bound up in the same volume with Prof. Jones' great speech and scattered broadcast.

JOSEPH BRADFIELD.
