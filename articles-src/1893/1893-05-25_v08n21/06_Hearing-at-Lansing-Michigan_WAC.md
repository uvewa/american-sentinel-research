A SECOND hearing was granted upon the bill for a more stringent Sunday law introduced in the Michigan legislature, and also upon a barber bill. The hearing was before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on the evening of May 8, upon the following bill:

SECTION 1. That it shall not be lawful for any person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of shaving, cutting or dressing hair, or performing the duties of a barber, to carry on or engage in any part of said business on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

SECTION 2. And it further shall not be lawful for any barber shop or place where the business of hair cutting, shaving, hair dressing, etc., is carried on, to be kept open for the transaction of business on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday (except when it is for business for a deceased person). Provided, that any person who conscientiously observes the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, and the first day of the week should be observed as the Sabbath, shall not be liable to the provisions of this act.

SECTION 3. Every person offending against the provisions of the foregoing sections of this act, shall be punished by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $50, or by confinement in the county jail for a term of not more than sixty days, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.

This bill had its origin in a barber's petition.

The same bill, with slight modification, was about this time introduced in the House, by a vote of 64 to 7 was passed. Coming into the Senate, it was referred to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, and a hearing granted upon it before this committee. The hearing was held in the open Senate chamber, and lasted from eight o'clock in the evening until nearly midnight. Not less than one hundred persons were present. Notwithstanding the House was in session that evening until a late hour, so much interest was manifested in the proceedings going on in the Senate chamber upon the barber bill that a number of representatives left the proceeding in the House to come in and listen to or take part in, the discussion at the hearing.

A number of Senators, Senator McKinley and Representative Bickwell appeared in favor of the bill. Prof. C. B. Field and the writer spoke in opposition to it. The moral arguments in favor of the bill were made, that the barbers were "forced" to labor on Sunday, their customers demanding it; and that if a law was passed compelling them to close on Sunday, they would lose their positions and some trade, or some barber who did not care for the commandments would get the patronage. Some of the trade they thought they were entitled to. Senator McKinley even went so far as to declare that if it were not for Sunday laws men could not rest, and without them there would be seen no church steeples pointing heavenward and "kissing the blue-tinged clouds."

Against this and all other such arguments the following arguments, in brief, were offered:

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: When the Sunday-closing measure was before the United States Senate the fourth commandment was the foundation of the case; and it is found in religious statutes.

Senator Peffer said:—

To-day we are engaged in a theological discussion about religion.

And Senator Quay sent the Bible to the speaker's desk to have the fourth commandment read. In like manner, at the hearing on the bill above mentioned, Senator McMillan, the chairman of the committee before whom the hearing was held, opened the Bible and read the fourth commandment as the foundation for the passage of the measure for the closing of barbershops. The facts are:

1. The Bible is a religious book and the fourth commandment is a religious commandment.

2. Religious legislation is un-American. The United States was founded on a new order of things; not as the older nations, on the domination that the Lord divided the human race into two classes, one to govern and the other to be ruled and enjoy their rights; but upon the proposition that all men are created equal, and the security of the people, and the equality of all before the law.

3. Such legislation is not only unnecessary, it is wrong.

"If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world but to save the world." If he had told man to observe the first day of the week as the Sabbath, a man by observing the seventh day would in this life commit sin by working on the first day, the Sabbath, or for not keeping it. And yet, some desire to have Congress and State legislatures step in and not only command but compel. Christ never commanded any man to observe the first day for observing not the first day of the week and not what he had commanded.

Furthermore, Paul says, "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin." Rom. 14:23. Sunday laws then, whether made for barbers or any other class, are always enacted to compel somebody to keep Sunday who does not believe in keeping it, or who has no faith in it.

No. 3, entitled, "Saturday or Sunday laws," makes the following broad, plain, and fatal confession:—

"If any respond and show—'We are not familiar with these inferences and arguments,—allow us, when but the day of rest is selected for us, to believe what we see as a direct and positive command of God.' We assert it is."

Such was in brief the line of argument presented at the hearing.

In response to Mr. McMillan's statement that were it not for Sunday laws men could not exist, and there would be no churches pointing heavenward and "kissing the clouds," the gentleman was asked how it was that man existed before Constantine's Sunday law of 321 A. D., which history tells us was the first Sunday law, either ecclesiastical or civil, that the world ever saw, and how it is that California has never had any Sunday law, and yet notwithstanding the fact that State has in this period grown from an insignificant community to a prosperous State, with churches and steeples and Sabbath keeping. Several other questions of interest came up, and questions were asked, but time was taken from the other side.

W. A. COLCORD.
