In an editorial article written during the first week of the World's Fair, the Chicago Herald says:—

If the directors will listen to the protests voiced last Sunday in the vast multitude that sought admission, and in the rather scant attendance week days up to this time, they will open the gates of Jackson park next Sunday and every Sunday thereafter. Give Congress back its paltry appropriation and let the American people rule the Columbian Exposition. It belongs to them.

It is certain that Congress was outside its legitimate sphere of legislation when it passed the Sunday-closing proviso. Congress of course has a right to affix conditions to appropriations which it may make, but it has no right to attach any religious condition or test to any legislative act. This Sunday closing was a religious condition, it affixed a test of the performance of a stated religious form as the condition precedent to acceptance of an appropriation. This test Congress had no right to establish, and if Congress had no right to make it, the National Commission and the Local Directory could not properly accept it. If they did accept it, that would not cure the fatal defect of unconstitutionality in the original act. The Directory of the World's Fair and the National Commission were not gifted with supreme legislative capacity by which they could render bad law good law, and make constitutional that which was unconstitutional—what the supreme law of the land, by which all legislative acts must be corrected and adjusted, rendered invalid and ineffective—that no private corporation, or creature of Congress, could render valid or effective. Congress passed, and the President of the United States signed, an act which was constitutionally invalid. The World's Fair authorities formally promised to obey the unlawful requirement, and lastly, due obedience was rendered. But had all this any effect to annul the phrase of the Constitution which says that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"? Certainly not. If that clause of the Constitution was in force when Congress passed the Sunday-closing proviso, it is in force now. However, this was not the first step. The three possible stages of legislative discrimination, in religion, asserted in the convention which adopted the Virginia "Declaration of Rights," as the logical progress of religious legislation, have been consecutively reached.

The Supreme Court has given a judicial preference to Christianity in this country. Congress has discriminated in favor of a certain body of Christians—the World's Fair authorities have enforced the discrimination. This is the complete judicial, legislative, and executive series. Because the Commission and the Directory have consummated the judicial theory and the legislative mandate by the executive act, it does not of necessity follow that the theory was correct and the whole series sound. On the contrary deductions from an unsound premise must necessarily be unsound. In this case the theory being false, the entire series fails. As a matter of charity, and what, in many business circles, would be thought an unnecessary refinement of conscience, the World's Fair authorities might kindly refund the $2,500,000 granted them with a proviso attached which was void from the beginning, but they could not necessarily be compelled so to do.

Congress has trifled with this matter in the most pitiful manner. It passed legislation which many did know and all should have known, was forbidden to it. Then, too weakly proud to acknowledge an error, and too politically timid to take any course to undo its effects, it subsequently diverted a portion of its gift, with the intent, probably, on the part of certain ones at least, to raise a question as to whether or no Congress had not, by breaking faith, released the Fair from its acceptance of the proviso, because the proviso was accepted as to the whole, and not as to a portion.

When the supreme law-making power of the country can be influenced to such things in the face of the earnest warnings from its own statesmen, spread upon the pages of its own early records, how can it be said that the American people still rule? And what, now, belongs to them?
