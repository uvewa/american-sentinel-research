TRUE question of Sunday observance is the question of to-day; and that it is part of religion and prophecy so not one day. In the prophecy of Daniel, beasts of fierce character, and also one, no small, was given governments of like character. In Rev. 13, another beast is brought to view, having two horns like a lamb; it causes the earth and its inhabitants thereof to worship the first beast, and the worship of the world, to acknowledge his authority; to keep the Sabbath, and thus fulfilled Dan. 7:25. Do Adventists not justly accuse—the old church claims Sunday as a badge of its power, the Protestants by keeping it acknowledge her power.

The World's Fair Sunday-closing measure was before the United States Senate, in which this fourth commandment and established therein the authority and the course of the Sunday Sabbath. Dr. Mallock, in an earnest address before this body, stood from the standpoint of religion, morality and safety. He delivered an address on the proposition that in order to show the United States to be a great Christian Nation, to evangelize the world and to be consistent, we ought not to fail in the observance of Sunday, all the more so as a Christian Nation and that the obligation rests upon the individual. He called for a Christian law of Sunday closing. The European powers had mostly refused to recognize freedom in the observance of Sunday, it was asserted. He spoke of the position of the United States and its relation to the other nations respecting religion,—the World's Fair in progress, all the nations of the earth gathering to give new life and impetus to the Sunday and keep the fourth commandment as the Christian Sabbath.

Who can doubt that we shall soon see the end of these things which will first consume the earth and then those that dwell therein?

When his vantage point was gained, then came the cry of "monarchists" against those who resisted the encroachment. That almost always is true, for as it is now appearing in this land of ours. Thus things went on till the time for opening shall arrive, and then will be the test—that in spite of everything, these gates would be opened on the first day, showing the masses, and on the other hand, an uprising of indignation against it, by political leaders. But when the ruling authorities backed down before everybody and everything, even to one of its own members, it was perfectly plain to all.

The enforcement of the Sunday Sabbath law, the ever-predominant religious authority contrary to the principle of the separation of Church and State.

Rev. Thomas F. Cashman, a Catholic clergyman, who was in Chicago at the time, of April 3, 1893, well observed:

The petition of concern to so many of the great things in this world as to the religious part of them. If the best people of these United States would control themselves to be controlled by the civil laws of their country, and their obedience to religious obligation, from their old every day of civil duty.

The passage of such bills as this. The barbers stood no more in need of such legislation for their own protection. No one objects. They all rest on Sunday by all means. One of the barbers stated that what they desired was the opening, as to shave or not to shave. It was decided in favor of Sunday. There is nothing so unpopular as that which makes one, and surely nothing would be so ridiculous. At this moment Sunday-keepers, as a class, were no more temperate than seventh-day keepers. I was shocked to see so much Sunday class legislation, and only one thing surprised me. The next test will allow certain things, as others rest.

In an address delivered recently, near New York City, by the Rev. Thomas J. O'Gorman, of the Catholic University of America, formerly professor of the Carroll Chapel, by His Eminence, Cardinal Gibbons, the professor spoke on the subject of temporal support for the Church. Among other things he said that such an interference with civil powers are unworthy of them or of it.

And Luther, the great champion of the Reformation, was not less emphatic.

I would not resort to force in defense of the Gospel. I have been opposed to those who never tolerant on his view, and by force the Sabbath will never be sustained.

We pledge, therefore, our obedience to the Commandments of God, and those who enforce them as their Lord and Master.

command of God. "For all his commandments are righteousness." Psa. 119:172. Solomon says: "I know that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever; nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God doeth it that men should fear before him." Eccl. 3:14.

Some say that the seventh day can not be the true Sabbath because so few keep it. Are the words of our Saviour in Luke 13:23—a "little flock"—only because he made them through the flood; of faith on the earth when he comes. Luke 18:8. Remember Lot's wife; for she was a representation of this world when she was turned to a pillar of salt. The Sabbath as an everlasting memorial of creation commands us to keep it holy. He will so, and what is our duty? "To obey is better than sacrifice."

Christ says: "Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass." Some are pushing forward the time. And these claims are being brought to bear on the state to exercise judgment in matters of religious belief. It is a serious matter, and even Christ himself said, "I came not to judge the world but to save the world."
