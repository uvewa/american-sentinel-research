WILBUR F. CRAFTS, and the so-called Christian allies, are in earnest to see that the Fair is not opened on Sunday. Nearly all are aroused, and will use all the energies of the Columbian Exposition on the President to order United States troops to Chicago to enforce the Sunday closing. This is the last step. Let us hope that this gigantic combination for establishing the Church and State is ready to go to its last undertaking.
