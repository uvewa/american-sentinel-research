IN an editorial article written during last week of the World's Fair, the *Exposition Enquirer* further developed the principles of the subject.

Those who know to the persons voiced surprise, but in the rather exact sentiments was an echo from the person speaking.— Congress took a decidedly aggressive step beyond its legitimate sphere of legislation when it passed the Sunday-closing proviso. Congress of course has a right to affix conditions to appropriations which it may make, but it has no right to attach any religious condition or test to any legislation. This Sunday closing was a religious condition, it affixed to the appropriation bill for the World's Fair, and the condition precedent to acceptance of an appropriation was congressional. It had no right to establish, and if Congress had no right to establish it, the National Commission and the Local Directory could not properly accept it. If they did accept it, that would not cure the fatal defect of unconstitutionality in the original act. The Directory of the National Commission were not clothed with supreme legislative capacity by which they could breathe into bad law, and make constitutional that which was unconstitutional from the beginning. The law of the land, by which all legislative acts repugnant to the Constitution shall be dead invalid and ineffective—that no private acceptance, or reasons of two Congresses, could render valid or effective. Congress passed, and the President of the United States signed, an act which was constitutionally invalid. The World's Fair authorities formally promised to obey the act—whatever unreasonable and invalid; this obedience was rendered. But had all this sanctity of act upon the phrase of the Constitution which says that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion?" Did the acceptance make it valid? Certainly not. If that clause meant anything; and it does; the fact is, when Congress passed the Sunday-closing proviso, it was in force then. Besides, the act was not the first step. The three positive tests of religious discrimination, in religion, asserted in the convention which adopted the Virginia "Declaration of Rights" as the logical progress of religious legislation, have been reached one by one.

The Supreme Court has given a judicial precedent as the Christian nation, and Congress has discriminated in favor of a particular sect, and the World's Fair authorities have enforced the discrimination against religious objectors, individuals, and executive arms. Before the Continental and the Congress of 1789 commanded the judicial theory and the legislation mandate the exception, it does not of necessity follow that the theory was correct and full which was acted upon. On the contrary deductions from an assumed wrong principle may more than be unsound. In this case the theory being false, the entire series falls. As a multiplication of error, while, in a mathematical series, would be thought so invalid.

World's Fair authorities might kindly deal with this matter in the most judicial manner. It passed legislation which many if not all of those who should have known, was forbidden to it. The World's Fair management may have made an error, and too politically timid to take their own course of action. Whether or no Congress had not, by the unconstitutional act, forfeited its acceptance of the proviso, because the proviso was accepted so far as the whole, that as to a portion.

When the supreme law-making power of the country can be influenced to such things to the face of the national sovereignty from its own statesmen, rested upon the groves of its own early roots, before now, it is well said that the Almighty his position or rule! And with what now, belongs to them?

That best security for the Sabbath is not a civil law, but the holy observance by those who love its great Founder. Let our example demonstrate that moral sentiment is the community which is more powerful than anything else for the preservation of the Sabbath.
