THE charge of a "civil" character. This is the same method adopted by the authorities of Tennessee and Maryland in dealing with Seventh-day Adventists. They are openly proceeded against for being Adventists, but upon the pretext that they are inimical to the peace and quiet of the community, and that their practice of doing mortal work and business on Sunday is subversive of good morals. Bigotry in America does not differ much from the same wicked thing in Russia.
