LAST we we gave, at some length, evidence showing that the Adventists who have been imprisoned in Tennessee and Maryland for violation of the Sunday laws of those States, hold not only that the fourth commandment enjoins strict observance from labor on the seventh day of the week, but that it also forbids a like observance of *any other day*; and that for this reason, and for this reason only, they *refuse* themselves to *improprieties* in working on the first day of the week.

On another page of this paper is an article written by one of these men to his faith which fairly lays out the statements which we made last week.

As will be seen by reading the article referred to, found on page 165, the imprisoned Adventists hold that the Roman Catholic Church, the Papacy, is the persecuting power described in Dan. 7:25, 26, and parallel texts, and that the institution of Sunday is the key to the Commandment in Dan. 7:25. Dr. Albert Barnes says: "Can any one doubt that this is true of the Papacy? . . . Has not this, the slightest acquaintance with the history of the Papacy will convince any one, that what is here said of making 'war with the saints' (verse 21), and 'wearing out the saints of the Most High' (verse 25) is strictly applicable to that power, and will accurately describe its history."

This is the view generally entertained by Protestants, not only of the application of Dan. 7:25, but of many other scriptures. But this feature of the prophecy is very generally overlooked. Dan. 7:25 should "speak great words against the Most High," and "wear out the saints of the Most High," but also that he should "think to change times and laws," evidently of the Most High. This prophecy, the Adventists believe, is fulfilled in the change of the Sabbath, by the Papacy. And as above has been set forth by quotations from Catholic catechisms, the Roman Church herself acknowledges the change, and appeals to that fact, and the acquiescence of Protestants in the change, as proof of the power to establish feasts and holy days and to command their observance under sin.

That the Sabbath has been changed so far as it is possible for men to change that which God has established, all are agreed; but when it comes to stating the reason and manner of the change, there is not the same unanimity of sentiment. Seventh-day Adventists believe, and have always believed and so stated it that it was not made by divine warrant, in the Scriptures; moreover, the very nature of the Sabbath, as set forth in the idea that it rests on two facts; the fourth commandment sets forth explicitly the reason for the observance of the Sabbath, namely, the creation of the world, God's rest on the seventh day of the created week, and to change the day of the Sabbath rest to another day of the week is a thing that it is utterly impossible for an institution to entirely change the institution itself, or rather to destroy one institution and establish another in its stead. And in this last view, namely, that so far as man could do it, the Sabbath has been changed (for man has not changed the Sabbath) for instead of creation, we have another day for which no reason of the kind can be given.

This change has been made not by Christ and the apostles, as is confessed by the authority of the Roman Church.

The question of Sunday, this changing the period of rest from the seventh to the first day of the week, was brought about by the gradual constitution of authority. In the early church, the Sabbath, and on a time older, also the Christian habitation, the first day of the week, was observed. Bam. 3:14.

In order that none may misunderstand what is meant by "the early constitution

by another from the same paper under date of Feb. 16, 1886, as follows:—

We have less to say and to show about the validity of the present Sunday observance and for the reason that while the Sabbath and Sabbath rest that was made for man by God stands, it is easier to state apostolic times for the establishment of the seventh day.

This latter quotation shows clearly that the Catholics of 9 to 6 does not date the change, nor for Church in the days of the church, but anything whatever it should change. Rightly correct, so can be demonstrated by hundreds of authorities. The apostles had no room in this connection for only a single expression of a practice or observance of a first day. See Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:2; and if changed (and it never can be), it will not be necessary to cite any other. Neander, Mosheim, of whom "McClinktock and Strong's Cyclopedia" says that he is generally conceded to be by far the greatest of ecclesiastical historians, gives this pointed and candid testimony:—

The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always only a human ordinance, and it was far from the intention of the apostles to establish a divine command in this respect; far from them and from the early apostolic Church, to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday. Perhaps at the end of the second century a false application of this kind had begun to take place; for men appear by the fourth century to have considered the observance of Sunday as they so are.—*Rose's Neander, page 186.*

This is a plain statement. But the fact remains that the change has been made. Somebody outside of the Bible authority made it, how was it accomplished? As there is no divine authority for the change, what earthly power made it, and what circumstances were connected with its institution? To these questions Adventists answer in the terms of the early church.

In answer to these questions Adventists hold that the change was made gradually without divine authority but in direct violation of the divine law: and also to observe the day, in effect, is to recognize that apostacy, or that power about which apostles had spoken, which had instituted the Sabbath. But it is objected that the institution of Sunday dates from at least as early as the fourth century, whereas the earliest date assigned by Protestants for the establishment of the Papacy is A. D. 538. Is it not possible that Sunday was the established day long before the Papacy had an existence?

But let those who make this objection remember that the Papacy was the result of growth. It did not spring into being in a day, nor did it attain full stature in a century. As early as A. D. 54, the apostle said:—

For the mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way, . . . and then shall that wicked one be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming. 2 Thess. 2:7, 8.

This, all Protestants agree, is a reference to the Papacy, and to the great apostacy which culminated in the Papacy. But however early the date is established as A. D. 538, the papal power of the church and the corruption, the first infancy and youth were far back of that date, and gradually, to track or traces of error before that time. In his history of the "Early Church," p. 101, Killen says of the bishop of Rome:—

At this time the bishop, or pope, of Rome exercised supreme power only over a part of the church, but his power was the same in kind, if not in extent, that was exercised by his successors two centuries later.

Those who say that the Papacy changed the Sabbath, on the ground that the change was effected before the Papacy had an existence, only show how limited is their knowledge of the history of the great apostacy, and the development of the papal power.

Seventh-day Adventists hold that the Papacy has in it many features borrowed from paganism, particularly its idea of Sun-day. Sunday keeping is one of them. Protestants do not claim, and Sacred Scripture contains no hint of the change of the Sabbath by divine authority, and many first-day writers have acknowledged the fact; voluminous authorities and men who have repeatedly said, that "the festival of Sunday was always a human institution."

Do Adventists not justly accuse "the mystery of iniquity," which was at that time working for the corruption of the Church, with the crime of changing the Sabbath, in so far as it is possible for man to change or violate the fourth commandment, as forbidden by this commandment? And those also do well to obey God rather than man-made laws requiring the observance of another day.
