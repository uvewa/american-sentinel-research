BUT even with Sunday opening it by no means certain that the Fair be by any means better off. While there is little doubt a majority of the people of the United States are in favor of Sunday opening, or at least not opposed to it, there is a large and aggressive minority that characterizes any opposition as a "desecration of the Christian Sabbath," and they will have it in their power to do more to the Fair in the event of its being opened on Sunday. The question of Sunday opening will probably be definitely settled before this issue comes under the eyes of the reader.
