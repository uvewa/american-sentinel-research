CONGRESS passed a law closing the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. But the law has no penalty. Hitherto a law in this Nation destitute of a penalty, had no legal or civil force. It remains to be seen whether this one closing the Fair will have any force or not. There is seemingly a penalty attached to the law if the gates of the Fair are opened on Sunday. But a more than strange feature of the penalty is that if the Board of Managers should open the gates on Sunday, they would not be held for the penalty, but Congress would withhold the $2,500,000 appropriation. Or in other words Congress imposes a fine of $2,500,000 on itself if the religious ideas of Congress are not carried out. But dissenters from this congressional Christianity need not borrow any trouble about the real penalty that will soon follow. As the law making Sunday the Sabbath of the Nation was unconstitutional, the penalty must also be unconstitutional. The civil power has been surrendered to the churches, chief of which is the Roman Catholic, and they can and will manufacture penalties to suit every emergency and boycott them through, the same as they boycotted the Congress of the United States. But outside of, and beyond, the penalty to be visited upon all those who dissent from such a mongrel deformity, there is a penalty that the Nation will pay, namely: the downfall of the Nation. In the making of this a "Christian Nation," the Nation is divided against itself. Lincoln said that American slavery divided this Nation against itself and that slavery or the Nation must fall. And so it was. Slavery died and the Nation lives. But you may ask how the establishment of a national religion affects the destiny of a nation. The answer is easy. The Supreme Court violated the spirit of the Constitution in deciding that this is a "Christian Nation," and the churches and Congress did the same thing to establish a national religion. The result is that Congress and the churches and the Supreme Court are arrayed in deadly antagonism against each other, and one or the other or all together will die in the terrible struggle for supremacy. A greater than Lincoln said: "A kingdom divided against itself can not stand." The words of Jesus are more enduring than earthy kingdoms and thrones, more so than heaven and earth, for these shall pass away with a great noise, but his word abideth forever. The Constitution is practically dead—a thing of the past. Without the consent of the American people, Church and State have been united, and the image to the beast—the papal power, a national hierarchy of religion, sits enthroned in power, where once sat our proud queen of nations. Our proud bird is dead, our brilliant stars have faded from their azure sky, our triple bars,—the red white, and blue,—have faded to a "scarlet colored beast," in the tide of persecution that is inundating the land.
