ON another page will be found an article by a Seventh-day Adventist, on a complaint of a Methodist minister, for looking over to his own field on Sunday. The article makes the claim and substantiation that which we stated last week, namely, that Adventists do not observe Sunday, by habitually refraining from labor or business upon that day, without violating what they believe to be a commandment.
