Or the Sunday closing of the great Fair now in progress at Chicago, the Herald of that city, says:—

The closing of the gates will not be an unmixed evil. The indignation which it will excite will be a death blow to similar crank legislation. The first step toward the union of Church and State in this country will be the last.

This is a mistake. "The territory that Government invades it dominates. The jurisdiction it takes it keeps." It was Senator Plumb who said this, but years before, Hon. Richard M. Johnson, as chairman of the House Committee on Post-Offices and Post-Roads, said in his report on the proposition to abolish Sunday mails:—

> Let the national legislature once perform an act which involves the decision of a religious controversy, and it will have passed its legitimate bounds. The precedent will then be established, and the foundation laid for that usurpation of the divine prerogative in this country which has been the desolating scourge of the fairest portions of the Old World.

Of the principle of governmental interference in religious matters, Mr. Johnson said:—

> If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the Government will be strongly marked, if not eventually controlled by the same influence. All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when the influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequence.

The closing of the World's Fair by an act of Congress is only the beginning of the end. The people refused to believe it possible that any such action would be taken until it had been done. And even then they were not thoroughly aroused. Now it is too late. In any event the misguided religious influence that secured the closing of the gates of Jackson Park will be strengthened. If the Fair remains closed the precedent will have been thoroughly established. On the other hand should the Fair be opened on Sunday in defiance of law the advocates of Sunday closing would pose as the defenders of law and order, and congressmen jealous for their authority, and touched because it had been set at naught would go to still greater lengths in order to vindicate past action. The Government stands committed to the championship of a religious institution, and not only so, but to a course of religious legislation at the dictation of the same influence that was potent to secure passage of the Sunday-closing proviso.
