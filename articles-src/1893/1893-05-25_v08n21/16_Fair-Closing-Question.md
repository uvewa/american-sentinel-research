BUT whether or not the Fair opens on Sunday the Government standeth committed on the Sunday question. It has decided that Sunday is the Sabbath and that the Sabbath, the fourth commandment of the Decalogue says the seventh day it means the first day. In accordance with the action of Congress, the World's Fair Post-Office will be closed on Sunday even if the Fair itself be open. On the 11th, Attorney General Olney reaffirmed a decision that the law of Congress requiring the Fair to be closed on Sunday, prohibits the opening of the public buildings and grounds upon that day.

Bro. J. H. KROWNE, General Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was interviewed recently relative to the attitude of the organization in the event of its being open, or partially so, on Sunday. Mr. Krowne said:—

Our sole purpose is to aid in its power to bring about the result it has been working for nearly three years. In case the directors lose an assault on the peace there will be thousands of people who will stay away from Chicago on purely religious grounds. For this will not be a mere spectacle; in that event I can not say. There will be no organized boycott of the Fair, but there will be a universal feeling against it.

"Do you mean no effort will be made to keep people away from Chicago during the Fair?" asked the reporter.

"Oh, so organized Christianity will show the world that there is more religious sentiment in this nation. It is probable that missions all over the country will be asked to advise their congregations not to go. No doubt the world should know the money thus lost as well as the church, would keep hundreds of thousands of people from the Fair."

That is, it will be a "Christian" boy-worship, is boycott, in effect but not in name. That is about as honest as dubbing Sunday the Christian Sabbath, and the Sabbath as everybody knows, to another day. There is a good deal of bamming about the so-called American Christianity, and the American is the least part of the thing. If a thing is right to do, it should be an honest boycott something that is not.
