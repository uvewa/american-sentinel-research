OF the Sunday closing of the great Fair now in progress at Chicago, the *Herald* of that city, says:—

The closing of the gates will be so assured. The indignation which it will excite will be so great as to have no similar result. Legislation of this tenor toward the union of Church and State in this country will be at an end.

This is a mistake. "The territory that remains to be taken is far greater than the jurisdiction it takes is begun." It was a Swiss-French proverb which said, "In pressing a point one always goes too far." Nevertheless, Hon. Richard M. Johnson, as chairman of the Committee of the Senate on Post-Offices and his report on the proposition to abolish Sunday mails—

Let the national legislature once perform an act which involves the decision of a religious controversy, and it will have passed its legitimate bounds. The precedent will then be established, and the assumption held for that usurpation on the divine prerogative in this country which has been the desolating scourge of the fairest portions of the Old World.

Of the principles of governmental interference in religious matters, Mr. Johnson said:—

It is assumed, it is *justly* assumed that if this be the future measure of the Government we will be *strongly marked*, if not *essentially controlled*, by the same influences. All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when the influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences.

The closing of the World's Fair by an act of Congress is only the beginning of that. The people refused to believe it possible that any such action would be taken until it had been done. And even then they were not thoroughly aroused. Now it is too late. In any event the misguided religious influence that secured the closing of the gates of Jackson Park will be strengthened. If the Fair remains closed the precedent will have been thoroughly established. On the other hand should the Fair be opened on Sunday in defiance of law the advocates of Sunday closing would pose as the defenders of law and order, and congressmen jealous for their authority, and touched because it had been set at naught would go to still greater lengths in order to vindicate past action. The Government already committed to the championship of a religious institution, and not only so, but to a system of religious legislation at the dictation of the same influence that was exerted to secure passage of the Sunday closing proviso.
