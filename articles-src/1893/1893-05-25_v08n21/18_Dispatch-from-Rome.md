A LAST dispatch from Rome says: "It is understood that Mgr. Satolli has been well received, and that he will be known as the kilowatted and will have standing and authority as the permanent representative in the United States of an American Legation at the Vatican. The movement would not be so directed as to bring all possible influence that the end to bear upon the Washington Government."
