On another page will be found an article written by a Seventh-day Adventist, in jail in Chestertown, Md., on complaint of a Methodist minister, for husking corn in his own field on Sunday. The article substantiates that which we stated last week, namely, that Adventists can not observe Sunday, by habitually refraining from labor or business upon that day, without violating what they believe to be a divine command.
