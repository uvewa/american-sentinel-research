A second hearing was granted upon the Barbers' Sunday Rest bill, which was introduced in the Michigan legislature, on the evening of May 10. The first hearing was before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on the evening of March 2, upon the following bill:—

A bill to regulate the closing of barber shops on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

SECTION 1. The people of the State of Michigan enact, That it shall not be lawful for any person or persons to carry on or engage in the art or calling of hair cutting, shaving, hair dressing, and shampooing, commonly called that of a barber, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

SECTION 2. And further it shall not be lawful for any person or persons to keep open their shops or places of business aforesaid, on said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday (except such persons shall be employed to exercise such art or calling in relation to a deceased person). Provided, however, That nothing in this act shall apply to persons who conscientiously believe the seventh day of the week should be observed as the Sabbath, and who actually refrain from secular business on that day.

SECTION 3. Every person offending against the provisions of this act shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $28, or be imprisoned in the county jail for not more than 30 days, or by both such fine or imprisonment in the discretion of the court.

SECTION 4. All acts or parts of acts in conflict with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.

The same bill, with slight modification, was about this time introduced in the House, and a few days since passed the House by a vote of sixty-four to seven. Coming into the Senate, it was referred to the committee on labor, and another hearing granted upon it before this committee. The hearing was held in the open Senate chamber, and lasted from eight o'clock in the evening until nearly midnight. Not less than one hundred persons were present. Notwithstanding the House was in session that evening until a late hour, so much interest was manifested in the discussion going on in the Senate chamber upon the barbers' bill that a number of representatives left the proceeding in the House to come in and listen to, or take part in, the discussion at the hearing.

A number of barbers, Senator McGinley and Representative Barkworth appeared in favor of the bill. Prof. G. E. Fifield and the writer spoke in opposition to it. The usual arguments in favor of such bills were made,—that the barbers' were "forced" to labor on Sunday, their families deprived of their association on Sunday, would lose their positions and come to want if they refused to work on Sunday, or some barber who did not care for Sunday would keep open his shop and get some of the trade they thought they were entitled to. Senator McGinley even went so far as to declare that if it were not for Sunday laws men could not exist, and without them there would be seen no church steeples pointing heavenward and "kissing the blue-tipped clouds."

Against this and all other like measures the following arguments, in brief, were presented:—

1. All Sunday laws are religious. When the Sunday-closing measure was up in Congress last July, Senator Hawley said:—

> Everybody knows what the foundation is. It is founded in religious belief.

Senator Peffer likewise said:—

> To-day we are engaged in a theological discussion concerning the observance of the first day of the week.

And Senator Quay sent the Bible to the speaker's desk to have the fourth commandment read by the clerk, as the foundation for the proposed legislation. Likewise, at the former hearing of the barbers' bill above mentioned, Senator McGinley, the framer of the bill and chairman of the committee before whom the hearing was held, opened the Bible and read the fourth commandment as the foundation for asking the passage of the measure he had drafted. And everybody knows that the Bible is a religious book and the fourth commandment a religious command.

2. Religious legislation is un-American. The Government of the United States was founded on a new order of things; not the principle held by other nations that the Lord divided the human race into two classes, one to rule and the other to be ruled and enjoy their rights and liberties only as they were doled out to them; but upon the principle of the sovereignty of the people, and the equality of all men in the matter of rights.

3. Such legislation is not only un-American but unchristian. Christ said: "If any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not." John 12:47. Even if he had told man to observe the first day of the week as the Sabbath (which he never did), he would not in this life condemn them for not believing it was the Sabbath or for not keeping it. And yet, though he never gave such a command, men desire to have Congress and State legislatures step in and not only command what Christ never commanded, but condemn other men for not obeying what Christ would not have condemned though he had commanded it.

Furthermore, Paul says, "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin." Rom. 14:25. Sunday laws, whether made for barbers or any other class, are always enacted to compel somebody to keep Sunday who does not believe in keeping it, or who has not enough faith in it to keep it. Then it must be evident that to force such to keep it can only be to force them to sin.

To his disciples Christ said: "Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ." If he is our Master, we are his servants. But Paul said, "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. . . . So then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God." Rom. 14:4, 12. In religious matters, then, the individual is responsible alone to God, and not to the Government.

4. Such legislation is also contrary to the principles of Protestantism. The birth of Protestantism was in the year 1529 at the second Diet of Spires, when the Christian princes, in response to an intolerant decree that was sought to be imposed upon the Reformers, said:—

> Let us reject this decree. In matters of conscience the majority have no power.

> Out of this council, says D'Aubigne, grew "a new order of things," and this new order of things was the principle of liberty in religious matters, of absolute separation of Church and State, the principle upon which the Government of the United States was founded. And this is the interpretation of the Latin phrase on the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States, Novus Ordo Secutorum, "a new order of things."

The Protestants said:—

> We pledge, therefore, our obedience to the Emperor in all civil matters; but as for the Word of God, it is liberty that we demand.

And Luther, the great champion of the Reformation, thus affirmed:—

> I would not resort to force against such as are superstitious, nor even against unbelievers. Whosoever believeth let him draw nigh, and whose believeth not, stand afar off. Let there be no commission. Liberty is the very essence of faith.

> I am ready to preach, argue, write,—but I will not constrain any one: for faith is a voluntary act.

The enforcement of the Sunday Sabbath, or any other religious institution, is therefore contrary to the principles of true Protestantism.

Rev. Thomas F. Cashman, a Catholic priest of Chicago, in the *Chicago Evening Journal*, of April 8, 1893, well observed that,—

> The position of coercion taken by so many of the Protestant clergy—the position that although they are admittedly in a hopeless minority of all the people of these United States, they would compel all the rest of us to accept their Sunday dogmas by recourse to law and other methods—is a grievous departure from their old battle-cry of civil and religious liberty.

5. The passage of such bills as the one under consideration is class legislation. The barbers stand no more in need of such measures than street-car drivers, butchers, merchants, etc. They all can rest on Sunday if they wish to. What is not prohibited is admitted. No man ever starved to death for resting one day in seven, not even an observer of the seventh day, as unpopular as that makes one, and surely no Sunday observer would admit for a moment that Sunday-keepers, as a class, stand a poorer chance in life, or are poorer bread-earners than seventh-day keepers.

And the exemptions in it are still further class legislation, and are but acts of toleration. They simply say that the State will allow certain things which men have an inalienable right to do anyway. But, as Madison held,—

> To grant to the State the power of tolerating is implicitly to grant to it the power of prohibiting.

And Philip Schaff states the same truth when he says:—

> Toleration is a concession which may be withdrawn; it implies a preference for the ruling form of faith and worship, and a practical disapproval of all other forms.

6. There is a compelling, persecuting spirit behind these laws. The following is from a report of an interview which a reporter of the *Chicago Evening Journal*, of April 8, had with Rev. Frederick A. Noble, pastor of the Union Park Congregational Church, Chicago:—

If Sunday observance as you advocate it is considered oppressive by a majority of the people, would you still enforce it?

Exactly as I would enforce the law in any other respect. The Supreme Court has declared this to be a Christian country, and the foundations of the country were laid in Christian truth.

The same reporter interviewed Rev. Dr. Withrow, pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church (Chicago), with the following result:—

Would you compel others to observe Sunday in your way?

Never! I believe in the fullest religious and civil liberty. But neither civil nor religious liberty means lawlessness on the part of any portion of the community. There is a Sabbath observance law on the Statute books of this and most of the other States, and the Supreme Court has lately recognized the Christian Sabbath. Sunday observance is the law of the land, and that law must be enforced the same as any other law. Anything else than that would be anarchy.

But Mr. Fairchild, in his "Moral Philosophy," has truly said:—

Intolerance and oppression are not made tolerable by being in strict accordance with the law.

7. The real object underlying all Sunday legislation is to settle a religious controversy and elevate Sunday, the first day of the week, as the Sabbath, in the place of Saturday, the seventh day, which God himself has declared is the Sabbath of the Lord our God. The United States House of Representatives, in its Sunday mail report of 1830, recognized that such was the case. It said:—

If Congress shall, by the authority of law, sanction the measure recommended, it would constitute a legislative decision of a religious controversy, in which even Christians themselves are at issue.

The State can not afford to take sides in a religious controversy. When it does, it thereby sets itself up as the enemy of those on the opposite side from that to which it adheres, and thus deprives itself of the power to keep the peace.

And finally, all the Sunday legislation in all the world can not settle the Sabbath question, or make Sunday the Sabbath. Sunday is not the Sabbath, and both Catholics and Protestants admit the fact. The Chicago Catholic priest already quoted, Rev. Thomas F. Cashman, in the *Chicago Evening Journal*, of April 8, 1893, gives the Sunday case all away in the following words:—

> The church insists, remember, upon a proper observance of Sunday in commemoration of the resurrection of her Head and the descent of the Holy Ghost. But that is church law, not divine. There is no command in the Bible which directs the observance of Sunday. That is canon law, and though our Protestant neighbors have borrowed the day from us, we have no desire to meddle with them in its enjoyment in their own peculiar fashion. At the same time we don't want them to meddle with us. Now, as to Sunday being a Christian institution, an error loudly proclaimed; in the strict sense of the word, it was not instituted by Christ or his Church. It is not ordered by divine law nor was it ordered by the church. Constantine decreed the observance of Sunday in order to give the Christians a chance to compete with the pagans, and recognizing it was a good thing, the church in her subsequent councils adopted it.

And the American Sabbath Union, an organization started and supported by the leading Protestant denominations in the United States, in its "Pearl of Days Leaflets" No. 3, entitled, "Saturday or Sunday —Which?" makes the following sweeping and fatal confession:—

> But our opponents declare, "We are not satisfied with these inferences and suppositions; show us where the first day is spoken of as holy, or as being observed instead of the seventh; we must have a direct and positive command of God." We admit there is no such command.

Such was in brief the line of argument presented at the hearing.

In response to Mr. McGinley's statement that were it not for Sunday laws men could not exist, and there would be no church steeples "kissing the blue-tipped clouds," the gentleman was asked how it was that men existed before Constantine's Sunday law of 321 A. D., which history tells us was the first Sunday law, either ecclesiastical or civil, which the world ever saw, and how it is that California has church steeples kissing the skies, notwithstanding the fact that that State has no Sunday law. These and many other items of interest came up, and questions were poured in from all quarters almost without number. Thus is the Sabbath question coming before legislative assemblies.
