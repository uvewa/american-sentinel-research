WE hoped to be able to give our readers a letter this week from our own correspondent. We trust that we will have after what we shall have something each week after we shall have the continuance of the *Pacific Press*. These letters will not be descriptive of the Fair but will discuss a World's Fair standpoint those questions to which the SENTINEL is devoted. Probably one man in a thorough reliable manner, the relation that the Fair and the Congresses to be held in connection with it will have to the development of governmental religion. At that the Sunday-closing agitation has made the right of Congress to legislate upon religious questions the supreme issue.
