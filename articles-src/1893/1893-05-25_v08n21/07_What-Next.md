It takes men of moral backbone to stand firmly in a crisis of this kind, especially when he is in the face of a body of men who occupy positions of power. The combined powers, and social intimidation, of the whole empire of Germany would not intimidate such a man. Like a giant he stood in defense of the work committed to him, of conscience. The ruling spirits of any reformation are made into different material, than those who may call out a protest from men who may not think much about religion, but who will simply have only the effect of strengthening the hands of such worthless individuals, and bringing down upon themselves ridicule or abuse.

Thus it has been in this Sunday closing of the World's Fair. When the question was first sprung, there was a storm of protest from all over the land, and the almost unanimous verdict was that such a thing as closed gates of the Columbian Exposition would never be done. Not any had any idea it would come as it did, but the fact remains the same. The legislative body of our land, in the way of settling the rights under the Constitution of the United States, there arose another set of principles, this time, not from the populace also, but from the legislatures themselves, there being at that time not more than a handful in both bodies who would openly champion the Sunday-closing views of the governmental aggressors.

But when the flood of political protest coming from the people had been met and stemmed by threatening boycotts, and by fairly calling men by fair methods "cowards," and when those who dared stand up against the wicked idea, one by one have been silenced or have been sent back, and some of those who were loudest in denouncing the act were the first to fall in line with the mandates of the "church-related political partisans of the 'American Sabbath,'" explaining their action in droves, it invites a preference for the ruling form of faith and worship, and a practical monopoly.

There is a compelling, persecuting power behind these laws. The following is from a report of an interview which a reporter of the *Chicago Evening Journal*, on April 3, had with Rev. Frederic A. Noble, pastor of the Union Park Congregational Church:—

If Sunday observance as you advocate is not already supported by existing law to cover it, would you enforce the law on any people of the State who don't agree with you in the belief that Sunday should be observed, and who do not work on Saturday but do on Sunday?

"I believe in the fullest religious and civil liberty. But neither civil nor religious liberty means license." He pointed out that it is the law of the land, and that law must be enforced.

And American Sabbath Union, an organization started and supported by the leading Protestant denominations in the United States, is the agent.

But Mr. Fairchild, in his "Moral Philosophy," has truly said:

The State can not afford to take sides in a religious controversy. When it does, it thereby sets itself up as the enemy of those opposed to that to which it is adverse, and thus deprives itself of the power to be impartial.

The real object underlying all Sunday legislation is to settle a religious controversy in favor of Sunday, the first day of the week, as the Sabbath, in the place of Saturday, the seventh day, which God himself had declared is the Sabbath of the Lord our God. Richard M. Johnson, in the Sunday mail report of 1829, recognized that it was a religious institution. He said that—

If Congress shall, by the authority of law, assume the prerogative of determining what are the laws of God, it will have passed its legitimate bounds. A legislative decision of a religious controversy is virtually established.
