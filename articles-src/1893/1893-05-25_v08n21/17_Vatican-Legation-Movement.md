A late dispatch from Rome says: "It is understood that Mgr. Satolli has represented the hierarchy and leading Catholic laymen in the United States as anxious to start a movement in favor of establishing an American Legation at the Vatican. The movement would be so directed as to bring all possible influence to this end to bear upon the Washington Government."
