It takes men of moral backbone to stand up stiffly against a wrong, and especially if it be in the face of a large majority of the people. Martin Luther was such a man. The combined powers, political and ecclesiastical, of the whole empire of Germany could not intimidate him in the least. Like a giant he stood in defense of the work committed to him, and came off victorious. The ruling spirits of any reformation are men of this stamp. But they are made of different material, or by the power of God made into different material, than the majority of mankind. An apparent evil may call out a protest from men, who when they see that their protests seemingly have only the effect of strengthening the bands of wickedness, and calling down upon themselves ridicule or abuse, leave that work to another.

Thus it has been in this Sunday closing of the World's Fair. When the question was first sprung, there was a storm of protests from all over the land, and the almost unanimous verdict was that such a thing as closed gates of the Columbian Exposition could never occur. No one had any idea it would come as it did, but being sprung as it was on the highest legislative body of our land, and in the way it was, on the face of it, a palpable violation of the Constitution of the United States, there arose another storm of protests, this time, not from the populace alone, but from the legislators themselves, there being at that time not more than half a dozen in both bodies who would openly champion the Sunday-closing proviso of the governmental appropriation to the World's Fair. But when the flood of petitions and protests came from the religious element of the country, threatening boycott, and fairly calling down divine vengeance on the heads of those who dared stand up against the wicked thing, one by one these protests ceased, and some of those who were loudest in denouncing the evil were the first to fall in line with the mandates of the religio-political guardians of the "American Sabbath," explaining their action in such words as these: "My constituency demand such action," and to do otherwise than to accede to their demands "would not be wise statesmanship."

When this vantage ground was gained, then came the cry of "anarchists" against those who opposed this unconstitutional act. That silenced many more, for an anarchist is in disrepute in the United States. Thus things went on till the time for opening had arrived, when the report went out that in spite of everything the gates would be opened on the first Sunday, and there was general rejoicing among the masses, and on the other hand dire threatenings on the part of the religio-political leaders. But when the crucial test came, the gates closed against everybody and everything, even to one of Uncle Sam's mail wagons. It is stated also that a Frenchman presented himself at the gate and offered the keeper a twenty-dollar gold piece if he would let him inside, but that he was refused, whereupon he exclaimed: "And this is what you call personal liberty!"

The thing they wanted has been, for a moment at least, accomplished—closed gates—though already the indications are that the closing rule is not to be adhered to. But how are those looked upon who still remonstrate and protest? Dr. Lawrence, a Baptist minister of Chicago, preached a sermon on the subject Sunday, and denounced as treasonable all efforts that are now being made to open the Fair on Sunday. First they were "anarchists," now "traitors." What is the penalty for treason? And what may those expect who persist in this opposition to these encroachments? The prophet's ear of eighteen hundred years ago heard the fiat, and it was that "the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed." Are we not almost there now? And who will be able to stand?

W. E. CORNELL.
