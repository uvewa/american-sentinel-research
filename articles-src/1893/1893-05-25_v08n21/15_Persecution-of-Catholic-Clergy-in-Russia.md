A CATHOLIC paper complains that "the persecution of the Catholic clergy in Russia still continues with increased ardor on the part of governors and their officials. The new Governor of Wilna, Mr. Orgiefsky, has inaugurated his appointment by sending off three priests into exile for from two to six years."

No specific charges were brought against the priests, but they were exiled simply on the general charge that their presence was a menace to the peace of the district. Another priest, it is asserted, has been confined in one of the convent prisons for, inadvertently, not standing up while his brother priests were taking the oath to the Emperor. "It is the old story," remarks our Catholic contemporary, "of the wolf and the lamb. Every pretext is seized that ingenuity can conceive to harass the Catholic priesthood."

All this simply confirms that which we have frequently remarked, namely, that religious intolerance seeks in every country to hide its ugly head behind substantially the same subterfuges. Russia professes to tolerate all sects that avail themselves of certain provisions, and so does not avowedly persecute Roman Catholics on account of their religion, but upon various charges of a "civil" character. This is the same method adopted by the authorities of Tennessee and Maryland in dealing with Seventh-day Adventists. They are not openly proceeded against for being Adventists, but upon the pretext that they are inimical to the peace and quiet of the community, and that their practice of doing secular work and business on Sunday is subversive of good morals. Bigotry in America does not differ materially from the same wicked thing in Russia.
