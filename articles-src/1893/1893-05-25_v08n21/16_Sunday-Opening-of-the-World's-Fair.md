It seems probable at this writing that the entire World's Fair will be thrown open to the public on Sunday, owing to the fact that if deprived of the possible Sunday gate receipts the enterprise is certain to be a financial failure. Thus far the average daily attendance has been but little over 17,000, whereas to pay the running expenses alone the average should be 90,000.

But even with Sunday opening it is by no means certain that the Fair will be any better off. While there is little doubt that a majority of the people of the United States are in favor of Sunday opening, or at least not opposed to it, there is a large and aggressive minority who are so bitterly opposed to what they term a "desecration of the Christian Sabbath," that they will do all in their power to ruin the Fair in the event of its being opened on Sunday. The question of Sunday opening will probably be definitely settled before this note comes under the eye of the reader.

But whether or not the Fair opens on Sunday the Government stands committed on the Sunday question; it has decided that Sunday is the Sabbath and that when the fourth commandment of the Decalogue says the seventh day it means the first day. In accordance with the action of Congress, the World's Fair Post-Office will be closed on Sunday even if the Fair itself is open. On the 16th inst, Attorney-General Olney rendered a decision that the law of Congress requiring the Fair to be closed on Sunday, prohibits the opening of the post-office within the grounds upon that day.

Rev. J. H. Knowles, General Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was interviewed recently relative to the attitude of the union toward the Fair in event of its being open, or partially so, on Sunday. Mr. Knowles said:—

> Our union proposes to do all in its power to bring about the result it has been working for nearly three years. In case the directors do not accede to our request there will be thousands of people who will stay away from Chicago on purely religious grounds. Just what action our union will take in that event I can not say. There will be no boycott, for we do not like the word boycott. It sounds rather cheap.

"Do you mean no effort will be made to keep people away from Chicago during the Fair?" asked the reporter.

"Oh, no. Organized Christianity will show the world that there is some religious sentiment in this country. It is probable that ministers all over the country will be asked to advise their congregations not to go. No doubt this would have a powerful effect and keep away thousands, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of people from the Fair."

That is, it will be a "Christian" boycott—a boycott in effect but not in name. That is about as honest as dubbing Sunday the Sabbath, when the name belongs as every body knows, to another day. There is a good deal of humbug about the so-called American Sabbath Union; and the name is not the least part of the fraud. It is fitting that it should call its boycott something that it is not.

Wilbur F. Crafts, and the so-called American Sabbath Union forces generally are almost wild over the action of the local Directory in deciding to open the gates of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday; they are even demanding that the President shall order United States troops to Chicago to enforce the Sunday-closing proviso. This shows to how great lengths this gigantic combination for uniting Church and State is ready to go in their nefarious work.
