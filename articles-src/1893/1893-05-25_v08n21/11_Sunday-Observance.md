LOUISVILLE is mildly excited over the question of the observance of Sunday. Two distinguished clergymen recently visited that gambler-ridden town and addressed the meeting of the American Sabbath Union, which, notwithstanding its name, insists on observance of the first day of the week instead of the seventh. But the addresses were earnest if neither eloquent nor abounding in new ideas and the meeting adjourned in the determination to keep up the agitation. It is true there is some quasi amiable criticism of the fact that the sum of $250 was levied on the meeting for the purpose of defraying the expenses attendant on the visit and addresses of the two gentlemen, and because one of the two took occasion to advertise the fact that the other had published a book and was the editor of a paper for both of which he solicited subscribers, and offered at special rates; but that stroke of business is, perhaps, not to be condemned—it was a matter of propriety of which the reverend gentlemen must be the judges.

The principal Sunday violation to which the attention of the meeting was called was the Sunday newspaper. Rev. Mr. Crafts announced that the Sunday paper was being rapidly suppressed in his city, Pittsburg, under a law which prohibits secular labor, and Rev. H. H. George advised that it be placed under a ban of the civil law. Rev. George was the companion of Mr. Crafts and was the gentleman who called attention to the book and newspaper of his colleague and the advantageous club rates, failing, however, to explain why it was that the Sunday paper should be put under the ban of the law, when, as Mr. Crafts said, it was being rapidly suppressed, and under a law now in force and which was accomplishing the ends so devoutly wished by the two missionaries to darkest Louisville. Why ask for another ban when one at hand is doing the suppressing act?

The fact is there is law enough, if there were a public sentiment demanding enforcement; and not all the laws of colonial times, nor of this bustling age will suppress the Sunday paper, nor any other thing until the public can be brought to believe the object of attack is harmful; and the Sunday paper is not more harmful than the paper of the other days of the week; neither is the labor of the printer on the Sunday more harmful, in itself, than the labor of the servants of the gentlemen of the convention who prepare their comforting and comfortable Sunday dinner.

If the attack is to be made let the gentlemen attack the paper of Monday morning to which they expressed no objection and which they read; yet the news is gathered for it on Sunday, written up and set up on that day requiring an army of reporters, editors, telegraph operators, messenger boys, printers, proofreaders, firemen and engineers. Why did the convention neglect to take action on the slavish condition of these men at the time its tenderest solicitude was being exercised on behalf of the men who work on Sunday papers and whom they denominated slaves, yet whose work is nearly all done on Saturday? Were they, are they, afraid of the Sunday newspaper as a competing influence? If so the remedy is with themselves—at least the fault is.
