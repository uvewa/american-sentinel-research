We had hoped to be able to give our readers a letter this week from our own correspondent at Chicago, but we have been disappointed. We trust that hereafter we shall have something each week during the continuance of the Fair. These letters will not be descriptive of the Fair but will discuss from a World's Fair standpoint those questions to which the SENTINEL is devoted. Probably not one in a thousand realizes the influence that the Fair and the Congresses to be held in connection with it will have in the development of governmental religion. Already the Sunday-closing agitation has made the right of Congress to legislate upon religious questions the supreme issue of the hour.
