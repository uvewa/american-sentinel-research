JANUARY 9, Mr. Storey, of the Tennessee legislature, introduced a bill repealing the law against barbering on Sunday in that State. It does not appear, however, that any member of the legislature can see any inconsistency in the law which sends a man to the chain-gang for speaking stamps in his back field on Sunday.

BISHOP H. W. WARREN, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, says that "freedom in religion does not mean freedom from religion." This is a fitting companion piece to the definition of religious freedom by Cardinal Gibbons that "religious freedom is freedom to be rightly and according to the dictates of a right conscience." The two utterances are fitting companions, for both are essentially wrong.

WHETHER weakness of the alliance of civil government, we said:—

But this in no way expresses the divine obligation. God does not release any corporation or individual from obligation to obey the divine law. It simply provides a way whereby you may compel their fellows to yield to them that which is justly theirs. But as long as the form of government is civil, God is still the great moral Governor, and every man is responsible to him for every free moral agent will give account.

Surely, to us unknown, individuals of Ohio, marked this paragraph, and after putting stars upon the margin has followed the questions, evidently designed to be answers:—

"Is not the man who openly makes a ten-cent stand, in violation of the United States postal laws?"

"Has individual?"

It is true individual is not released from this obligation, as such, nor any corporate body of individuals release him as a member of said corporation and is not the corporation bound by the same laws? Can the corporation be of any other character than all the individuals maintaining?

No corporation has any power to release any individual from obligation to obey the divine law; and for this very reason, no corporation can, as such, have any thing to do with the divine law. The members of every corporation should be governed as individuals by the divine law; and if so governed they will be content in all things; but they have no right either as individuals or as a corporation to attempt to enforce that law upon others.

As for a corporation having or not having "any other character than that of the individual membership," the simple truth is, that a corporation has no character at all, of any kind. A corporation can not even violate the postal laws of the United States by sending for one cent a written communication which may require costs, as the individual has done. Let individuals be honest, and corporations can not go wrong anybody.
