We will pursue the even tenor of our way, filing informations with magistrates for every Sunday's work done by carriers and agents of newspapers, and others engaged in promoting their circulation and distribution. We have no intention of prosecuting editors, reporters or compositors. The reporters and editors are as especially their class generally, and will be exempt from any responsibility shifted on them by their statutory employees.

In anything even wanting to convince people generally that the scripture is true which says, "Great men are not always wise," it might certainly to be afforded by the recent opinion of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in favor of the Sunday law of that State.

In their opinion, the judges said: "The act of a wise and broad-minded statutes, and we would regret to see it interfered with." But following this is a caution against enforcing the law too strictly, as "the law of the Lord is perfect. What should not be enforced! A strange law, in truly! And not the least peculiar thing about the law is, the while they early caution others to enforce this "wise and benevolent" statute, they say that it is their "plain duty" to enforce it just as far as it goes.
