A CHRISTIAN lady residing in Aurora, Ill., writes thus of the Tennessee persecutions:—

I have no sympathy at all with that kind of law. It is done in no sense for the one true time of the God of the land. I consider it as sinuous and wrong—in the welfare of savage as those in India who are giving into the privacy of homes, and oppressing them.

This lady is a firm believer in Sunday association, but, like thousands of others, revolts at the injustice that is being practiced.
