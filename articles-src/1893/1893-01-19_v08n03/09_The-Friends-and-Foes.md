# "The Friends and Foes."

THE noted lecturer, Joseph Cook, of Boston, delivered an address in the Grand Opera House in this city, January 14, under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, upon his broad theme, "The friends and foes of the public Sabbath."

His speech, was reported in the *Evening Telegraph*, of Superior, from which the following extracts are given; showing what what must be of special interest just at this juncture when religion and politics have come together, and how much the public need be alarmed at the influence that Catholics and Catholic politicians may exercise, lest they gain the balance of power.

There are now about 8,000,000 Catholics in the United States, but by a little more immigration, in ten or twenty years we shall have 100,000,000, and as one in five of these will be Roman Catholics or immigrants, when one out of five of the voting school teaches obedience to the clerical party, and political manipulation of the Catholic votes.

Certainly "the clerical influence is felt in politics;" in a very unpleasant degree when ministers lobby in the halls of Congress, and the churches send petitions and manipulate Congress asking for the passage and enforcement of Sunday-closing legislation matters. And when feeling and fanning this clerical influence—this church party—senators will stand on the floor of Congress and gravely say, speaking of the action of the petitions of the church party, "I would write the provision for the observance of the Sabbath because the sentiment of the country demands it."

Truly the clerical influence is felt in politics! But it is only the influence of the clergy of the Catholic Church that is felt? Who are the clergymen that do the petitions, wire-pulling? Are they not Protestant? Professing needs to the gain control of the Government in the interest of religion?

But the Government is no safer under the influence of Protestant clergy than of preachers and churches than under the influence of Catholic clergy than under the Roman mass rule.

Again, *speaking of the Jesuits*, their influence in this country, dictating where this one the leader, as, Mr. Cook, says also that only that the North Americans do the American that different sort deputes,—hero nation is a naked sword with the hilt in Rome and its position the power. So, too, it is; and it pierces the vitals of every government it touches. But that government reaches municipalities under but a few municipalities of jurisdiction under in matters of Protestantism, which needs to be in the means well known that Jesuitism has always done.

There is our friends and our foes in matters of State and Church, but we do not need to carry our fight on any political or State argument.

This is all that the bishops asked of the imperial power in the fourth century; just you Constantines help and we will send our church will help you. The Papacy met the same bid. But still the ramely applicable statement was made by this noted lecturer:

AMERICAN who put down slavery are not going to be put down by Roman Catholic. An empire with seventy million people has not room enough for one-fourth of the people never see the inside of a church of God can enter the ballot box with a people which can put the dollar into the public purse; put the child into the stomach of the school and the Bible into the stomach of the child; send on the three links of iron, silver, and gold—the common school, the free press, the open Bible—to the uncivilized world.

The education for which Mr. Cook pleads means, not a secular, or a Godless, but a Moral training—religion. But notice his point—that the religion of the Bible, as supported by the State, shall do this and separate those citizens, that "the church and the family are not sufficient." "Put religion in the State."

But why, Mr. Cook? But why not tell the gentleman, seeing the insufficiency of their churches—which is plainly now self-confessed that they petition the God of heaven, who has truth on his side and all the righteousness, to make them efficient for that work. We would ask, Whose are religion and the Bible, and whose the Government? Which, of course, Mr. Cook knows as the Bible says, "Suffer the children false doctrine, surely.

But what will be the fate of the church that takes the position it has on its hands? Whose religion and education shall the Government of the church of the Church? Than the Church would be decent. Shall the Government as a whole permit churches to take control of the Government to teach their religion, to lead the people to God—is just as wicked, and the State just any political making will do, one of our Government as it would for the Catholic Church to do the same thing. The whole thing is antichristian and unchristian.

But Mr. Cook makes a still more astute leading statement:— "But the Constitution says that religion, must be the church—there must be no Romanism. Thus the Constitution, as officially interpreted, has never given to Protestants one day out of seven more than Roman Catholics; and it has never done so constitutionally."

Does instructed American know what the Constitution says? He says so certainly. Then why such reckless statements? Every one knows or ought to know that those held in the Constitution, as "every knowledge Christianity" or that "this is a Christian Nation" or that religion is our Government, establish our free ways, and say that our Government is—well let the man know enough to leave these things out of his speeches. The rest of his remarks were of the results of civil government.

Observe the self-contradiction inherent of Mr. Cook's statements, the Constitution says there shall be "no establishment of religion, or prohibition the free exercise of establishing the Sabbath in its form" and it says, "officially interpreted," that it. And in the treaty with Tripoli in which the Senate of the United States declared that "the Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion." (*Treaties are to the same class as the Constitution.*)

The true Protestant idea of the province of government, is best stated in the famous *Remonstrance* of the Protestants of Germany at the Diet of Spires from which Protestantism takes its name.

In all matters of conscience the majority has no power of commanding. And it is the very avoidance of any such thought of compulsion in matters of religion.

*W. A. Blakely.*
