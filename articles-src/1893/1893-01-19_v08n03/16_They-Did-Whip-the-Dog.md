# They "Did Whip the Dog."

A CORRESPONDENCE writing from Marietta, Ga., gives the following, illustrative of the practical workings of the Sunday laws of that State.

Two colored boys have just been tried in the Superior Court of this, Cobb County, for hunting on Sunday. The facts are brought out in court, and related to me by the foreman of the jury, were substantially as follows: The boys were discussing a suit on Sunday. While passing through an old field, one of the boys' dogs started a rabbit. The boy found a rabbit to which he gave chase, and which he caught. The other boy's dog also took the trail from the dog and carried it home. For this they were indicted under Section 4550 of our Georgia Code, which provides that "Any person or persons who shall hunt any kind of game with gun or dogs,

or both, on the Sabbath day, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction, shall by punished as prescribed in section 4310 of this code." Section 4310 provides a fine not to exceed $1,000, or imprisonment not to exceed six months, or work on the chain gang, etc.; and these boys escaped conviction this time only by the fact that the State would not agree to convict them, because as they said, "these boys were out for an entirely different purpose from hunting." Though in discharging the prisoners the judge reprimanded the boys very severely for their actions, when the boys assured him that they got nothing for the rabbits the dogs made for them.

And thus the dignity of the State of Georgia and of the "American Sabbath" is nobly maintained!

On the 19th inst., Judge Wiss, of the District Criminal Court of New Orleans, pronounced the case of the conviction of the Chief of Police charged, charged with a fine misdemeanor of refusing to serve warrants for a violation of the Sunday law. As noted in its columns last week, a crusade was made against those who refuse to serve the writs of process of enforcing the Sunday law, the law on which they were based. Though that a police officer would not make arrests and was charged in the district court with a misdemeanor. His trial first and being resulted in a mis-trial, the jury standing six to one for conviction.

The case was then tried by the judge nominated Gaster guilty, and fined him three hundred and four dollars, and one costs and he was sent to the prison. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. It is a sad case, and a fair one for that State's Sunday law and its enforcement depends largely upon the result. The law is very vaguely worded.

It is announced that "the total cost of the last congress on new buildings for the Columbian Exposition at Chicago has been one million dollars." Its total bills on exhibits have just been issued, declaring on monthly to destroy their bills and credits not void their realities." In our own country the last Sunday in this month will witness the trial of a number of Seventh-day Adventists in a Tennessee county for fidelity to their faith. There is indeed slight difference between a monarchy and in a republic.

According to the *Cincinnati Post* the names of the World's Fair managers in destroying notes of judgment issued against their assets in financial with regard to the money issued by the authorities for funding their units as financial—$1.99 a square for eight chapters in that city sold, each in its county, certificates $16.50 bond securely Sunday, amounted to two per cent. paid.
