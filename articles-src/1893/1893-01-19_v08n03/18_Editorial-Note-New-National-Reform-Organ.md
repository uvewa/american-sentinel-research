A NEW National Reform organ of the "straitest sect" has been started at Johnstown, Pa., by Rev. M. L. Weaver. The motto of the new paper is, "God's will should be the supreme law of all people and nations," which in this case means, of course, Mr. Weaver's interpretation of God's will. No National Reformer is willing to take the Bible just as it reads and make it the supreme law of even his own life. National Reform means giving some men power to compel others to accept their views of the will of God.
