THE last of the series of four hearings upon the question of Sunday closing of the World's Fair was of more intense interest than any one of the others upon this question. Three hours and a half were occupied. The larger number of speakers were been in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday for the hearing. But having the larger number of speakers does not give the larger number; and the Sabbathists from receiving another very unexpected defeat of this one in the Fair closing. At this final session the opposing forces organized on the question of the Trades and Labor Assembly of Chicago, representing the Trades and Labor interests against Sunday closing in Chicago, while Mrs. Boymen and Mrs. Remick spoke in favor, although with restrictions upon what they had with the religious question.

The questions and candor, the native good sense and the plain understanding of real facts presented by these representatives of the working class were in most striking contrast to much, and indeed to the whole that had been presented upon the other side.

Coming to the argument for closed Sunday in the interest of the laboring classes, Mr. Gompers presented against the laboring claim. He presented against religious petitions as having been circulated representing to one, and of no value, and presented his own facts by his workers and vouchers which should prove that they were presented for what they represented.

These workers Mr. Adams presented in detail. He said there were eleven hundred and seventy-five labor organizations in the city of Chicago, and that the members were continually coming in large numbers, and committees of all, and committees of quarters of his assembly, in Chicago, that there would be a money profit by closing, and slapped away the first commandment within that short time a unanimous expression against Sunday closing had been received from all these assemblies. He presented labor statistics, resolutions, letters and briefs from workers, labor and manufacturer workers so as to the estimates of the American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association.
