A CHRISTIAN lady residing in Aurora, Ill., writes thus of the Tennessee persecutions:—

I have no sympathy at all with that kind of law executing. It is done more for spite than for the good of the land. I consider it an outrage and would like an opportunity of saying so to those who are prying into the privacy of homes, and striving to bind the very conscience.

This lady is a firm believer in Sunday sacredness, but, like thousands of others, revolts at the injustice that is being practiced in Tennessee.
