A NEW movement has been set on foot to enforce Sunday observance in Brazil. And, But as usual the Sunday forces, are not having clear sailing. Mr. George Lyon, a Seventh-day Baptist, the Lyons are of the Seventh-day Baptist Church, and only desire the right to follow their own judgment, and opposing them in the public prints, and only desire the right to form any body to keep Sunday, but challenges them to show from the Bible that Sunday is the Sabbath, or course, this is very strange domain. Mr. Lyon, for he knows too well that there is no scriptural authority for Sunday observance of the Sabbath, and could have no other motive in raising the question than to embarrass the Sunday movement. Mr. Lyon ought to know—and probably does—that such a question as he is asking will ruin the best Sunday movement in the world.
