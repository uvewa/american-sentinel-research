If anything were wanting to convince people generally that the scripture is true which says, "Great men are not always wise," it ought certainly to be afforded by the recent opinion of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, sustaining the Sunday law of that State.

In their opinion, the judges said: "The act of 1794 is a wise and beneficent statute, and we would regret to see it interfered with." But following this is a caution against enforcing the law too strictly. The law is "wise and beneficent," but should not be enforced! A strange law, truly! And not the least peculiar thing about this law is, that while they caution others not to enforce this "wise and beneficent" statute, they say that it is their "plain duty" to enforce it just as they find it!!
