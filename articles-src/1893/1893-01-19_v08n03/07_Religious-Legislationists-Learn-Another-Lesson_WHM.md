THE last of the series of four hearings upon the Sunday opening or closing of the World's Fair was of more intense interest than anything previously heard upon this question. Three hours and a half were occupied in the discussion. Twelve speakers were heard in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, and five in opposition. But having the larger number of speakers present did not save the religious legislationists from receiving another very unwelcome lesson from their opponents. Those who opposed the organized clergy in this final encounter before the committee were Mr. Morgan and Mr. Askew, of Chicago, representing the Trade and Labor Assembly; and Rev. Dr. Thomas, of Chicago, while Mrs. Boysen and Mrs. Washburne replied very concisely to some strictures upon what they had said the previous day.

The openness and candor, the native force and practical character of the views and facts presented by these representatives of the workingmen were in most striking contrast to much, and indeed to most, that has been said at these hearings in support of Sunday closing.

IN SUMMING UP THE ARGUMENT OF CLOSED GATES, REV. DR. GEORGE HAD BELITTED THE PETITIONS HERETOFORE PRESENTED AGAINST REGIGIOUS LEGISLATION AS MEANING nothing, representing no one, and of no value, and called upon his opposers to present the vouchers which should prove that they actually spoke for a known constituency. These vouchers Mr. Askew presented in petitions and resolutions from three hundred and seventy-five labor organizations in thirty-three States, and said that these were continually coming in large numbers, as he had a telegram from the headquarters of his assembly, in Chicago, that on the previous day over thirty had been received. Only little more than a month had elapsed since the first communication had been sent out upon this matter, yet within that short time a unanimous expression in favor of Sunday opening had been received from organized labor all over the United States. While Mr. Askew presented labor statistics, resolutions, petitions and letters which were undeniable and unanswerable vouchers as to the sentiments of the laboring men of the country, he punctuated and emphasized their presentation by concise and clearly stated explanations of the number and character of the organization from which the resolution or petition came, such as could not fail to carry conviction to every one present, however unwilling they might be to receive it, that the workingmen had spoken, and that they had spoken adversely to Sunday closing. The figures of Mr. Askew were in marked contrast to the fanciful estimates of forty and fifty millions of the Sunday closers, and it was evident that here, at last, were figures and figures which did not lie. But the facts which Mr. Morgan set before them were no less startling to their self assurance, and touched their egotism even more keenly. He denied their right to speak for European Socialists whom they had quoted, and said that these men upheld the principles enunciated by Jesus Christ,—"principles" said he, "which you do not understand." An arraignment too bitterly, sadly true,—and never more clearly demonstrated than by the deliverances of some who claimed to be his ambassadors, at these very hearings.

This final session closed with a terse reply from both Mrs. Boyesen and Mrs. Washburne to strictures upon what they had said yesterday. Mrs. Boyesen had reminded the ministers that anarchy was abroad already in this land, and they were not placating it or removing any of the grievances which goad those who carry the red flag, by closing the doors of the Exposition to them on Sunday, but quite the contrary. To this, with a discourteous insincerity, quite unworthy of the credit of their cloth, they had raised the cry of "Anarchy!" Mrs. Boyesen gave them to understand that she had told them a truth, and if an unwelcome truth, they were welcome to make the most of it.

This was the end,—but still the end is not yet. The Sunday-closing faction has visited, by appointed delegation, the President, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor of the Treasury, with the purpose shown in this letter which has been sent to the President:—

To the President: On behalf of millions of citizens who think that Sunday should be kept holy, and of many more millions of land and head laborers who think that Sunday should at least be a day of rest, we ask: That the transfer of souvenir coins provided for by the act of Congress, approved August 5, 1892, from the officers of the United States to the corporation known as the World's Columbian Exposition be suspended until the owners (whoever they may be) of all the grounds included in the site upon which the Columbian Exposition buildings are erected, give their assent to the provision for Sunday closing made by Congress in said act; or until the question reported as mooted in the courts of Illinois by application for an injunction to enjoin the World's Columbian Exposition management from closing the gates on Sunday, be legally determined in favor of such closing; or that, in view of the importance of the subject, in addition to the legal opinion already given by the Solicitor of the Treasury, that the President obtain the opinion of the Attorney-General himself upon the whole subject as affected by the possible intervention of the courts, pending the giving of which opinion the transfer of souvenir coins to cease.

Should the entire $2,500,000 be transferred to the managers of the Fair under the act of Congress and the gates then finally be opened, the sagacity and honor of the present administration would be so impugned that no attempt to cast the onus upon the courts would suffice to justify such a failure of the Executive Department of the Government of the United States to secure conformity with existing law.

On behalf of the General Committee, composed of the friends of Sunday closing.

(Signed) ELLIOTT F. SHEPARD.
CHARLES B. HAMSDELL.

Another step in the progress of the matter is shown by this:—

Congressman John B. Robinson, of Pennsylvania, is preparing, and will introduce in the House, a resolution calling for inquiry as to the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. If it is found open the Attorney-General is instructed to proceed to recover money already paid under the Sunday closing clause. The resolution is not yet drawn, but Mr. Robinson will introduce it as soon as practicable.

Most assuredly the end is not yet.
