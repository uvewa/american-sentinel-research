## Congress and the World's Fair

TUESDAY, January 10, the House Committee on the World's Fair gave the first of the four hearings to be held this week in the question of Sunday at the World's Fair. At the appointed hour there were present a committee from the common council of the city of Chicago, delegated to represent the city, in this matter, before the Home Committee and Congress. There were also present a considerable number of representatives of the American Sabbath Union, and others.

Congressman Durborow, Chairman of the committee, opened the hearing by my remark that it would be proper to state to the committee that the premises in reference thereto from the case as presented a year ago, and that this Sunday-law question has absolutely, as to modify any existing—last year—law; as was the case a year ago. Therefore the new action to be taken, on this occasion, is expected, will be held very closely within the limits of the present act—the act of the last Congress, which simply provides for the modification of the closing provision in the appropriation act, which closed on Sunday by permitting them to be opened under certain conditions.

The resolution, copies of which were placed on the committee room table, was House Resolution 161, which reads as follows:

*Providing for opening the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday*

WHEREAS, by the act of Congress of April twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and ninety two, five millions of Columbian half dollars were appropriated as premiums for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, by holding an International Exposition of the arts, industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mines, and sea, in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois, and said act provides that the exposition shall not be opened to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and

WHEREAS the World's Columbian Exposition was not authorized, nor has the work of preparation been prosecuted, for the promotion of and fostering of any particular religious denomination, creed or sect, but on the contrary is purely of a national character, and is intended to serve the interests and the best interests, not only of all the people of this nation, but of all the nations of the world who are to take part in, and contribute to, said Exposition; and

WHEREAS said Exposition will consist of representatives of all that is good and useful, tending to the happiness and elevation of the people in arts, in science, art, education, and history such as can not but leave a lasting impress upon our civilization; and said Exposition should be so conducted as to be of equal benefit and advantage to all people alike; and

WHEREAS it is enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That section five of "An act to provide for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus by holding an international exposition of the arts, industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mines, and seas, in the State of Illinois," and appropriating money therefor," be, and the same is hereby, modified as follows:

SECTION 1. That it shall be lawful to modify the action of the World's Fair directory of Chicago made in compliance with the conditions which were created by the act of Congress of April twenty-five, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, or such other rules or modifications of the rules of said World's Fair directory as will not require the Exposition to will predict the use, on Sundays, of such machinery as may be in that Exposition and running, and at the same time give scope for the free study and the display of the liberal arts and mechanical science; that the art galleries, horticultural building, and all other buildings and grounds of the said Exposition shall be open, and that it shall be thrown open to the public on each and every day of the week, including the first day; and that each employee of said Exposition shall have one day's rest out of every seven days.

This, of course, rules out entirely any question of the constitutional or moral principles involved. Nevertheless, Mayor Washburne expressed sound views upon this point in two or three ways during the hearings.

Mr. A. T. Jones also upon the unconstitutionality of the Sunday-closing law as passed by Congress in the legislation and arguing from that the necessity for its repeal from the moment at the beginning of his discussion when Congressman Belman asked Mr. Jones to what denomination he belonged, and Mr. Jones replied,—after explaining that was a matter in which the committee could properly have no interest,—he did state that the cause of the present growing spirit of derision arose among non-church-going people. He presented the representations of the American Sabbath Union and their representations—that different opposition, the sentiment of the community; etc; and commission, setting toward the close of the addresses; when Mr. Jones referred to the meeting in Chicago when Sunday closing resolution had been voted down,—in expressions of disapproval and sinister implications scarcely befitting the dignity of the place and occasions.

## Developed into a Religious Council.

The second day's hearing before the House Committee on the World's Fair developed into a religious council. The entire session was devoted to hearing the advocates of Sunday closing. The common room was crowded, and those present were, with few exceptions, ministers of different denominations.

Col. Elliot F. Shepard, as president of the American Sabbath Union, led the presentation of the speakers. Those who addressed the committee were Col. Shepard, himself; the Rev. Dr. Ramsell, of Washington; the Rev. Joseph Cook, of Boston; the Rev. Mr. McCullagh, of Tennessee; the Rev. Dr. Fernley, of Philadelphia; the Rev. W. F. Crafts, of Pittsburgh; the Rev. Dr. Henson, of Chicago; the Rev. Dr. Hamilton, of Washington; the Rev. Dr. McAllister; the Rev. Dr. Christie, from Asia Minor; Mr. Ceda, of Iowa; the Rev. Dr. Paton, of Pennsylvania; Mrs. La Fetra, of Washington. Alderman Sexton, the only member of the committee from the common council of the city who did not address the committee in favor of Sunday closing, but who spoke of the religious belief and views of the Nation, two represented the American Sabbath Union, in another; and Col. Shepard stated the farmers of his State, as well, another represented the Connecticut Sabbath Observance Union, of the District of Columbia, and the Rev. Mr. McCullagh described the fourth of the hearing as days of special prayer, that the law for preventing the opening of the Fair be not repealed, and said that all Christian people can join with them to daily prayer to the same minister; and they then informed the committee to be brought with his resolutions signed by eight or ten societies of Washington, demanding that legislation to close the World's Fair be not repealed, under or otherwise.

Nobody attempted to deny the claim that the Fair was sufficient to show that the closing was done purely for religious reasons, for none other world have thought of asking it.

That which the speakers had to say was presented with more fluency and force, and in some cases with marked ability. Every argument of the time was offered, and the management of this portion of the hearing exceeded most strikingly the facility which these organizations have for mobilizing their forces, and working together in perfect mutual, and accord to the same end. That the reason is differences of opinion upon religious legislation does cause great discordancy, entire combinations, and incooperation; when brought together and compared, it well known is did to who have any intelligent student to other movements or voting. They suffered considerably in this case from the fact that in the convergency of so many conflicting views placed with great proximity.

Upon two things, however, there was common ground, viz: first, the uncompromising, and these were that by decision of the Supreme Court this was a "Christian Nation," and legislation asked by its religious people should be had. The religious people of Christianity, therefore, permitted, on their hands and in the interest of the common welfare, to ask legislation embodying their ideals, precedents, and social customs that control their own church practice, to constitutional principles entirely failing, and their reasoning was entirely over. The one difficulty in this case, however, was that at the foot of congressmen—composed of men of the world and of commercial and constitutional principles, that it must be established that it was not a religious matter, and Congress this matter should leave alone, since doing it could be no doubt about all; and, that the necessity for such a show was illustrated wholly, and that there was is that it did not know what it was talking about, is to say a word upon this Sunday-closing matter from its standpoint was absurd and contrary religious view of the matter; and that, to say a word upon the advocacy of Sunday from the religious standpoint, an advocacy of the Sunday-closing provision would be a reflection upon the intelligence of the Congress that passed it, and the President of the United States who signed it.

Another fact that should be stated is that a great crowd of even the Sunday-closing people would not care to acknowledge that the argument really and truly made wholly depended the Sunday closing clause. It was a curious position for churchmen to be in—to be dependent on the commercial view and the graces of practical oratory to be able to succeed—but the Sabbath Unionists from Col. Shepard to the humblest of his presentation, to persuade them that Sunday closing was right because it was a wise business measure, and to suggest to them, that when they were looking at it with commercial eyes, it was acknowledged by the repeal of this law. It was rather curious for churches to see the official stationery of the church of the Church of the United States by the secular of its forces, and commercialism was the one strong card in the play, all this for a religious measure.

## A Day of Contending Parties.

More eloquence was heard, and a much greater interest caused, on the third day of the hearing before the World's Fair closing days. The committee sat from ten o'clock until half past twelve, and the time was divided equally between the contending parties. Dr. Atterbury, of the American Sabbath Union, appeared for the speakers who favored the Sunday closing. His principal argument was that the New York Sabbath Association, organized for the enforcement of Sunday rest, had been in existence thirty-five years, and was not of a theological caste as to management, but composed of business men and workingmen. Letters were read from the Federation of Labor and the Trades Council of New York, in which they took the position of opposing Sunday closing of the Fair. The speakers in opposition to Sunday closing of the Fair were: Mr. A. T. Jones; Robert L. Belknap, of New York; D. C. Gifford Agnew, of New York; Mrs. Welch, of Illinois; the Rev. Herrick Johnson, of Chicago; the Rev. Dr. Brooks, of New York.

Mr. Jones presented the constitutional argument in opposition to the views of Sunday closing of the Fair. Among the ladies who appeared were Mrs. Boymen, Mrs. Remick and Mrs. Sexton. Mrs. Boymen presented a paper from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Miss Susan B. Anthony; Rev. Mr. Grover, of Ohio; Rev. Minot J. Savage, of Boston; Mr. Morgan, of Chicago; Robert L. H. Putnam, of Cambridge; and Mr. Adams, of the American Secular Union.

The points presented for Sunday closing were not new; those presented in opposition were, only in some instances expressed in new dress, but pressed home with additional vigor of intensity. One minister's peculiarity quite fully his insensible inability to recognize the distinction between the religious and the civil argument was truly breathtaking. His mental blindness was evidently shared by some others who could, for they scarcely listened to his propositions that laws against religion are not bad even at the World's Fair, should be precisely the same. The idea that such anything on the Fair grounds would be an evil, but that the practice the passage of Sunday laws, by these people against Seventh-day Adventists are all evil was lost on the speakers, "if that be so, then the Constitution does not the except in the clause 'Sundays excepted.'" Mr. Putnam, of Cambridge, clearly showed the fallacy of this notion in a few simple words. Nor will the same thing be but too many multitudes of times and yet the foolishness be not shown.

The Woman's Club, of Chicago, sent a delegation of three wise and witty women, who addressed the committee with fine ability, arguing deftly against each point and alternately to the ministerial talk of the question of what should be done about the 50,000 Sunday clergymen almost out of his sense by what they said. They were such a rebuke as they had never received since they left their mothers' knees. That any one, much less a woman, should bravely proceed to take a disposition to look, them in, beyond belief; and still more intoxicating and horrifying was it, that, coming from a woman, they were obliged to endure it though a very proper. This disinclination to listen to correction was emphasized by some, treachery applause and cries of, "Hear! Hear!" This gallantry, already imperfect, receiving from them much more of an illustration, further confirmation and that the same considerations of gallantry required, as a matter of common courtesy which they had before failed to demonstrate.

The Rev. Mr. Cross, a Presbyterian clergyman, from Ohio, stated in his own and manly a way at the direction that has gone pouring in reputed politicians; that the first two paragraphs of his remarks are quoted here, inasmuch, on as a matter of to which the SENTINEL has both frequently and strongly called attention.

In Chairman and gentlemen of the Committee: My profession of the world is such that, as a matter of some right, and a little information, I felt at first drawn to this occasion. I am a minister of an orthodox church. I am a minister of an orthodox church position are exceedingly delicate, as to the relation of Church and State. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church at Portland, Oregon, Presbyterians passed a resolution, saying that we in some sense represent something in the country, we claim to represent fairly, or to represent of many of the same church members alluded to above—ours is not altogether a small denomination, and say we represent fifty, seventy or consequently we carry a great deal of weight.

But I want to say to you, Mr. Chairman, those who are counted as voting for the sentiments expressed in the resolutions of the General Assembly, were not asked to express their views upon this subject,—which is so much opposed in social politics. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, claiming to represent eighty church members that were not consulted, is a sample of the way in which the whole thing was done—as a church political vote was taken by the Sunday school superintendent and not by the Christian citizens themselves as to whether the expression, "World's Fair" meant or did not mean Sunday. But we are here, and intend to practice in Chicago.

I desire to say to you in this committee of the House, and to the country, that this whole question is religious but you can not tell by the work and I challenge that assertion; and of the one end of the religious press, and the exhortation of rises to call it, or to make prayer that is religious; and they say to the few that are voting, that is religious; and then they say it is not religious. We are in favor of a religious holiday and they want to decide this question without any impartisan declarations—upon a political basis, and that is not consistent with the civil thereof. Justice. I notice a tendency—and I am sorry to make this declaration—I notice church papers to gloss over the fact that "we need Sunday rest." And when a man is down and you want to trample upon him, and you have own strength, to urge Congress; we have brided the Columbian Exposition management. Give us the law of the United States, against our fellow citizens, and against various other of our citizens.

These things Mr. Cross deprecated, and such a spirit, and the Rev. Herrick Johnson, of this same point and quoted an opinion to the effect that in which it was to state in the true that "figures will lie," yet it was after understanding a fact that "you can lie with figures." For the application of this in general it is gracefully, you'd from it is unserviceably apt.

Mr. James T. Ringgold, of Baltimore, opened the day's session with an earnest legal appeal in which he also found opportunity to state his views and his experience in matters of religion upon religious grounds. He then gave facts that far more fully than any of these hearings yet seen, the unfaithful displacement of constitutionality, and the extreme indiscretion of criticisms or comments.
