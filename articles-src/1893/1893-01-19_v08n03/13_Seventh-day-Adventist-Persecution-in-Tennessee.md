FOR the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, that excellent publication, the *Adventist Outlook*, says: "This on an American, on Christian persecution of Sabbath-keepers is a blot on its history as a State, one which will cloud the name of Tennessee for years to come; and the comparative silence of the religious press, in condemnation of it, gives too much color to the idea that better men than those who have instigated the wrong than done, are willing that it should go unrebuked.

"This lady is a firm believer in Sunday association, but, like thousands of others, revolts at the injustice that is being practiced."

A NEW National Reform organ of the gospel has been started at Johnstown, Pa., by Rev. H. P. M. In the course of the paper, it is, "God's law is the supreme law of all people and nations," which in this case means, of course, Mr. Weaver's interpretation of that law. National Reform is simply willing to take the Bible just as it asks us; not the supreme law are not living of our life. National Reform means giving their own power to compel God's own.

A PITTSBURG dispatch of the 4th inst. says that the Law and Order Society is well pleased with the action of the State Supreme Court in upholding the Sunday law regarding the publication of newspapers, but will make no effort to stop the publishers. It will aim to work to stop delivery and all traffic in Sunday papers. President James W. Houston, speaking for the Law and Order Society, said: "The decision is just what we expected, and will in no way affect our movement."
