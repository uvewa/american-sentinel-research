JANUARY 9, Mr. Storey, of the Tennessee legislature, introduced a bill repealing the law against barbering on Sunday in that State. It does not appear, however, that any member of the legislature sees any incongruity in the law which sends a man to the chain-gang for sprouting stumps in his back field on Sunday.
