# Bearing False Witness.

THE following is from the *Pacific Methodist*, published in San Francisco:—

A SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST.

A body of Seventh-day Adventists parked a large tent in the southeastern part of the city last week, and when the ballot on Sabbath-closing of the Fair was taken, they all voted against closing. The fact that such people voted against the Fair and these people is something amazing. Both self-interest and religious enthusiasm, in the interest of a protesting religious meeting, with the result above stated. Verily the whole world—the flesh and the devil—has joined battle. And this comes as a bitter foe to the civil Sabbath, and mass religious meeting, with much power, to induce people on properly assent to take part in civil elections and in other public measures; and yet the secular paper assumes that the resolutions of such meetings are the expression of the community at large. This is distinctly and purely an organ of this sinful, has been for scores of years doing its best to destroy the sanctity of the Sabbath. It would sweep every vestige of the Sabbath from the statute-books; and it would destroy the Sabbath in the minds and hearts of all around. Nobody objects to these people keeping their own Sabbath in their own way—but when one of their number comes out and takes a position on the badge of civilization and Christianity—

Our first remark will remember that the facts concerning this meeting were published in these columns three weeks ago. We shall, however, state them very briefly again.

The meeting which, according to the *Advocate*, the Adventists, wrote as each meeting of the American Sabbath Union and was advertised as a "mass meeting," and everybody was invited, and of course anybody who wanted to go had a perfect right to go, and to vote when there.

The meeting, though advertised as a mass meeting, drew but a very small attendance. Out of a city of over a million, about only about one hundred persons were present, and but little more than one-thirds of those present took interest enough in the proceedings to vote. When the real facts are brought to the attention of those who are disinterested on Sunday law, the same old spirit is aroused that has promoted, and the persecution of the early Christians, and wherever possible, made itself is achieved in the same way. As aspirants of a form of the gospel to preach on this subject, the following from the *Davenport (Iowa) Democrat* is in illustration.

It is amazing to hear the Massachusetts committee report, that as they have been contending against the opening of the doors of the Columbian Exposition to visitors on Sunday, a lot of old Doomsday Chronologists in remember the Sabbath day and to keep it holy. Those people, it is very comfortable to have their consciences quiet and the thunderings of Sinai. Let it be distinctly understood that we have no wish to hand the claim to quotes as being binding to recommend in other to more faithful men and women their arguments upon either one side of this question, has no reference whatever to the Sabbath or any other religious institution, and every Biblical or other schools knows that on keeping the commandments about keeping an essential part of that covenant. The controversy arrangement concerns only the question of placing a for the pages day of worship,—the day of the Son, called by the Revelator "the Lord's Day." These Seventh-day Adventists are—with a perfect recklessness, and fully the seventh commandment, in order to destroy the—and have at least degree of seriousness.

It is evident that by reason of this controversy themselves are being made as Seventh-day Adventists as people who observe the Sabbath by divine appointment, but that it only rests upon by the.
