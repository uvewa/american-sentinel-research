A PITTSBURG dispatch of the 4th inst. says that the Law and Order Society is well pleased with the action of the State Supreme Court in upholding the Sunday law regarding the publication of newspapers, but will make no effort to stop their publication. It will aim to stop their delivery and all traffic in Sunday papers.

President James W. Houston, speaking for the Law and Order Society, said: "The decision is just what we expected, and will in no way affect our movements. We will pursue the even tenor of our way, filing informations with magistrates for every Sunday's work done by carriers and agents of newspapers, and others engaged in promoting their circulation and distribution. We have no intention of prosecuting editors, reporters or compositors. The reporters and editors are a specially formed class generally, and will be exempt from any responsibility shifted on them by their mercenary employers."
