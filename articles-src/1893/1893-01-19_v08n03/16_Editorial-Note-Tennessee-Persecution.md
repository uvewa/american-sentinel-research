Of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, that excellent publication, the Sabbath Outlook, says: "This un-American, un-Christian persecution of Sabbath-keepers is a blot on the history of our time which will cloud the name of Tennessee for years to come; and the comparative silence of the religious press, in condemnation of it, gives too much color to the idea that better men than those who have instigated the wrong thus done, are willing that it should go unrebuked."
