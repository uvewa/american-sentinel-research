It is announced that "the Czar has decided upon new hardships for the Jews within his realm. Six edicts have just been issued, declaring no mercy for the Jews, and directly aiming to destroy their influence and crush out their religion." In our own country the last Monday in this month will witness the trial of a number of Seventh-day Adventists in a Tennessee court for fidelity to their faith. There is indeed slight difference between intolerance in a monarchy and in a republic.
