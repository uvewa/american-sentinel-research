# Religion and Infidelity in France.

THE truth stated in a recent SENTINEL editorial, that infidelity has been caused by the infidelity of the French Revolution, gains startling emphasis from the words of John Smith, the very reverend author.

The religion of the French Revolution was a natural result of the superstitions tyranny of the Church of Rome. It was a revolt of a people, but returning their natural intelligence against the wretched miseries imposed.

It has not also been a lesson timely for us to learn. That there are many, very few of them, very down beneath the surface that these things to the government.

That which is most grievous to be borne, however, is the fact that these clergymen, when discovered, who was to be only philosopher, with a disposition showing, they had this very reason. It should be especially that every other man had this very same fault. But in France the Roman Catholic Church would not block the whole "paradise" of the millennium, and put back to the "Glorious Revolution" (so-called as the "paradise" of the millenniums, and put it to Napoleon and his). When all others made to make of France was, although a truly busy, but all were alike powerless to remedy the evil; and the revolution that beasts unrebuked by the power of Christianity.

Replying to M. Roux, who in his "History of Jesus," tells us that Christianity "will vanish in cloud of day, after the eighteen hundred years of preparation, one might have naturally indulged in a dream, he says in his history of that epoch—

Accordingly as to say and considering some wretched existence that they might be saved. Christians have nothing to fear from that sort.

The history of those days shows how mistaken were those who abandoned the true principles, and seek to attain their aims through subservience of evil as at the

religious liberty, know not to what lengths they may be led. Mild manners and a genial disposition are not proof against the temptation and resulting logic of wrong principles coupled with intense depravity and Satanic suggestion. It is a matter of record that Robespierre in his early career engulfed a judgeship of Arras rather than pronounce a sentence of death; yet he followed his theories to the bitter end, and at last became, he is despised by all, as a monster of cruelty which he never believed himself to be. Another, Danton, was too late the ruin and strove to restrain France going to its full length of the blood he had helped to let loose. When at last condemned to the guillotine for trying to stay the torrent, he was heard to say:—

"I wish this were merely a dream," and then another said, "Yes, we have all been sleepers of that same Revolutionary Tribunal. I crave pardon of God and of man." They never set poor fishermen free to meddle with governing of nations.

Those and other popular idols were cast down by the maddened Paris mob until "I found itself to have been guided, not to a destination, but to a massacre." What a warning to those who in the slightest degree, for any fancied good, to come out of it, are diverging from principles of right and truth and lending hands to evil.

Those who nowadays believe in an official religion, and the enforcement of Sunday laws in our country, frequently cite the unhappy condition of France, with the hope of awakening fears among the people.

"This country is not France," said a Chicago paper. "True. But is not the situation in France very like that which these same clergy are working to bring about in our country? When Napoleon was reconstructing France, Lafayette tried to have him adopt the true principle—the separation of religion and the State, which was working so well in the new Republic across the Atlantic. But Napoleon, centered only immediate expedience, said that: "Lafayette has learned nothing and forgotten nothing." A folly, when it is wished to apply to a remote continent the lesson of the country would new France the old curse of taking religion as a department of State. And to-day—why should those who wish to make the State a teacher of religion and a guardian of religious observance in this country, point the finger of reproach at France, where the State now subsidizes its churches as public ministers of morality, and salaries not only Catholics and Protestants, but Jews and Mohammedans as well? Official religion has helped to make France what it is, and says the recognition of God in the constitution of that republic for years has been the influence on the side of license and against the restraints of morals, religion, self-respect and prestige. How then can American citizens hope to be new anything but ruin and disruption in the efforts of religion makes to set in operation here the same forces which have been the curse of Church and State confusion in all other lands.
