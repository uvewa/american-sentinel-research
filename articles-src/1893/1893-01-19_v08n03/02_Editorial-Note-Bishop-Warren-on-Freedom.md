BISHOP H. W. WARREN, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, says that "freedom in religion must not mean freedom from religion." This is a fitting companion piece to the definition of religious freedom by Cardinal Gibbons that "religious freedom is freedom to worship God according to the dictates of a right conscience." The two utterances are fitting companions, for both are essentially papal.
