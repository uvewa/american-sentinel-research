# Sunday Laws in the United States.

*We reprint the following article, written by Mr. W. A. Blakely, of this city, from the current number of the "Chautauquan" magazine. The title chosen by the author was "The Legal Aspect of the Sunday Question." We have thought the title here used a more appropriate one. Mr. Blakely is the author of that comprehensive work, "American State Papers Bearing on Sunday Legislation," a volume of over nine hundred pages, containing a general history, bearing upon the question of Sunday legislation in all its phases.*

THE constitutionality and the constitutionality of "Sunday" laws have been considered by the courts of this country in more than one thousand cases. So far as this mere weight of authority can settle anything, it is settled that such laws are valid under the Federal Constitution, and under the constitution of every State in which their validity has been contested.

But there are traces of a union of Church and State elsewhere in the body of American law (as in statutes against blasphemy, profanity, questions required by witnesses, etc.), but Sunday laws are by far the most conspicuous of the remaining inheritances of ours from the English form of government.

To say that Sunday laws represent a "union of Church and State," and that the weight of authority sustains such laws in the United States, sound to many to be an impeachment of our judiciary, because the absolute separation of the law is commonly regarded as an axiom of American politics. Yet both propositions are established.

The reason, of course, is established by a more covering of the cases. The reading of them is enough to establish the first. But many of the courts that sustained to Sunday laws as interfering with the religious liberty of the citizens, and declare their constitutionality has been assailed on the ground that they are exclusively the ground that they are exclusively on the ground that they are exclusively assailed on the ground that they have a religious character, solely and exclusively assailed on the ground that they are of a religious character. And not one of the judges who have sustained their constitutionality on religious grounds has ever ventured the assertion that they are wrong, or that their constitutionality is asked for, on any other ground than this. And where a statute is passed or the enforcement of which is asked for on religious grounds, represents a union of Church and State, the courts maintain on what other grounds the courts sustain.

It is difficult to formulate a general statement of existing "Sunday" statutes outside of the Federal system, because each of the States has its own, which differs widely, and the language of the statutes and any particular subject is equally at variance. The force of this remark, as to Sunday laws, can be easily made unified, by the interesting fact discovered and noted by Mr. Stimson in the preface to the invaluable "American Statute Law," that there are in the Union at least one group of States and another group of States (of which he finds two), follows a uniform line, different from that pursued by each of the others.

One of Mr. Stimson's "streams of tendency," which holds in all the Eastern States, whose constitutions declare in substance that no "preference" shall be given by law to any religious sect over another. If we admit that there is a like provision in the constitutions for "religious freedom" or the maintenance of the first stream—as we must admit, unless we are willing to admit that a simple declaration of preference is all—well known are the State laws in defiance of such constitutional and other declarations—whence we may find the general result of the decisions to date. It is in connection with the statutes of such States, if they gave a "preference" to one religion over another by requiring that they give any such preference.

The constitutionality of a statute may be regarded from two standpoints—that of the State and of the Nation. Neither "origin" need not be confounded with the other for (as in statutes against blasphemy) or which were originally imported by, or which formed corrupt motives as in the constitutional corruption of any other thing, or be better settled than that this one constitutionally may sustain the.

But suppose the legislature, by no means to the legislatures themselves, were to confessedly aim at the accomplishment of a religious object not of a religious means? This situation to accomplish. And let it be obvious then, what could be said of the statute passed with such an aim is sustained by the courts, this result will be accompanied by the unconscious and the accomplishments of the unconscious legal triumph. And a course of decisions sustaining the statute merely became precedents for sustaining legislation at the same point, at which the legislature might be more open about its real.

These beliefs connect themselves with two things, belief concerning and the. If it desires a "preference"—as the contrary requiring a two-third—one requires a certain belief. A "preference" is given to those who believe and withheld from those who it forbids or dose not require. Hence, it is always a question, under a "preference" law.—What religion or religion creed or faith is established by this preference? And when this is answered it is also answered what religion is prohibited? Does it rest on any religious creed or belief? The creed of the Bible or the teachings, or the general traditions of, say, the Protestant Churches, or the Talmud, or the God of Islam—or neither of the above?

Such, in brief, are the statutory lines the dogma be invalidated, yet a "preference" is given to one religious establishment over another by the mere regulation of outward conformity. The whole question, whenever the conduct is regulated on the basis of mere religion; whether by the prescription of any religious sect, or when they ask for its enforcement, as an act offenses against religion or the first against a certain sect for the "observance" of a day on its religious grounds.

The true Protestant idea of the province of government, is best stated in the famous *Remonstrance* of the Protestants of Germany at the Diet of Spires from which Protestantism takes its name.

In all matters of conscience the majority has no power of commanding. And it is the very avoidance of any such thought of compulsion in matters of religion.
