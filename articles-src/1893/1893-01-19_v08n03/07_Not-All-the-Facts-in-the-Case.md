# Not All the Facts in the Case.

No one at all in touch with the times can deny that there is a growing disregard for Sunday observance on the part of the public. In spite of the increase of churches and the multiplying of pastors, the tide is not checked; but rather as was recently expressed in these columns by a typical National Reformer, "We can hardly tell now what day Sunday comes on." What is the matter? It is simply this, the people see how poorly the religion is observed, and the people are beginning to find it out; and having found it out, what is more natural than that it should lose its sacredness in the minds of those who have professed to believe in its sacred appointment? One of the things that the adherent finding out and acting upon is developing is this very fact; and when the real facts concerning this meeting were published in these columns three weeks ago. We shall, however, state them very briefly again.

The meeting which, according to the *Advocate*, the Adventists, wrote as each meeting of the American Sabbath Union and was advertised as a "mass meeting," and everybody was invited, and of course anybody who wanted to go had a perfect right to go, and to vote when there.

The meeting, though advertised as a mass meeting, drew but a very small attendance. Out of a city of over a million, about only about one hundred persons were present, and but little more than one-thirds of those present took interest enough in the proceedings to vote. When the resolutions were presented the Adventist could not endorse them, and so voted against them, as they had a perfect right to do, and greatly to their credit also. These facts found—being a majority of those voting, though as a matter of fact they were, probably only a minority of the whole number present.

There was no packing of the meeting. The Adventists that attended the meeting were people who lived in the same locality in which they reside, and because the meeting was in their neighborhood, they evidently made no effort to "pack" the meeting, for had they tried, they could easily have brought together a delegation out of a much larger number than they did have, for the central publishing house and some of the streets and buildings to be found in meeting in the city of Chicago would easily supply two or three times the number; and that such a meeting could be controlled by outsiders, is very evident.

In light of these statements we wish to ask the *Pacific Methodist* one question: Is not the religious paper that would publish such representation responsible?—the Sabbath by divine appointment, but that it only rests upon the.
