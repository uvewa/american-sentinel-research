A NEW movement has been set on foot to enforce Sunday observance in Bradford, Pa. But as usual the Sunday forces are not having clear sailing. Mr. George H. Lyon, a civil engineer, and a member of the Seventh-day Baptist Church, is opposing them in the public prints, and not only denies their right to force anybody to keep Sunday, but challenges them to show from the Bible that Sunday is the Sabbath. Of course, this is very inconsiderate in Mr. Lyon, for he knows very well that there is no scriptural authority whatever for Sunday keeping, and he could have no other motive in raising the question than to embarrass the Sunday preachers who are back of the Sunday movement. Mr. Lyon ought to know—and probably does—that such questions as he is asking will ruin the best Sunday theology in the world.
