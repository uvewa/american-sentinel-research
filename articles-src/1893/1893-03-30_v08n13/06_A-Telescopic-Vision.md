In commenting upon an attack lately made by a company of socialists upon a Roman Catholic meeting, at Roubaix, France, the *Mail and Express* says:—

> Every man has the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, whatever may be the objectionable peculiarities of his worship, so long as he does not violate the ordinary principles of morality or offer offense to the requirements of social order, or interfere with the free and full exercise of the same right by others.

After describing the riotous acts of the mob the comment continues:—

> This is the same spirit that animates the cruel and craven assaults upon the Armenians and Protestant missionaries by the Turkish Government, and the brutal and bigoted persecution of the Lutherans, the Mennonites and the Jews, by the Russian Government. Such an attack upon a single honest worshiper is an attack upon all worship that springs from conscience and not coercion, and is in direct violation of not only the principles and precepts of Christianity, but also of the principles and laws of civilization.

Why does the *Mail and Express* always cover its religious vision with a telescope warranted to disclose nothing within three thousand miles? This country is full of the same spirit which has animated these assaults and prompted the persecutions which the *Mail and Express* enumerates. Scenes of violence and of persecution similar in character, have been enacted here. They have not been mentioned by the *Mail and Express* to deprecate them in any case; indeed the course which the *Mail and Express* takes in reference to coercion in religion at home directly tends to cause the very same acts which it declares to be, abroad, in direct violation of the principles and precepts of Christianity, and of the principles and laws of civilization. This is true; but it is no less true in this country than in France. If it is the theory of the *Mail and Express* that only the American Sabbath Union and its followers have a right to exercise coercion in religious matters why not say so openly, for it is evident that the only difference between the persecutors and religious coercionists of Europe and of this country is that there they are not members of the American Sabbath Union.
