[The following defense of the Tennessee Adventists was published in the *Post-Intelligencer*, Paris, Tenn., March 3.]

Before an old resident of Henry County, and for years a subscriber to our county paper, I would kindly ask a little space in your columns to correct what I feel sure is a misapprehension on your part and also on the part of many of your readers.

I am an Adventist, and the misapprehension which I refer to is as to the contents of certain tracts circulated by myself and other members of the same church within a few weeks past. In your issue of February 10, you accuse "the Adventists" of being the "tools" of "anarchists" in maligning the good name of our country and its citizens by circulating their falsehoods.

This is a serious charge, and one that ought not to be made against anybody, even the members of a small and despised sect, unless it is clearly true.

After reading the several articles in the *Post-Intelligencer* I again read carefully copies of the two tracts circulated, by myself and by my brethren, namely, "Religious Intolerance in the Republic," and "In the Chain-Gang for Conscience's Sake," and I must say that as I understand the matter neither of these publications contain a single statement of facts that is not substantially true.

Some of the opinions and conclusions may appear too strong to those who look at this question from a different standpoint than our own. But is it kind, not to say Christian, to thus attack us because certain gentlemen have expressed opinions which you do not deem warranted by the facts? If we have circulated false charges against any, we will, if convinced of the fact, gladly retract them. But your charge against us is made in too general terms to admit of anything but a general denial.

For Judge Swiggart, both myself, and so far as I know, my brethren, entertain a very high regard. Under the rulings of the Supreme Court, His Honor could not favor us any more than he has done. We believe that the whole proceedings are as distasteful to him, as they are distressing to us.

We bring no railing accusations against Attorney General Lewis, but feel that he has gone beyond the requirements of his oath in prosecuting us as he has. We are not the judges of his motives, but we have a painful personal knowledge of the facts.

So far as we are concerned the charges which we make that our prosecution is religious persecution, does not refer so much to the officers charged with the enforcement of the law, as to those who have urged them on and insisted that we must be prosecuted, but who have not had the manhood to face us in open court and swear that our quiet Sunday work was an annoyance to them. Our immediate neighbors are not annoyed, why should those be who live at a distance of several miles from us? It is simply the annoyance of intolerance which they mistake for the nobler feelings of patriotism.

You cite the fact that six employees of the P. T. & A. R. R. company were also indicted as evidence that we are not discriminated against on account of religion. But why were not some of the white employees of the railroads indicted, if the purpose is simply to stop Sunday work, no difference by whom? Why are only negroes and Adventists indicted?

It is not our purpose to defy the law. We claim that according to the letter and spirit of the constitution of the State of Tennessee we have the right to work on Sunday as on other days provided we do not thereby interfere with the rights of others. True, the Supreme Court has taken a different view of the matter, but even supreme courts are not infallible, and sometimes reverse their own decisions, which our Supreme Court may yet do in this matter. Nor are we alone in this view of the constitutional question. His Honor, Judge Swiggart said in open court last summer, that were it not for the decision of the Supreme Court he would be inclined to hold that our work was not a nuisance. And in an interview given a reporter of the *Memphis Commercial*, one of the most eminent citizens of this county, Ex-Governor Porter, stated, that according to his understanding of the constitution we were suffering wrongfully.

It is the testimony of our enemies that in all else we are good citizens. We desire to be so in all things, but as we understand the law of God, the seventh day is the only divinely appointed Sabbath, and that we have no right to habitually rest upon another day and even outwardly observe it as different from other days. You may say that this is a foolish notion, but that does not free us from the obligations to preserve consciences void of offense toward God.

We are sorry that we can not always obey both God and man, but in case of conflict between the two, with the apostles we choose to obey God rather than man, and we believe that under the constitution of the State we have the right so to do.

J. H. DORTCH.
