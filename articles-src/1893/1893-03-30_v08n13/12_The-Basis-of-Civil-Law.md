THOSE more or less fully recognized and adequately protected in all ages and in all countries. Doubtless before the giving of the law upon Mount Sinai, theft, murder, adultery, false witness and disregard of paternal authority were more or less recognized as worthy of the severest punishment, and were, to some extent at least, made the subject of civil law, not because they were contrary to divine revelation but because they were subversive of self-evident human rights.

Illustrations on ancient Egyptian tombs show that that heathen people had a code of morals embracing many of the prohibitions of little, if any, inferior to our own; but little, if any, inferior to our own not from divine revelation as was ours, but they were able to read in the grand book of nature and of human experience, and upon this their laws and customs were based, though in practice, these called Christian peoples, they fell very far short of their ideals of right and justice.

The Decalogue is not for the purpose of furnishing a code of civil law, but purely for the purpose of setting forth that standard which, in the ways of creation, for His own honor, and for the benefit and protection of every other man. And in any violation of this law it is an unsaved God. When David had done Uriah the two most revolting wrongs one man can do to another, and was by the Spirit of the Lord brought to a realization of his offense, his confession was: "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned." What was wrong was done to Uriah, but the sin was against God, and the whole purpose of the divine law is to define sin. "For where sin abounded the grace of the law the might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound," "For the strength of sin is the law," and "sin is spiritual" it "is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart;" it is a violation of the sixth commandment and of the seventh. Matt. 5:17-37.

The divine law deals with thoughts as well as with conduct. "Thou shalt not covet" is wholly spiritual; "That law is of a most holy spiritual sort, that is, the law that takes the same view of it as any law can take cognizance of the processes of thought." The State can take hold of six commandments which many people think constitute human duty, but no spiritual law can never be made the basis of a human legislation. Any attempt in this direction is simply to usurp a divine prerogative.

On the other hand, the commandment against idolatry relates not only to the feelings but to the act as well. Were the first two true Hebrew statutes might properly have the same feeling of Pope gotten images which the king of Babylon set up in the plain of Dura, and commanded all to worship. Nor could any civil government. But the Son says that a law prohibiting idolatry is a civil law, or even capable of being based on an absurdity. But why? If any man owes a duty to God, as we might in law, why not that command as well as any other? Idolatry is as much an outward act as is murder or adultery; all these exist in the mind; they are covered, by the same expression in fact; and would we equally lay hold beyond the domain of civil law upon any other basis than that of conserving natural rights.

THE *Jewish Times and Observer* quotes Rabbi Krauskopf upon the World's Fair.

If the World's Fair were an object of commerce it would have a right to open or close it whenever it pleased. But since it is to be a national affair, with international attractions; since it is to introduce the sanction and patronage of the United States Government, no question connected with the matter of its conduct can be dismissed from the religious point of view, more or less expected for some. The best thing Government can do is to prevent every one to stay away from it who wishes to stay away. And all that the church that is opposed to Sunday opening should demand, is its right "to remove God from all the earth," is its attempt to remove those who so.

The provisions of the legal steps which are being taken in the case may be the Sunday opening of the Fair. All that can be seen, if that he so, how many church membership will be filled on that Sunday afternoon.

In a report to the United States Senate we find that it is claimed, that—

What others call religious toleration, we call the destruction of religion. Government of which government can not be dissolved by act of law.

But this is no proper true; the courts are very apt to do that which legislatures have substituted limited simply religious for universal liberty. For as Prof. Ames addressed the Federal Convention, they by the Supreme Court, to be constitutional; but it first keeping with the Church and State in the Constitution. Let every fair judgment be satisfied that this country was first settled by Europeans, and that the great majority of the settlers professed the Christian religion, however destitute of religious form, it simply was not true to them, the Christian settlers of that country, to Christians, while it was necessarily well known of the light of country when the amendment was adopted.
