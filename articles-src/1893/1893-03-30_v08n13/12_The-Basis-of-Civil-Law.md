In a recent editorial article on Sunday legislation, the *Colorado Sun* said:—

> Some of the requirements of the Mosaic code—those prohibiting murder, theft, false swearing and adultery, and that enjoining obedience of children to parents—are fittingly embodied in human laws, and conformity to them required and enforced. But this is because their enforcement is demanded for the temporal good of the community, for the safety of society. They must be observed that men may enjoy their rights to do business, to gain and enjoy property and to seek happiness. They must be obeyed that the family may exist in peace and purity, and that society may be maintained in order and good repute. They must be conformed to, that there may be fair, orderly, decorous, profitable life in the world, that good government may be established and maintained, that civilization may be advanced and protected, and that anything of good and of greatness may be accomplished.
>
> They are properly enforced by the State because they concern man's relation to his fellow-man. He who infringes them infringes the rights of others, and perhaps imperils the public good.
>
> The commandments that relate solely to man's relations to his Maker, or that prohibit sins purely of thought or feeling are clearly not suitable subjects for embodiment in human laws. A law enjoining love to God, or prohibiting idolatry or covetousness would, in these days, be a recognized absurdity. Yet the Church, to fulfill its mission, must enjoin obedience to this latter class of commandment.

This is a very great fallacy. The last six commandments of the Decalogue are no more to be legislated upon as such than are the first four commandments. God in his infinite goodness made human rights self-evident, and as such they have been more or less fully recognized and adequately protected in all ages and in all countries. Centuries before the giving of the law upon Mount Sinai, theft, murder, adultery, false witness and disregard of parental authority were all recognized as worthy of the severest reprobation, and were, to some extent at least, made the subjects of civil law, not because they were contrary to divine revelation but because they were subversive of self-evident human rights.

Inscriptions on ancient Egyptian tombs show that that heathen people had a conception of human rights and of social duties but little, if any, inferior to our own. They knew nothing of revelation but they were able to read in the great book of nature the law of natural rights, and upon this their laws and customs were based, though in practice, like so-called Christian peoples, they fell very far short of their ideals of right and justice.

The Decalogue is not for the purpose of furnishing a basis for civil laws, but is for the purpose of setting forth that which God requires of every man, both for His own honor, and for the benefit and protection of every other man. And so any violation of this law is sin against God. When David had done Uriah the two most cruel wrongs that one man could do another, and was by the Spirit of the Lord brought to see the enormity of his offense, his confession was: "Against thee, thee only have I sinned." The wrong was done to Uriah, but the sin was against God. All sin is against God, and the purpose of the divine law is to define sin. "The law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound." "The law is spiritual." It "is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." Hate is a violation of the sixth commandment and lust of the seventh. Matt. 5:21-28. The tenth commandment, "Thou shalt not covet" is wholly spiritual, that is, it relates entirely to the mind. No civil law can take cognizance of the processes of the mind. But this is one of the last six commandments which many people insist are the proper basis of civil law. A spiritual law can never be made the basis of human legislation. Any attempt in this direction is simply to usurp a divine prerogative.

On the other hand, the commandment against idolatry relates not only to the feelings but to the act as well. Were this not true the three Hebrews might properly have bowed before the great golden image which the king of Babylon set up and required all his subjects to worship. But the Sun says that a law prohibiting idolatry would, in these days, be recognized as an absurdity. But why? if any part of the Decalogue can be enforced by civil law, why not that command as well as any other? Idolatry is as much an outward act as is murder or adultery; all these exist in the mind before they find expression in the act, and so all are equally beyond the domain of civil law upon any other basis than that of conserving natural human rights.
