In commenting upon an attack lately made by a crowd of young men upon a Roman Catholic meeting, at Montreal, *France, the Mail and Express* says:—

Every man has a right to be a Roman Catholic, just as every man has a right to be a Republican, Democrat or Mugwump, so long as he does not violate the laws of civil decency or interfere with the personnel of social order or conspire with the enemies of civilized government.

After describing the riotous actions of the crowd it says:—

This is the same spirit that prevails among the promoters of religious legislation in this country. The same arguments are being summoned in the Turkish Government. Such an attack upon a right once successful would place the whole Dominion under a single religious tyranny.

This may amount to the Rev. Mr. Mool and Rev. Mr. Charlton enters his religion with a vigour of ten thousand miles? This country is full of intolerants and prompted the persecutions with the *Mail and Express* of Mr. Shepherd. Sense of violence, and of persecution. Religion that is not aggressive upon the rights of others does not require legal protection. They have not been mortified by practice. They have been so far unable to any claim, indeed the custom with the *Mail and Express* to be in reference to come the very same note which is deserving the intolerance of the persecutor of the principles and prospects of Christianity. This is true; but it is no less true of this country than of France. It is the theory of the *Mail and Express* and only the Americans, Radical Unions and its followers have a right to exercise control over the people of the nation.
