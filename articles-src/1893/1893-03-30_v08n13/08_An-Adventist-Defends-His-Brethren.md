*(The following defense of the Tennessee Adventists appeared in the Tennessee Advance, and is now reprinted by request.)*

BORN an old resident of Henry County, and for years a subscriber to our county paper, the *Advance*, a little space in its columns to correct what I feel are is a misimpression on your past and on the part of many of your readers. I am an Adventist, and the newspapers seem to have given an incomplete description of certain tracts circulated by my people: but let me say that one of our church within a few weeks past. In your issue of February 23, you speak of the Adventists' of being the "body" of "fanaticism" in multiplying their literature of our country and its citizens by circulating tracts of our children.

This is a serious charge, and one that ought not to be made against citizens, even the members of a small and despised sect, without proof.

After reading the several articles in the *Post Intelligencer* I again read carefully the tracts complained of. These are published by my brethren, namely, "Religious Liberty," "Our Answer to the Bible Sabbath," "What the Sabbath Involves," "Is it the Chain—Going for Conscience? Sake," and others. I have no hesitation in saying that matter neither of these publications contain a single statement of facts that is not substantially true.

Some of the opinions and conclusions may appear too strong to those who look at the matter from a standpoint different from our own. But is it kind, to say to any Citizen, to thus stand in its certain established government has expressed opinions which you do not share, and which do not agree with your own; that false charges against any, we will, if you please, drop that charge against us. But your charge against us is made in too general terms; state it plainly; permit us to answer frankly; and then leave it to the general doubt.

For Judge Belknap, both myself, and as far as I know, my brethren, entertain a very high regard. Under this ruling of the Supreme Court, His Honor could not favor in any more than he has done. We believe that the whole proceedings are as distasteful to him, as they are distressing to us.

We bring no railing accusations against any person. Convinced that Judge Belknap has gone beyond the requirements of his judicial office, in our own behalf. We are not the judges of his motives, but we have a natural knowledge of his position.

So far as we are concerned the charges which we make that our prosecution is religious persecution, does not refer so much to the officers charged with the enforcement of the law, as to those who have urged them on, and urged that we should be prosecuted, but who have not and had no interest in us, as citizens, nor any other. We are aware that our quiet Sunday work was a long way, not accepted, why should these who live at a distance of several miles from us, concern themselves about our inobservance which they mistake for the Sabbath, unless they had some motive besides that?

You cite the fact that are prosecuted as evidence as an argument against us; the same plea may yet be urged against others on our side of the question; certainly we have not been indicted as evidence that we are disrespectful criminals; we are not accused of a crime of malice; it must be observed that the evidence showed that the people we were not some of the white employes of the old inmates. Indeed, our purpose is simply to stop Sunday work among Adventists and compel them to regard and Adventists indicate?

We think the according of this letter in spirit of the constitution of the country and of its State is that we should have Sunday as other days provided we do no wrong. The public may yet be able to approve our supreme courts are not always wrong on these questions. Since the supreme courts may yet do it upon the matter of Sunday prosecution by first little expressions of sympathy; and the rights of those who yet to claim to be both temporal and spiritual and they only need to be rested of their claims and to have their power broken. But the time was assuredly not to be far distant when civil law was assumed responsibility not to man but to God, and such malicious motive made distinct that freedom to exercise the right of private judgment and to choose and live according to the individual's right to relate himself to God. Thus all liberty is the heritage of the people so taught by the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
