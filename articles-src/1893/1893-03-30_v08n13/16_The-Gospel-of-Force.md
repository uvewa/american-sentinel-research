An exchange from Monroe, Neb., expresses its views, editorially, upon the enforcement of Sunday observance, thus:

> To the Christian the law of God is the end of the question about observing the day, as well as the manner of observance. As to the rest of the world, the Christian stands in the relation of a ruler, so far as his power of ballot and influence goes. Here he can not control the inward man, but he can justly provide a day of compulsory rest, and do this in the interest both of the individual and the general welfare. The American Sunday as a legal institution stands on the latter level as a purely secular enactment deriving its authority from the governing power, and all loyal citizens will obey without compulsion.

This is one out of many evidences of how the leaven of ambition for the assumption of temporal power, is pervading all professed Christendom. The boastful utterances of the prelates of the predominate church are being taken up and echoed even by outlying secular newspapers. There is candidly expressed in this editorial a full belief in the propriety of the Christian assuming to stand to the world in the relation of a ruler, who may justly enforce compulsory observance of religious forms upon his neighbor.

Such avowals as this show how widespread is the acceptance of the doctrine of the righteousness of the gospel of force.
