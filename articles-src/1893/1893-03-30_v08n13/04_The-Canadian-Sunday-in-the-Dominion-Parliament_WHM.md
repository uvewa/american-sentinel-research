The Canadian House of Commons has its champion of "Sabbath observance reform," in the person of Mr. John Charlton, M. P., who not long since addressed the Ministerial Association of Toronto on the subject of the legal enforcement of the observance of Sunday. Mr. Charlton is himself the author of a bill, which has been before the Dominion House of Commons for several sessions, having for its purpose the prohibition of Sunday newspapers, Sunday traffic and railway business, and Sunday excursions whether by land or water. In reference to this bill the *Christian Statesman* quotes Mr. Charlton in these words:—

> Speaking of the experience of his bill thus far, the lecturer said that although none would say its provisions were not eminently proper, yet three-fifths if not two-thirds of the members of the Commons were covertly hostile to it. They would not openly vote it down, but in committee where no names were recorded they got it knocked out, and two days later when he had it reinstated in its place on the order paper they talked it to death. There was only one way to get at these fellows. They feared nothing but loss of votes, and if the Christian people of Canada were to be a power they must say definitely and clearly to their representatives, "You must support this measure or we shall cease to support you."

From this it is evident that the minds of all the false reformers run in the same channel. If they can not obtain their ends by fair measures, above board and just, still in any event they must succeed. In their minds the end justifies the means. So wedded are they to the idea of the righteousness of their cause that their vision fails to take in a single step, of the devious way through which their goal must be reached, but their eyes are fixed alone on the object of their desires. Mr. Charlton has seen the effect of the political boycott with which the Church party in the United States has threatened congressmen and senators. He is not above adopting so successful a device and adapting it to the Canadian mind and applying it to the official understanding of the members of the Dominion Parliament. Such advice from a member of the House of Commons is startling and suggestive. He is in a position to know what will be most efficacious, and his advice is very likely to be taken by his followers.

Mr. Charlton seems to desire not to be taken as favoring directly a union of Church and State, yet it seems doubtful whether he fully comprehends what constitutes a union of Church and State, for he says, "There is no union of Church and State in Canada,"—while it is certain that such a condition virtually exists in Quebec, and as to the political status of the Church generally in Canada it is said in the "Encyclopedia Britannica," article Canada.

> The religion, laws, language, and customs of the French population were all guaranteed to them at the time of the cession of Canada to England; and the rights and privileges pertaining to the Roman Catholic Church, among a population regarding its creed as their national religion, help to perpetuate essential differences by maintaining what is still practically an established if not a State Church.

It is evident that when Mr. Charlton says there is no union of Church and State in Canada he speaks technically and takes refuge behind a distinction which is in reality not a difference. The purpose of his legislative measure is to build a doctrinal structure upon the foundation which already exists. It would seem that it would not be as difficult a matter as to accomplish what has been done in the Congress of the United States toward the enforcement of Sunday observance by the central Government. It is certain, however, that neither Canada nor England will be far behind the United States in the enforcement of common law religion. It can not be expected that there will be any step retraced in this matter. When it has become clearly evident to other English speaking legislators that the United States has fully committed itself to a course of religious legislation, they will not hesitate to put into full operation the religious requirements always countenanced by, if not an integral part of, their own governments. This relapse into medieval thought and methods is not to be for the United States alone.
