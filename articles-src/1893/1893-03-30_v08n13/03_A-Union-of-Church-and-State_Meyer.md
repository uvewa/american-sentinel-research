The following is a clipping from *Die Rundschau*, a German Lutheran weekly; an independent political paper, published at Chicago, and extensively read in the Missouri Synod and Synodical Conference, which, by the way, is the largest Lutheran church body in the world at present. The paper is not in any sense "official," but the clipping shows that some Lutherans are able to see things in the true light, even though they be "Missouri" Lutherans:—

> Governor Altgeld has appointed Rev. W. Steers, of Pittsfield, as chaplain of the Southern prison. We regard this practice, namely: appointing a preacher for a prison by the Governor as a union of Church and State, against which we ought solemnly to protest. The State may permit clergymen of every denomination to preach to the inmates of prisons, but it has no right to appoint a preacher there on part of the State."

Now, this was written after the appointment of a Lutheran chaplain at Joliet; more, the man appointed there is a Missouri preacher, and this paper openly condemns the practice as it undoubtedly deserves.

More still! This ought to be a sufficient answer to those who claim that the Lutherans, as such, sought only recognition, offices and power in the recent school contests in Illinois and Wisconsin. The truth is, they wanted irresponsible parties to keep their hands off from schools which were established and maintained entirely by private funds, at Lutheran expense. Now, the same paper, which was foremost in the fight for the parochial schools, denounces the holding of a chaplaincy by the Governor's appointment as a union of Church and State, which course is logical, right and patriotic.

C. F. W. MEYER.
