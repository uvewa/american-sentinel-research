NEW YORK, MARCH 30, 1893.

L. H. CRISLER, the Seventh-day Adventist minister, whose case was mentioned elsewhere, whose case was mentioned in these columns last week, writes us that he was brutally assaulted, and considerably hurt on the night of the 19th inst., owing to religious bigotry and intolerance. His only offense was preaching to certain of the people of the neighborhood where the causes of the calls, etc. We are majority is the neighborhood. We have not been favored with the particulars of the assault.

We publish on another page a communication to the Paris, Tenn., *Post-Intelligencer* by one of the persecuted Adventists. It is a manly and straightforward defense against the bitter attacks made upon the Adventists by the *Post-Intelligencer* some weeks ago, and republished in these columns as illustrative of the bitter spirit of the Tennessee Inquisition.

In the same paper from which the letter is taken is a weak attempt to reply to it. The editor has at once discovered a battery; his columns are too crowded (by ads.) to do it, and his publishing and printing from the Adventists. He has room, however, for frequent attacks upon them. If the persecuting spirit is in other particulars as it will not be the fault of the editor of the Adventists.

———

The *Post-Intelligencer* insists that the prosecution of the Adventists is not religiously persecuted; and in a recent frantic effort to prove that it is not, said:—

As evidence that these people are not discriminated against and singled out for persecution, we point to the indications before the present session of the Grand Jury for violation of the Sunday law. R. R. O. etc.

This is certainly a fact. The six indictments referred to were found simply as evidence that the Adventists were not discriminated against. But the Adventists have been discriminated against, and their prosecution is persecution, all details to the contrary notwithstanding. Nor are the Adventists alone in taking this view of the matter. A number of papers in that State have denounced the prosecution as persecution; and Ex-Governor Porter, probably the most popular and influential man in Henry County, said in a published interview:—

I endorse the action of our courts with reference to this question of compulsory Sunday observance law has hitherto been in contravention of the principles of American liberty, as well as contrary to the express provisions of the Constitution of the State, according to my construction of it, in regard to religious liberty.

The *Post-Intelligencer* should convince the leading men in Henry County, including Ex-Governor Porter, that there has been no religious persecution here under the cold forms of civil law, before it loses its temper about what others say of the iniquity that has been perpetrated in the name of justice.

Some degenerate sons of noble fathers whose daughters are in Tennessee now using religion as a cloak, are willing and to use the civil law to do the covering and hind the consciences of their fellow-men, and failing in this, to fine and imprison them, but the constitutional provision that "no human authority can in any case whatever, control or interfere, with the rights of conscience," shows that the people of that State not only love liberty for themselves but that they are writing that others should enjoy it also. Persecutors and justifiers of persecution there are in that State, but there are men and women there, men whose voices will be heard in defense of the rights of conscience, whether the *Post-Intelligencer* likes it or not. The Adventists have right and justice on their side, and their vindication to the world is only a question of time. Vindication is coming.

*(Continued from Norfolk, Va., date of March 19, 1893.)—*

For the first time in many years no Sunday laws were observed to-day. Steamships are arriving at these docks, having crossed on the high seas; and when the attendance at the Clyde line office was called, we were told that the telegraph linemen were also arrested for working on the public highway. Nevertheless the day's enforcement of the law was the result of the influence of the Sabbath laws in the hands of the Police Commissioners and Chief of Police.

No one who has watched the progress of the Sunday agitation for the past five years yet fail to see in it a most ominous sign of the times. The Sunday is evidently the connecting link between Church and State in America just as it was in Rome in the fourth century.

JOHN WESLEY has been dragged from his grave as one of the witnesses of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and is made to rehearse the same old argument, namely, that an open Fair would keep people from church. It seems that in 1797 Wesley wrote a letter to a subscriber urging him to oppose a bill "designed to unbolt the mills, and allow commerce on Sunday," from which letter a correspondent of the *Christian Advocate*, of this city, quotes, with much more, the following:—

We have little religion in the land now, but by this step we shall have less still, for wherever this is encouraged to dispense the people of God knock and gather, and I will imagine away so much the more and after it their churches will be emptied that they are silenced.

The bishop used the same argument in the fourth century for the closing of the theatres; the people, said they, would resort to the shows rather than to the churches. What they said was doubtless true, but if the Government will properly take cognizance of such questions, why may it not go a step further in the same direction and require the people to go to church?

———

EVERY Sunday law, every legislative enactment concerning religion should be enough every one who has lived in any or every State from Maine to California. To bring up a question of religion in any legislature should be so considered treason. The great safe-guard of American liberties can be a total and perpetual separation of Church and State, or they order religious liberty for the people in this republic. The Seventh-day Adventist persecution is merely the beginning of the end. The churches need waking and a solemn warning to prepare for the end with prayer.—*Norwich (Conn.) Creek (Neb.) Times.*

Every lover of good should have a copy of "Vick's Floral Guide" for 1893. The Vicks have always had the lead in the matter of flower seeds, but this year they have outdone themselves, and this catalogue—with engravings which surpass all former ones.—is certainly everything a good deal, for only one; Vick's seeds are best. Plenty of novelties, and a real joy to thorough. "Vick's Floral Guide" is a fine and attractive. It contains description of "Pansy," a "Poets' Number," numerous colored plates of flowers, plants and vegetables and other illustrations.

REV. T. M. C. Birmingham in an address before his congregation dealt the Romanist theology in various languages— "Like all his efforts it has undertaken a mission in America." His tale on the condition of the Romish Church is startling, the methods by which the Pope is own country, and calling upon all its citizens are destroying all those of all worldly cures must, the advantages of plain as the gospel. So startling, Some who are interested in the address were hardly prepared for his charges made such his conclusions. In short, the state Communism is startling and suggestive. He is a prelate in a position well in the most effectual situation, and his advice is very timely. Indeed, to be timely is to be effective. Mr. Charlton seems to desire not to be as favoring directly either of the two great churches.
