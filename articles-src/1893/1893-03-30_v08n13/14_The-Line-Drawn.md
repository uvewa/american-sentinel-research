A Tennessee paper defends the prosecution of Adventists in that State thus:—

> The position, in Tennessee, is as follows: The law forbids working on Sunday, every man is bound to obey the law or become a law-breaker. No man has the right to antagonize the laws that are made for the safety and well-being of society. He has no right to usurp the authority to upset fundamental conditions for the purpose of accomplishing his individual aims.
>
> Men have the right to believe what they please, but they have no right to let their opinions bring them in conflict with "the powers that be." The law-abiding sentiment is too strong in Tennessee to allow any set of men to substitute their private opinions and preferences for existing legal provisions and requirements, and the sooner all classes learn this fact the better it will be for them.

This is simply the old story over again: men may believe as they please but they must practice as the law dictates. As suggested in the paragraph which we published last week from the *New York Tribune*, "the truth is, that there are few people or governments who do not draw the line against religious liberty somewhere, resembling therein Oliver Cromwell, who proclaimed that all creeds should be tolerated, but added that if anybody thought that he was entitled thereby to celebrate mass in Great Britain he would find himself speedily mistaken."

This is just what Tennessee does; the constitution declares "that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship;" but if anybody thinks that he is entitled thereby to do secular labor or business on Sunday he speedily finds himself mistaken. This was officially stated by Judge Hammond in the well-known case of R. M. King. His Honor said: "Sectarian freedom of religious belief is guaranteed by the constitution [of Tennessee], not in the sense argued here, that King as a Seventh-day Adventist, or some other as a Jew, or yet another as a Seventh-day Baptist, might set at defiance the prejudices, if you please, of other sects having control of legislation in the matter of Sunday observance, but only in the sense that he should not himself be disturbed in the practices of his creed."

It thus appears that instead of religious liberty in this country we have only religious toleration; that is, those who have control of legislation simply guarantee the right of believing contrary to the faith of the majority, but deny the right to practice in accordance with that creed; thus the Protestants of Tennessee could not forbid belief in the mass; but if they saw fit so to do, and had control of legislation, they might forbid, just as Cromwell did in England, the celebration of the mass; and, according to Judge Hammond, the courts would be compelled to sustain the law; to declare that it was no violation of the constitutional provision "that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience."

In a report to the United States Senate in 1829, Hon. Richard M. Johnson said:—

> What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights. They are exercised, not in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights, of which government can not deprive any portion of citizens.

But this is no longer true; the courts have swept away religious rights and have substituted instead simply religious toleration. Even the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution has, by the Supreme Court, been declared to be in perfect keeping with the Church and State charters under which this country was first settled by Europeans; and that instead of prohibiting an establishment of religion here, it simply forbids the establishment of any religion in opposition to Christianity, which was already the religion of the country when the amendment was adopted.
