THOSE who advocate a theocratical form of government in the present age, must necessarily suppose a form of human absolutism. It is not within the range of possibilities that any one-man power can be a perfect exponent of governmental righteousness any more than a privileged aristocracy or an irresistible majority.

WHEREVER the human element enters, imperfection must come. The more irresponsible to his fellows the possessor of absolute power is, the more dangerous will he be to the peace and welfare of those over whom he rules. The irresponsibility of the established church in its effort to enthral civil government will practically accentuate the theory of a corporate soul in the body politic, responsible to God but not liable to man, is still a greater danger. Governments, righteous human governments, is theoretically good; but a religious faction established, that does not exist in reality. The conditions make it impossible. Righteousness is a personal attribute and can not be predicated collectively.

To say that government is from God is not saying that earthly governments are administered by the divine Giver himself. All life is from God, but lives are not directed by him according to his will. The responsibility of directing the life according to God's will lies with each individual, and this responsibility is not limited by his own individuality but extends to his relations with his neighbor; and this comprises his individual influence in all government,—municipal, State, national, and international.

It might be possible to make a composite photograph, in which should be combined the facial characteristics of every American citizen. This might be called the typical American,—but no such being would have an existence. It might indeed, be called a counterfeit presentation, for the original itself never drew breath; it would be a fiction of the camera. So, the nation as a composite, sentient, responsible, being, is a presentation of the mental vision and an intellectual fiction created for the convenience of human thought and expression, and not to be confounded with realities. It has always been the fatal error of the human intellect in the periods of its highest development, to confuse the concept and the fact. In the pride of intellectual power, the creations of the mind are given life, endowed with intelligence, weighted with responsibility, perhaps even deified and raised to the throne of Godhead. This is the highest possible development of idolatry. Some peoples of the world who have reached this stage of misconception of civil affairs, and are covering themselves with that imposing thing,—the governmental righteousness of national religion.

Upon whom, then, does the responsibility for good government rest? Upon God? Upon what fiction of the religious mind,—"the Christian nation"—or upon the individual citizen within the constitution of the body politic? It can not be that the responsibility devolves upon God, for in that case the responsibility would be met and all governments would be perfect; and imperfect men would be absolved from all participation in their creation or their administration. The role of obedience would be the sole part humanity could play. The responsibility can not rest with the "Christian nation" for there is no such being; indeed, it is not an entity but a nonentity; and a society and a nationality, an association of mortal beings, cannot create itself, be responsible for and administer its affairs, and be in course of salvation to itself not its subjects. Upon the individual citizen, then, the responsibility for good government rests. The government will be that which they make and maintain. The citizens are not God. They are not delegates of divine right. They can not, therefore, give to any one the privilege of ruling by divine right. Consequently no theocracy can proceed from them. A democratic form of government is the only form of self-government by the people,—republicanism is but a modified democracy. A theocracy is a government by the power and authority of God alone. The two can not coexist at the same time in the same place. One or the other must prevail.

BUT man can not establish a theocracy. It depends upon the God whose will it will administer, temporal authority or not. That is what the Jews would have had Christ do, but he said to them "My kingdom is not of this world." If his kingdom is not of this world, any one who raises a temporal standard in his name raises a false standard. The claim of divine right is not supported by the Word of God. On the contrary, the world is earnestly warned against such presumption. Those who claim to rule by such right and to do so from religious principle, in order that their selfish absolutism may be fixed upon what they hope to be an unassailable foundation. The man or the body of men who claim to represent the divine right, must assume to be the viceregent of God, must be delegated to speak for him. If that be so, the man or the body of men who claim to stand for the divine right, must assume to be the viceregent of God, and be delegated to speak for God and be presumed to command in his name. Such a ruler, whether an individual or an assembly, by claim of divine right, must presume to act for God, claim to be infallible on behalf of the Deity, or on claiming to be acting for him, is prone to be infallible. Infallibility is not a human attribute.

The rule of divine right, then, usurps the place of God, and as there are no infallible beings who are not divine, all that any body of men can rule in the name of God, and humanity can rule are not in the name of God.
