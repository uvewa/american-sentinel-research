A RECENT article in the *North American Review* discusses the criminal law of France. It is by Madam Adam, and the following paragraph gives a good idea of its leading thought:—

> Article IV. of the French Civil Code declares that "the judge who shall refuse to utter judgment on the plea that the law is silent, absurd, or insufficient, may be prosecuted as guilty of refusal to administer justice." A judge, therefore, must enforce the law, even should it seem to him to be false and unjust—*fava lex, sed lex*. But you may ask, will not his conscience rebel? No. A judge is a priest of justice; he can not dispute her dogma. If the sentence which he pronounces be unjust, his conscience can not be burdened, for the blame rests with the legislator.

The reader familiar with the administration of criminal law in this country need not be told that it is not essentially different from the practice which prevails in France. The American judge "must enforce the law, even should it seem to him false and unjust"—though hard law, it is law; and the responsibility rests with the legislator, not with the judge. Equity courts there are in the United States, but their jurisdiction is civil, not criminal.

The tendency in this as in other countries is to clothe the law with a sort of sanctity which forbids any but the most respectful and mild criticism. And the number is rapidly increasing who insist that so long as a statute remains it must be enforced, whether right or wrong; and all opposition to this dogma is branded as anarchy and treason. The motto of the Law and Order Leagues organized within a few years in so many of our cities is, "We ask only the enforcement of the law." They do not feel called upon to defend a statute; it is enough that it is law. All criticism of their methods is met by the arrogant reply, "It is the law."

In the cases in Henry County, Tenn., in which a number of Seventh-day Adventists were found guilty of maintaining a public nuisance by quiet farm work on Sunday, Judge Swiggart held that, while, if left to his own discretion he would be inclined to decide that such work was not a nuisance, he had no option in the matter. The law as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the State declared it a nuisance, and his duty was to enforce the law as he found it, not as he might think it ought to be.

Nor is this principle merely local. In the famous King case, carried from the Circuit Court of Obion County, Tenn., to the United States Circuit Court, Judge Hammond said:—

> King was wrongfully convicted, the State vs. Lorry wrongfully overruled, and Parker vs. the State wrongfully decided; but it does not belong to this court to overrule these decisions, and it does belong to the State courts to make them, and King's conviction under them is due process of law.

It is doubtful if French injustice furnishes a parallel to this decision, which, while probably sound from a legal standpoint, shows most conclusively that American courts, equally with European courts, have very limited discretion in the administration of the law. In the same decision already quoted, Judge Hammond said:—

> Malice, religious or other, may dictate a prosecution; but if the law has been violated, this fact never shields the law-breaker. Neither do the courts require that there shall be some moral obloquy to support a given law before enforcing it. . . . It [the act] may be harmless in itself.

The crime is in doing the thing forbidden by law, harmless though it be in itself.

Again, in the same case, the judge says:

> The proper appeal is to the legislature. For the courts can not change that which has been done, however done.

This emphasizes the importance of having only just laws, for no matter how harsh the law, nor how mischievous its enforcement, so long as it remains upon the statute books, the courts must enforce it when the demand is made upon them; and that regardless of the motive that dictates the prosecution!

But, while a grave responsibility rests upon the legislator, in the matter of making the laws, the powers of the courts are only second to the lawmakers; for while judges have no power to repeal laws once made, they both have the power, and exercise it, to add very much to the statutes by their decisions. Upon this point, Prof. J. T. Ringgold, of the Baltimore University, remarks incidentally:—

> They [lawyers] are, to a greater extent than any other class, makers of law—in legislature by enactment, on the bench by construction, at the trial by persuasion.

Right in line with this are the words of Judge Hammond:—

> The judges are the depositaries of that [common] law, just as the statute books are the depositaries of the statute law; and when they speak, the law is established, and none can gainsay it. They have the power, for grave reasons, to change an adjudication and re-establish the point, even adversely, but generally are bound and do adhere to the first precedent.

In view of these facts the thoughtful man can not but view with alarm the tendency of our courts, both State and national, to encroach upon what were once regarded as the reserved rights of the people; and to entrench behind judicial decisions, institutions and dogmas which our fathers fondly supposed they had forever excluded from the domain of civil jurisdiction.
