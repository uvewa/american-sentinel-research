In a recent article in the *Lutheran Quarterly*, David H. Bauslin, D. D., of Springfield, Ohio, sets forth some views on "The Reformation and Civil Liberty," which worthy of serious attention. A brief key note of the article is struck in the following sentences: "The greatest era in man history is the providence of Almighty God. All genuine reforms which have marked the progress of this world's history have been born of the world's deep need, and they have in every case come out of the innermost height to the human soul."

"Behind the long series of external reformers, Constantine, St. Basil," which in their outward and visible appearances are to be seen manifestation to be mere jumble of liberal and heretical teachings historical causes, the inward and powerful creative towards the workings of Almighty hand which at one time becomes the forces of stirring action, series set at other periods or thrusts the plans of authorities and designers men, and all for the accomplishment of designs, which at the time of their execution are incomprehensible."

"In no period of the world's history, some in days of the apostle, have the designs of this supernatural agency been more manifest," says the doctor, "and it workings more manifest, than in this striking circumstances, distinguished epoch—the age and significant series of events, which are associated with that marking period known as the Reformation of the sixteenth century. Martin Luther has been called 'the father of modern civilization.' He it was who emancipated the mind from ecclesiastical bondage. But it was already claimed that peculiar sort of freedom of thought without which it is easy to see that in spite of our boasted modern inventions, the spirit of the Middle Ages must have been producing indolently and the course of modern civilization, in consequence of the Reformation, would be what it has been."

"Romance with the stories of Wycliffe, Huss, Erasmus, Arthurs and its franchise, furnishes no exception, either in its intellectual and physical, as Martin Luther nailing his theses, his declaration of the right of private judgment, to the door of the church in Wittenberg, or standing in the humble presence of the Emperor of Germany and its magnificent array of kings, princes and barons, in the Diet of Worms, and declaring 'I can not and I will not recant anything?' If he said that the emancipation of Luther was for religious rather than civil liberty, the ready answer in any dispassionate mind is civil liberty is not stable; and one can not live where the other is not."

This is truth well stated; and as is also the closing sentence of the paragraph to which in Luther's asserted, produced and matched for the way for the exercise of two other kinds of freedom which have been the most important factors in the progress of the last three hundred and twenty years, viz., freedom of the individual and freedom of the press." This is in fact and one kind of freedom, intellectual freedom; the press is not a something of the individual, the creation of the individual.

"There were prolific ideas," says the doctor, "and every age has been marked by times. Their strength and forever principles were in the Gospel of Christ. They were the same ideas which gave their grand power to the early propagators of Christianity. Luther did not according to himself and its time from the forces of imperialism and papal usurpation and bondage, but in the main were the old ideas of St. Paul regarding the grounds of common Christian obligations. The fundamental thus in its first stages was a distinctive religious movement was a distinctive in most soul, cast. although a perfected religious ideas of modern times in its divine soul. Let God and the soul stand face to face. Let God and the soul know and be known to each other. Here is I am in no other. God help me, for God commande' mo.' Faith, justification by grace alone, for the redemption of sinful man into a face to face fellowship of God, and which brings justification, pours in the sunniness where God lives, where God's voice was heard, beforehand also—this was the primary and fertile idea which at first and effectually destroyed every influence of spiritual energy, indolential and morale of the buildings and their associated machinery of which are, that civilization is the product. Luther gave back to the individual his proper autonomy; the right of private judgment, religious liberty,"—and what you will, it produced the growing respect for the rights of the individual, and the ampler room afforded for the unfolding of responsible, accountable, rational beings. Accordingly God is to be worshipped by man as responsible, accountable, rational beings. Accordingly no civil law can enter here, and no human authority impose its chains upon the soul's allegiance. Under the conditions which prevail in these days the world has done but little conception of responsibility, and the rights of spiritual and physical, and those who dare to claim to be both temporal and spiritual and they only need to have one of their claims demolished as true, and to have their power broken. But the time was nevertheless not far distant when civil law has assumed responsibility not to man but to God, and such malicious motive more made distinct that freedom to exercise the right of private judgment and to choose and live according to the individual's right to relate himself to God. Thus all liberty is the heritage of the people so taught by the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
