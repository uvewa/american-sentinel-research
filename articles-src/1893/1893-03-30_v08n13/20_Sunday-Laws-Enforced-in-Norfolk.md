A DISPATCH from Norfolk, Va., under date of March 19, says:—

> For the first time in many years the Sunday laws were enforced to day. Steamers arriving at their wharves were not allowed to discharge their cargoes, and when the stevedores at the Clyde line wharf started to work they were arrested. Several telegraph linemen were also arrested for working on broken wires. Every saloon was closed. Today's enforcement of the law was the result of the war which the newspapers have been making on the Police Commissioners and Chief of Police.

No one who has watched the progress of the Sunday agitation for the past five years can fall to see in it a most ominous sign of the times. The Sunday is evidently the connecting link between Church and State in America just as it was in Rome in the fourth century.
