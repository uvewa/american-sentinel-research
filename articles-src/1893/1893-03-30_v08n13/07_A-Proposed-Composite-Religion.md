If the people who go to the Chicago Fair, have time to spare after going through the multitude of buildings, to look at the display, they are to have a chance to hear all sorts of philosophers and social and religious doctors talk in many languages upon every kind of troublesome and insoluble question. A great feature of the exhibition is to be sundry parliaments, as they are denominated in the scheme of the managers.

The parliament to which the Chicago people seem to be looking forward with the most eagerness, is "the world's first Parliament of Religions." It is to be convened on the 11th of next September, and it will be a polyglot congress representative of "all the shades of Christianity, including the orthodox Greek, and Russian churches, Northern and Southern Buddhism, Confucianism, Shintoism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Mohammedanism, and the various forms of Hinduism." The historic ecumenical councils of Christendom were narrow and provincial affairs when compared with the coming Chicago novelty, as the Tribune of that town tells us. They "only had reference to one shade of religious opinion," but Chicago will mix up all shades. It will set up a modern Pantheon in the "Hall of Columbus in the new Art Palace on the Lake Front."

Every kind of religion will get a show, and each will have a fair field in the competition, for enlightened Chicago has no prejudices in the matter. Christian missionaries from the East will sit "on terms of religious equality" with their old adversaries, Zitzozen Ashitzu, the Buddhist monk, H. Dharmapala, the Secretary of the Buddhist Society of the Buddha Gaya Maha Bodhi, which is engaged in an attempt to substitute Buddhism for Christianity the world over, and Moslem, Zoroastrian, and Mohammedan scholars. An especially exhilarating part of the entertainment will be the reading by proxy of a paper on orthodox Hinduism by Nikanth Vithal Shastri, "the peculiar features of caste preventing orthodox adherents of that faith crossing the ocean." Other eloquent speakers expected are Mr. Jinanji Jamshedji Modi, a Bombay Zoroastrian; Mr. Pung Kwang Yu, of China, and Professor Bunyinnanjio, of Japan.

Evidently the Parliament of Religions will be a high treat, but we are surprised that we do not find Hierophant Olcott among the delegates and orators. Neither do we see the name of the Yankee Mohammedan, Webb, though they both speak a language which is understood in Chicago.

Nor can we make out exactly what the Parliament proposes to accomplish, though of course there would be no reason for its existence if it really had a definite end in view. It is possible, however, that the Chicago scheme is to get up some sort of a new and compound religion, which shall include and satisfy every variety of religions or irreligious opinion. The subjects for polyglot debate, as laid down in the official programme of the proceedings, suggest that the basis of the religion which would be favored by Chicago may be theism or belief in the existence of a God.

The discussions will continue daily from the 11th, to the 27th of September; and as the end of the parliament approaches, this theistic purpose is to be brought out more prominently. The great theme of discussion on September 26, will be "the religious union of the whole human family," and on the next day, at the final session, the parliament will consider the "elements of perfect religion as recognized and set forth in the different faiths." With a view to determine the "characteristics of the ultimate religion" and "the centre of the coming religious unity of mankind."

It is a big job to get up a new and eclectic religion satisfactory all around; but Chicago is confident that it can finish up the business on the 27th of next September.—*New York Sun.*
