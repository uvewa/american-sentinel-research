If the people who go to the Chicago Fair, have time to spare after going through the multitude of buildings, to visit the many congresses, they will have a chance to hear all sorts of philosophers and religious and religious doctors talk in many languages upon every kind of troublesome and insoluble questions. The most important of all these many and many parliaments, as they are denominated, is that to which the Chicago papers are giving the most extensive advertising, the parliament to which the Chicago papers are giving the most prominence, and the most suggestive, is that "world's first Parliament of Religions." It is to be convened on the 11th of next September, and it will be a polyglot congress representative of "all the shades of Christianity, including Greek, Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, Northern and Southern Buddhists, Confucianism, Shintoism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Mohammedanism, and the various forms of Hinduism," all the historic ecclesiastical councils of Christendom were narrow and provisional affairs compared to it. The committee of the congress on invitations, we are told, has already, as the *Tribune* of that town tells us, received favorable responses "from all shades of religious opinion," but Chicago expects to see in it nothing less than the modern Pantheon in the "Hall of Columbus" in the new Fair Palace on the lake front.

Every kind of religion will get a show, and each will have a fair field in the congress, for prothegism? No; the scheme is for propaganda in the matter. Christian missionaries from East will turn their tongues of religious equality? with their old adversaries, Viennese Judaism, the Buddhist priests from Ceylon, and a delegation from the Buddhist Society of the Bodha Gaya of Calcutta; Brahmo Somaj will send a contingent to substitute Buddhism for Christianity, some religious Christians can already see the beginning of the great crusade. An especially exhilarating part of the entertainment will be the reading by proxy of a paper on orthodoxy Hinduism by Nisant Vithal Shastr, "the peculiar features of caste prevailing, practical otherwise of that faith crossing the ocean." Other eloquent papers anticipated are Mr. Joseph P. Benjamin Modi, a Bombay Zoroastrian; the Pung Kwang Yu, of China, and Prinze Oka, of Japan.

Evidently the Parliament of Religion is a misnomer. It should more properly be called the "Parliament of Religions." And yet we do not find Hierophant Shoot making much impression in this collection do we see the name of the Yankee Mohammedan, Webb, though they both speak a language which is understood in Chicago.

Every one make out not only what this Parliament proposes to accomplish, though of course there were; he no reason for its existence if it really had a definite end in view. It is probable, however, that the Chicago show is to give birth to a new religion, a new and composite religion, which shall eliminate the distinctively objectionable features or irreligious opinion. The subjects will be well treated in the official programme of the proceedings, earnest men the basis of the religion which would be favored by Chicago may be the truest or belief in the substance of a discourse which will continue daily from the 11th, to the 27th of September; and as the end of the parliament approaches, the Christian purpose is to be brought out more prominently. The great themes of discussion on September 27, will be "the religious union of the whole human family" and on the next day, at the final session, the parliament will consider "the element of a perfect religion as recognized by the enlightened mind and heart," with a view to determine the "character" of the supreme being, and also what constitute the coming religious unity.

It is a big job to get up a new and eclectic religion; sufficient and it sounds but Chicago is confident that it can finish up the business on the 27th of next September.—*New York Sun.*
