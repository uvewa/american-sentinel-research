With each succeeding year we witness new applications to the meaning of words, and to keep pace with the constant variation of language indicated by the public mind, takes no small effort at learning and unlearning words and expressions that are subject to the caprice or will of men. The time was when temperance meant moderation, and a temperance man was one who might take occasionally a glass of strong drink, yet so long as he did not get drunk or drink to excess, he had the pleasing title of "temperance man." His neighbor who was more rigorous in what he considered the right use of the ardent, totally abstained and got thereby the radical appellation of "teetotaler." But such words have lost their original signification or new ones have arisen to take their place to suit the time. The "temperance man" of former days would be unable to find his location now in society under that cognomen, and the "teetotaler" of a quarter of a century ago, would find himself behind the bar tipping the decanter and dealing out destruction with gainful zest to his fellows under the new-born name of "Prohibitionist" so long as he left his lucrative employment long enough to vote the Prohibition ticket. Yes, he might even himself indulge in the use of that which he formerly condemned, for, after all, it is his vote alone that gives him his name and standing.

This may seem absurd, but we have the highest authority of the Prohibition Party that this is so, namely the *Voice*, of New York. Be it known, therefore, to all men that in its issue of Feb. 23, 1893, it heralded to the world the complete definition of Prohibitionist in the following words:—

**Question.**—Do you think it right for a Prohibitionist to sell beer glasses and flasks and other bar goods to saloon-keepers, or for a clerk in a store to sell them for his employer?

**Answer.**—When an evil traffic becomes interwoven in society and government, it is next to impossible for citizens to avoid all business relations with it. We do not care to draw the line. We can only say that we would do our level best to make a living in some other way than by selling bar goods and saloon fixtures. But the fact that a man does that, or the fact that he even stands behind the bar and sells liquor does not prevent him from being a Prohibitionist. It is better for him to sell liquor and vote the Prohibition ticket than to sell liquor and not vote the Prohibition ticket. The only test of a Prohibitionist is his vote.

That is to say a man may engage with intoxicants as he will; he may deal out a glass of that fiery liquid to his fellow, that would cause him to commit a crime, and then go and vote the party ticket, return, find the crime committed, and yet be hale fellow, well met, and in good and regular standing in the Prohibition Party. What next? things are getting awfully mixed in '93. The writer thought himself a Prohibitionist, but this last drastic discharge from the Prohibition cannon lands him with too enfeebled intellect and crippled energies to ever again see the far receding ensign of that party.

Fare thee well, thou goddess of another clime!
To me once dear, but now so far removed.
Thy pleasing voice shall sound no more amid the halls of time,
For recreant to thy hallowed trust thou art proved.
Flown are the graces of thy hands,
Thy lips' persuasion that would win the child,
And in thy place a tyrant stands.
Clasping the hands that thou did'st call defiled.

C. S. WYMAN.
