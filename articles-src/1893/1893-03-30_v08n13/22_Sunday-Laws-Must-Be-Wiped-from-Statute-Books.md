EVERY Sunday law, every legislative enactment concerning religion should be promptly wiped from the statute book in every State from Maine to California. To bring up a question of religion in any legislature should be considered treason. The great safe-guard of American liberty must be a total and perpetual separation of Church and State; any other policy will bring disaster to this republic. The Seventh-day Adventist persecution is an entering wedge and a solemn warning to Americans.—*The Jury.* Amen.—*Silver Creek (Neb.) Times.*
