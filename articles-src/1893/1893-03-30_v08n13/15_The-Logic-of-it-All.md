In a recent communication to the *Christian Cynosure*, Secretary Foster, of the National Reform Association, thus explains what National Reformers mean by making the Decalogue the "sole and only guide in civil and political life":

> This involves a recognition of the fact that the State is the divinely appointed keeper of both tables of the Decalogue. In doing this, the State fulfills the end of its being—"a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that do well." The association maintains that the State, as the keeper of the first commandment, should acknowledge God as the source of all authority and power in civil affairs. The second involves the authoritative and judicial suppression of all open and public idolatry, whether practiced in Romish cathedrals, Chinese Joss-houses, or the Mormon Endowment House. The third makes the administration of oaths in secret societies a punishable offense, whether it be in such treasonable orders as the Jesuits, the Mafia, the Clan-na-Gael, the High-hinders, and the Endowment House; such insidious and dangerous worshipers of devils as the Masons, Odd Fellows and Knights of Pythias, or such harmless dupes of Satan as the Knights of Labor, the G. A. K., and the Orangemen. The fourth prohibits all public Sabbath desecration on the part of the individual, lodge, corporation, municipality, commonwealth or general government. The fifth secures the mutual rights and privileges of parents and children, and says to belligerent employer and employee, "Labor, all its rights; capital, all its rights; equal and exact justice for all." The sixth prohibits murder, either by the knife, revolver, or rum. The seventh outlaws free love, polygamy and speedy and easy divorce. The eighth forbids stealing, stock gambling and endowment orders, and secret insurance societies, that rob an unsuspecting public. The ninth punishes perjury. The tenth makes covetous deportment punishable, as Achan in the camp of Israel.

This is the logic of all so-called National Reform, whether in the National Reform Association or in any of its various allied associations, like the American Sabbath Union, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, etc.
