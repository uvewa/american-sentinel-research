# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, March 30, 1893 (v08n13)

## General Note

This issue presented significant OCR challenges. The 300 DPI scans of these pages contain very dense, small text in three-column format. Many passages were difficult to read with full confidence. The transcriptions should be considered draft quality requiring careful review against the original scans. Multiple passages across all articles contain readings that are best-effort interpretations rather than high-confidence transcriptions.
