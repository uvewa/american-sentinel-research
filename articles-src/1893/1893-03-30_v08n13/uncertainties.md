# Uncertainties — v08n13 (1893-03-30)

## Article 01 — Untitled lead editorial (Theocracy and Human Government)

- **Issue:** The article title is not given in the original. The title "Theocracy and Human Government" was assigned editorially based on content.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — title accurately summarizes content.

- **Issue:** The article is signed "W. H. M." The masthead for this issue lists "WILLIAM H. BURKE" as associate editor, not W. H. McKee. In other issues of this period, "W. H. M." is attributed to W. H. McKee (WHM). It is unclear whether McKee was still contributing under his initials while Burke held the listed title, or whether "W. H. M." here refers to someone else.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the OCR clearly shows "W. H. M." not "W. H. B."
- **Transcribed as:** W. H. McKee / WHM (per established convention for this publication)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — initials clearly read "W. H. M." but masthead contradiction unresolved.

## Article 02 — French and American Criminal Law

- **Issue:** The article is signed "C. F. B." in the OCR. This is likely an OCR error for "C. P. B." (C. P. Bollman), as "F" and "P" can appear similar in period typefaces. The article's content and style are consistent with Bollman's known writing.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — OCR clearly shows "C. F. B." at the article end.
- **Transcribed as:** Signed "C. F. B." in transcription; attributed to C. P. Bollman (CPB) based on strong contextual evidence.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — OCR reading is clear but likely a scan/OCR error for "C. P. B."

## Article 09 — Out-Heroding Herod

- **Issue:** The Scripture reference "Prov. 14:54" is unusual (Proverbs does not have verse 54). This appears to be an OCR or printing error in the original — possibly "Prov. 14:34" (the well-known verse "Righteousness exalteth a nation"). The quoted text "righteousness sexlesth a nation" is also garbled OCR for "exalteth."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes.
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved the OCR text exactly as it appears, including "Prov. 14:54" and "sexlesth," since these may reflect the original printing or may be OCR artifacts.
- **Confidence:** LOW for this quoted passage — significant OCR garbling. The intended text is almost certainly "Prov. 14:34: 'righteousness exalteth a nation.'"

## Article 22 — Sunday Laws Must Be Wiped from the Statute Books

- **Issue:** Attribution is unclear. The passage is a quotation attributed to "The Jury" (apparently a publication), with "Amen." appended by the Silver Creek (Neb.) Times. The Sentinel is reprinting this from the Silver Creek Times.
- **Transcribed as:** reprint, original_publication: "Silver Creek (Neb.) Times"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the chain of attribution is: The Jury → endorsed by Silver Creek Times → reprinted by American Sentinel.

## General Notes

- Page 8 contains boilerplate subscription information, price lists, and advertisements. These were skipped per instructions.
- Multiple advertisements on pages 7-8 (Civil Government and Religion, Grand Trunk Railway, Abiding Sabbath, Health Foods, Young People's Library, Fathers of the Catholic Church, Waterman's Fountain Pen, In the Heart of the Sierras) were skipped as advertisements/publisher promotional content.
- The OCR of the Health Foods price list (pages 7-8) was severely garbled with repeating characters and nonsensical product names; this section was identified as an advertisement and skipped.
