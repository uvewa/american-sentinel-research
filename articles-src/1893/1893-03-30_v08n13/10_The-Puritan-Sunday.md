The following letter is such a strange jumble of liberal and illiberal thinking that it is an interesting study:—

I was very much interested in your editorial in today's Record on "Educated Crime." The principle therein stated, that "the heart must be educated as well as the head, if we are to make men and women better by teaching them to read and write," is the very touchstone of all education. The doctrine that you still further declare is "that the school can do nothing to keep men out of jail. In the homes of the land, through parental training, aided by the kindly and gracious teachings of the Church, we must look for the influence which makes of increased knowledge a beneficence instead of a curse."

The capacity to do good comes from the educated brain; but the inclination to do good comes from the Christian heart. This is the same truth that Christ enunciated when he taught that the Pharisee's prayer was of no avail, and declared:

"Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in nowise enter therein."

The Record is an able educator of the brain, but it furnishes no teaching for the heart and conscience. On the other hand it strenuously and constantly attempts to invade the home on the Sabbath day by publishing a Sunday issue; and its advocacy of the opening of the World's Columbian Exhibition on the Sabbath day is a persistent effort to circumvent the "kindly and gracious teachings of the Church."

I am a constant reader of the week day Record; but I was deprived of the pleasure and benefit of reading therein one of the most important items of news which has transpired in this country for weeks—the inaugural address of President Cleveland—simply because it must go in to help fill up the Sunday issue.

Local self-government, tariff reform, and an honest dollar, are questions which press hard upon this Government now. The Record is able and consistent in the advocacy of these reforms; but the final plucking of all these fruits will turn them to apples of Sodom in your hands, if you should succeed in depriving the Lord of his day. You have an evidence of all this in the very apt illustration which you bring of the Homestead affair.

JOHN WARD FREEMAN.

Montrose, Pa., March 7.

The rigidity of Sabbath observance and of Pharisaical adherence to the form rather than to the substance of the Sabbath commandment was never so strongly rebuked as by the Master and Maker of the law. The kindly and gracious teaching of the Testament does away with pains and penalties, and declares the clement and wise intent of the Author of the Sabbath.

But does our critical correspondent think that the inaugural address should have been held over for Monday readers? Was there anything in it to compromise the conscience of saint or sinner? Would it have been better for the Record printers to have put it in type on Sunday for the Monday issue, rather than on Saturday for the Sunday issue? And does our correspondent really think that it lies in the power of any earthly creature or sovereignty either to add to the sanction of the Sabbath or "to deprive the Lord of his day"?—*Philadelphia Record*, March 9.
