A RECENT article in the *North American Review* discusses the criminal law of France. It is by Madam Adam, and the following paragraph gives a good idea of its drift:—

Article 6 of the French Civil Code declares that the judge who refuses to render judgment on the pretext that the law is silent, obscure, or insufficient, may be prosecuted as guilty of refusal of justice. Therefore, whatever may happen outside the law, even should it seem to him to be directly contrary to the law, the judge must render a judicial decision; he may, so to speak, create the law to render a just result of justice; he can not dispute her dogma, modify her law nor refuse to reconcile and come to terms with the legislator.

The French criminal law is the administrative law of the country. The administrative law in this country is essentially different from the practice which prevails in France; a French judge is required to enforce the law, even should it seem to him contrary to justice; in this country it is law; and the responsibility rests upon the judge as well as with the legislature. Equity courts there are in the United States, but in France there is no equity jurisdiction.

The tendency in this as in other countries is to clothe the law with a sort of sanctity which forbids not only but the most respectful and mild criticism. The whole matter is rapidly tending to a position in which a secular statute is treated with the regard which is reserved to a religious institution; and all opposition to this dogma is branded as sedition. In the United States, the saloon Law and Order Leagues organized against the violation of statutes and ordinances. "We ask only the enforcement of the law." They do not find it called upon to defend a statute; it is enough that it is law. All criticism of their methods is met by the arrogant reply, "It is the law."

In the case in Henry County, Tennessee, where young men and young women were found guilty of maintaining a public nuisance by "game of lawn tennis on Sunday," the player who pleaded that if left to his own discretion he would be a law abiding citizen, was told by the judge, a minister, he had no option in the matter. The law as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the State declared it a misdemeanor, and his duty was to enforce the law as he found it, not as he might think it ought to be.

Nor is this principle merely local. In the famous King case, carried from the Circuit Court of Obion County, Tenn., to the United States Circuit Court, Judge Hammond said:—

King was wrongfully convicted, the State as well as the circuit judge admitted that King was wrongfully decided, but it does not belong to the courts to examine into the justice or injustice of the other, it is the religious rule of the majority. That is just what is claimed to have been set up in this country. The development of the human mind, in this direction, prohibits the unrestrained despotism of the one-man power, but the irresponsible power of a majority will be even more despotically exercised, particularly as a man so powerful as a majority considers himself a theocrat, correcting through the political machinery the social ordinances of God by divine right. This is a remarkable illustration of the doctrine that "the voice of every man is a god." This is the realization of that philosophy contained in the words "the people is the voice of God."

It belongs to the State courts to make these, and to find if corruptions exist in their making or administration.

It is doubtful if French injustice further obtains in this far fetching analogy, while probably sound from a legal standpoint, it should be remembered that American courts, equally with European courts, have very largely liberalized the administration of the law. In the same direction already proved, Judge Hammond said:—

Malice or reflex or other malice does a greater harm; and if the law has been violated, the fact never alters; the law however great its administration may be, does not reform. In other words, equally to suspect a given law before enforcing and reforming is to cease to reform.

The crime is in doing the thing forbidden by law, and this rule covers criminal law in the main.

Again, in this same case, the judge says:—

There appears to me to be no question in this case as to the legislature. We can not of course not change that which has been done.

This emphasizes the importance of having the just right law, for no matter how liberal the law, nor how mischievous its enforcement, so long as it remains upon the statute books, it must be enforced; and when the demand is made upon these courts to enforce it, there is no escape from its enforcement.

The responsibility rests primarily upon the legislator, in the matter of making laws. The governor, in this relation, is only second to the lawmakers; for while judges have no power to repeal laws once made, they both have the power, and are solemnly bound by their official oaths and by their decisions. Upon this point, the venerable Judge Cooley, of the Michigan University, remarks incidentally:—

They [judges] are, to a greater extent than any other class, indeed the—legislators or equity judges who are to decree what the law is to be or really is.

Right in line with this are the words of Judge Hammond:—

The judges are the depositaries of the traditions and the conservatism of the course of the rhetoric law; and when they speak, the lawyers and the public learn how to use the existing laws, and to re-establish the point, even adversely, from a decision.

In view of these facts the thoughtful man can not but view with alarm the tendency, strongly manifested in the national, to encroach upon what were once regarded as the reserved rights of the people; and to smother behind judicial traditions, institutional and dogmas which our fathers bravely supposed they had forever excluded from the domain of civil jurisdiction.
