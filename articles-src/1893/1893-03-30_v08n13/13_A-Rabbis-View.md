The *Jewish Times and Observer* quotes Rabbi Krauskopf upon the World's Fair, as follows:—

> If the World's Fair were an adjunct of some Puritanic church, then the church authorities would have a right to open or close it whenever they pleased. But since it is to be a national affair, with international ambitions; since it is to be conducted under the sanction and patronage of the United States Government, the rightfulness or wrongfulness of keeping the Fair open on Sunday, considered from the religious point of view, must at once be dropped, for our Constitution has wisely divorced Church from State. All that our Government can do is to permit every one to stay away who thinks it a wrong to visit a Fair on Sundays. And all that the church that is opposed to Sunday opening can do, is to prohibit its members from attending the Fair on that day, and to excommunicate those who do.

The outcome of the legal steps which are being taken in the case may be the Sunday opening of the Fair. It remains to be seen, if that be so, how many church memberships will be forfeited by Sunday attendance.
