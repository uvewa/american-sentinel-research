The following is a clipping from *De Froodeschap*, a German paper, published as an independent political paper, published in Monroe and Steuben Counties, in the State of Indiana; and Steuben County, Ohio, State, which, by the way, is the largest German paper in Northern Indiana at present. The paper is not in any sense connected with Seventh-day Adventists, now Lutherans are able to see things in a true light, even Lutherans the best of it, except "Lutherans"—

Church and State, yet it seems admitted whether by fully comprehends what constitutes a union of Church and State, for he says: "There is no union of Church and State in Canada,"—while it is certain that such a union actually exists in Quebec, and as to the political status of the Church generally in Canada it is said in the "*Encyclopædia Britannica*," article Canada:—

The religion, law, language, and customs of the French population are all guaranteed by the capitulation of 1763, and by acts of imperial and colonial legislation. We can only note in brief the rights and privileges pertaining to the Roman Catholic Church.—It would be difficult to point out, so far as the law is concerned, any essential difference by restraining what is still further acknowledged in the law from what exists in the Province of Quebec.

It is evident that when Mr. Charlton says there is no union of Church and State in Canada he speaks technically and takes refuge behind a definition which is in reality not a difference. The purpose of this legislative measure is to build a coercive structure upon the foundation which already exists. It would seem, too, that it would be as difficult a matter to accomplish what has been done in the Congress of the United States toward the enforcement of Sunday observance by the constitutional method which has produced the existing laws of the country, that neither Canada nor England will be far behind the United States in this respect; and perhaps it would not be going too far to say that England will be outstripped in this matter. When a man announces himself to be a citizen of his speaking legislature that the United States, should formally commit itself to a course of religious legislation, they will be unable to put into full operation the religious requirements always countenanced by, if not an integral part of, their own governments. This reopens into medieval thought and methods and is not for the United States alone.
