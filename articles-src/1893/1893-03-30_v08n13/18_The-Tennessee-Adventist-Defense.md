We publish on another page a communication to the *Paris, Tenn., Post-Intelligencer* by one of the persecuted Adventists. It is a manly and straightforward defense against the bitter attacks made upon the Adventists by the *Intelligencer* some weeks ago, and republished in these columns as illustrative of the bitter spirit of the Tennessee Inquisition.

In the same paper from which this letter is taken is a weak attempt to reply to it. The editor has since discovered a better way; his columns are too crowded (?) to admit of his publishing anything more from the Adventists. He has room, however, for frequent attacks upon them. If the persecution is not carried on as of yore it will not be the fault of the editor of the *Post-Intelligencer*.
