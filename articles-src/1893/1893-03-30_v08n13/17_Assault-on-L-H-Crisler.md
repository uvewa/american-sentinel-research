L. H. CRISLER, the Seventh-day Adventist minister, whose case was mentioned in these columns last week, writes us that he was brutally assaulted and considerably hurt on the night of the 18th inst., owing to religious bigotry and intolerance. His only offense was preaching doctrines contrary to the faith of the majority in the neighborhood. We have not been favored with the particulars of the assault.
