Rev. T. M. C. BIRMINGHAM has recently held three lengthy services in Carthage, Missouri, devoted to the subject of "Romanism in America." His talks on the subject of Romanism were good, explaining the methods by which the Pope is seeking to establish his authority in our own country, and calling upon all who were American citizens at heart to awake and resist the advances of this apostate power. So, when the speaker gave his plans for resisting the church of Rome, some were hardly prepared for his change of base to that of a rank National Reformer. He said:—

> Solomon in Prov. 14:54, tells us that "righteousness sexlesth a nation." There is individual righteousness and there is national righteousness—separate and distinct from each other. Proof: national righteousness is rewarded by national prosperity in this life, not beyond; but individual righteousness is rewarded in the life to come. A nation may be righteous though a part of the people in that nation may not be. How? By enacting righteous laws; then seeing to it that only such as will enforce those laws according to the gospel of Christ; if we allowed to fill the offices under the government. This is necessary if we expect to hold in check the arrogance of Rome. They are organized. We must organize. They are seeking to control the Nation—so must see. We should see to it that our officers are men sound in the gospel of Christ and will execute the laws upon this basis.

A few months ago Mr. Crafts was at Carthage lecturing upon his favorite theme of religious legislation. The enthusiasm was not such as he desired, and he was soon followed by another, and this man stated publicly that others would follow on the same line. It seems that the latest turn—when other methods fail—is to hold up the grasping spirit of Rome as an inducement to all to organize and combine their power to crush them—and then—take to themselves the power which Rome sought. This is indeed the best plan that we have seen advocated by the so-called National Reformers to accomplish their object. Having been so repeatedly exposed in their efforts to blind the people in regard to the claims of God upon them, they now appeal to self interest, and thirst for power that dwells in the unregenerate heart. How civil government can execute civil law upon the principles of the gospel of Christ (good news of salvation from sin, pardon for transgression, etc.), was not explained. Luke 17:3, 4, says: "Take heed to yourself; if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him."

Can officers of law be empowered to do this? If so then they must have power to discern true repentance, so that the execution of law would be left optional with the judges. The man who through fear for his own life will take his life, is perhaps as reasonable as the one who through fear of the mother of harlots will consent to place himself under the care of her harlot daughters. We believe that while all should be protected in their religious faith—Catholics, Protestants or others—it would be extremely dangerous to place the power to coerce in the hands of those who, in principle, so poorly exemplify the Golden Rule. The word of God abideth forever; and in this we are told that the kingdom of Christ is not of this world. John. 18:36.

C. SANTEE.
