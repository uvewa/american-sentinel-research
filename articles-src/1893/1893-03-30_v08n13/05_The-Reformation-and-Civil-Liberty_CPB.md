In a recent article in the *Lutheran Quarterly*, David H. Bauslin, D. D., of Springfield, Ohio, sets forth some views on "The Reformation and Civil Liberty," well worthy of serious attention. The key note of the article is struck in the first two sentences: "The genius of human history is the providence of Almighty God. All genuine reforms which have marked the progress of this world's history have been born of the world's deep needs: they have been answers of God out of the uttermost height to the human in its uttermost depths."

"Behind the long series of external events," continues Dr. Bauslin, "which in their mere outward and visible succession appear to be traceable to mere ordinary historical causes, the devout and thoughtful trace the workings of an Almighty hand which at one time touches the springs of human action, and at another permits or thwarts the plans of ambitious and designing men, and all for the accomplishment of designs, which at the time of their execution are incomprehensible to men."

"In no period of the world's history, since the days of the apostles, have the designs of this supernatural agency been more intelligible," says the doctor, "and its workings more manifest, than in the striking circumstances, distinguished personages and significant series of events, which are associated with that epoch-marking period known as the Reformation of the sixteenth century.

"Luther has been called 'the father of modern civilization.' He it was who emancipated the mind from ecclesiastical bondage. He it was who proclaimed that peculiar sort of freedom of thought without which it is easy to see that in spite of our boasted modern inventions, the spirit of the Middle Ages must have been prolonged indefinitely and the course of modern civilization, in consequence, been essentially different from what it has been. . . . Romance with all the grand figures of its Launcelots, its Arthurs and its Ivanhoes, furnishes no picture of such heroic courage, moral and physical, as Martin Luther nailing his theses, his declaration of the right of private judgment, to the door of the church in Wittenberg, or standing in the hostile presence of the Emperor of Germany and his magnificent array of kings, princes and barons, in the Diet of Worms, and to the demand that he recant announcing 'I can not and I will not recant a single word.' If it be said that the contest of Luther was for religious rather than civil liberty, the ready answer is that civil and religious liberty are inseparable; and one can not live when the other dies."

This is truth well stated; as is also the following sentence: "The religious freedom which he [Luther] asserted, produced and marked out the way for the exercise of two other kinds of freedom which have been the most important factors in the progress of the last three hundred and fifty years, viz., freedom of the individual and freedom of the press." This is in fact but one kind of freedom, namely, individual freedom: the press is but a mouthpiece of the individual, the creation of individual liberty.

"Those were prolific ideas," says the Doctor, "which Luther projected into his times. Their strength and fervor primarily lie in their conception of salvation. They were the same ideas which gave their great power to the early preachers of Christianity. Luther did not accordingly spend all his time in fierce denunciations of imperialism and papal usurpation and bondage, but to the reaffirmation of the ideas of St. Paul regarding the grounds of hope for the soul's salvation. The Reformation thus in its first stages was a distinctively religious movement, not a political or moral one, although perforce of the religious ideas asserted it soon became both political and moral. 'Get rid of the Pope, said Luther, get rid of the priests, rid of all that stands between the individual soul and God. Let God and the soul stand face to face. Let God and the soul know and be known to each other. Here I stand, I can do no other. God help me, for God commands me.' Faith, which brings a man into a face to face knowledge of God, and which brings justification, peace in the conscience where God lived, where God's voice was heard, believed and obeyed—this was the primary and fertile idea which set free and stimulated the energy, intellectual and moral of the individual and thus augmented the forces of which our civilization is the product. Luther gave back to the individual his proper autonomy; the right of private judgment, religious liberty,—call it what you will; it produced the growing respect for the rights of the individual, and the simpler room afforded for the unfolding of his powers, and for realizing his aspirations. It gave rise to such action and achievements in the field of civil action, as would have been impossible under the dominance of any other idea than that of the assertion of personal rights with respect to religion, the highest concern of man. The principles enunciated by Luther at once fostered a habit of mind which was thoroughly incompatible with a patient endurance of tyranny at the hands of the civil power."

These are true words. It is only as men come to understand their individual responsibility to God that they are enabled to have any just conception of their rights as accountable, rational beings. Accountability and freedom of choice are inseparable. Under the conditions which prevailed prior to the Reformation men had but little conception of accountability to God. The priests ruled them in things both temporal and spiritual and they cared only to know the will of the church and to have her approval. But the time came when they began to realize that they were accountable not to man but to God, and with that realization came the demand for freedom to exercise the right of private judgment and to choose, each individual for himself, how he should relate himself to God. Thus all liberty worth enjoying is due to the influence of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
