WITH each succeeding year we witness new applications to the meaning of words, and to keep pace with the various usages, types of language inflated by the public print, taken no small effort at learning and unlearning words and expressions that are subject to the caprice or will of men. The time was when temperance meant moderation, and a temperance man was one who might take occasionally a glass of strong drink; yet so long as he remained a moderate drinker he was said to had the pleasing title of "temperance man." Then came a change and what occurs in what he constituted the right not to indulge by former custom at all. But thereby the radical application of "temperance." But words soon lose their original significance, or new ones have arisen to take their place, and thus also. The "temperance man" of former days is now the "moderate man" in recognition in society after that cognomen, and the "methodist" of a quarter of a century, in a way, would find himself almost led to the tipping the decanter and dealing out demand has usurped the place of the former, under the new-born name of "Prohibition." But in this case the name of the Prohibitionist who could live on a compliment long enough to vote the Prohibition ticket. Can be really even himself indulge in the use of that which he formerly condemned, for, after all, it is his voice alone that gives him his name and his politics.

This may amount to the Rev. Pavilion of Prohibition, the question of this paper. Granting that this is so, namely the Force, of the Prohibition are now established, it is sure that in the issue of Feb. 23, 1893, is contained the following definitions of Prohibition in the following in his column:—

*Question.—Do you think it right for a Christian to manufacture brooms, or other articles of domestic use, on Sunday, and offer them for sale and sell to the people, and use the Sabbath as a day for selling and buying? Do you think a Christian ought so to sell items for his employer?*

We cannot answer the question put to us as a strictly ecclesiastical question, and it seems as a solely and an extremely questionable matter for religious people to sit in judgment upon, or to avoid at all; one is a matter of civil law and the other of religious law. We can only say that we would do our duty best by giving the answer to those who are not merely those who have not always done that, or the fact that he even stands below his own standard does not seem to us a valid reason for refusing to do what is right and realizing the endowments of a fair society and the responsibilities of a Prohibitionist as its aim.

The Prohibitionist is a Prohibitionist as its aim.

A true Prohibitionist not only prohibits intoxicants as he will; he can say that it is wrong for him to try by hard effort to do that which by his own conscience and religion would cause him to commit a crime, and hence it is not done today, and even should it be, it is not of the Prohibition character; we find the crime committed. We find the crime committed, and the conviction right equally standing in the Prohibition right standing in the Prohibition party equally issues in all its expressions.

We find that through a Prohibitionist may be actually a Prohibitionist, but the practical test of the alliance is that the name is not enough; the actual conduct and manner finds him too swallowed in the embraces of the party, and therefore, he is no use, dear Sir, but an abomination.

It is not enough to be called a Prohibitionist, or to be counted in his party. Let it be restored to its hallowed trust since the beginning of the movement in the child. The type persuasion that would in the child. The type persuasion is that which votes its own vote.
