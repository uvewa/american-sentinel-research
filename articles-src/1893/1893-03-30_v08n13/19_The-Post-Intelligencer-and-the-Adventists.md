THE *Post-Intelligencer* insists that the prosecution of the Adventists is not religious persecution; and in a recent frantic effort to prove that it is not, said:—

> As evidence that these people are not discriminated against and singled out for prosecution, six of the indictments before the present session of the court were against employees of the P. T. & A. R. R. Co.

This is certainly a fact. The six indictments referred to were found simply as evidence that the Adventists were not discriminated against. But the Adventists have been discriminated against, and their prosecution is persecution, all denials to the contrary notwithstanding. Nor are the Adventists alone in taking this view of the matter. A number of papers in that State have denounced the prosecutions as persecution; and Ex-Governor Porter, probably the most popular and influential man in Henry County, said in a published interview:—

> I believe that the action of our courts with reference to this question of compulsory Sunday idleness has hitherto been in contravention of the principles of American liberty, as well as contrary to the express provision of the constitution of our State, according to my construction of it, in regard to religious equality.

The *Post-Intelligencer* should convince the leading men in Henry County, including Ex-Governor Porter, that there has been no religious persecution there under the color and forms of civil law, before it loses its temper about what others say of the iniquity that has been perpetuated in the name of justice.

Some degenerate sons of noble fathers there doubtless are in Tennessee who, using religion as a cloak, are willing also to use the civil law to stifle conviction and bind the consciences of their fellow-men, and failing in this, to fine and imprison them, but the constitutional provision that "no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience," shows that the people of that State not only love liberty for themselves but that they are willing that others should enjoy it also. Persecutors and justifiers of persecution there are in Tennessee, but there are also noble men there, men whose voices will be heard in defense of the rights of conscience, whether the *Post-Intelligencer* likes it or not. The Adventists have right and justice on their side, and their complete vindication is only a question of time. Vincit omnia veritas.
