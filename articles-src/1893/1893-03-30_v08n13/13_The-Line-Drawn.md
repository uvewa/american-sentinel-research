A TENNESSEE paper debates the proposed enforcement of Adventists in that State thus:—

The position, in Tennessee, is as follows: The State has a Sunday law. Nobody is disposed to deny the right and the duty of the State to enforce it. But the State has no right to antagonize the laws that are made for the enforcement of the laws of the State. It has no right to annoy the authority to upon those who are compelled for the purpose of accomplishing the law.

Has the right to believe what they please, but have they a right to force their views upon those who do not agree with them? The law abiding sentiment is too strong in Tennessee to allow any one to practice that sort of religion—an opinion and preference for existing legal privileges is a matter for all the people, law and their representatives to determine.

This is simply the old story over again: toleration where there is no state persecution; exact practice as the law dictates. As enunciated in the paragraph above by this editor of a Tennessee paper—

It was stated last week from the New York *Tribune* that Mr. Charlton was bitterly opposed by people or governments who do not draw the line against religious conviction but where, remembering therein Oliver Cromwell, who declared that all religions ought to be tolerated, but added that if anybody thought that he was going to tolerate the established state in Great Britain he would find that he made a very great mistake; and our constitution declares "that no human authority can in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience. No preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment." The Adventists are a law-abiding body who thinks that he is entitled thereby to do secular labor or restriction of his religion specially finds himself mistaken. This position was made most emphatic, in the well-known case of R. M. King, His Honor said; "Section 4, touching 'Sabbath Breaking,' provides: If any one shall pursue on work of labor of any secular call on Sunday, or in public work," as a resolution of Tennessee, not to the same thing on Saturday. But if a Seventh-day Adventist, or some other on a law, or yet another conscientiously abstains from work and set at defiance the protection, if you please, who has done every action of performing, that the question in the matter of Sunday observance, true only to the sense that he should not himself be disturbed in the practices of his religion upon another day.

It thus appears that instead of religious liberty in this country we have only religious toleration; that is, those who have control of legislation simply generously permit their subjects to be free enough in the faith of the majority, but deny the right to the minority; for if those who observe the Sabbath on Saturday, and who, like the Protestants of Tennessee could fully demonstrate as they have done that if some fit to do so, and had control of legislation, they might forbid, just as Great Britain used it in England, the celebration of worship, in the second case, as Judge Hammond stated, the courts would be compelled to sustain the law's declaration to be a declared violation of the constitutional provisions that no human authority can in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience.

In a report to the United States Senate we find that the full text is:—

What others call religious toleration, we call the destruction of religion. Government of which government can not be dissolved by act of law.

But this is no proper true; the courts are very apt to regard the laws and legislation that religious liberty has been considered as being limited simply religious for universal liberty.
