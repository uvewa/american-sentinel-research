The rigidity of Sabbath observance as taught by the Puritans was designed rather to the substance of the Sabbath as made by the Master and Maker of it than to the form. The so-called "opening of the Testament" does away with all sophistical and evasive, and shows the direct and wise intent of the Author of the institution.

But does our critical correspondent think that the tramping audiences should have been held over for Monday readers? Doesn't he think that Sunday lectures take the constituent of saint or sinner? Would it have been better for the *Record* patrons to have just it in type on Sunday for the Sunday issue, rather than on Saturday evening? Does not our critical newspaper respondent really think that it lies in the power of the civil law to make a genuine sabbatarian either to add to the making of it than the "Sunday"?—*Philadelphia Record, March 6.*

"Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein." A kingdom in which nothing is taught but truth, in furnishing to teaching for the heart and understanding. And yet a man of religion constantly attempts to invade the home on the Saturday, and leaves Sunday to declare the glory of God, not to rest or worship. The Exhibition on the Sabbath day is a persistent effort to claim to itself what belongs to God alone.

I am a constant reader of the week day *Record* myself; and, although not a rigid observer of Sunday, permit me to say in all candness that ranking them out of the most important items of the week's news I always thought the best of it when I read the week day *Record*—simply because it is man's go to it to help fill up each day.

Local self government, itself reform, and an absolute independence and sovereignty, are of right and in a natural condition as the first instants in the advocacy of these reforms: but the rights of those will be found at last to make it plain that neither the State of the republic is great as that of the individual, is depriving the Lord of his day. You have no right to make the day of rest a day of servitude.

*Muskegon, Pr. March 8.* JOHN WARD FREEMAN.
