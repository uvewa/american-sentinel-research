JOHN WESLEY has been dragged from his grave in the interests of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and is made to rehearse the same old argument, namely, that an open Fair would keep people from church. It seems that in 1782 Wesley wrote a letter to a nobleman urging him to oppose a bill "designed to embody the militia, and exercise them on Sunday," from which letter a correspondent of the *Christian Advocate*, of this city, quotes, with much more, the following:—

> We have little religion in the land now, but by this step we shall have less still; for wherever this pretty show is to be seen, the people will flock together, and will lounge away so much time before and after it that the churches will be emptier than they are already.

The bishops used the same argument in the fourth century for the closing of the theaters; the people, said they, would resort to the shows rather than to the churches. What they said was doubtless true, but if the Government may properly take cognizance of such questions, why may it not go just a step further in the same direction and require the people to go to church?
