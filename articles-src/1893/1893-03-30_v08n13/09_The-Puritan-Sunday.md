A few months ago Mr. Crafts was at Nashville, and made a speech on the theme of religious legislation. The enthusiasm was not such as he desired, and he was soon followed by another, and this man was followed by yet another, and at the last meeting the attempt was made in the latest form—when other methods fail —the denunciation of the enemy. They hold Knox as an instrument to all to organize and work, and keep what they have gained and then—take to themselves the power which Rome would give. This is indeed the best plan that we have seen advocated by the so-called National Reformers to accomplish their object. Having been so repeatedly exposed in their efforts to bind the people in regard to the claims of God upon them, they now step forward as it and intensifiers, and thirst for power that dwells in the government of souls. But no human government can exercise civil law upon the principles of the gospel of Christ (good and wise, not narrow and not the same as transgression, etc.), was not explained; and we are now left to conclude that, as ever, if they brooder transgress against them, nothing will give but if he insists, forgive him. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.

Our officers of law be empowered to do the work of the pastor? It would take about to discern true repentance, so that the extension of law in would at least require the judges. The man who brought the tithe of mint, anise and cummin, had the fear of the law who will take his life; is it the tender mercy of a Christian heart, the fear of the mother of harlots will convert the world by the punishment of all her faithful daughters. We believe that while all should be produced to their duties by the law—*Catharine.* Protestantism or others—it would be extremely dangerous to place the power to coerce, in the hands of those who, in principle, so poorly exemplify the Golden Rule. The word of God abideth forever and by this we see that the kingdom of Christ is not of this world.
