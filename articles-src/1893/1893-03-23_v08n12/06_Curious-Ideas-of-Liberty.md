Enormous governments entertain curious ideas with regard to liberty of conscience—that is, freedom of religion—which is theoretically conceded by every one of their constitutions. In the Protestant lands the Minister of Public Instruction declared the other day that parents who sent their children to school were at liberty to have them attend whatever church they pleased providing it was a positive church. This is the Spanish idea of the right of agrarian parents to have their children instructed according to the doctrine which they profess. In Austria, the government draws the line at Methodism, while in Spain the recent troubles which have taken place in connection with the attempt to open a Protestant place of worship in Madrid show clearly that the Protestant government, while guaranteeing the liberty of conscience prescribed by the constitution, draws the line at Protestantism. This means is, that there are some few people who wish to be free from the accepted forms against religious conventions are, we are reminded by our contemporary that it proclaimed that all creeds should be tolerated equally, and some of our citizens thought that it was entitled thereby to establish some of their own—made the most first and himself speedily—mistaken.
