# Uncertainties — v08n12, March 23, 1893

## Author Identification

### Article 01 — "Civil Liberty a Product of the Gospel" — W. H. M.
- **Issue:** The masthead of this issue lists the associate editor as "WILLIAM H. BUCKEE" (not McKee). The known initials WHM = W. H. McKee. It is possible this is a different person (William H. Buckee), or that "McKee" is the correct spelling and the OCR/typesetting variant accounts for the discrepancy.
- **Transcribed as:** author "W. H. McKee", author_short "WHM"
- **Confidence:** LOW — the masthead name "BUCKEE" does not match "McKee." Recommend checking originals to confirm the correct surname.

## OCR Quality Issues

### Article 05 — "Sunday Legislation in Maine" — Section 1 of Tennessee Act
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "Section 2388 of Millions & Vertrees' commission of the statute laws" — "Millions & Vertrees'" appears to be an OCR error for a law publisher's name (likely "Milliken & Vertrees'" or similar).
- **Transcribed as:** "Millions & Vertrees'" (as it appeared in OCR)
- **Confidence:** LOW — probable OCR garbling of a law publisher name; original should be checked.

### Article 05 — Tennessee Act, Section 1
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "to apply to persons known as who, or with the same laws" — this passage is garbled and likely has missing or corrupted text.
- **Transcribed as:** appears as in OCR
- **Confidence:** LOW — the original document should be consulted for the correct statutory language.

### Article 07 — "A Congressman's Protest" — "shasseless persecutions"
- **Issue:** OCR reads "shasseless persecutions" — likely "shameless persecutions."
- **Transcribed as:** "shasseless" (as it appeared in OCR)
- **Confidence:** LOW — probable OCR error for "shameless"; original should be checked.

### Article 10 — "Dr. Talmage and the Greek Church" — "foundists"
- **Issue:** OCR reads "the Jews, the foundists and others" — "foundists" is unclear; may be "Stundists" (a Russian Protestant sect) or another OCR error.
- **Transcribed as:** "foundists" (as it appeared in OCR)
- **Confidence:** LOW — probable OCR error; "Stundists" is a strong candidate given the Russia context.

### Article 10 — "The votaries of Catholicism Protestantism"
- **Issue:** OCR reads "The votaries of Catholicism Protestantism have obtained control" — appears to be missing punctuation or a word between "Catholicism" and "Protestantism"; possibly "Catholicism and Protestantism" or "Catholicism-Protestantism."
- **Transcribed as:** "The votaries of Catholicism Protestantism" (as it appeared in OCR)
- **Confidence:** LOW — the original should be checked.

### Article 03 — "defecation of the World's Fair buildings"
- **Issue:** OCR reads "to go to Chicago to participate in the defecation of the World's Fair buildings" — clearly should be "dedication" not "defecation."
- **Transcribed as:** "defecation" (as it appeared in OCR, preserving OCR text faithfully)
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR error for "dedication"; original must be checked.
