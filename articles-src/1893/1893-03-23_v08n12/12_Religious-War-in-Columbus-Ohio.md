A DISPATCH to the New York Times, states that there is a religious war in Columbus, Ohio, between a Protestant faction and the Catholics over elections to the school board. The American Protective Association, representing Protestants, will undertake to control the election next month. This association has been denounced by Dr. Washington Gladden.
