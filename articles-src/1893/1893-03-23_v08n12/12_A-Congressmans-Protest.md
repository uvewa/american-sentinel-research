Representative, W. T. Bowers, of California, a member of the legislature of that State, writes him as in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. On the subject of religious liberty, as quoted on this page, was written by Col. Shepard.

*Dear sir:*—I have yours in which you favor opening the World's Fair on Sundays.

There is, but for myself no intention in this. It is sent for members by mail and sent letters, for they chose to make from this—from both sides of the controversy—an increase in both directions of the incoming mail. This may reach the purpose of the mails if that has come to me as it has to other members of this Legislature, and measures to vote on the bill now under discussion. I know of nothing that would be so unfortunate or so dishonorable.

They are like hundreds of others received. You say that you "want all the churches and all religious creeds to bow in voluntary obedience to the explicit command of God." We answer: then what do you call all such a bill. Do you do it? Do you want a civil law to do it?

But who is to say what are "the explicit command of God," and what is "voluntary obedience" when compelled by civil law? Do we invoke the law of others? The history of religions in this State show that the people of one religion are best—yet but the sole reason that they differed in opinion about the so-called "explicit commands of God." The reformer who broke with Rome was himself a persecutor as soon as he acquired the power—burst these who differed from him in religion, as Rome did. They tell us the Puritans came to this country for the sake of religious freedom and it, "worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience," yet they persecuted to death those who differed from them, and said of the Baptists that they were disturbers in the same line with their predecessors in this country who brought the days of religious persecution, when many Quakers were fined, banished and treated because of their religion, are being used. Would they do so here, we have our own. Well they say, "but this is a free country," especially fond of boasting that this great American flag and its stars and stripes is a guarantee to all citizens. That is an important fact.
