The Congressional Record containing the proceedings of the House of Representatives for March 3, has the following in reference to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The amendment which Mr. O'Neil of Massachusetts here refers to, and the offer did not come before the House from the committee, but a substitute for it which he proposed to attach is was that line, having no opportunity in present from Sunday opening to the House for its line. The House therefore did not formally decide the question, but practically the United States has assumed dictatorial power in the premises, and has assumed that Sunday, the first day of the week, is to be by civil authority set apart as a Fair Sunday, the first day of the week. The Congressional Record reads:—

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I wish to address a very few words to the gentleman in charge of this bill yield for a question?

THE SPEAKER *pro tempore.*—The time of the gentleman has expired.

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts.—Mr. Speaker, a gentleman from Illinois if it is proposed by the friends of this appropriation to have to have the Fair open on Sunday.

Mr. DURBOROW.—That, I will state to the gentleman, is a question about which the World's Fair corporation have anything whatever to do with. It is a matter solely within the jurisdiction of the House. But I will allow the gentleman from Massachusetts to even ask that question himself.

Mr. HOOKER.—I desire an affirmative answer from Mr. Durborow, for we should like to vote on politics on that answer.

Mr. DURBOROW.—I decline to yield to the gentleman.

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts.—I would like to know whether or not the friends of this appropriation would yield to me.

Mr. DURBOROW.—I will yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts for that purpose.

Mr. POWERS.—I desire a distinct answer, if the gentleman will permit me.

Mr. DURBOROW.—I will answer the immediate question of the gentleman from Vermont, that if I were personally in charge of this bill, I would consent to one of these propositions opening the gates on Sunday.

Mr. POWERS.—And we will vote it down.

After the word "extent," in line 14, on page 8, insert: That as a condition or appropriation in aid of the management or control of the World's Columbian Exposition shall make or maintain any rule or regulation designating or recognizing Sunday as a day on which the gates of the Fair shall be opened or closed.

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts. I only had this amendment. Mr. Speaker—

THE SPEAKER *pro tempore.*—The Chair so under the rule—

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts—Mr. Speaker, I ask from the gentleman from Massachusetts whether he proposes to vote from Massachusetts whether he proposes to close or not open the Fair on Sunday, and he refused to do that.

Mr. DURBOROW.—You have offered the amendment here.

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts—If the gentleman from Massachusetts declines to accept then I am very much obliged.

THE SPEAKER *pro tempore.*—The gentleman from Massachusetts is not in order.

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts.—Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment may be read.

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts.—Every single sir. Mr. Speaker I desire—

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts.—I do not see. I do not. I am in favor of having this Fair opened on Sunday. I want to have all the people of this country who come to this grand Exposition to enter the gates and have some opportunity of enjoying the benefits of this Fair.

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts.—I do not want to go in on Sunday.

Mr. MORSE.—But you embarrass the State of Massachusetts by putting in the amendment that was—let me have a moment; this amendment that I have I do not want to be interrupted by any one. I put in this amendment for the good of the bill.

Mr. MORSE.—And you do not this question. You have had the floor, Massachusetts. I know all the outs on the question of Sunday opening.

Mr. HITT.—The grand World's Columbian Fair has been the wonder of the world, the greatest and best sentiment of any State of Massachusetts or any other State or locality has been that this is the work of a great commercial and industrial Nation. She is to be the focus of all countries upon this great progress in this country, seek to retard every effort of man.

THE SPEAKER *pro tempore.*—The gentleman has the subject from a very different standpoint from the original matter; let me make a statement to him. We have here in Chicago, one of the great parks in the city of Chicago. This Fair opens on the first of May. The Fair opens on May 1st, and when I say it will cost, I mean I will state that the city of Boston has expended ten millions of dollars, the city of Chicago has spent nearly twenty millions of dollars in this park, and the custom of the common people of the city seeking an eating place or a place to go on a Sunday.

THE SPEAKER *pro tempore.*—The time of the gentleman has expired.

Mr. DURBOROW.—I yield to the gentleman five minutes.

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts.—Why, sir, when the distinguished Postmaster General of the administration puts his own name upon a matter for a good part by the same city of a description of the Fair was the way it was done—we have opened the gates of that city; and now that it has been opened every day in the week.

We have our museum opened to the public on Sunday, and if our working people did not have our park opened on Sunday, I do not know where they would get together. I want those who live in the rural districts to enjoy themselves with the people in the same place to go in on a Sunday. You complain about the laborers. There is an institution that complains about corner-loafing. This thing is not to get 200,000 people in a park—and it is intended that the workingman should enjoy himself away with it. Those people must get air and must enjoy themselves.

We ask you to give them a chance for an afternoon's enjoyment in this great Fair. We do not intend to, sir, when we ask you to modify the act as Congress, we simply ask that—it is not the least reading; you in the interests of the working people making this on the working pro tem.

Mr. POWERS.—Will the gentleman allow me a question.

Mr. O'NEIL of Massachusetts.—Certainly; but I want the gentleman alone if you can.

Mr. POWERS.—I will say by way of a suggestion to the gentleman that he has not a petition or communication from the working pro tem—

THE SPEAKER *pro tempore.*—The gentleman from Massachusetts has unanimously resolved against the Sunday opening of this Fair.

I desire to have the amendment read which I present to the committee.

THE SPEAKER *pro tempore* (Mr. Richardson).—Is there objection?

The amendment reads—

We ask you to give them a chance for an evening from the working people of the country.

Mr. QUACKENBUSH.—I beg leave to say a word before the last five minutes. A meeting was held in Philadelphia, hundreds of them from all over the country met, and during the work to visit that Sunday of the Fair at Chicago, a meeting was held in Chicago. We ask that the people who are obliged to work during the six days of the week shall have Sunday as a day of rest on which to meet their more favored friends, relatives, and follow-citizens not thus employed, in the grounds of the World's Columbian Exposition.

I do not care whether this proposition comes from the working-people or any other source. That proposition is just and right, and I desire it and I suffer because I believe it is right and because I believe it is in the interests of the working people of the United States. That is all I desire to say about offering this amendment to the section of the bill now pending.

Mr. JOSEPH D. TAYLOR.—Mr. Speaker, I regret that the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. O'Neil) has seen fit to notify the House that he demands a yea and nay vote on the Sunday question. If you will remember, during the last Congress that question was settled during the last session by both Houses, substantially by a two-thirds vote, and notwithstanding that the gentlemen demands whatever on their part to reopen this question.

The Director-General of this Fair says that five millions and a half of dollars were appropriated by the Congress of the United States upon the express condition that this Fair be closed on Sunday. It is a very unfortunate that this question is agitated at this particular time.

Gentlemen, not all of you are bound by the mandate of your constituency—that is the best evidence, and all I want here are of the subject, as I expressed it, in the sentiment of the people; I prefer to not it abandoned a thousand times rather than to have this question continued.

Grover Cleveland, the President elect, who is now at Lakewood on his vacation, has stated to everybody who has been to see him. He stated his intention to go to Chicago, to participate in the dedication of this great Exposition. I understand to those who have been to visit him at his White House home at that time was dispel with not have gone at all. He said he would have done the same thing when he left his home in New York a few weeks ago but did not want to offend anybody. He said the same thing at the dinner given to him by members of Congress.

In both these instances he touched the hearts of the people, not as the President, but as a patriotic citizen and as a great leader. And there will be no Fair open on Sunday. They say they would have opened the Fair Sunday on Sunday if possible but they did not think it desirable. Now, some of these men are ready to sell the Fair for a mess of pottage. I had expected for that day. I applause on the floor and in the galleries and I had expected myself to participate in it. Let us not now stand in the way. [Cheers. Grover Cleveland, and we will be well." the gentleman are moved to tears by the sentiments of this great people.]

The last fact that Secretary Noble had previously had in the treasury of the United States, at which President Cleveland is entitled.

Mr. BRECKINRIDGE of Kentucky.—It is a parliament of the House; and that the rules of the House shall be such that the patriotic utterances of a gentleman like the gentleman from Ohio will be sufficient to induce the occupants of the galleries not to break the rules of the House at any future time.

Mr. MORSE.—Massachusetts (Mr. O'Neil).—I ask Mr. Speaker—these visitors are invited here and they are classed as being bigots and which would certainly apply to the House itself, is it not, to the Fair corporation, and the question was this: the Fair be not opened on Sunday, but out of the pocket of the United States Treasury they were given to give the Columbian Exposition five million dollars on the condition that the gates of the Fair must be closed on Sunday. And now to publicly announce that the gates shall be thrown open, in violation of this agreement and an act of Parliament, and I so publicly ratify these gentlemen for the legislation.
