"The Fifty-second Congress, which expired by limitation on March 4, will not be remembered," says the Observer of this city, "as a body of great accomplishments." This is a cruel and ungrateful thing, for a paper which has all along advocated Sunday closing, to say of the first National Religious Congress of the United States.
