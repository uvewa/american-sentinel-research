A correspondent in a letter, written regarding the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday and kindred matters, Mr. C. O. Hook, of Tennessee, says:—

As far as I see, I have been, so far in the future as I did in the past—to-those the World's Fair on Sunday upon their own merits. We should, with our honored representative while agreeable as it is stand the "principles" of the United States Constitution, which are found distinctly in the "principles of the United States Constitution, for its several States;" "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." In the "principles" of the Declaration of Independence which says: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." And the statement attributed directly to George Washington, "Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen, is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience." Or it is the "principle" of the lowly Nazarene, as is formulated in the Golden Rule.

Fountain City, Tenn., Jan. 26, 1893.
