"Fifty-second Congress, which expired by limitation on March 4, will not be remembered," says the *voice* of that "era, 's a body of great accomplishments." This is a cruel and ungrateful thing, for a paper which has all along advocated Sunday closing, to say of the first Religious Congress of the United States.

A DISPATCH to the New York *Times*, states that there is a religious war in Cleveland, Ohio, between a Protestant faction and the Catholic over elections on school committees. The American Protestant Association, representing Protestants, will undertake to control the election next November, and the Catholic ticket will be nominated by Dr. Washington Gladden.

A CORRESPONDENT of the Boston *Pilot*, organ of the Catholic Congress, which is to be held in Chicago early in September, says:—

Although the Congress, which is to be a congress of the laity, will doubtless present an able basis of its own and claims for itself absolute independence of all of them, being the eighth congress of the Baltimore Catechism, and prepared before the use of World's Congresses was planned and thought of, it has a nice place among the various congresses, and will therefore almost by its very existence, not only of Catholics, but of people of all creeds, and this is to no greater degree than any for the time being. Its aims are broad and generous.

The week beginning September 4, will it is announced, be Catholic week. Chicago, during that week, will present a spectacle which, if it does not convince every Methodist preacher, it will undoubtedly appear that the whole population has "come over to Rome." Such an opportunity of placing itself fully and squarely before the American people has never before been offered to the Catholic Church of America. And that opportunity will be utilized to the full.

The remarkable activity of the Catholics and their rapidly increasing popularity

is an ominous indication of the future of our country. Mr. Crafts has not rightly assessed this, evidently, the Sabbath closing of the action of national bodies should be followed up by a new series of letters to senators and congressmen.

Mr. Craft's chapter is not altogether exactly as it should be, and yet it is probably not nearly so deep as it should be. For years the "great evangelical national bodies," as Mr. Crafts styles them, have been producing great excuses for the temperance cause, but they have never showed their fault even by their own works. The liquor traffic is confessedly the greatest evil that threatens our country, but the energy of the churches has never been directed to fighting it. This, however, an unintentional slight was asked to be put upon the Church by opening the World's Fair on Sunday, and for deliberately taking away from the churches authority but by the Church, Congress was overwhelmed by petitions and letters demanding action for the protection of their darling institution. But the most impassioned appeals fail to rouse the churches against the drink evil!

THE COLORADO *Sun*, of February 8, has this pertinent paragraph:—

One of the fundamental principles upon which this Nation was founded is that of the absolute separation of Church and State. This principle recognized and supported by the State. It means that the State must never be used to for instances of the right, maintenance and sufferance of the denomination or requirements of any church merely because they are such. It means that the State must never use the authority of any religious cult in furthering religious aims. It means that any system of religion simply becomes a private corporation in the eyes of the law.

This is quite true, for Government cannot, of right, have anything to do with religion. Governments are instituted for the securing of natural rights, not for the defining of moral duties.

A CORRESPONDENT writes from Grand Island, Florida, of the indolent spirit manifested in that place in reference to the teachings of the Seventh-day Adventists, a minister of that denomination has been holding meetings there for several weeks, which aroused the Methodists to call some of their ablest ministers from other parts of the State and make arguments to refute the scriptural doctrine as it had been presented. When the Seventh-day Adventist announced that he would review these Methodist ministers, they appeared the next morning, on the bulletin board, in the village post-office, the main public notice that could have been given,—the following:—

*Notice.—The M. E. Church on this Island hereby notify Rev. Mr. Crisler, to leave this Island by twelve o'clock, on or before March 10, 1893. This bond not to be trespassed.* Signed, members of W. C. C.

This is the same style and form of address with which E. M. King, of Tennessee, was favored before and during the pooling of his different trials for Sunday labor. In his case the arrest and persecution was at the instigation of members of the Methodist Church. Some of those actively connected with the persecution in Henry County, Tenn., are also Methodists. It is possible that such things as these must meet with the approbation of the Methodist denomination as a whole.

It is not on record yet that any Seventh-day Adventist has ever intimidated or treated thus threats. Mr. Crisler himself is a mild mannered man of God.
