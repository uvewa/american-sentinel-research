A CORRESPONDENT of the Boston Pilot, writing of the Catholic Congress to be held in Chicago early in September, says:

Although the Catholic Congress, which is to be the first of the religious congresses, stands upon a basis of its own and claims for itself absolute independence of all of them, being the rightful successor of the Baltimore Congress, and projected before the series of World Congresses was planned or even thought of, it has also a place among the various congresses, and will therefore attract the attention, not only of Catholics, but of people of all creeds, and this in a far greater degree than did even the Congress held in Baltimore in 1889.

The week beginning September 4 will, it is expected, be exclusively and distinctively "Catholic week." Chicago, during that week, will present a remarkable spectacle,—in the words of a rabid Methodist preacher, it will undoubtedly appear that the whole population has "gone over to Rome." Such an opportunity of placing itself fairly and squarely before the American people has never before been offered to the Catholic Church of America. And that opportunity will be utilized to the fullest extent.

The remarkable activity of the Catholics and their rapidly increasing popularity are certainly ominous.
