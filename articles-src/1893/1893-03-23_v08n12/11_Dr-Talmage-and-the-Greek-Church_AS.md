WHEN Dr. Talmage visited Russia last winter, he was greatly impressed with the beauty of the Russian universal and the Russian Church, with its religious faith of the Russians. To an American charity to the definite and charitable empire, and only seeing them through the half-dusk atmosphere of the that and their church, the glory and honor of the occasions. So faith received his impressions, and when he came home and told his story in various papers, of these most favorable impressions, with statements so gross, and so aggravating, if their statements be more false that the following, of which he spoke, in astonishment that until the Jews, the real fundamental characteristic expression toward God, do not believe or practice the tenets of the political church, and the principles of nature states that will sentimentalize even heavens in their own language, in deeds of noble generosity, and find

and oppression. Appearances are sometimes deceptive, for we are apt to judge them by their external contact with our own land. In his generalizations on the Russian Greek, Dr. Talmage says:—

The Greek or Russian Church, as I told Emperor Alexander III in the conversation that I had a half-hour with him to. I was met everywhere I went in this city, he impressed with the sincerity to their religion of any people as is what I had seen in Russia and elsewhere. Many time have I been to Russia. In Russia, when I saw his rose himself—"What do you do that for?" he said, "for, say, when I do that for my God; do you not that?"

By the same logic, Mohammedanism, Catholicism, and Hinduism might be made commendable to some of the reverend doctor of a popular Presbyterian church. In making not a list of this kind, however, we do not wish to be misunderstood at the basis. I am here only speaking of the sincerity of those who sincerely hold the Christian faith, not on the basis of belief and practice as judged by the human standards.

The only proper standard by which to judge of the merits of any system of religion, professedly Christian, is by the Bible and the only code of godliness by which its membership can be properly judged is that of the life and character of our Lord Jesus Christ, the great Exemplar of his people for all time. No manner of human breeding, though it may influence the judgment of man, can give to salutary effort to the most imposing of human institutions.

Russia, today, furnishes an excellent sample of what a union of Church and State will do. Those who love church, even devoutly, from the national religion, do so at the imminent risk of imprisonment or banishment. And this condition of things would be much worse than it is were it not for the benign light of religion at liberty shedding its bright rays from this star-spangled banner of our own fair land for a hundred years upon the nations.

But will not the hope of the oppressed multitudes of that Russia and of which these when they are religious freedom emanated into being in the very capital of our country? The votaries of Catholicism Protestants have obtained control of our Government, and in the near future they will set of to enforce they will upon all our citizens who can be coerced by fines, imprisonment, and threatened death. And our danger has lain most in the fact that the people generally would not believe and claim things were coming. They could not see, and many will not see until the net is drawn about them, then, at the beck of the Church, to legislate in the interest of one religion, they will also legislate upon any other religious question under the plea of necessity. And precedents indicate that they will then when the Church tells them do.

A. SMITH.
