It seems that Sunday legislation is in the very air, and that work is going on in every direction, Maine not excepted, notwithstanding the fact that Maine prides herself on her liberality, and boasted of her laws giving to every man the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. But in Maine, as well as elsewhere, the citizens have realized that something must be done, and in many places are bestirring themselves to get their people to get their attendance at church.

On the 25th of January a meeting was held (at inter-denominational effort to secure better Sunday observance) at which the following clergymen were present: Rev. Mr. Wharf, of Brookland, Rev. Mr. Hooper, of Woodfords, Rev. Mr. Seminary, Rev. E. T. Adams, of Williston Church, Portland, Dr. Blanchard, W. S. McLain, of Biddeford, met at the rooms of the Young Men's Christian Association. As the result of that meeting, forms were sent throughout the State and more than three thousand in all. There were sent out containing this blank form:—

*To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives in Legislature assembled.*

We the undersigned, citizens of the State of Maine, respectfully petition your honorable body to enact such legislation as shall compel all citizens of this State to cease all unnecessary labor, business, and properly regard Sunday.

These blanks were sent to pastors and church people all over the State of Maine, to be signed and forwarded to the Legislature; in addition to sending out the petition blanks, the committee ask the ministers of each church in Maine to preach a sermon, or series of sermons, on the subject of Sabbath observance. Thus, we are told, there was an agitation throughout the State of Maine since December.

A bill was presented to the legislature, and was given a hearing before a committee. The petition prays that a law be enacted to prohibit all unnecessary business, and to properly regard Sunday. This bill was referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs, where it had a hearing before this committee on the 7th and 8th of February. Ministers of the various denominations from different cities in the State appeared certainly in behalf of the bill, claiming that unless something was done, they were endeavoring to throw the protecting aegis of civil law over the institution. The the principal speaker in defense of the bill was Mr. Ritchie, of the Seventh-day Adventists.

Give a law to protect Sunday and the Church will do the rest.

The word "rest" revealed the evil motive behind the whole movement, for, notwithstanding its being tried to conceal it by calling for a "civil" Sunday law, this plea for the Church to do the rest shows the designs. If there be any query in the minds of any of our readers as to how such laws work in certain communities, let them go to Tennessee, and believe us to see for themselves. What they do there, they will do in Maine—and to-day they do protect Sunday, dragging Christians to jail and compelling them to work upon the public highway by the side of criminals all because they dare to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience.

The bill was debated. The committee voted unanimously to give the bill—permission to withdraw— which means to die.
