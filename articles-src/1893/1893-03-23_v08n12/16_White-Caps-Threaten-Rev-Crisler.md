A CORRESPONDENT writes from Grand Island, Florida, of the intolerant spirit manifested at that place in reference to the teachings of the Seventh-day Adventists. A minister of that denomination has been holding meetings there for several weeks, which aroused the Methodists to call some of their ablest ministers from other parts of the State and make appointments to refute the scriptural doctrine as it had been presented. When the Seventh-day Adventist announced that he would review these Methodist ministers, there appeared the next morning, on the bulletin board, in the village post-office,—the most public notice that could have been given,—the following:—

We, I organized White Caps of Grand Island, hereby notify the Rev. Mr. Crisler, to leave this place by next Monday morning, or stand the consequences which shall surely follow. Take heed lest you be caught. SECRETARY OF W. C. CLUB.

This is the same style and form of address with which R. M. King, of Tennessee, was favored before and during the pending of his different trials for Sunday labor. In his case the arrest and persecution was at the instigation of members of the Methodist Church. Some of those actively connected with the persecution in Henry County, Tenn., are also Methodists. Is it possible that such things as these meet with the approbation of the Methodist denomination at large?

It is not on record yet that any Seventh-day Adventist has been intimidated by these threats. Mr. Crisler himself says:

> I shall review Dr. Anderson to-morrow night, and if I can not use the house, the services will be held outside in the woods. The weather is warm here now so that this can be done. I do not apprehend any trouble; yet we do not know what may occur. One thing is certain, we are here in the work of the Lord and his interests are our interests, and if he chooses to have us suffer for his sake, then we want to suffer.

These seem to be the words of a servant of God. Would it not be well for those professedly Christian persecutors to stop and consider lest they be found to fight against God.
