THE General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventists held at Battle Creek, Mich., February 17 to March 6, unanimously adopted the following preamble and resolutions:—

WHEREAS, There has been introduced in the legislature of the State of Tennessee, an act which distinctly names the Seventh day Adventists, and proposes to legislate in their behalf in the following words:—

AN ACT to Prohibit Interference with the Religious Rights or Liberties of Certain Classes of Persons:

SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee that Section 2388 of Millions & Vertrees' commission of the statute laws of the State of Tennessee be and is hereby so amended as not to apply to persons known as who, or with the same laws, to the extent that persons whose religious faith teaches them to conscientiously believe that another day than the one generally observed by the people of the State is the proper one authorized by God as a day of rest. Provided, that their usual avocations shall not interfere in any manner with the peace, quiet, or proper rights of others. And provided further, that said persons shall observe one day in each week as a day of rest, as commanded in the Scriptures.

SEC. 2. Be it further enacted, That all laws or parts of laws in conflict with this act be and are hereby repealed.

SEC. 3. Be it further enacted, That this act take effect on and after its passage, the public welfare requiring it.

WHEREAS, This proposed act does require that our religious faith shall teach us to conscientiously believe that another day than the one generally observed is the proper one authorized by God; and that we shall observe one day in each week as a day of rest, as commanded in the Scriptures, and—

WHEREAS, Our consent to this act would be only to surrender to the State our God-given right to be religious or not religious, to observe or not to observe a day according to the dictates of our own consciences and the convictions of our own minds; and would be only to consent that the State shall take judicial and supervising cognizance of our religious beliefs and our conscientious observances; and would be only to consent that the State shall be the interpreter and expounder of the Scriptures for us; and would be to consent that there should be enforced upon others that—the observance of Sunday—which we would not have enforced upon ourselves, and would therefore be a violation of that blessed precept of our Saviour and Master: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so unto them"—in short that it would be to consent that we and all others should be deprived of the dearest rights of mankind, therefore be it—

Resolved, By us, the Seventh-day Adventists in General Conference assembled, for and in behalf of the Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee and all other places, That while appreciating the good intention of the author of this proposed act, we beg to and hereby do enter our most solemn and emphatic protest against the passage of this act, or any other of similar import, by the State of Tennessee or any other State or government on earth.

Resolved, That this preamble and resolutions be printed, and that a copy be placed in the hands of each member of the legislature and officer of the State government of the State of Tennessee. And be it further—

Resolved, That a committee be appointed to carry this protest to the legislature of Tennessee at its present session, to explain as fully as occasion may allow, our reasons for the position which we are compelled to take in this matter.

These resolutions have now been presented to the legislature of the State of Tennessee and the reasons for the action have been given. What influence, if any, they will have upon the action of that body it is impossible to tell. But whatever may be the immediate effect of the resolutions they have at least gone on record as a testimony against the iniquity of religious legislation upon whatever pretext. The whole Sunday law of Tennessee ought to be repealed, as ought every other Sunday law, and this protest ought to speedily result in a general demand for such repeal, not in one State but in every State in the Union.
