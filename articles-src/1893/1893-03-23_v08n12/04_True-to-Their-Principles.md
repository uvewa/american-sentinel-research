The General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventists held at Battle Creek, Mich., February 17 to March 6, unanimously adopted the following preamble and resolutions:—

WHEREAS, There has been introduced in the legislation of various States, bills for the better enforcement of Sunday laws, and the religious people's "organize in their behalf in the following

AN ACT to Establish Interference with the Religious Rights of Citizens, and

WHEREAS, The Fourth Congress of the United States has set a Precedent for the Same and for National and State Legislation for Religious Purposes; and

WHEREAS, These legislative acts are Contrary to the Principle of the separation of Church and State on which our Government and its Free Institutions are based; and

WHEREAS, The proposal and assumption that our Government is a Christian Government and that civil laws should enforce other than the one generally observed—laws that another day than the one generally observed—we believe that this is setting a precedent that we shall observe one day to each week as a day of rest; to this we have no objection. We believe in the right of every man and woman to surrender to the Saviour our God given right to be left alone; we believe in the right of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience; and the convictions of our own minds; we believe that the civil government has no right to interfere with the religious beliefs and our conscientious convictions of any of its citizens; that the Bible is to be the interpreter and expounder of the Scriptures for itself; that no human authority has a right to force us to observe any day as the Sabbath—which we would not have enforced upon us, either by the civil power or by any religious organization.

"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." We therefore ask only to be treated as we and all other citizens of this Government wish to be treated by us.

*Resolved*, By us, the Seventh-day Adventists in General Conference assembled at Battle Creek, Michigan, and our brethren assembled at various other places, That while appreciating the good intentions of those who have been instrumental in securing the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, we hereby protest against the passage of this act, as being a long step toward a union of Church and State, and hereby respectfully ask the Congress or any other state or government on earth, to refrain from all religious legislation; and that each member of the legislature and officer of the Government do this by their sacred oath.

*Resolved*, That a committee be appointed to carry these resolutions to the Congress now in its present session, to replace as fully as common may be expected our position regarding this subject to the National Government.

These resolutions have now been presented to the members of Congress from Tennessee and the reasons for the section fully explained. Let us hope that Congress they will have upon the action of that body it is impossible to tell. But whatever may be the immediate effect of the resolutions they have at least gone on record as a testimony against the iniquity of religious legislation upon which Congress has set. The whole Sunday law of Tennessee ought to be repealed, as ought every other Sunday law, and this protest ought to have the effect of hastening the day of such repeal, not in one State but in every State in the Union.

Massachusetts (Mr. O'Neil) two resolutions most respectfully but earnestly petition that your honorable house of representatives equalize and diminish, to that end, to the following.

THE SPEAKER.—It would not. (Laughter on the floor.)

MR. POWERS.—Yes it was. The fact is the fact of this—

Yes, it is true, the facts of this whole matter is that the floor, and only fair thing is not to be rubbed out. But it been well done!
