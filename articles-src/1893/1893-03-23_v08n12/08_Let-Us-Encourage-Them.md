The Ledger, of Noblesville, Ind., has a correspondent who appreciates the principle of truth and equity for which the Seventh-day Adventists stand. The evolution of this principle is that which makes for righteousness. To oppose its progress is to defend and strengthen the powers of unrighteousness. This is so clear that it is only the blind who do not see it. Let these blind followers of the blind consider what ditch it is into which they will fall. The Ledger correspondent says:—

"I see Comrade Rev. E. Bailey says I come to the front to espouse the cause of the Adventist: he is right. I am always ready to defend the Christians who are persecuted for righteousness. The Adventists are right so far as any command by Christ or his disciples. Constantine who became Emperor of Rome was a convert to Christianity, and previously had been a pagan, and the pagans had many gods and from the names of their gods, we have the names of the days of the week, (1.) Sunday, god of the sun; (2.) Monday, goddess of the moon, wife of the sun; (3.) Tuesday from Tuisco, god of war; (4.) Wednesday, from Woden, god of the Germans; (5.) Thursday from Thor, the god thunder; (6) Friday, the female deity, who presides over love and matrimony; (7.) Saturday, for the god Saturn, one of the planets.

"The greatest crime that man can be guilty of is to murder innocent persons; and that by an ecclesiastical law, called the Inquisition, in which millions of innocent, men, women and children were put to death, because their religious faith did not agree with the majority.

"Any law that will punish innocent persons for their belief is a species of inquisitorial law. The Constitution of the United States, Amendment, Article 1, is, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' Any and all laws of the States compelling any one to keep a day set for religious purposes is unconstitutional. All prosecution for violation of such laws is punishment by an inquisition to that degree.

"Now I understand the Adventists are universally opposed to all such laws. They are right; that was the intention of the framers of the United States Constitution under which every citizen is free and equal. The Government should protect all religious organizations in their meetings and assemblies. We have made more advancement in history, science and literature in the last fifty years than was made in one thousand when we had an Inquisition. The Adventists are evoluting, let us encourage them. They are standing for good works.

"JAMEL OLDACRE."
