THE Colorado Sun, of February 5, has this pertinent paragraph:—

> One of the fundamental principles upon which this Government was established, was the entire separation of Church and State. This means something more than that there shall be no church recognized and supported by the State. It means that the State shall never legislate for the indorsement, maintenance and enforcement of the doctrines or requirements of any church merely because they are such. It means that the State shall never embody in its laws the rules and ordinances of any system of religion simply because they claim or even possess the divine sanction.

This is quite true, for Government can, of right, have nothing to do with divine sanctions. Governments are instituted for the securing of natural rights, not for the defining of moral duties.
