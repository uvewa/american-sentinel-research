Civil liberty is a product of the gospel. To demand complete freedom for himself is natural to every man, but to deny to all others the same liberty which he so earnestly desires for himself is just as natural. To the unregenerate man liberty means freedom from authoritative control coupled with the possession of despotic power over all others.

For wherever to-day to exercise the right of might, the gospel of force, this only can the natural man understand, the possession of this only satisfies him. What Worldly wisdom—so-called—intellectual liberty—is also comprehended by the spiritual man. Before the understanding of this paradox of freedom through subjection can enter the mind of man, he must first have talked with God, as did Nicodemus, must, being born of the Lord, have learned the mystery of regeneration.

For wherever to-day those who have been most rightly represent the cause of civil liberty and human rights, pure and simple, while seemingly antagonizing Christianity, by denying its power and authority over the world in the hands of men, are, like all other reformers, like all the great ethical teachers of their contemporaries, in the line of the cause they unconsciously follow in the steps of Christ and but needed some one, like another Paul to the Athenians, to preach to them the God whom they ignorantly worshiped. Who will say that the unknown who knelt at the altar of the unknown god was not nearer to the kingdom of God than the Pharisee, the dust of whose city Paul had shaken from his feet?

From the desire for liberty to the possession is an upward step, but this is in the pinnacle; there is but one step from the possession of liberty to the desire for power, this is a downward step. Through ambition aided by skill, by the power of the grace of God in the only thing that really could feeble humanity, whatever its Christian profession, expect to gain by that through which heavenly power was lost? When once the unholy lust for power has entered into the heart of the church, the satanic poison has begun its work and that is a fallen church, or, as that was Lucifer a fallen angel. The fallen angel grows and the fallen church will be kindred spirits, and they will work the same works.

As Lucifer sought supremacy, arrogating to himself the possession of the trained intellectuality of the world sacrificed by a superior spirituality in its own esteem, then is the time that it will set up its claim to rule the world, as Satan, drunk with a consciousness of its own beauty and a supposed intelligence, coveting divine supremacy in the heavens. Those two, then, having purposes which complement each other and lead to the same end, become natural allies, and the human power and intelligence become the dupe and the tool of the supernatural subtlety to work its purposes out.

That day is past when the stern and hardy pagan may think to stay the progress of the gospel by hurling the greatest of his defiance in its path—to-day power seems to be sought on its side, and those who carried the Word of the Lord of hosts, though alone, were supported by the hosts of those who wait upon their Lord to do his bidding. Their armed hordes have disappeared like the frost before the morning sun; and the pagan sword and the pagan cause have been replaced by the pen of the subtle satirist, whilst the voice of the orator to thousands now ring from the public platform, and the pulpit, controlling the world.

The powers of evil, heretofore in the world's history, have used the grosser subtlest deceptions conceivable by the mind of the master of all deceivableness, have been developed, and a capacity for a higher intensity of action has been gained. The results of this are already seen and will continue to be manifested to a greater and still to a greater degree. The end which was seen by the wicked one long ago has grown under his fostering care so luxuriantly, and in such perfect semblance to the wheat itself, that many can not distinguish the tares from the good grain. This is part of the plan of the great deceiver, that in this age the good ground should be occupied by the tares, that in their rank growth they might overrun the wheat and keep the only and the rightful crop down. As a result of this satanic policy, ecclesiasticism has arisen and the nominal church becomes a danger to its own. This infant church, while professedly spiritual in character, purpose, and intent, has become a human organization, the epitome of a worldly guile and vainglory and the attainment of temporal power and authority. Fundamentalism is infancy and weakness, in this country, the not only willing of the civil Government depend upon it. As this established church has grown up—and being established has become the accepted national religion, recognized as such by Government—it is an appointed chaplaincy in company; by lawyers, as in the matter of wills; by insurance by labor, representatives, and senator, in legislative halls,—it still takes the bold action of the national and State treasuries into ecclesiastical appropriations and exemptions from taxation. This grasp of the continuity to its existence, prove to be a tenacious one, and its hold upon the national life becomes of such strength with a full dependence upon the State. To prove is a certainty, moreover, that is as much ecclesiasticism and not pure religion insist and free from the corruption of the world.

Now, however, having gained numbers, wealth, position, it is no longer necessary to remain upheld; but by right of its acknowledged spiritual authority must claim temporal power. That is all the attempt to enforce this claim should be made under existing conditions, in existing upon the title of time and the nature of man should be reversed, and all mankind come, like Nicodemus, to the feet of the Lord to be taught of living, and be born again of the Spirit into righteousness.

Ecclesiasticism has always been a practical and deceptive despotism. By that sign it may be known that it has not preached the gospel or practised the precepts. The gospel civil liberty; ecclesiasticism, of despotism; ecclesiasticism in its infancy or weakness, civil liberty, ecclesiasticism in its maturity despotic power. Civil and religious freedom is the product of the gospel and of this country, the fruit of the first Religious Congress of the United States at Washington, and the inauguration of a national religion to the revolution which has taken place, and is now going on to work both in this United States the foe of the gospel, which the nominal church—ecclesiasticism, the shadow of the Church, has now usurped the civil power.
