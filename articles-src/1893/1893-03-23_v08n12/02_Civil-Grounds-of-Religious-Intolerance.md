In every age and in every country religious intolerance has been exercised to a greater or less extent on the ground of civil necessity. The victims have been stigmatized as enemies of the State, subversive of civil order, and dangerous to the public peace. Ahab's wicked accusation, "Art thou he that troubleth himself?" has been repeated in various forms in every country and in every age from that time until the present. When Daniel was summoned to the king because he prayed three times a day contrary to the royal mandate, the accusation was in these terms: This man, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed. Before Pilate the charge against the cross was held to be subversive of social order, and his example to be pernicious in the community.

The Son of God was accused "as one that perverteth the people" (Luke 23: 14), and the prevailing argument with Pilate for his condemnation was, "If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend;" whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. Religious bigotry nailed Christ to the cross; and the penalties of the civil law; he suffered, not as a violator of the moral law, but of the law of the State.

The apostles were also accused of being disturbers of the peace. At Thessalonica the cry was, "These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;" whom Jason does receive; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Cæsar, saying there is another king, one Jesus. And at Ephesus, the silversmiths raised a tumult because their craft was endangered by the preaching of the apostles—and these were their fear-groundless. The danger to their craft was all the real danger that really existed; so close was the relation between the prevailing faith and the social and commercial customs of the people. Thus they plausibly argued that there existed a substantial civil basis for their prohibition of the preaching of the doctrine of Christ.

It is said that "times and things change and people with them;" but there is really little truth in the oft-repeated maxim. The grace of God is in the only thing that really changes people. Men are naturally intolerant, and we still find them using the power of the State to enforce religious dogma, and to bolster up religious creeds; and at the same time justifying that action on civil grounds.

In our own country the attempt has been made to justify various measures of religious legislation on the ground that the stability of our institutions and even of the Government itself depends upon the religious observance of Sunday. This is actually true of Sunday laws. In his "History of Sunday Legislation" Mr. Blakely says:—

The conviction of the majority that the Nation can not be preserved without religion, nor religion without a day of weekly rest, nor the observance of a day of rest without the authority of law, is the basis of all Sunday legislation to the right of self-preservation, not in violation of any prohibition of the organic law.

The argument is plausible, but in the actual, it would if all carried out, destroy in the destruction of the past and revive the bloody persecutions of the Dark Ages. An exact parallel to it is found in Russia to-day. There the faith of the dominant Church is the established religion; and Lady Herbert of Lea, a Roman Catholic, writes for the *Nineteenth Century*, for January, that "the chief menace to the body and integrity of Russia is the disunion of religious sects within her confines." It follows, according to Mr. Blakely's argument, that the Russian Czar is perfectly justifiable in maintaining that menace.

The statement quoted from Lady Herbert is confirmed by the Russian Government invited by the Russian Government to visit the principal religious establishments in that country. "It was everywhere plainly revealed," says the *Review of Reviews,* "that the Church was its own Pobyedonostzeff," the famous procurator of the Holy Synod. Pobyedonostzeff said to his guest, saying, as Lady Herbert reports his language, "that the sects are going to ruin and that its decay may be found in the growing tendencies of the revolutionary and social principles which are sapping it of its faith and loyalty." Russia, "he said," "we have preserved the right of authority, and the flag." There respect for the Christian religion. The people are attached to "if there is no respect for authority or the law at the bottom, and thoroughly good at the bottom, and they enjoy a state of prosperity which there are no political parties, no parties, no political press, no revolutionary trials; the streets at night you need never fear to avoid any contact with what might disturb you."

Father Vannitelli himself says:—

Fear and ignorance among the people . . . and who can visit Russia with about it afterwards and hear the name of Russia mentioned without associating with it notions of barbarism! I think any description of Russia must be incorrect unless much of the groundwork of it is given . . . and nowhere does Christ reign to such an extent as in Russia.

As to the condition of religious liberty in the February *Century*, by Pierre Botkine, a Russian living in this city of Washington, will serve to throw some additional light upon this subject and show about what Vannitelli meant by saying that "nowhere does Christ reign as in Russia." Botkine says:—

The accepted classes are precisely in the unity of power, in the first faith of the people in their Czar, the foundation of their system.

The Russian idea is that the Czar reigns by divine right. He is the acknowledged head of the entire church as well as the civil government, and the fealty of the people to him is not simply that of subjects to a civil ruler but to a spiritual autocrat, and he who has but a just political claim has also but the best political reasons against them or to oblige them to leave their religious vernacular center in a great deal individually, material, the Czar, these are the power over them, and the contemporaneous instrument of the government which is thus the authorized head of the church as well as the human will.

Now what Mr. Botkine has already here said it is scarcely necessary to say that the rulers of Russia and of their State system. It is scarcely necessary to say that the established church, or to draw away converts from it. It is not intended, however, to undermine the empire itself, or to destroy it through its political, as well as a feeling of patriotism that is the strength of the State through the church is from direct modifications in Russia; and one of the fundamental articles of the faith basis of political Mr. Botkine.

The Orthodox Church in the State Church in Russia; Mohammedanism is recognized as a partially tolerated; but the other are not of the empire are converts of or by or depend upon the Government. But Mr. Botkine says—

Considering however that all are Russian citizens, full of patriotism and love, the law should provide certain measures of protection, and must of this. It is therefore natural that any interference on the part of foreign missionaries, or organizations, and strive to prevent the interests of the Russian Government in those remote parts of the empire.

This is but putting in other words the identical argument used in justifying Sunday laws or the enforcement of Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and Crafts in justification of Sunday laws.

In Russia to be it in the open of, most of the majority, at least of those who have religious faith, believe that there can be no religion, nor religion without the Orthodox Church, nor the Orthodox worship without laws; therefore, such laws are sustained by right of self-preservation; in violation of no prohibition of the organic law to compel or to curtail out all religious opinions—a religious body is the recognized and as much in the interests of the law of the majority in Russia as here; that is, the state church; or in other words, persecuting in another; to destroy or render without strength. The motive is not religious but political; the Czar wishes to retain his hold on his subjects, and he therefore strips religion of his empire only that has to deny the truth fully for it in order to help together the various parts and elements in this empire. This logic is as good as that of those who maintain that the same principle is the same in America as in Europe or in Russia.

Mr. Botkine denies that there is any religious persecution in Russia, and of course, whereas certain occasions seem to occur, we must insist also that certain individuals of morals or of good morals should be removed. Botkine says:—"We did not expel the Jews from Russia, as has been so widely stated, but they did restrict their rights as to locality, founding all localities of the law in their favor, which had long been set for." This being the case, Mr. Botkine regards the course of Russia toward the Jews and other countries as most impertinent. Taking Mr. Botkine's testimony for what it is worth:—

It can be observed that the arguments urged in justification of restrictions of religious liberty are the same in every country and in every age. Elijah was Daniel was persecuted because he regarded not the king's command; Christ was put
