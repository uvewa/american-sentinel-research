SUNDAY as a holy day rests only on the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. No text of sacred Scripture so much as intimates that the first day of the week is in any wise different from the other days allotted to secular affairs. Neither Christ, the apostles, or the Apostolic Church honored Sunday above other days. Neander says: "The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always only a human ordinance, and it was far from the intentions of the apostles to establish a divine command in this respect, far from them and from the early Apostolic Church, to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday."—Rose's Neander, page 186.
