May 19, the President and Mrs. Cleveland gave a reception to the delegates of the Presbyterian General Assembly, wives, and friends, to the number of 2,500. After the formal introduction of the guests, Rev. Dr. Craig, Moderator of the Assembly, addressed the President as follows:—

> You know somewhat of the Presbyterian Church. Many of these gentlemen who are here had precisely the same general experience that you had, perchance—reared amid the same plain living and the high thinking of that wonderful nursery of strong men. We have common experiences which make us, though we may never have come together before, to be, as it were, friends, because we know the things which have, perchance, made us to be worthy of the esteem of our fellow-men, and made you, sir, worthy to rule, with the confidence of your fellow citizens gathered close around about you, the mightiest Nation of the world. Let me, sir, congratulate you upon the fact that sturdy Presbyterians hedge you round about and that the sturdiest Presbyterian of us all is at your side, a holy benediction to keep you straight to the faith of your ancestors, which is not only the great assurance of success, but it is the highway to the immediate presence of the living God. I am not much inclined to the common saying, "You must be obedient unto your wives." I never was yet enabled to do that, as I have been officiating around the holy altar. But, sir, you are entitled not only to give us instruction from your high place, but order; now I have this little chance to give you an instruction, I tell you, be obedient to her.

> I have but one word more to say, sir, and this gives me more pleasure than most men who are addressing you in these days. I am afraid of late hours. You ought to be refreshed when you talk with a man who represents 2,500, people who do not want a single office. [Applause.]

In conclusion Dr. Craig invited the President to visit the Assembly; after which Mr. Cleveland responded in these words:

> I assure you it affords me much personal gratification to meet on this occasion the representatives of that great religious denomination which has done so much to make our people better and happier, and which is associated with so many tender and pleasing incidents of individual experience. The thought is also in my mind that in the light of my public duties and responsibilities there is a propriety in extending to you a welcome to this home of the Nation's chief executive. We still profess to be Christian people. This means that no public officer of high or low degree should be unmindful of the restraints of religious sentiments. It means that the religious teachings of our people should lead them to exact from those who make and execute their laws a recognition of these restraints. It means that the rules which a popular religious sense approves should underlie the performance of every public duty; and it means that those who assume to be religious teachers in this land, where the people rule, are related in responsibility to those in public station.

> You, therefore will, I hope, permit me to say that though you do well to insist upon the conscientious discharge of official obligations, and though you ought never to shrink from the exposure of official shortcomings, the contribution you owe toward accomplishing good government will not be fully made unless you teach the people by precept and example that they will find their safety and welfare in enforcing upon their public servants the observance of the mandates of Christianity and morality. There ought to be inspiration in the thought that our country's destiny is in our hands, and it ought to dignify our Americanism to feel and know that those who teach and those who govern and those in every walk of citizenship have a share in our preservation as a Christian people and in the guaranty this affords of grand national achievements.

Nine days after uttering these sentiments the President went yachting on Sunday, and now the Presbyterians think him very inconsistent.
