The most astonishing statement, produced by Protestants in favor of keeping Sunday instead of Saturday as the "Sabbath day," is the following in the *Mid-Continent:*—

The change of day—as called—was effected not in the sense that the Sabbath was regarded as the Sabbath on any *particular* day, by law, has continued limited and acknowledge that God did establish the Sabbath day by giving it that place. Its nature, the same as that of, divine example, made man the crown of creation. It has been said that the first manifestation of God to man was the making of the world—and "he rested on the seventh day," and sanctified it. From all this, the question is asked by Protestants as to what day "the seventh day" is. Is it the day after the creation of man on the earth, the only manifestation of God in the flesh, and the Word Incarnate, and let his divine example be both the test of the "particular" day and a "the Sabbath." From the beginning of man in the world; and of the validity and sacredness of the keeping of the same Saturday for "particular-day." We answer the anti-Bible, or at least the particular editor of the *Mid-Continent,* a copy, he speaks as if he had never read the "Bible." It is from the Bible it follows, that our Saviour kept the Sabbath day on Saturday; that he kept it for Saturday—and not Sunday—holy—

And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up, and he went into the synagogue, according to his custom, on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read, and there was delivered to him the book of Isaiah and the Spirit of the Lord is upon me; where written. The spirit of the Lord is upon me; where he has appointed me to preach the Gospel.

And our Saviour kept Saturday, the seventh day of the week, during all his earthly life, during all his time when he preached the gospel to the people, and in his divine preaching never spoke of any day but the Sabbath. In his entire character, his divine example always was to the world—for he died for all—and in his whole life, the Sabbath Saturday.

But our Saviour also stated his whole life is for Saturday, the last day of the week, as the Sabbath day. In Matt. 11:11, 14,

he drove the buyers and of the temple where Saturday the Sabbath day was enshrined. In Matt. 23, when he laid his authority to obey the divine law's given, who made them observe Saturday, the Sabbath day. In Luke 6 where he obtained the granting of corn on the Sabbath day, which he would not have done on a day that was anything but a Sabbath and a holy day. And in John 7:15-22 he uses it as a divine example. And in John 7:15-22 the Saviour continued the matter with a divine example.

The Catholic Church, of its own legislative authority, rested Sunday a holy day to take the place of the Sabbath of the old law, and as Catholics are bound to obey the commands of the Church equally with the commands given on Sinai, Catholics must observe Sunday.

But what in the world do Protestants mean by observing Sunday?
