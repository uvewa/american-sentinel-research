## The Superior Court of Cook County Defends

JUDGE STEIN of the Superior Court of Cook County has granted a temporary injunction restraining the authorities of the Columbian Exposition from closing the Park, or Public grounds in Jackson Park, to the People, on Saturdays or Sundays. This cause was brought by The People's Rights Association, as counsel for C. W. Clingman, a resident of the south side of Chicago, and a stockholder in the World's Fair corporation, was brought upon the following necessary facts and technical legal matter.

That the said premises occupied by the said Exposition are, and were before such occupation, a part of the State of Illinois, and adopted by the people, that the said premises were first established as a public park dedicated to the people, and known as Jackson Park, Hyde Park and Lake. Approved February 24, 1869. By this act of the Legislature, the title to said premises as follows: "Which said land herein above designated, and such other tracts, pieces or parcels of land, as may hereafter be taken, reserved as provided by this act, shall be held, managed and controlled by said board of commissioners, and shall be open and free to all persons forever." Said premises known as Jackson Park and the Lake Front, are the property of the public and the people or their representatives for the well understood general public.

Your orators further represent that they are informed and believe, that the said corporation has assumed and claimed to have exclusive, right of individual property to the said World's Columbian Exposition, and have claimed and assumed to have the right of exclusive right of management and are claiming to exercise supreme jurisdiction in the matter of these premises, and to have the right to close said premises and to exclude people therefrom. But your orators allege nor the said World's Exposition or Company have any such right or rights, and that their claims are contrary to the original Act under, and by virtue of which the said park board and corporation obtained control, and under which they manage the same; that the public in general, upon the purchase of the said property and the payment of a large amount of money therefor, became possessed of said premises in question; and that while the said law gives the said park authorities the right to maintain them to make rules for the regulation of the said premises and the admission of the public thereto, the Legislature of the State had no power to thwart or close of the said premises which provides that the said grounds shall be "open and free to all persons forever." For neither the Legislature of the State of Illinois, nor the Congress of the United States nor any other officer or officers of the government, nor officials nor representative of the people themselves, can have power or authority or the right to take away or abridge the inalienable rights of the people.

Your orators further aver unto your Honors that charge the fact to be that the said Directors of the World's Columbian Exposition, and the people of the Congress of the United States, have decided to close said Exposition on Sunday, to the great detriment, that said grounds are occupied and used by certain buildings which contain exhibits of great and historical value and interest from many countries and peoples of the earth, and such exhibits afford much instruction to and are as attractiveness to the patrons of the said Fair and to the people.

The gist of this bill is the avertment of the part of the Government of a corporation to contravene an act of Congress and a law of the State of Illinois. This bill was filed on Saturday, the 13th day of May, and the hearing was set for to the following Wednesday. It is understood that, it will go finally to the higher judges. The two judges of the United States court, Judge Fuller and Judge Fullerton of the United States Supreme Court is in consultation. The decision of the court is therefore awaited with great interest as circumstance partakes of the reflected adjudication by the Supreme Court of this country. In the meantime, according to a decision entirely at variance with the history, with which the National Commission

failed to disagree, and in obedience to the injunction, issuing from Judge Stein's Court forbidding the World's Fair authorities from closing the public park in which the Exposition is situated, to the people on Sundays, the Exposition will be open on Sundays until the question is resolved. A very decision is laid in this case in the first instance, by Mr. Milchrist and Mr. Edwin Waller, who is in attorney for the corporation, and who asks the court, he will need certainly two weeks for the preparation of the bill in such case, consequently there will be at least two more Sundays on which it will be open, and both the grounds and the buildings, will be open on Sundays; and at least the individual exhibitors and States see fit to open their buildings also.
