THE evening *World* of this city, remarks that "Attorney-General Olney goes out of his way to aid and encourage the various sectarian trusts which seek to make Sunday a closed day in America. He would be much more fittingly employed in getting into the way to block the more material trusts which rob labor for monopoly's enrichment."
