JUDGE STEIN of the Superior Court of Cook County has granted a temporary injunction restraining the authorities of the World's Fair from closing Jackson Park, in which the Fair is situated, to the people on Sundays. This case was brought by Ex-Congressman William E. Mason, as counsel for C. W. Clingman, a resident and tax-payer in the city of Chicago, and stock-holder in the World's Fair corporation, and others. After setting forth the necessary facts and technical legal matter, Mr. Mason represents—

> That the said premises occupied by the said Exposition are described in the Act of the Legislature of the State of Illinois, and adopted by the people, entitled, "An Act to provide for the location and maintenance of a park for the towns of South Chicago, Hyde Park and Lake. Approved February 24, 1893," as public lands, and the South Park Commissioners by the terms of the original act hold title to said premises as follows: "Which said land and premises when acquired by the said Commissioners as provided by this act, shall be held, managed and controlled by them and their successors as a public park for the recreation, health and benefit of the public, and free to all persons forever," and "subject to such rules and regulations as shall from time to time be adopted by such Commissioners or their representatives for the well ordering and regulation of the same."

> Your orators further represent that they are informed that the said South Park Commissioners have attempted to make a pretended lease of said public property to the said World's Columbian Exposition, a corporation, etc., but your orators charge that neither the said Park Commissioners nor the said World's Exposition Company have any right or authority to make any rule or regulation contrary to the original Act under, and by virtue of which, the people purchased and became possessed of the said premises, and that the people, or the public in general, upon the purchase of the said premises in question became possessed of the same with the right to free access "forever" to the premises in question; and that while the said law creating the said South Park Commissioners permits them to make rules for the regulation of the same, such rules must be consistent with the act creating the said Board, and permitting the purchase of the said premises which provides that the said premises shall be open as a public park "to all persons forever," and that, neither the Legislature of the State of Illinois, nor the Congress of the United States, nor any authority short of a vote of the people themselves, can have power or right to change or modify the right of the people to use and occupy said premises for "health" and "recreation" forever."

> Your orators further show unto your Honor that they are informed and believe, and therefore charge the fact to be that the said Directors of the said Exposition, pretending to be guided by an Act of Congress of the United States, have decided to open a part of the premises in question, and to close a part, to wit: that part of the premises occupied by certain buildings which contain exhibits of great interest to the people, and of great benefit to the stockholders of said Exposition, by reason of their attractiveness to the patrons of the said Exposition, and that the said pretense of the said Directors of the said Exposition is, that they are bound by the Act of Congress to close the said part of the said premises on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; but your orators show unto your Honor that the said Act of Congress is wholly unconstitutional and void, the first section of the Constitution of the United States providing as follows, to wit: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." And your orators represent that the said Act of Congress, under which the said Directors of the said Exposition pretend to act, attempts to establish the said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship as against the seventh day of the week, commonly called Saturday, which is used by a part of the complainants to this bill as a day of rest and worship; and is an attempt of Congress to make a law "respecting an establishment of religion," and "prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

> Your orators further represent that the said Act of Congress, which the said Commissioners pretend to be operating under, provides that it shall in no way interfere with the laws of the State of Illinois.

> Your orators further represent that the constitution of the State of Illinois, Article 8, Section 3, is as follows, to wit: "That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their consciences; that no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

> And your orators further represent that the said Act of Congress which attempts to close the said Fair, or Exposition, on the first day of the week, commonly known as Sunday, is giving a "preference" to those "religious establishments" which rest and worship on the first day of the week commonly known as Sunday, to the prejudice of those "religious establishments" which worship on the seventh day of the week, commonly known as Saturday, as directed and commanded in Holy Writ. And while your orators, who worship on Saturday or Sabbath, can not conscientiously attend the said Exposition upon the Sabbath day, commonly called Saturday, they have not sought to interfere with the conscience of other people who desire to visit the said Exposition on the Sabbath day, commonly called Saturday, and charge that any attempt to prevent them from visiting the said Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, is an abridgment of their constitutional right and is an attempt to illegally prefer or to give preference to other modes of worship against their mode of worship, and is therefore unconstitutional and void.

In the course of his opinion in this case granting the temporary injunction asked for, Judge Stein said:—

> In the first place it is contended that Congress, having sole and supreme jurisdiction, has enacted a law that the Fair shall be closed Sundays. Even if it were true (which it is not) that Congress had sole or supreme jurisdiction in the matter in hand, still in the first act of Congress concerning the Exposition and creating the Board of National Commissioners (approved April 25, 1890) it is provided that "nothing in this act shall be so construed as to override or interfere with the laws of any State." Nor is it true that Congress has passed a law requiring the Fair to be closed Sunday. On the contrary, it has carefully refrained from doing so, probably for the reason that it knew it had no power.

> What it did do was by the act approved Aug. 5, 1892, to make certain appropriations, including the $2,500,000, "upon the condition that the said Exposition shall not be opened to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and if the said appropriation be accepted by the World's Columbian Exposition upon that condition it shall be and hereby is made the duty of the World's Columbian Commission, to make such rules as shall require the closing of the Exposition Sunday." It was only by the acceptance of this condition by the Exposition Board of Directors that the clause forbidding Sunday opening became operative. In effect Congress offered them a certain sum of money, provided they would do a certain thing. They accepted the proposition and thereby entered into a contract with Congress.

> As it takes two both to make a contract and to change it after it is made, and Congress had seen fit on its part, without the concurrence of the second party to the contract, to withhold one-fifth of the lump sum appropriated, there was therefore such a breach of contract, on the part of the Government, as to relieve the directors from their obligations, entered into in the acceptance of the proviso attached to the contract for the appropriation required in the act of Congress.

An intervening petition opposing the granting of the injunction, and in favor of Sunday closing, was filed in this case by an attorney for the American Sabbath Union; referring to the argument of this attorney the Judge said:—

> "This is a Christian Nation," says the intervening petitioner, and "Christianity," says his counsel, "is a part of the law of the land," and, therefore, the injunction should not be granted. In the "Bill of Rights," being article 2 of the constitution of Illinois, the people of the State have declared: "The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall forever be guaranteed; and no preference shall be given by law to any denomination or mode of worship." There is a well-known Christian sect, the adherents of which believe that Saturday and not Sunday is the proper and rightful day of rest and worship; and even among those who regard Sunday as the proper day there is serious differences of opinion as to the manner in which it should be kept. In this as in other countries there are millions of professing Christians who see no wrong in taking recreation on Sunday. Even if Christianity be imbedded in the law—which is not free from legal doubt—yet it by no means follows that the Christian religion, as practiced by large numbers of its devout believers, requires the Fair to be closed Sunday.

> It is next objected that for the court to grant the injunction asked for would be a violation of the law of the State, because section 317 of our criminal code provides that "whoever disturbs the peace and good order of society by labor or any amusement or diversion Sunday shall be fined not to exceed $25." It is assumed by the intervening petitioner and his counsel that keeping the Fair open Sundays will result in a disturbance of the peace. As a citizen, the Court, with many others, is of the opinion that under the conditions known to prevail in this community the opening of the Fair Sundays, instead of disturbing, will directly and powerfully conduce to "the peace and good order," and, one may safely add, to the education and elevation "of society."

In regard to the plea that Jackson Park, in which the Exposition is located, is a public park dedicated to the people, and that the usufruct of this public ground is in them forever, Judge Stein said:—

> By the act of the legislature providing for the location and maintenance of the South Park, the commissioners are to hold and manage the park grounds, "subject to such rules and regulations as shall from time to time be adopted by them or their representatives for the well-ordering and regulation of the same." Under this provision the commissioners may make such rules and regulations as are reasonable and proper to effect the purposes for which the park system was established. It does not appear that the "agreement," to close the park was entered into in pursuance of any rule or regulation made by the commissioners, or that any rule was made by them regulating the admission to the park Sunday or any other day. Upon the showing now made, and even regarding the "agreement" as a rule, the Court is not in a position to determine whether it is a reasonable exercise of the powers conferred upon the commissioners. It devolves upon those who claim that the exclusion of the public Sundays was rightful to show the reasonableness of the action taken in that regard. This not having been done the complainant is entitled, on the face of his bill, to a preliminary injunction as prayed for.

The temporary injunction being thus granted, Wednesday, the 7th of June, was set for a final hearing on the motion for a perpetual injunction.
