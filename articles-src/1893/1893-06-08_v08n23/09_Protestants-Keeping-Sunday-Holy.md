[Apropos of that which we have repeatedly said relative to the only authority for Sunday observance, is the following article from the *Kansas City Catholic*, of Feb. 9, 1893. We give the article entire. The reader will observe that the scripture quotations are from the Donay version, which, however, in these texts, does not differ materially from the King James.]

THE agitation for and against "the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday," brings the strange—in fact, wild—inconsistency of the Protestants in keeping Sunday holy under a flood of light. In an article in the *Mid-Continent* some weeks ago, entitled, "The Change of Day Question," the position taken in defense of Protestants observing Sunday as a holy day is more than ordinarily ludicrous. In reply to a question put to it by a correspondent as to why Protestants have changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, and as to why they do not keep Saturday the Sabbath day, and keep it holy, the *Mid-Continent* says:—

> The difficulty which our correspondent has upon the subject is the same that others have experienced, viz: in expecting to find in the Scriptures a legislative injunction in favor of a particular day.

If there be no "particular day" set apart, why decree that either Sunday or Saturday, or any other "particular day" be observed?

This is among the most extraordinary assertions that we have seen, even in defense of Protestantism, and that is pursuing the possibility of assertion to its limit. That book so much abused by Protestants that their inconsistencies and contradictions over it have destroyed all firm belief in it among the masses in even their own "membership," the Bible—"the Scriptures" spoken of in the above—has this "legislative injunction" in it, commanding, under pain of punishment here and hereafter, "a particular day," and that day Saturday for "the Sabbath." Let us quote the Scriptures:—

> And the Lord spoke all these words. . . . REMEMBER that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. . . . The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; thou shalt do no work on it; thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates. For [because] in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day' trebleevate, the Lord blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it. Exodus 20.

God here tells them to "remember," what had always been a command from the beginning, and refers them back to the creation of the world for the original command and its cause. The "injunction" being to "keep holy the Sabbath day," being "the seventh day" of the week as time was measured from the beginning by man. This is repeated, again and again in chapters 23:10, 11, 12; 31:13–17; 34:21; 35:1–3; Lev. 23:3–8. And in memory of the injunction, the command, given to Adam at the beginning, because God "rested on the seventh day," Saturday, and commanded that "particular day" to be kept holy—to prevent their over forgetting the day of the week—they were made to set every seventh year apart as the Sabbath year, so as to ininstructibly inculcate and commemorate the day among the Jews, so that they could not forget that the seventh day of the week, Saturday, was "the Sabbath." (See Lev. 25:4; Num. 19:4.) If the editor of the *Mid-Continent* had never seen a Bible, this refreshing statement would be excusable. But in the sects, in men who claim that all religion is within the leaves of this very Bible of which all the foregoing string of testimonies are a part, this is a stretch of desperation so foolish that we did not think that even a bad case would drive any one to it.

THE DIVINE COMMAND TO KEEP SATURDAY.

The *Mid-Continent* continues:—

> A divine precept did not lay the foundation of the Sabbath at the beginning of the world's history. No one, if challenged could have pointed in the first twenty-five hundred years of the world's career to a single divine command ordaining the Sabbath.

When the Lord spoke on Mount Sinai, the Bible tells us that he told all mankind that in the very first hour of the world's career, he did give a "divine command ordaining the Sabbath," and in now attempting to explain away the Sabbath, we hope (with all due reverence to the name of God, even in battling with the marvelous squirming of the sects) that these sectaries will not claim that God was untruthful on Mount Sinai. But if some good Presbyterian will loan this Presbyterian editor a copy of the Bible, besides the statement given from God on Sinai, and the other testimonies we have given from the Scriptures, the first two chapters in the Bible will contradict him.

THE DAY THAT ADAM OBSERVED.

The *Mid-Continent* continues:—

> Did Adam observe the seventh or the first day of the week? The record shows that man's first full day on earth was the Sabbath. His Sabbath was not on Saturday, but on the day commonly called Sunday. It was on the first day of the week.

As it is not possible that the editor of the *Mid-Continent* never saw and read a Bible, he evidently wishes to cover over an irreparable blunder by a foolish misstatement. The first two chapters of the Bible tell him:—

> And God . . . said: let us make man to our image and likeness. . . . And God created man to his own image; to the image of God he created them. . . . And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. Gen. 1:25–28.

> And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. And he blessed the seventh day and sanctified it. Gen. 2:1–3.

Adam was created on the sixth day, and the "seventh day" was "blessed" and "sanctified" for him, and he was commanded to keep the seventh day the "Sabbath day," which is as distinct a command to not keep the first day or any other day but the seventh day, Saturday.

And to render plain and make the day unmistakable through all time the Jewish posterity of Adam divided all time into weeks and kept the seventh day of each week, Saturday, as God commanded Adam, and as God again commanded Moses, and as the Jews were reminded and continuously commanded in the Bible ever since. And too, as far as a command and its capital enforcement could make the command imperishable, the Sabbath-breaker, the man who does not both keep Saturday as the Sabbath and keep Saturday "holy," is commanded by the Bible to be punished with death. Num. 15:32–36.

The Catholic Church abrogated "the Sabbath" and made the change of day from Saturday to Sunday by virtue of the power conferred upon her by Christ when he said: "All power is given to me in heaven and on earth." Matt. 28:18.

"Whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven." Matt. 18:18. Here is the warrant and commission given the apostles and their successors the bishops and pastors of the Church. He received all power in heaven and on earth, and he gave that power to the apostles and their successors, and "sent" them "as the Father sent him" (John 20:21), to bind and loose upon earth, and anything that the Church shall bind or loose upon earth shall be bound or loosed also in heaven. By the power of Jesus Christ her Founder, the Catholic Church, in the plenitude of her infallible power, abrogated Saturday, the Sabbath of the old law, and substituted Sunday in its place, and commanded Sunday to be kept holy in the manner that she commands. We see, then, that not only do all who keep Sunday acknowledge the infallibility of the Catholic Church whether they wish to do so or not; but that to observe it in any other manner than the manner in which she commands, if it be observed at all, and yet claim that it is a religious observance, is insensate.

OUR SAVIOUR AND "THE SABBATH."

The most astonishing statement, probably, that we have seen about keeping Sunday instead of Saturday as the "Sabbath day," is the following in the *Mid-Continent*:—

> The change of day—so called—was effected in the same way that the Sabbath was originally established, viz, by divine example.

After stating that God did not establish the Sabbath on any particular day, he here contradicts himself and acknowledges that God did establish the Sabbath day; but let that pass. He here states that God, by divine example, made a change of day from Saturday to Sunday. The first manifestation of God to man was after he had created Adam, and "he rested on the seventh day," and sanctified it. And if there be any further dispute by Protestants as to what day "the seventh day" was from the beginning of man on the earth, the only manifestation of God in the flesh was the Word Incarnate, and let his divine example be both the test of the "particular day" kept as "the Sabbath" from the beginning of man in the world, and of the validity and binding force of the command to keep Saturday the "particular day." We must ask some Bible Christian to loan this apparently anti-Bible, or at least Bibleless editor of the *Mid-Continent* a copy, as he speaks as if he had never seen the Bible. Matthew tells us, as follows, that our Saviour kept the Sabbath day on Saturday, and that he kept Saturday—and not Sunday—holy:—

> And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up; and he went into the synagogue, according to his custom on the Sabbath day; and he rose up and read. And he found the place where it is written: The spirit of the Lord is upon me; wherefore he has annointed me to preach the gospel. Luke 4:16-18.

And our Saviour kept Saturday, the seventh day of the week, during all his life on earth as the Sabbath day, and preached the gospel to the people, and in his divine preaching never spoke of any change of day, but, on the direct contrary, his divine example always was to keep Saturday, the seventh and last day of the week, the Sabbath day.

The divine example of his whole life is for Saturday, the last day of the week, as the Sabbath day. In Matt. 21:12, 13, when he drove the buyers out of the temple where Saturday the Sabbath day was enshrined. In Matt. 23, when he told his disciples to obey the Jewish lawgivers, who made them observe Saturday, the Sabbath day. In Luke 6, where he defended the gathering of corn on the Sabbath day, which he would not have had need to do if Saturday was not the Sabbath and a holy day. In other places in the same chapter we find the same divine example. And in John 7:7-16; 7:10, 14, 22, 23, 37, we find the same divine example.

The Catholic Church, of its own infallible authority, created Sunday a holy day to take the place of the Sabbath of the old law, and as Catholics are bound to obey the commands of the Church equally with the commands given on Sinai, Catholics must observe Sunday. But what in the world do Protestants mean by observing Sunday?
