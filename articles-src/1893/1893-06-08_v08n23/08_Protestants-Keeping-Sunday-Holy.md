Apropos of that which we have repeatedly said upon this question, the *Catholic Standard,* of July 4, 1893. We give the article complete; it is from the Sunday enforcement controversy, in these lines that differ materially from ours.

The agitation for and against "the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday brings the strange—in fact, wild—inconsistency of keeping and endeavoring to keep Sunday holy under a flood of light. It is only the other day that a writer in these columns, some weeks ago, entitled, "The Change of the Sabbath." The position taken in defense of Protestants observing Sunday as a holy day is more than ordinarily ludicrous. In reply to a question put to it by a correspondent as to why Protestants have changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, and as to why they do not keep Saturday the Sabbath day, and not keep it holy, the *Mid-Continent* said:—

The difficulty which our correspondent has upon the authority of the divine command, it seems to us, is expecting to find in the Scriptures any authority for Sunday as a day of rest.

If there be no "particular day" set apart, why does *Mid-Continent* select Saturday, or any other "particular day" to observe?

This is among the most extraordinary statements that have been made upon a question that is in controversy. In defense of Protestantism, and that is saying a good deal on the Protestant side. That book so much abused by Protestants that their inconsistency about controversies ever it have destroyed all the belief in it among the masses in France and Germany.

The Scriptures' spoken of in the above said paragraph are the Old Testament, commanding, under pain of punishment and death, the observance of Saturday, and last day Saturday for "the Sabbath."

And God spake all these words, saying,

The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it. Exodus 20.

God tells them "to remember," a word showing it to be an older institution, what had always been a command from the beginning, and orders them that if the creation of the world for the original sabbath were not sufficient reason for being to "keep holy the Sabbath day," being "the seventh day of the week"—if the time was measured from the beginning by man. This is repeated, twice and again—the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. See Exodus 31:12-18; Levit. 23:1-3; Amos 8:5. God addressed it to Adam at the beginning, because on that day God rested. The Apostles strictly, and commanded that "particular day" to be kept holy be greeted their ever forgetting the day of the week— they were made to set every seventh year apart as the Sabbath year; so as to indelicate is historically and communicate day among the Jews, so that they could not forget that the seventh day of the week, Saturday, was the Sabbath.—See Lev. 25:3; Exm. 16:23. If the editor of the *Mid-Continent* had examined a Bible, this refreshing statement would be excusable. But in the first

to man who claim that all religion is within the leaves of this very Bible of which all the foregoing string of declarations made upon it, is not a proof of it, part of it, a deed of it, therein dependent so forlorn, but that it needs to show that it can and make a case and make its said objection.
