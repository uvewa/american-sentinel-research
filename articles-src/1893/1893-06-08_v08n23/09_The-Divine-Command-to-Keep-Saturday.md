## The Mid-Continent continued —

A divine precept did not lay the foundation of Sunday, or fix it for observance on that particular day. No one, if challenged could have pointed to a law, or rule, or rubric, or anything whatsoever, bearing the semblance of a divine decree.

When the Lord spoke on Mount Sinai, the Bible tells us that he told all mankind that it was the very first of the world's corner, he did give a "divine command" as to which day should be kept "holy," attempting to explain away that the Sabbath is Saturday is like battling with the emanations of God, even in battling with the current and existence of a thing that was—and those sectaries will not find claim, that God has spoken, and the first commandment given, some great Presbyterian will die and possess the Sabbath by giving everyone a copy of the Bible, "and" commanded the people of Mount Sinai, and the other testimonies we have to be observed, and the commandments like chapters in this Bible will contradict him.

## THE DAY THAT ADAM OBSERVED.

If Adam did observe the seventh or the first day, whichever it was, nobody knows the name by which it was known to him. It could not have been Saturday, but on the day commonly called Saturday, the Bible commandment called observing.

As it is not possible that the editor of the *Mid-Continent* never opened a copy of a Bible, he evidently whisker to cover over these pages, that so diametrically contradict his statement. The first two chapters of Genesis thus read:

And God said: let us make man to our image, after our likeness.

So God created man to his own image, in the image of God created he him. Gen. 1:26, 27.

And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his works.

And he blessed the seventh day and sanctified it. Gen. 2:2, 3.

Adam was created on the sixth day, the day before the seventh day. God rested and "sanctified" for him, and he was commanded to "keep by own word" the "Sabbath day," which is as distinct a command to rest the very day of the creation, and other day but the seventh day, Saturday.

This knowledge was carried down unbroken historically through all the Jewish nation's family of Adamites to Moses. Moses kept the seventh day of each of the weeks and kept the seventh day of each of seven years—Sabbatical. So God blessed and hallowed it at the time of Adam; Moses, and the Jews were reminded to remember what they had observed ever since. And too, as far as a command comes, the command imperatable, the "Thou shalts"—beside them, any man who dares both keep Saturday as the Sabbath, and the fourth commandment and obey the Bible to be punished with death.

The Catholic Church advocated "the Sabbath" and made the change of the day from Saturday to Sunday. The Church by long-established custom resting upon no text of Scripture—acting and commanding her children. he wrote he said: "All things are to be lawful to me and so much." Matt. 5: 17-18. "Whatsoever you shall bind upon earth
