THAT the manhood of Henry County, Tenn., is becoming aroused, and juries refuse longer to be the mere puppets of the prosecuting attorney, is evident from the fact that two more Adventists, charged with nuisance by working on Sunday, have just been acquitted there. It is said that Judge Swiggart is opposed to the persecution. Out of twelve indictments found six months ago for Sunday work, the State's attorney has not secured a single conviction, yet he is said to be determined to pursue the matter further, and other indictments have probably been returned by the present grand jury.
