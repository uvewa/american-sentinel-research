THE claim that different police conditions exist on Sunday than on other days, and that the public peace may be disturbed on that day by things that do not disturb on other days, received a serious setback in Chicago, on the 29th ult. In granting the temporary injunction prayed for by one of the stockholders, forbidding the closing of the Fair gates on Sunday, Judge Stein overruled the plea that "to open the Fair would be a violation of the law of the State by disturbing the peace on Sunday," remarking that the petitioner had made no showing that there was a disturbing of the peace, or that the disturbance, if any, was worse on Sunday than on any other day. This principle consistently adhered to by the courts would render null and void every Sunday law in America. It is refreshing to find a judge who can grasp the thought that a mere annoyance of somebody's religious prejudices is not a disturbance of the peace, and is not cognizable by civil courts.
