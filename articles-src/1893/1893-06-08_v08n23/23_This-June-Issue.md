This June issue is a remarkable issue of a review, containing one hundred issues for the same purpose. It is the largest single issue of the paper. We are sending twenty pages of carefully written book reviews of the best books on religious liberty; this, with the original reading matter, makes it a number of more than forty pages. Harlan, Harriet Gerstland, and editor and publishing house should be taken to the best, as our anniversary issue next Saturday, and should be spread broadcast.
