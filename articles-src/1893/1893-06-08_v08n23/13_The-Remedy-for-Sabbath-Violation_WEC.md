In the *Michigan Christian Advocate,* of May 13, is an article entitled, "Sunday Keeping." Rev. Wm. Fawcett, D. D., says in part:—

The Sunday newspaper violates the law of God as a promoter of lawlessness.

It is this statement, that following the Sabbath of the law of God, and that the Rev. Mr. Fawcett's statement that law is violated, would be true. But does the Rev. Mr. approve of the State's making a law to enforce the particular interpretation of God which pertains only to the individual who himself, even if that individual exercises his God given right to choose to disabey that command. It is like the personality Christ put into the hands of the Almighty. How does the Rev. Mr. Fawcett cross the things which are God's?

Has Mr. Fawcett overlooked the teaching of the Master himself and considered this point? As a professed minister of Christ, does he not know that the word of God must be bolstered up by human laws? Is he reflecting on the judgment of God

by implying that his law is inefficient for its purpose designed, and hence must fall back on civil power for support? Does not know there can be no real civil power where there is no freedom of choice? Does he not know that God in his infinite wisdom saw that conspiracy, observation to his observance, to the end for which many governments were established, that God purposely avoided making the performance of his law civil in character, loyalty to him, which the State makes—a worse consequence of the creation of injustice of it? God does not announce punishment for violation of his law simply in order to enforce law, but because it is an arbitrary result; and in other that in his creation also; and let, in might be in the creatures of his image an opportunity for probation.

Mr. Fawcett says truly that the hand is made sick. For the malady—it is its own remedy. If he will read the following from the same article from the issue in which his own article appeared, he may be induced to reflect upon the matter.

Faithfully preaching the gospel is by far the most effective and constitutional remedy. And think into that conscience if you would expect heavy and hard the penalty for its violation, how do you feel; and instead of feeling hard and miserable, would you not be so happy as when he can induce some religious legislation, the minister of the gospel must not turn aside from preaching Christ and him crucified and occupying themselves with the world's moral reform and temperance reform and political reform; if you wish to worry the devil, pay your debts, and be content to live honestly.

This has the right ring to it. If the Church uses simply in the hand let it build Christ in Churches; for there is no value in any other; for there is some other under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12. If the ministers, and others claim to be Christian workers, would devote their time and energies tampering with politics, if they would give themselves entirely to the preaching of the gospel, and vote themselves to the promulgation of this gospel of Jesus Christ, then would come out of it, for there is power in that to remedy all the evil abroad in the land; but there is not anywhere else. For the Church to use any other authority as an enforcing power, is an acknowledgment weakens and the lack of that power which is in the gospel. Then instead of turning to Christ, who is that power, and putting the people who are in error, to see the truth, they turn to the secular and human agency, and only augment the evil of unbelief.

W. E. CORNELL.
