GIVING reasons why the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday, the *Northwestern Christian Advocate* says:

> Then, again, a great many people believe in abiding by the law until it has been adjudged unconstitutional or void by the courts authorized to sit in judgment on it.

Then why do not the Methodists abandon their illegal and unchristian boycott of the Fair? There can be no boycott without conspiracy, and under both State and Federal laws conspiracy is crime. The boycotter is a law-breaker.
