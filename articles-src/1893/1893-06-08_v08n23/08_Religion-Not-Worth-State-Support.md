ANY religion which is not of sufficient value in itself to pay men for professing it, is not worth professing, much less is it worth supporting by the State. In genuine Christianity there is a virtue and a value which make it worth more to him who possesses it than all the world can afford. "What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?"
