References to the World's Fair controversy, the *Mail and Express* remarks that men who ruled against the laws of God are not expected to obey human enactments when interest and inclination point in another direction. This is true; and being so it behooves people to keep an eye on the *Mail and Express,* for it is in open and persistent rebellion against the divine law which says: "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." The issue between the first day of the week, which is the Sunday of the Papacy and the Sabbath of the Lord,—is fully joined, and the *Mail and Express* is on the side of rebellion against the Lord of the Sabbath.
