Any religion which is not of sufficient value in itself to pay men for professing it, is not worth professing, much less is it worth supporting by the State. In general government there is a virtue and a value which makes it a worth more to him to pay money to promote it than all the world can offer. What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
