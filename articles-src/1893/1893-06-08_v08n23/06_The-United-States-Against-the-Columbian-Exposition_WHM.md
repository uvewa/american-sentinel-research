Chicago Correspondence.

Some months ago it was said in the SENTINEL, that the United States courts might, before the year was passed, be compelled to state their position more definitely upon the points raised, and indirectly determined by Justice Brewer's opinion in the decision of the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity of New York vs. the United States, in the United States Supreme Court, decided Feb. 29, 1892. It was said that it might be that this would be brought about through the question of State rights, as to whether Congress has any jurisdiction within the municipality of Chicago by which it may enforce the Sunday-closing proviso attached to the World's Fair appropriation, or lay any penalty for its non-observance. It is possible that the time has already come which was looked forward to in those statements previously made, for suit has been commenced for the Government, looking to the permanent enforcement of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by decree of the United States Court. The action has been brought for the United States by Thos. E. Milchrist, United States District Attorney for the northern district of Illinois, in the United States Circuit Court.

Mr. Milchrist sets forth in his bill that he acts in this behalf by the authority of the United States and brings the bill of complaint against the World's Columbian Exposition, a cooperation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Illinois. After narrating the inception of the plan for the holding of the World's Fair and the determination of Chicago as the site upon which it was to be held, the act of Congress providing for the holding of such an international exhibition in the city of Chicago is cited. The congressional history of the different appropriations made by Congress in behalf of the Fair is then set forth together with the passage of the Sunday-closing proviso attached to the appropriation of the five million souvenir half dollars, and the claim is made that the proviso attached not only to that but to all other appropriations made by Congress in behalf of the Exposition. The action of the Local Directory and of the National Commission, in the acceptance of the appropriation, of souvenir coins, is then referred to and the language of the resolutions passed by each body, respectively, respecting the closing of the Fair on Sunday, as embodied in the rules governing the World's Fair management, and the question of the abiding force of that Sunday-closing regulation treated at length, as follows:—

> Your orators further aver that the said rule, as modified, providing for the closing of the Exposition and the gates thereof on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, is now in force; that, by virtue of the several acts of Congress hereinbefore set out and referred to, and by virtue of the acts of the said commission and the said corporation, neither the said Exposition nor the gates thereof can lawfully be opened upon the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and that neither the said corporation nor the said commission, acting together or severally, have legal power or authority to change or abrogate the said rule last aforesaid, as modified, or to open the said Exposition or the gates thereof on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

> Your orators further aver that after the acceptance of the said appropriations by the said corporation as aforesaid the Secretary of the Treasury delivered to said corporation S.858,240 of said coins.

> Your orators further represent that the said corporation and the officers thereof, and the said defendants, Harlow N. Higinbotham, D. H. Burnham, Col. Edmond Rice, George R. Davis, and Horace Tucker design and intend to open the said Exposition and the gates thereof for the admission of the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, and on each Sunday during the remainder of the period during which the said Exposition is to be held; that in pursuance of such design and intention the Board of Directors of the said corporation, defendants herein, heretofore, to wit: on the 16th day of May, 1893, passed and accepted the following resolution, to wit:

> "The Exposition shall be open for the admission of visitors until the 30th day of October, 1893, on each day of the week, subject, however, to the following regulations for the management and conduct of the Exposition Sunday: On each and every Sunday the operation of the machinery in Machinery Hall shall be suspended as far as practicable. Exhibitors and employes shall be relieved from duty, except so far as their presence is essential and necessary for the protection of property and the public peace, but all employes whose services are required Sunday shall be given one day of rest during each week. Religious services may be held in Choral and Music Halls at such hours as may be designated and named by the Council of Administration, and said council shall have authority to arrange for such services. The fee of admission on all days of the week is hereby fixed at fifty (50) cents for adults and twenty-five (25) cents for children between the ages of 6 and 15 years."

> And your orators further show unto your honors that the said corporation and the officers thereof, and the said other defendants, have given out to the public that the said Exposition and the gates thereof will be open on Sunday, the 28th day of May, A. D. 1893, to the public; and your orators aver that they have good cause to believe, and verily believe, that, unless the said defendants are restrained by the order of this honorable court from opening the said Exposition and the gates thereof to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and each Sunday during the continuance of said Exposition, the said defendants will open the same in accordance with their design and intentions so to do as aforesaid.

## CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY.

> Your orators further aver that the said World's Columbian Exposition, corporation as aforesaid, and the said Harlow N. Higinbotham, D. H. Burnham, Col. Edmond Rice, George R. Davis, and Horace Tucker are conspiring and confederating together, and are assuming to be in possession and control of the said Exposition and grounds, and have usurped and are attempting to usurp an unlawful authority over the same, and assume to have the right to open and control the said gates and said grounds for the admission of the public thereto on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, during the continuance of the said Exposition and that by reason of such unlawful claim and assumption, claim an authority to open said gates and grounds to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, by virtue of the said resolution and rule so passed by the Board of Directors of the said corporation as aforesaid, notwithstanding the fact that the said unlawful assumption and the attempt and purpose as aforesaid to open the said grounds and Exposition on Sunday are in direct contravention of the terms of the said act of Congress, and notwithstanding that the said contemplated acts in opening the said gates as aforesaid are and will be, as your orators aver, of great injury and a grievous prejudice to the common public good and to the welfare of the people of the United States.

> In consideration whereof, and inasmuch as your orators can only have adequate relief in the premises in this honorable court, where matters of this nature are properly cognizable and relievable, your orators pray that this honorable court may order, adjudge, and decree that the said World's Columbian Exposition, Harlow N. Higinbotham, D. H. Burnham, Col. Edmond Rice, George R. Davis, and Horace Tucker, and each and all persons acting for or on their behalf or under their direction, be enjoined and prohibited from further agreeing, conspiring, and acting together or severally to carry out the said last mentioned rule and regulation as adopted by the said corporation as aforesaid, and that all and each of them be enjoined and prohibited from opening the said Exposition and the said grounds and the gates thereof to the public on the 28th day of May, a. D. 1893, which is the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, and on all other Sundays during the continuance of the said Exposition; and that the said defendants, and each of them, and each and all persons acting for or on their behalf, be commanded by the order and mandate of this honorable court to close the said Exposition, grounds and the gates thereof to the public on the said 28th day of May, 1893, and each Sunday thereafter during the continuance of the said Exposition.

> To the end, therefore, that the said defendants may, if they can show why your orators should not have the relief hereby prayed, and may, according to their best and utmost knowledge, remembrance, information, and belief, full, true, direct, and perfect answer make, but not under oath, answer under oath being hereby specially waived, to each and all matters and things in the said bill contained as fully and particularly as if the same were here repeated and they were specially interrogated thereto severally; and that the said defendants and each of them may be required to stand to perform and abide by all further orders and decrees which to your honors shall seem meet; and your orators, as in duty bound, will ever pray, etc.

THOMAS F. MILCHRIST.
United States Attorney and Solicitor for Complainants.

The gist of this bill is the averment on the part of the Government of a conspiracy by the World's Columbian Exposition corporation to contravene an act of Congress and a law of the United States.

This bill was filed on Saturday, the 27th of May and the hearing upon it continued to the following Wednesday. It is understood that the case will be heard by three judges. The two judges of the United States Circuit Court sitting Chief Justice Fuller of the United States Supreme Court in consultation. The decision of the court in this matter will, therefore, under such circumstance partake of the reflected authority of the United States Supreme Court. In the meantime, according to the latest resolution of the Local Directory with which the National Commission failed to disagree, and in obedience to the injunction issuing from Judge Stein's Court forbidding the World's Fair authorities from closing the public park in which the Exposition is situated to the people on Sundays, the Exposition will be open every Sunday, at least until an adverse decision is had in this case in the United States Court. Corporation Counsel, Edwin Walker, who is attorney for the World's Fair, has given notice that he will need certainly two weeks for the preparation of his side of the case and consequently there will be at least two more Sundays in which the World's Fair, both the grounds and the buildings, will be open to the public, except so far as individual exhibitors and States see fit to close their buildings and cover their exhibits.
