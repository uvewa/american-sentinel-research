From these articles we are watching with deep interest the movements in the Australian colonies toward the dangerous union of the Church and the State, and the use of the civil power to enable the Church to get control of civil power. Attention should be called to the fact that this movement in any of the countries is not confined to America. The tendency in the State was early recognized in forming the constitutions of the colonies, and in later legislation these constitutions have granted to the people—constitutions of religious liberty. It is some of these things have gone beyond toleration and have recognized the people's rights, but as settlements at one time to please all, but lately certain state of things or attainment that the governments are too-secular; that they do not attend as much to the religions interests of the community.

This feeling is manifested chiefly by the desire of certain parties to get the legal promotion of religion by the State. A number of the evangelical denominations have recently formed an organization known as the "Lord's Day Observance Society." The Church. The object of this organization is to use civil or legislative organization and co-operation on matters affecting religion and morality and the interests of the community. It will be the duty of this movement to watch the legislation of Parliament; to study every bill to be presented, and when the clergy and those interested are decided what is best for the people, they are to oppose or support these bills. Naturally they also desire to get the civil power to seek and secure the defeat of I possible the in certain direction. In fact, the great power which is in the gospel. Then instead of turning to Christ, who is that power, and putting the people who are in error, to see the truth, they turn to the secular and human agency, and only augment the evil of unbelief.

They try to annihilate error to to let the truth, which he did not to destroy—to simply take in the humble castle and let the sunshine, which darkness is averse to overcome itself.

Another organization known as "The Scriptural Education League." The aim of these interests are two or more organizations known as "The Lord's Day Observance" and the Scriptural Education League." The aim of the Lord's Day Observance Society is to get the civil power to compel a better observance of what it is pleased to consider the sabbath, namely, the first day of the week. The course this society has taken is to secure a more rigid and severe penalties of the law upon those who perform ordinary labor on Sunday. It

will be understood by the reader that in this country these religious organizations are not compelled to lose any time encouraging candidates of laws to enforce religious dogma. They find everything ready to hand. Church and State are blended although some acts of liberty or toleration have been passed by Parliament within quite recent years. They are the constitution offers otherwise.

The Scriptural Education League has recently been organized for the purpose of securing religious instruction in the public schools. Some years ago the State of Victoria passed an Education act excluding the Bible and all religious instruction from the State-supported public schools. The churches have not taken this kindly as a verdict against it as a Christian land, and it must be undone. Hence the Scriptural Education League.

Other colonies followed Victoria in excluding the Bible from the State schools; but the churches in other colonies have not been long the Victorian Church at the for formation of special societies to secure an end of that condition of affairs.

Looking over our Australian exchanges, on the face of them we find that a contest is waged between the two factions over the Bible-in-the-public-schools question. On the other hand we also notice the colony giving lectures, organizing, circulating petitions, pledges, etc. To have religious instruction in the government schools. As they consider the Bible the standard for instruction in the government schools, the people of the colony will have some form of it, and every candidate must pledge himself to the Bible in schools—to introduce the Bible into the schools or to opposed all efforts to displace or weaken it, in this the editors and members of Parliament themselves are more enlisted therein.

We, we plainly that the issue is right upon us, and that it is the duty of every citizen to support the claim of the children to deprive the classical education of what should be their birthright. Suffrage and to preserve, it. In the Australian colony, one of the following statement written of the force: *Melbourne, Australia.*

Now, just now, is one time to work to have this great evil crushed, this colony as well as every colony, shall unite with the Papacy in forcing the Bible into the public schools, or else we will give them up and let them go their own way as the heathen. If this is not done, the prospects are that its children will ere long be gone, and everything they held dear be taken from them. Let me hear from you on these measures at length and I will sympathize with those who fear the Lord and his enemies.—*From an Australian Christian employee says:* "Work at one work: it is one thing if you use the Bible and another thing if you worship with it. . . In the name of God, my friends, as you hope to be saved, rise up, sign this pledge, and do everything in the power given you in this great and glorious cause."

It is significant also that this matter, so exactly in harmony, in Australia, was not directly or indirectly the Fulk say what it reads the First-day Sabbath that the Fair be opened grounds the first-Sunday that the Fair was open. The Australians also write upon this matter.

*Sydney, Australia.*
