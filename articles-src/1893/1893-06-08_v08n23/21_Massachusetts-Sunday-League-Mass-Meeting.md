A GENERAL mass meeting of the Massachusetts Sunday Protective league was held on Sunday evening, the 21st ult., in Boston, to organize another and more formal protest against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday.

A telegram was sent to the President, concluding in these significant words: "We suggest proclamation that opening will not be allowed except on mandate of Federal Court."

After the telegram had been adopted Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, secretary of the league, went to the table where the reporters sat, hard at work on Sunday, and distributed typewritten copies of the telegram, saying as he did so, that he hoped they would give the meeting all the space they could in Monday's papers. One reporter suggested that the story would have to be written on Sunday, but Rev. Mr. Crafts replied that he wanted the readers of the papers to know all about the meeting.

Just so! It makes all the difference in the world, it seems, who works on Sunday and who they work for; if it is for Mr. Crafts and his Sunday-closing scheme, it is all right; otherwise, it is all wrong.
