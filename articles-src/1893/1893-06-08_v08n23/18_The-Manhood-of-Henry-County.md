The manhood of Henry County, Tenn., is becoming more, and this refusal to longer be the mere puppet of the prosecuting attorney, is evident from the fact that two more Adventists, charged with misuse by working on Sunday, have just been acquitted there.

It is said that Judge Swiggart is opposed to the persecution. Out of twelve indictments found six months ago for Sunday work, this is the third Adventist jury has secured a single conviction, yet he is said to be determined to pursue the matter further, and other indictments have probably been returned by the present grand jury.
