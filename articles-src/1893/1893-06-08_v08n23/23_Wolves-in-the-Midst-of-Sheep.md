WHEN the Author of Christianity sent forth his disciples to proclaim the truths of his kingdom, he said, "Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves." But if we can make ourselves believe that certain persons, now living, are his servants, we must conclude that this statement has been reversed, for they now act more like wolves in the midst of sheep. The "Rev." H. H. George, Sunday-law champion, said last fall at Paterson, N. J., that the clause in the World's Fair Appropriation Bill, closing the Exhibition on Sunday, "can not be repealed. . . . We mean to maintain it at the point of the bayonet." And now, that the time has come that the Fair has been opened on Sunday, in spite of governmental interference, the following from the "hub" of this "Christian Nation" is in exact accord with this wolfish spirit:—

BOSTON, May 19.—At a full meeting of the First United Presbyterian Church last night the pastor was authorized to send the following telegram to President Cleveland:—

"The First United Presbyterian Church of Boston, distrusting both directory and commissioners, appeals to you to suppress Chicago nullification with Jacksonian firmness and to guard the gates next Sabbath with the troops if necessary."

How far are such men from the Jesuitical idea that "the end justifies the means"?
