From this country we are watching with deep interest the movements in the United States in the formation of the union of the Church and the State, and we are amazed at the frantic efforts of the Church to get control of civil power. But we are forcibly reminded that that spirit is not confined to America. The same movements are on foot in Australia. In forming the constitutions of the colonies, and in later legislation these governments have granted to the people considerable religious liberty. In some things they have gone beyond toleration and have recognized the people's rights. These acts seemed at one time to please all, but lately a certain class of religionists feel that the governments are too secular; that they do not attend as much to the religious needs of the citizens as they should.

This feeling is manifested chiefly by the organization of various societies for the promotion of religion by the State. In the Colony of Victoria the principal denominations have recently formed an organization called, "The Council of Churches." The object of this organization is to "afford an opportunity for consultation and co-operation on matters affecting the religious, moral and social interests of the community." It will be the duty of this counsel to watch the legislation of Parliament; to study every bill to be presented, and when the clergy decide that a bill is not what they think is best for the people, they are to oppose it personally and through their churches, and secure its defeat if possible. On the other hand they are to do all in their power to secure the passage of such measures as they think are proper. This organization can easily make itself felt by working through the great mass of voters who are connected with the churches.

Associated with the "Council of Churches" organization, and working under its supervision are two other organizations known as "the Lord's Day Observance Society" and the "National Scripture Education League." The mission of the Lord's Day Observance Society, as its name indicates, is to secure a better observance of what it is pleased to call the Lord's day, namely the first day of the week. The course this society has so far adopted has been to inflict the severe penalties of the law upon those who perform ordinary labor on Sunday. It will be understood by the reader that in this country these religious organizations are not compelled to lose any time securing the enactment of laws to enforce religious dogmas. They find everything ready to hand. Church and State are united although some acts of liberty or toleration have been passed by Parliament. But these go for nothing when the constitution orders otherwise.

The National Scripture Education League has recently been organized for the purpose of securing scriptural instruction in the public schools. Some years ago the Victorian Government passed an Education act excluding the Bible and all religious instruction from the State or public schools. The churches have decided that this was a very wicked piece of legislation and that it must be undone. Hence the Scripture Education League.

Other colonies followed Victoria in excluding the Bible from the schools, and the churches in other colonies have followed the Victorian churches in the formation of special societies to secure religious legislation. In South Australia there is at present a religio-political war over the Bible-in-the-public-schools question. The Leaguers have traveled over the colony giving lectures, organizing, and securing petitions for scriptural instruction in the government schools. The general elections are to be held in a short time, and every candidate must pledge himself to work for the introduction of the Bible into the schools or be opposed by the great mass of religionists. Some of the editors and members of Parliament are vigorously defending the present system. We see plainly that the issue is right upon us, and that the churches are certain to deprive the citizens of Australia of what religious liberty the governments have seen fit to grant them. We feel the force of the following statement written some months since:—

> Now, just now, is our time to work in foreign countries. As America, the land of religious liberty, shall unite with the Papacy in forcing the consciences of men to honor the false Sabbath, the people of every country on the globe will be led to follow her example.

The dark clouds are rising around us and our liberties will ere long be gone. But we take refuge in God who says, "I, even I, am He that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass?"
