In the *Michigan Christian Advocate*, of May 13, in an article entitled, "Sunday Papers," Rev. Wm. Fawcett, D.D., of Chicago, says:

> The Sunday newspaper violates the law of God and the law of the State, and to the extent of its influence is a promoter of lawlessness.

Granting that Sunday were the Sabbath of the law of God, and that the State had a law enforcing its observance, Mr. Fawcett's statement that law is violated, would be true. But does Mr. Fawcett approve of the State's making a law to enforce the observance of a command of God which pertains only to the individual and his God, even if that individual exercises his God-given right to choose to disobey that command? Is this the remedy which Christ put into the hands of his Church? Did he say, "Render to Caesar the things which are God's"?

Has Mr. Fawcett overlooked the teachings of Christ in the New Testament on this point? As a professed minister of the gospel does he think the commands of God must be holstered up by human laws? Is he reflecting on the judgment of God by implying that his law is inefficient for the purpose designed, and hence must fall back on civil power for support? Does he not know there can be no real obedience where there is no freedom of choice? Does he not know that God in his infinite wisdom saw that compulsory observance was no observance, to the end for which observance is desired? Does he not see that God purposely avoided making the very kind of a law in reference to man's loyalty to him, which the State makes—a compulsory law—because of the injustice of it? That God does not announce punishment for violation of his law simply in order to enforce his law, but because it is a necessary consequence of sin, and not an arbitrary result; and in order that in his infinite love and mercy, he might give the creatures of his image an opportunity to avoid the direful consequences?

Mr. Fawcett says truly that the land is full of Sabbath violation, but he fails to discern and point out the only effectual remedy. If he will read the following from another column of the same paper in which his own article appeared, he may possibly discover what the true remedy is:

> Faithfully preaching the gospel is by far the most successful way to combat error. Get the truth into the conscience if you would expel heresy from the head. Satan goes walking around among the churches with a chip on his shoulder, and is never so happy as when he can induce some overzealous, inexperienced or pugnacious theologian to turn aside from preaching Christ and him crucified, and devote his attention to knocking the chip off his Satanic Majesty's shoulder. Brethren in the ministry, if you wish to worry the devil, pay no attention to that chip, but instead, go right on faithfully preaching the Word.

This has the right ring to it. If the Church sees iniquity in the land let it preach Christ; for "neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Acts 4:12. If the ministers, and others zealous for religious laws, would stop spending their time and energies tampering with the chip on the devil's shoulder, and devote themselves to the promulgation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, good would come out of it, for there is power in that gospel to remedy the evil abroad in the land; but there is not anywhere else. For the Church to use any other means than this, especially to use civil authority as an enforcing power, is to acknowledge its own weakness and the lack of that power which is in the gospel. Then instead of turning to Christ, who is that power, and pointing the people who are in error, to him, they prefer to entrust the matter to human agency, and only augment the evil already begun.

The way to annihilate error is to let the truth shine. We do not enter a dark room with a body of men and attempt to carry the darkness out by force, but we simply take in the humble candle and let the light shine, and darkness is nowhere present. W. E. HOWELL.
