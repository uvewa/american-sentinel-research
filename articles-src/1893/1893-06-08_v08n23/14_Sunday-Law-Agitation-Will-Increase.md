OF the Sunday opening of the World's Fair the *Silver Creek, Neb., Times* says:

> We trust the agitation will not end here. Let it go on until the American people are so aroused that they will wipe from the statute books every Sunday law from Maine to California. Let these people be given to understand that while they are free to preach and pray, an appeal to the civil power by way of supplementing their legitimate religious work, will not be tolerated.

The agitation will not end here; it will increase more and more. But it will not result as the *Times* wishes; on the contrary it will result as foretold by Hon. Richard M. Johnson, in 1829, namely, future measures of the Government will be still more strongly marked by the same influence; other laws of like character will be demanded and passed, and a religious hierarchy will see to it that they are enforced. The Sunday-closing law did not fail because of the protest of the people, or because of any just appreciation of the real principle involved, but because of the financial necessity for an open Fair. Few even now discern the real issue involved.
