Other arrests are threatened. As usual only Adventists are disturbed, though the law is openly violated on Sunday. It was rather a compliment incited recently by a Sunday keeper, in these words: "We would not bother your Sunday work so much if you did not keep Saturday." The Adventists' real offense is keeping *another* day.
