MAY 29, a special committee reported at the Methodist ministers' meeting at 150 Fifth Avenue, this city, in favor of resolutions requesting all members of the Methodist Church to stay away from Chicago during the Fair. It had been expected that such resolutions would be adopted, but three ministers in turn spoke in opposition until 12.30 o'clock, when the meeting ended according to rule.

A Methodist ministers' meeting in Boston the same day adopted this:

> Resolved, First, that we respectfully request all our societies and agents to promptly withdraw their exhibits from the Fair; second, that we request all our people to keep away from the Fair. The Church of God must have no connection with dishonesty, anarchy, and godlessness.

The same day at the noon service for business men in the Broomfield Street Church the Rev. Mr. Dunnett, the Canadian evangelist arraigned the Methodists for their aggressive attitude on the World's Fair Sunday opening. He said:

> I have been informed of the withdrawal by the great body of Methodists of their patronage of the World's Fair because of the opening of its gates on Sunday. Yet the morning papers tell of 200,000 who passed through the gateway, and not a single one was compelled to go, but went voluntarily. I want to ask the churches of Boston why they do not get excited and arise in their strength and withdraw their patronage from the street car companies and the railroads, who cause thousands of men to work on the Sabbath who are hungering for the bread of life and can not get time to attend a church for the pressing daily needs of little ones, I am waiting for a resolution for the closing of the theatres and rum holes.

> It is a popular thing now to attack the World's Fair, but it would be unpopular to stop the street cars that on a Sunday carry Christians to their churches and to the beaches.

> As I look over this audience, I see some faces that are vexed, but you can hurl all the resolutions you will and I will sympathise with the man who has to work on Sunday, and whose perchance Christian employer says, "Work or leave."

> I tell you there is enough work for you right here in your own city, and to let Chicago alone. In the name of God, my friends, as you hope to stand before the great tribunal of God, quit this sham. It is a farce. The world knows it and laughs at you.

It is significant also that Bishop Samuel Fallows, it was said, was present and took part in the religious services in the grounds the first Sunday that the Fair was open. It is evident that the "Christian boycott" is not unanimous.
