As shown in an article in these columns last week, the first beast of the thirteenth chapter of Revelation is the Papacy,—a church seeking to civil rulers for power and support instead of looking to her Lord for the divine power which he promises to all who put their trust alone in him. An image to the beast must be a like union of Church and State. And as we discovered last week, that this country matches the specifications of the prophecy as to the time and manner of its rise, so we shall discover that here the Church has ceased to lean upon her Lord and has turned to the State for power to compass her ends and maintain her waning influence.

The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that:—

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

This order of things was generally accepted as satisfactory until in February, 1863, when an organization was formed at Xenia, Ohio, for the purpose of securing a religious amendment to the Political Constitution. In 1864 this organization was merged into or became what has since been known as the National Reform Association, the avowed purpose of which has from the beginning been—

To secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the Nation's allegiance to Jesus Christ, and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and so indicate that this is a Christian Nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages, of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.—*Art. 2, National Reform Constitution.*

In forecasting the practical workings of the Government under the proposed National Reform Amendment, one who was a directory secretary of the association, said in the *Christian Statesman* of Jan. 13, 1887:—

Our remedy for all these malific influences is to have the Government simply set up the moral law and recognize God's authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it.

In 1889, Mr. Gault published the following in the same paper:—

We propose to so *enforce* upon the people the neglected duties of the first four commandments, and to put all Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis.

May 29, 1889, Rev. W. P. Gray, secretary of the Missouri Branch of the National Reform Association, said:—

It is not, as some believe that as a political maxim, governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and I question whether Mr. Gault in this, I think. And the subject of this association is an effort to change the fundamental law: *Christian Statesman, July 4, '89.*

Scores of similar quotations might be given to show that the purpose of the National Reform Association is actually to have the Government enforce Christianity in every way that they are prepared to compass of religion and the State," but which would be in its effect and real purposes a union of Church and State.

Not much, however, seemed to be accomplished along National Reform lines until the American Sabbath Union in 1888 united the various elements that are interested in religious transactions in civil affairs. Then the influence of the various religious bodies being directed toward the accomplishment of a single object, namely, governmental recognition of Christianity, the civil power began to bend under it, and the result was the passage by Congress—following the initiative of the American Sabbath Union said: "We have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands."

For years the National Reform Association had been disseminating its ideas, indirectly by circulating among judges and other State and Federal officials, official and other publications setting forth what they are pleased to term "the principles of Christian civil government." The first fruit to this attract public attention was the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, delivered Feb. 29, 1892, in the case of the *Holy Trinity Church vs. the United States,* which declared that "this is a Christian Nation, and reading almost like a chapter from a National Reform manual."

This decision ignored the spirit and intent of the First Amendment to the Constitution, and directly contradicted that part of the fundamental law of the land [Art. VI Constitution] supposed to deal with religion in 1793, which declares that—

no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States,

was never, founded on the Christian religion—

In the act the United States Supreme Court asserted the prerogatives which belonged only to the people, and virtually made law, a supreme act, instead of interpreting law in harmony with the supremacy of the law, which by its oath it is sworn to do.

## WHAT NATIONAL REFORMERS PROPOSE.

In the *Christian Statesman* of June 23, 1892, one of the secretaries of the National Reform Association, wrote of this document that reads as if newly gathered from the mint of National Reform coinage.

But this is not the time to remember that the United States Supreme Court has decided that this is a Christian Nation.

The *Pearl of Days,* the official organ of the American Sabbath Union, May 14, 1892, says that this decision:—

Furnishes the exact fact pertinent to the pending issue, *i.e.*, whether the American Nation is Christian. This decision is vital to the Sunday cause. Not to open the Exposition with divine service is to read from the Book of law I need to the American Nation.

The most important issues now before the National Reform Association, outside of the immediate question of the World's Fair, is whether or not religion is imbedded in the organic structure of the American Government—that the American Nation is and is bound to maintain, Sunday as a day for rest and worship.

In the issue of May 31, 1893, the *Christian Statesman* says:—

"Christianity is the law of the land." "This is not only the rightful thing; it is the actual thing.... Christianity has rights in this country. Among those rights are the right that its institutions be maintained. It shall be deemed to be worthy of the Lord of heaven and earth.

This shows that National Reformism and the Churches' politicians' position in this decision is a foundation for all they have ever asked in the way of religious legislation; and that all they have desired would be implied in the "comprehensive" interpretation of that which was brought into existence and established. They at once began immediately to take place.

But an event still more important had been before Congress but not one had yet spoken in the House—their whole energy was marshalled. All doubt of Congressional appropriation for the Fair seemed to be removed, and a demand was made that a condition be annexed closing the gates of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday.

May 10, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Durborow, of Illinois, precipitated the discussion of the Sunday-closing question by submitting an amendment to its clause of the sundry civil bill, then before the House for the World's Fair $5,000,000 appropriation and making funds for the Government exhibit, appropriated shall be available unless the doors of the Columbian Exposition are closed on Sunday.

After two days of the most boisterous and exciting scenes witnessed in Congress, session of Congress, another provision was substituted for this and passed the House, May 23, as follows:

*Provided,* That the Government exhibitors at the World's Columbian Exposition shall not be opened to the public on Sunday.

This was carried by a vote of 141 to 93. In this the House of Representatives joined with the Senate, itself, to an acknowledgment of religious legislation, and by a vote of

## THE SENATE CONDITIONED THE ENTIRE QUESTION.

When the Senate, as amendment to the sundry civil bill, appropriating five millions to the Fair, was offered by Mr. Quay, of Pennsylvania, to provide for Sunday closing, the provision in language and manner worthy of the Inquisition, was practically the initial step in the general enforcement of religion by the Government of the United States, in pursuance of the decision of the Supreme Court that this is a religious, a Christian Nation.

The *Congressional Record* of July 10, 1892, page 6614, reads thus:—

Mr. QUAY.—I now move to amend by making it a proviso. I want to move:

*Provided,* That no payment has been made by the United States to or on account of the World's Columbian Exposition.

The Sabbath—the amendment I will send to the desk is to put upon the appropriation that no money be read from the Book of law I need to the American Nation.

The VICE PRESIDENT.—The particular will be stated.

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

The discussion which followed upon this amendment deserves to well in match among the debates in the great religious councils of the fourth century. It was even more significant than they. Its reach is fraught with even greater peril, as it marks the culminations of older combinations, and more recent, and also because, that, amid the greater opportunities to know and do the right, the wrong was deliberately chosen. The debate was opened by Senator Manderson, of Nebraska. In his speech (*Congressional Record,* July 10, pages 6693, 6703, 4701) appears the following:—

"I know what the desire of these petitioners is. It is that the Exposition shall be closed on the Sabbath day, and I have always understood that the Pennsylvania desire that the Exposition shall be closed not upon what they recognize as the Sabbath day, which is Saturday, but upon Sunday.

The word "sabbath day" means that it shall be the seventh day of the week, and it would be subject to the direction of those who sign these petitions that the Exposition should close the Exposition on the last day of the week—the old Jewish seventh day—rather than upon the first day of the week; so the Exposition should also close in on the first day of the week. I do not think the amendment as offered should be adopted by the senator from Pennsylvania.

I submit, Mr. President, a substitute, which I hope may be accepted by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.

And what was the substitute—so much the 'mechanical portion of the Exposition on the first day of the week.

Mr. GRAY.—I will accept the modification as far as I understand the phraseology of the amendment.

Mr. HAWLEY.—Let the amendment of the senator be as far as it may so read—

The VICE PRESIDENT.—The amendment will be stated again.

The VICE PRESIDENT.—It will be again reported. Is the request that the amendment be read?

Mr. QUAY.—I do not understand the desire of the amendment of the committee by inserting—

*And that provision be made by the appropriate committee on the first day of the week commonly called Sun-*

A final amendment to Mr. Quay's motion was proposed by Mr. Hiscock, and voted on as follows; the following, which was accepted, was:—

And it is hereby declared that all appropriations herein made for or pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition, are made under the condition that the said Exposition shall not be opened to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and if the said appropriation be accepted by the president of the corporation under its charter and the laws of the State under which it is incorporated, the said corporation shall thereupon be, and it is hereby bound to said condition, it shall be, and is hereby made, by reason of such unlawful claim; and as such grounds for the admission of the public thereto on behalf of said corporation is aforesaid; and upon the Director of the said corporation, or the grounds and the gates thereto to the public on the first day of the week commonly called Sunday, means the Exposition on the last day of the Exposition on the said first day of the week.

## THIS IS REALLY A BILL.

This is the first finished enactment of religion by the Congress of the United States; said by the House on July 19th; and ratified by the President, signed by him with the United States on August 5, and thus became law.

This is the first finished enactment of religious legislation by the Congress of the United States in the history of the Government.

## THE ENACTMENT RELIGIOUS LEGISLATION.

The enactment of religious legislation, speaking of Sabbath laws, Mr. Crafts says:—

At first thought they would seem to be wholly religious—

True enough, and so they are; first impressions are usually right. So what does legislation in the part of Congress become? It was the closing of the Fair on Sunday, Sunday, religious legislation. Men who advocate Sunday laws and ordinances—and then classes them as religious. Referring to July 29, 1892, the chaplain of the Senate said:—

The Senate debate first was might have ended in something else than the religious legislation that the whole country demanded—

Everybody knows what the foundation is. It is the Fourth Commandment. Read it:—

And the Senate Puffed with it!—

To day we are engaged in a theological discussion relating to laws to control the action of men in the matter of Sabbath observance.—*Congressional Record.*

Citing his speech Senator Colquitt, a National Reformer, thus betrayed a consciousness of the character of the legislation, and such speeches as he and others made upon that subject, by saying in his civil government.

That of course confirms that no further, Mr. President, for it may to some sound the more fact, since everybody knows that they are the commandments, that the religious are presumed to be better than other men.—*Congressional Record.*

## UNDER RELIGIOUS PREMISE.

The measure was introduced in Congress without the use of political and legislative measures on the part of the so-called "Protestant" or evangelical churches. To many of their politicians asking for this legislation was attached the following:—

*Resolved,* That we do hereby pledge ourselves to do all in our power, by voice, vote, and position of trust, any member of Congress either senator or representative, who shall vote further or aid any to kind to the World's Fair every day of every week including Sundays should be closed on Sunday.

Many churches by vote declared that they would stay away from the Fair if it were not closed on Sunday. Many citizens who had freely contributed so as to declare their intention to do what they had agreed to; that if the directors held their exhibit at the Fair were not allowed to be used.

And those blessed by Congress of these cutting methods to compeer their ride. And those through a load of woe said and courage were not without their weight upon them. Senator Hawley said through for position than principle.

In the Senate, Senators Hawley, of Connecticut, and Hiscock, of New York, were the strongest opponents of the measures. Senator Hiscock said:—

If I had charge of this amendment in the interest of the gentleman from the State in which I live, and had seen an argument against this proposition for the closer in any form that the representatives of this Church have been sending to your address here broadcasting or publishing about it. *Congressional Record, July 12.*

Senator Hawley said:—

If the Senate to-day decides that it will pass for this appropriation on the condition that these gates are closed on Sunday, and shall offended more than 40,000,000, people—certainly more than half of the adults of the United States, or of monarch of modern times; or eating of horse, are found to be closing their gates to the people of this country, it would be a serious and fatal error, no matter if it thought it a profound error. If it puts 50,000,000 of people out of the range of the gentlemen republish this, if they desire to reject this and if you say that these gates are to be closed on Sunday and not to be open—it seems to me to be distinctive put in white and black and proposed by the Senate of the United States in effect to legislate from the foundation of the country, through every administration, for every purpose to the American people. I Yield it if you dare; advocate it if you choose. Shall it go forth to the whole civilized world? *July 12, 1891, page 6000, and July 13.*

It was the same way in the House. A dispatch from Washington to the *Chicago Daily Post,* April 5, 1892, gave the following in an interview with a member of the House committee on the World's Fair:—

Yes, a free, that unless we do so, the Church people will get back at us with a vengeance —and you know we all want to come back, you know. They can do us more good, or more harm, than all others put together.

Yes, and the Senate too. We are all in the same boat. Our only safety is in getting them what they want, whatever it is; getting enough of it, that is all there is about it.

## CHURCHES PEAL FROM THEIR TOWERS.

Ministers and congressmen thus yielding, those churches knew the State had become the servant of the Church. Rev. J. B. Rash, of the Seventh United Presbyterian Church, Pittsburg, Pa., is a champion of their cause and

That the Church has weight with great political government, as has been clearly demonstrated effectively in the late World's Fair matter, when by what appeared to all to be a mere religious wish, the World's Fair $5,000,000 appropriation bill with the Church instituted position, that the gates of

the great Exposition should not be opened upon Sunday. This graceful and fine support to the great Exhibition on Sunday morning may often equally manifest character. The Church has thus far carried the day. Let the church keep the battle of more days on the part.

Rev. H. H. George, D. D., said in a speech in Paterson, N. J., August 2, 1892:—

I have learned that . . . we hold the United States Senate.

And in a meeting held in Lansing, Mich., the Sunday question was again and again said in—

We hold Congress in our hands, and wield it as we may.

And the *Christian Statesman* of Oct. 1, 1892, thus joyfully exclaimed:—

The Fair editors on the business houses of the land, the salary majority where they assert themselves as masters in a way that will claim the churches.

The Sabbath closing victory with which the quarter closed is the great achievement—a more epoch-making event . . . Far the great Christian victory for the establishment of the Sabbath—*Christian Statesman.* The great victory won largely by the signatures from all parts of letters with reference to the World's Fair. This, in its way is the proper answer to the question.

Thus Church control over the Government, over which these men here boast, makes it a union of Church and State.

## CHURCH AND STATE ARE JOINED IN THE

National Reformers have themselves admitted that this sort of Church domination is a union of Church and State. Note the following words of Rev. J. M. Foster:—

A union of Church and State exists where the Church controls the State by the influence of a Jewish theory, or where the State annexes to its authority the Church.

The union of Church and State now in this country, in the light of Rev. Mr. Kimball's kind,—a veritable image to the beast.
