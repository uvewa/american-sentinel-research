As shown in an article in these columns last week, the first beast of the thirteenth chapter of Revelation is the Papacy,—a church seeking to civil rulers for power and support instead of looking to her Lord for the divine power which he promises to all who put their trust alone in him. An image to the beast must be a like union of Church and State. And as we discovered last week, that this country meets the specifications of the prophecy as to the time and manner of its rise, so we shall discover that here the Church has ceased to lean upon her Lord and has turned to the State for power to compass her ends and maintain her waning moral influence.

The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

This order of things was generally accepted as satisfactory until in February, 1863, when an organization was formed at Xenia, Ohio, for the purpose of securing a religious amendment to the Federal Constitution. In 1864 this organization was merged into or became what has since been known as the National Reform Association, the avowed purpose of which has from the beginning been—

> To secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the Nation's allegiance to Jesus Christ, and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and so indicate that this is a Christian Nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land. Art. 2, National Reform Constitution.

In forecasting the practical workings of the Government under the proposed National Reform regime, Rev. M. A. Gault, a district secretary of the association, said in the *Christian Statesman* of Jan. 13, 1887:

> Our remedy for all these malific influences is to have the Government simply set up the moral law, and recognize God's authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it.

In 1888, Mr. Gault published the following in the same paper:

> We need to correct our unfortunate attitude under the First Amendment, which restrains Congress from prohibiting the free exercise of any false religion.

May 22, 1889, Rev. W. P. Gray, secretary of the Missouri Sabbath Union, defined the movement thus:

> I, for one, do not believe that as a political maxim, governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. And I believe with Mr. Gault on this, I think. And so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law. *Christian Statesman*, July 4, 1889.

Scores of similar quotations might be given showing that the purpose of the National Reform Association is and always has been to bring about in this country what they are pleased to term "a union of religion and the State," but which would be to all intents and purposes a union of Church and State.

Not much, however, seemed to be accomplished along National Reform lines until the organization of the American Sabbath Union in 1888 united the various elements favorable to ecclesiastical dictation in civil affairs. Then the influence of the various religious bodies being directed toward the accomplishment of a single object, namely, governmental recognition of Christianity, the civil power began to bend under it, and the result was that in less than five years a representative of the American Sabbath Union said: "We have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands."

For years the National Reform Association had been disseminating its doctrines by circulating among judges and other State and Federal officials, papers and other publications setting forth what they are pleased to term "the principles of Christian Civil government." The first fruit of this to attract public attention was the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, delivered by Justice Brewer, Feb. 29, 1892, that this is a Christian Nation, and reading almost like a chapter from a National Reform manual.

"This decision ignored the spirit and intent of the First Amendment to the Constitution, and directly contradicted that part of the "fundamental law of the land" (Art. VI of Constitution) expressed in the treaty with Tripoli in 1797, which declares that:—

> The Government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.—American State Papers, page 54.

In this act the United States Supreme Court assumed the prerogative which belonged only to the people, and virtually made law, supreme law, instead of interpreting law in harmony with the supreme law of the land, which by oath they were sworn to do.

## WHAT NATIONAL REFORMERS THINK OF IT.

In the *Christian Statesman* of June 25, 1892, one of the secretaries of the National Reform Association said:—

> Is not this the time to remember that the United States Supreme Court has officially declared [in a document that reads as if largely gathered from the National Reform Manual] that this is a Christian Nation?

The *Pearl of Days*, the official organ of the American Sabbath Union, May 7, 1892, says that this decision—

> Establishes clearly the fact that our Government is Christian. This decision is vital to the Sunday question in all its aspects, and places that question among the most important issues now before the American people. And this important decision rests upon the fundamental principle that religion is imbedded in the organic structure of the American Government—a religion that recognizes, and is bound to maintain, Sunday as a day for rest and worship.

In its issue of May 21, 1892, the *Christian Statesman* said:—

> "Christianity is the law of the land." "This is a Christian Nation."—United States Supreme Court, Feb. 29, 1892. The Christian Church, therefore, has rights in this country. Among those is the right to one day in seven protected from the assaults of greed, the god of this world, that it may be devoted to worship of the God of heaven and earth.

This shows that these National Reformers and "Christian" politicians recognize in this decision a foundation for all they have ever asked in the way of religious legislation; and that all they have desired would be fulfilled in the "development" of that which was here brought into existence and established. They at once seized upon this, and the development began immediately to take place.

Prior to this time several Sunday bills had been before Congress but not one had become a law. Now, however, a new energy was manifested. All doubt of the constitutionality of such legislation seemed to be removed, and a demand was made upon Congress for some legislation closing the gates of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday.

May 25, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Johnstone, of South Carolina, precipitated the discussion of the Sunday-closing question, by offering an amendment to the clause of the sundry civil bill, then under consideration, appropriating funds for the Government exhibit, as follows:—

> Provided, That no part of the amount hereby appropriated shall be available unless the doors of the Exposition shall be closed on Sunday.

After two days of the most boisterous and exciting scenes witnessed during this session of Congress, another provision was substituted for this and passed the House, May 26, as follows:—

> Provided, That the Government exhibits at the World's Columbian Exposition shall not be opened to the public on Sundays.

This was carried by a vote of 131 to 36. In this the House of Representatives committed itself, to an acknowledged act of religious legislation, and by a vote of almost four to one.

## THE SENATE CONDITIONED THE ENTIRE APPROPRIATION ON SUNDAY CLOSING.

When, in the Senate, an amendment to the sundry civil bill, appropriating five million dollars for the World's Fair, was offered, Mr. Quay, of Pennsylvania, moved to insert a Sunday-closing provision in language and manner worthy of note, and to be remembered as the real initial step in the general enforcement of religion by the Government of the United States, in pursuance of the decision of the Supreme Court that this is a religious and Christian Nation.

The *Congressional Record* of July 10, 1892, page 6614, reads thus:—

MR. QUAY.—On page 122, line 13, after the word "act," I move to insert:—

"And that provision has been made by the proper authority for the closing of the Exposition on the Sabbath day."

The reasons for the amendment I will send to the desk to be read. The secretary will have the kindness to read from the Book of law I send to the desk, the part enclosed in brackets.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT.—The part indicated will be read.

The secretary read as follows:—

> "Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy. Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day in the Sabbath of the Lord thy God (in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."

The discussion which followed upon this amendment deserves well to rank among the debates in the great religious councils of the fourth century. It was even more significant than they. Its result is fraught with even greater peril, as it marks the culmination of added centuries of error, and also because, that, amid the greater opportunities to know and do the right, the wrong was deliberately chosen. The debate was opened by Senator Manderson, of Nebraska. In the *Congressional Record*, of July 12, pp. 6694, 6695, 6701, appears the following:—

MR. MANDERSON.—The language of this amendment is that the Exposition shall be closed on the "Sabbath-day." I submit that if the senator from Pennsylvania desires that the Exposition shall be closed upon Sunday, this language will not necessarily meet that idea. The Sabbath-day is not Sunday.

The word "Sabbath-day" simply means that it is a rest day, and it may be Saturday or Sunday, and it would be subject to the discretion of those who will manage this Exposition, whether they should close the Exposition on the last day of the week, in conformity with that observance which is made by the Israelites and the Seventh-day Baptists, or should close it on the first day of the week, generally known as the Christian Sabbath. It certainly seems to me that this amendment should be adopted by the senator from Pennsylvania, and, if he proposes to close this Exposition, that it should be closed on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

Therefore I offer an amendment to the amendment, which I hope may be accepted by the senator from Pennsylvania, to strike out the words "Exposition on the Sabbath-day," and insert "mechanical portion of the Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

MR. QUAY.—I will accept the modification so far as it changes the phraseology of the amendment proposed by me in regard to designating the day of the week on which the Exposition shall be closed.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT.—The senator from Pennsylvania accepts the modification in part, but not in whole.

MR. HARRIS.—Let the amendment of the senator from Pennsylvania, as modified, be reported.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT.—It will be again reported.

THE CHIEF CLERK.—On page 122, line 13, after the word "act" it is proposed to amend the amendment of the committee by inserting:—

"And that provision has been made by the proper authority for the closing of the Exposition on the first day of the week commonly called Sunday."

As a final amendment to Mr. Quay's amendment, Mr. Gray, of Delaware, offered the following, which was accepted by Mr. Quay:—

> And it is hereby declared that all appropriations herein made for, or pertaining to, the World's Columbian Exposition, are made under the condition that the said Exposition shall not be open to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and if the said appropriations be accepted by the corporation of the State of Illinois, known as the World's Columbian Exposition, upon that condition, it shall be, and is hereby made, the duty of the World's Columbian Commission, created by the act of Congress of April 25, 1890, to make such rules or modification of the rules of said corporation, as shall require the closing of the Exposition on the said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

## THIS BECAME A LAW.

This was adopted by the Senate, on July 14; and by the House on July 19; and received the signature of the President of the United States on August 5, and thus became a law.

This is the first finished enactment of religion by the Congress of the United States in the history of the Government.

## THIS ENACTMENT RELIGIOUS LEGISLATION.

In his "Sabbath for Man," page 194, speaking of Sabbath laws, Mr. Crafts says:—

> At first thought they would seem to be religious laws.

True enough, and so they are; first impressions are usually correct. So was this legislation on the part of Congress touching the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, religious legislation. Men who were there and took part in it recognized the whole proceedings as religious. Reporting to the *New York Independent*, of July 28, 1892, the chaplain of the Senate said:—

> During this debate you might have imagined yourself in a general council or assembly or synod or conference, so pronounced was one senator after another.

## Senator Hawley said:—

> Everybody knows what the foundation is. It is founded in religious belief.—*Congressional Record*, July 12, 1892.

And Senator Peffer said of it:—

> To-day we are engaged in a theological discussion concerning the observance of the first day of the week.—Id.

Closing his speech Senator Colquitt, a National Reformer, thus betrayed a consciousness of the fact that such proceedings and such speeches as he and others had made were out of place in the halls of a civil government:—

> But I shall continue this no further, Mr. President, for it may to some sound like cant, like preaching, as though we were undertaking to clothe ourselves in overinfituous habiliments and pretend to be better than other men.—*Congressional Record*, Fifty-second Congress, page 6785.

## SECURED UNDER RELIGIOUS PRESSURE.

This legislation was not secured from Congress without the use of political and boycotting measures on the part of the so-called Protestant "evangelical churches." To many of their petitions asking for this legislation was attached the following threat:—

> Resolved, That we do hereby pledge ourselves and each other, that we will from this time better forth refuse to vote for or support for any office or position of trust, any member of Congress, either senator or representative, who shall vote for any further aid of any kind to the World's Fair except on conditions named in these resolutions.—*Congressional Record*, May 25, 1892, page 5144.

Many churches by vote declared that they would stay away from the Fair if it were not closed on Sunday. Many churches and church papers went so far as to declare their intention to do what they could to persuade exhibitors to withhold their exhibits if the Fair were not closed on Sunday, thus resorting to boycotting methods to compass their ends. And these threats of loss of votes and patronage were not without their weight upon those congressmen who cared more for position than principle.

In the Senate, Senators Hawley, of Connecticut, and Hiscock, of New York, were the most prominent advocates of the measure. Senator Hiscock said:—

> If I had charge of this amendment in the interest of the Columbian Exposition, I would write the provision for the closure in any form that the religious sentiment of the country demands, and not stand here hesitating or quibbling about it. . . . I would not leave it uncertain whether the Government might engage in business or not upon the Sabbath-day.—*Congressional Record*, July 13, 1892, page 6755.

Senator Hawley said:—

> There is no use in endeavoring to escape responsibility. If the Senate to-day decides that it will not close that Exposition on Sunday, the Exposition will be opened on that day, and you will have offended more than 40,000,000 people—seriously and solemnly offended them. No wise statesman or monarch of modern times, no satrap of flame, would have thought it wise to fly in the face of a profound conviction of the people he governed, no matter if he thought it a profound error. It is not wise statesmanship to do it. . . Now, if gentlemen repudiate this, if they desire to reject it, if they deny that this is in the true sense of the word a religious Nation, I should like to see the disclaimer put in white and black and proposed by the Congress of the United States. Write it. How would you write it? How would you deny that from the foundation of the country, through every fibre of their being, this people has been a religious people? Word it if you dare; advocate it if you dare. How many who voted for it would ever come back here again? None, I hope.—*Congressional Record*, July 13, 1892, page 6700, and July 13, page 6759.

It was the same way in the House. A dispatch from Washington to the *Chicago Daily Post*, April 9, 1892, gave the following from an interview with a member of the House committee on the World's Fair:—

> The reason we shall vote for it is, I will confess to you, a fear that, unless we do so, the Church folks will get together and knife us at the polls; and—well you know we all want to come back, and we can't afford to take any risks.

Do you think it will pass the House?

> Yes, and the Senate too. We are all in the same boat. I am sorry for those in charge of the Fair; but self-preservation is the first law of nature, and that is all there is about it.

THE CHURCHES FEEL THEIR POWER.

By Congress and congressmen thus yielding, these churches knew the State had become the servant of the Church. Rev. J. D. Sands, of the Seventh United Presbyterian Church, Pittsburg, Pa., in a sermon preached July 17, 1892, said:—

> That the Church has weight with great political or governing bodies has been demonstrated most effectually in the late World's Fair matter, when the United States Senate, the highest body in the country, listened to the voice of religion, and passed the World's Fair $9,000,000 appropriation bill with the Church-instituted proviso that the gates of the great Exposition should not be opened upon Sunday. That grand, good fact suggests to the Christian's mind that if this may be done, so may other equally needful measures. The Church is gaining power continually, and its voice will be heard in the future much oftener than in the past.

Rev. H. H. George, D. D., said, in a speech in Paterson, N. J., August 7, 1892, these words:—

> I have learned that . . . we hold the United States Senate in our hands.

And in a meeting held in Lansing, Mich., Dec. 9, 1892, the same speaker again said:—

> We can hold Congress in our hands, and wield this country just as we please.

And the *Christian Statesman* of Oct. 1, 1892, thus joyfully exclaimed:—

> The forty millions in the Christian homes of the land, the ruling majority when they assert themselves, have won at least one great moral victory in each of the recent sessions of Congress.

The Sabbath closing victory with which the quarter century closes, shows the way to others that will make the nineteenth go out in glory sight years hence. For the great Christian majority has learned, by response to its great petition, and its host of letters with reference to the World's Fair, that if can have of national and State governments whatever legislation against immorality it will ask unitedly and earnestly.

This Church control over the Government, over which these men here boast, is a most certain evidence that—

CHURCH AND STATE ARE UNITED IN THE UNITED STATES.

National Reformers have themselves admitted that this sort of Church domination is a union of Church and State, as note the following words of Rev. J. M. Foster in the *Christian Statesman*, of Aug. 29, 1889:—

> A union of Church and State exists where the Church usurps control over the State, as on the Romish theory, or where the State assumes to establish and control the Church, as in England.

The union of Church and State now in existence in the United States is of the Romish kind,—a veritable image to the Papacy.
