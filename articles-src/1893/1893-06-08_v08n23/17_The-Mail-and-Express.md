The *Mail and Express* says that "this administration is not so thin of skin nor so weak of fibre that it can not without difficulty oppose the opening of the gates of the Chicago Exposition on the Sabbath, while it is inclined to sympathize with the other side." This must be the reason the President went, publicly on Sunday instead of ordering out the army to close the Fair gates in obedience to the nobody's request of Mr. Crafts and the Boston preachers.

The claim that different police conditions exist on Sunday than on other days, and that the public peace may not be disturbed on that day by things that do not constitute on other days, received a serious setback in Chicago, on the 21st ult. In granting the temporary injunction prayed for by one of the stockholders, forbidding the closing of the Fair gates on Sunday, Judge Stein overruled the plea that "to open the Fair would be a violation of the law of the State by disturbing the peace on Sunday," remarking that the petitioner had made no showing that there was a disturbing of the peace, or that the disturbance, *if any, one worse on Sunday than on any other day.* This principle consistently adhered to by the courts would render null and void every Sunday
