# Uncertainties — v08n23 (1893-06-08)

## Masthead OCR Errors (corrected)

- **OCR read:** "ALONEO T. JONES"
- **Corrected to:** "ALONZO T. JONES"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — standard name, clear OCR misread of 'Z' as 'O'

- **OCR read:** "CALVIN P. BOLLHAM"
- **Corrected to:** "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — known name, clear OCR misread

## Article 06 — The United States Against the Columbian Exposition

- **Location:** Quoted legal bill text, "the Secretary of the Treasury delivered to said corporation S.858,240 of said coins"
- **Uncertainty:** "S.858,240" — the "S." is almost certainly a dollar sign ($) misread by OCR
- **Transcribed as:** "S.858,240" — preserved as OCR output; original almost certainly reads "$858,240"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — dollar sign misread as "S." is common OCR error, but original not verified

## Article 09 — Protestants Keeping Sunday Holy (reprint, Kansas City Catholic)

- **Location:** Scripture quotation from Exodus 20 in body of reprint
- **OCR read:** "rested on the seventh day' trebleevate, the Lord blessed..."
- **Uncertainty:** "trebleevate" is clearly an OCR error for what should read "therefore" or similar connective word; the Douay Bible text at this point reads "wherefore" (cf. Exodus 20:11 Douay version)
- **Transcribed as:** "trebleevate" — preserved exactly as OCR output since this is a reprint and the exact word in the original Kansas City Catholic text is uncertain
- **Confidence:** LOW — OCR error near-certain, but correcting would require verifying original Kansas City Catholic text
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — no additional clarity available from OCR text alone

- **Location:** Later in same article: "to ininstructibly inculcate and commemorate"
- **Uncertainty:** "ininstructibly" — may be OCR error for "indelibly" or "indubitably," or possibly a genuine archaic/unusual word used by the Catholic writer
- **Transcribed as:** "ininstructibly" — preserved as OCR output
- **Confidence:** LOW — unusual word, possible OCR corruption

## Article 05 — The Image to the Beast

- **Location:** Footnote at bottom of page 2 column: "*From this point upward this article is condensed from 'Parts for the Times.'"
- **Decision:** Retained at end of article as editorial note in italics, as it is part of the published text
- **Note:** The asterisk reference appears mid-article in the OCR at page 2. Placed at end of article in transcription for readability.
