## The United States Against the Constitution.

Some months ago, it was said in the SENTINEL, that the United States courts would, by their decisions in the World's Fair controversy, be compelled to state their position more definitely on the determination most recently by Justice Brewer's opinion in the decision of the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States—the "Christian Nation" decision. It was said it might be that this would bring up the whole question of State's rights, as to whether Congress has the power to pass for the municipality of Chicago by which it may enforce the World's Fair appropriation, or lay any condition upon its expenditure. It is possible that the time has already come which was looked forward to. Legislation not previously made, for suit has been commenced for the Government, looking to the permanent enforcement of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by decree of the United States Court. Suit has been brought for the United States by Mr. Milchrist, the United States District Attorney for the northern district of Illinois, in this behalf by the authority of the United States and brings the bill of complaint against the World's Columbian Exposition, a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Illinois. After narrating the description of the plan for the holding of the World's Fair and the determination of the place for holding such and international Exposition was to be held, the act of Congress providing for the holding of said public and international Exposition. The congressional history of the bill, with its different stages, the enactment of the second half of the Fair is then set forth together with its acceptance by the World's Fair. A proviso attached to the appropriation of the five million dollar bill relates to the claim is made that the proviso attached only to that but to the proviso attached therein made by Congress in behalf of the Exposition. . . That the Board of Director and the National Commission . . . should provide for the free exercise of religion, of amusement, is then referred to and the language of the restriction prohibited by word of the law. The appropriation was for the use of the said Exposition, it prohibits the opening of the Fair Sunday, as provided. The bill then proceeds at length to the Fair management, and the question of the opening of the Fair, the Sunday closing situation treated at length, as follows:—

Your orators further allege that although said act of Congress, among other things therein provided, providing for the closing of the said Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, is now in force and effect, and although the said World's Columbian Exposition has been and is now duly accepted the acts of the said commission and the said corporation and that it would comply with all the terms thereof; that its said Exposition is already begun; and that it is honestly kept in open, the gates of said Exposition, acting together or severally, have legal authority to close the said Exposition and to open, and all position of the gates thereof on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

Your orators further aver that after the acceptance of said appropriation upon conditions of said act of Congress, said corporation duly bound to said condition, it shall be, and is hereby bound to and corporation $2,530.15 of said coins therein. . . .

Mr. HISCOCK.—Harlow N. Higinbotham, D. H. Burnham, George R. Davis, and W. I. Buchanan—

Tucker design and intent to open the said Exposition to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and on each Sunday during the continuance of the said Exposition.

Your orators further allege that it is according to the design and intention the Board of Directors of the said corporation, and of the said National Commission, on the 18th day of May, 1893, passed and adopted a resolution that the World's Columbian Exposition be opened to the only condition upon which the public was to be admitted on the first day of the Exposition Sunday. On each and every Sunday that the said Exposition is open to the public—the said shall be suspended as far as practicable, and the mechanical portion of the said Exposition shall not be run, the buildings of said Exposition, the various structures for the protection of property and the various articles and objects exhibited therein shall remain open to the visitors for the day of rest and worship. Religious services may be held in the various buildings and places on the said Exposition grounds and an appropriate programme for each Sunday will be arranged and suited to the character of the day.

And said corporation has from its acceptance been engaged in the practice of opening the gates, building, and grounds of the said Exposition, and admitting the public thereto on each and every day of the week is hereby fixed at fifty cents per day—the sum charged for admission on every day of the week.

Your orators further allege that since the open, said corporation has opened the said gates and the Exposition on Sunday a large number of people have passed through the said gates and the ground of the said Exposition on each and every Sunday as aforesaid.

Your orators further show unto your Honors that that the charges for the admission of the public to and the said Exposition to be opened to the public, and if the said appropriation to be accepted by the said corporation, under the conditions provided for in the said act of Congress, the right and title of the World's Columbian Commission.

The Exposition was opened on the first day of the Exposition . . . Sunday. "It was only in its character and management under said Act of Congress by virtue of this resolution, on each Sunday after said day opening became operative. In effect Congress thus legislated the opening of the gates to be a proposition and thereby entered into a contract.

As it takes two heels to make a contract, and the failure to observe the terms, and Congress had seen fit on its part, without the consent of the other party to the contract, to withhold one-fifth of the appropriation, thereby forfeiting their

claim to hold the other party to the terms of the contract, as is shown by the fact that of said Exposition, so that they are bound by the Act of Congress to close the said Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; but your petitioner makes no point of this, as it has no interest dependent so forlorn, but that it needs to show that it can and make a case and make its said injunction, we do as of an aforesaid.

Your orators further aver that the said World's Columbian Exposition is properly a National Fair, and the said Harlow N. Higinbotham, D. H. Burnham, the U.S. District Attorney, Edwin Walter, who is, together, and are assumed to be in possession and control, under the charter of said Corporation, together, and are assuming to be in possession of and have lawful authority over the same; and assume to have control of the said, management of opening the said grounds for the admission of the public thereto and that by reason of such unlawful claim; and as such grounds for the admission of the public thereon on behalf of said corporation is aforesaid; upon the Directors of the said corporation is aforesaid; not to open the said grounds and Exposition on Sunday means that the Exposition would never have been open in violation of the act of Congress, and notwithstanding that the said corporation has ever been in open violation of the act of Congress, are doing a grave and unnecessary injury and a grievous prejudice to the constituents and patrons of said Fair, and the people of the United States.

In consideration whereof, and inasmuch as your orators have no adequate remedy at law, they pray man in this honorable court, where matters of this kind are alone properly cognizable, to the defendants name in this bill, each and every of them, may be subpenaed; and decree that the said World's Columbia Exhibition is in contempt of the act of the Congress, and the said Harlow N. Higinbotham, D. H. Burnham, and said Tucker, and such and all promoting for the opening of the gate of the Exposition on Sunday, used and prohibited from further agreeing, conspiring, or confederating for the opening of the Exposition on Sunday; and that the conditions adopted by the said corporation is aforesaid; not to open the said grounds and Exposition on Sunday and the gates thereto to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, and or all of the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, and or all the days of the week, and all persons acting for; or on behalf of, and them, and each and all persons acting for; or on behalf of said corporation shall be perpetually restrained and prohibited from opening the said grounds and the gates thereto to the public on the first day of the week, and all and further on each and every Sunday, or at any time thereafter during the continuance of the said Exposition.

Your orators further represent that should the defendants, if they can show why your orators should not have the relief prayed for, then upon a full hearing of the case, the said corporation, by a full, complete information, and brief, full, true, direct, and perfect answer, not under oath being hereby specially waived, to each and every of the allegations of this bill of complaint, on order oath being hereby specially waived; each and every of them; and they were specially interrogated upon these points, may be decreed from opening said Exposition on Sunday from being opened, by all and set aside by all further orders and decrees which will be necessary therein. And as equity directs in its deep bound, will ever pray, etc.
