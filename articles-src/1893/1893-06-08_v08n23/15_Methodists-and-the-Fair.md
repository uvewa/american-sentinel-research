May 19, a special committee reported at the Methodist ministers' meeting at 150 Fifth Avenue, this city, in favor of resolutions requesting all ministers and churches who could not conscientiously attend the Fair on Sunday. It had been the original plan of the day of the committee to have the resolutions adopted, but three ministers in turn moved that they be laid on the table, and when the meeting ended according to order, a Methodist minister at the same meeting the same day adopted:—

We view with alarm the present tendency of societies and agents to pompify worldliness upon the churches, and we earnestly exhort all our people to keep away from all places of evil repute and all public spectacles and exhibitions.

The same day at the noon service for young men in the rear room of the Church the Rev. Dr. Dunnett, said he would rebuke the members of his church for their aggressive attitude on the World's Fair question. He said:—

I have been informed of the withdrawal by the management of the Missionary exhibit of the World's Fair because of the opening of its gates on Sunday. I consider it a mistake. When our religion was compelled to close to go, but what witness, what testimony is it of you who leave? Why do not they do not get excited and arise in their strength and courage and resolution, and go in and preach and sing the gospel and distribute tracts; they go there to do work on the Sabbath who are hungering and thirsting after righteousness, and who need the word of God. It is a golden opportunity. And I am waiting for a resolution for the closing of the Fair on Sunday.

It is a popular thing now to attack the World's Fair; it is popular to stand against the gates; it is popular to denounce the show, and burn the churches and to the bondslave.

It is a popular thing now to the Church of God, the body of Christ, to withdraw and go home. In the name of the Lord I denounce the policy of withdrawal. If the fair opens on Sunday in the name of God, my friends, as you hope to be saved, rise up, go and preach the truth and distribute tracts to every person there.

On the Sunday opening of the World's Fair the Silver Creek, Neb., *Times* reports:—

Rev. Thomas Craig raised objections, saying that to go until the American people are so aroused that the senators and representatives will not dare to face the law from Idaho to California. Let those people who wish to have the Fair open on Sunday go and preach and pray, an appeal to the civil power to help them carry their moral legislation through yet, will not be silenced.

The gospel was not used here; it will increase more and more. But it will not result as foretold by the prophets of old.

It will result as foretold by Him. Those who will try to get the Government so that measures of the Government will be enforced upon men to compel religious action, will find that other laws of like character will be adopted, strictly upon religious matters, in a way they did not intend. Already it was so in that very thing at the Fair. The Sunday-law-side of the question has thus far been the loser and the gainer at the same time; and this very thing is an evidence of a powerful force for good in the use of any appreciation of the value. At the same time, there has been some financial necessity for an open Fair. Free enterprise that is needed the world over in civil cases.
