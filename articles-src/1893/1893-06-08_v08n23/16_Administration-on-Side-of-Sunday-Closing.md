THE *Mail and Express* says that "the administration is on the side of those who oppose the opening of the gates of the Chicago Exposition on the Sabbath, while it is inclined to sympathize with the other side." This must be the reason the President went yachting on Sunday instead of ordering out the army to close the Fair gates in obedience to the modest (?) request of Mr. Crafts and the Boston preachers.
