ANOTHER Seventh-day Adventist—the elder of the Millington church—was arrested, May 30, in Kent County, Md., for practical dissent from the established religion of that State. Other arrests are threatened. As usual only Adventists are disturbed, though the law is openly violated by others. The true reason was stated recently by a Sunday keeper, in these words: "We would not notice your Sunday work so much if you did not keep Saturday." The Adventists' real offense is keeping another day.
