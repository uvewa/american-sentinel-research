This is a question which Sunday-law advocates seem to be unable to answer, that is, unanimously. Some say it is only a civil law that is wanted, to procure for the "poor workingman" a weekly rest-day. But in contradiction to this the Baptist Examiner, some time ago, said:—

When the Sunday holiday begins to nullify the Sunday rest-day, the State should interfere.

That is, all should be compelled by law to keep Sunday as the Lord has commanded that the Sabbath should be kept. None should be allowed to do as he pleases, but the State should tell him what to do. Would that be a civil law?

In the Congressional Record, of July 10, 1892, we find this:—

MR. QUAY.—On pages 122, line 13, after the word "act," I move to insert:

"And that provision has been made by the proper authority for the closing of the Exposition on the Sabbath day."

The reasons for the amendment I will send to the desk to be read. The secretary will have the kindness to read from the Book of Law I send to the desk the part inclosed in brackets.

The "part inclosed in brackets," was the fourth commandment, which says:—

Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

Does that look as though it is only a civil law that is asked? Congress, backed by the churches, has said the gates of the Exposition shall be closed on Sunday. Why?—Because the fourth commandment says that no manner of work shall be done on the Sabbath. Sunday laws are asked for from a religious standpoint and not a civil.

If it is for the benefit of the workingman that Sunday laws are asked, it is a wonder that so many of that class are pouring in petitions to Congress to have the gates of the Exposition opened on Sunday. The churches, it would seem, are doing something for the workingman that he does not require of them.

But has Congress any right to close the gates of the Exposition on Sunday? Has the Government any right to pass a law saying that because Sunday is the Sabbath, and the Decalogue says that no manner of work shall be done on that day, therefore the gates shall be closed? It has no right; for this is a religious question, and is beyond the jurisdiction of Congress. The First Amendment to the Constitution forbids it, which says:—

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

This amendment has been violated. Congress has taken upon itself to make a law respecting an establishment of religion, and now it may assume the right to dictate upon other religious questions. Where is free America? Where is the land where every man is allowed his own choice in matters of religion? Where is the land where those that are persecuted in other countries flee for protection? Will they find refuge here? Will they find this a "land of the free," where they will have the inalienable right to believe and act according to the dictates of their own consciences? I think not, for religious persecution has begun already, and the time will come when all must keep Sunday or be punished. The persecution in Tennessee is only a beginning of what is to follow.

Speaking of religious legislation and of these persecutions, the Baptist Church Bulletin gives these suggestive words of warning:—

Let us be careful how we let in the camel's nose of religious legislation, lest the brute crowd his bulky form in and occupy the whole shop. If the law by which these men were legally imprisoned be a righteous law, then may any State, nation or country set up a religious creed and enforce it; then France treated properly the Huguenots; Russia the Jews; and early New England and Virginia the Baptists and Quakers.

And indeed it will not be long before the "brute will crowd his bulky form in and occupy the whole shop." The first step has been taken; it will not end there.

A. MALLETT.
