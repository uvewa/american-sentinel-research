The Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, according to the columns of the *Christian Statesman,* this almost sole surviving exponent of the cause of the foundations of religious law, in Pennsylvania, is rally to the support of existing Sunday laws in that State.

"The Sabbath law of Pennsylvania is in danger.

"Three bills already before the legislature ask for the repeal of the clause against the selling of Sunday newspapers on the Lord's day. This one evil opens the door for every other.

"Ministers of Pennsylvania can, in shall we say, *must* help. Our presence will show that our State courts earnestly contend for Sabbath, and her pulpit joins in her defense.

"Let every minister within the limits of the State report at once what help is needed and what he has offered to his beloved Saviour in holding out his helping hand to the ministers and our cause. Have your Sunday paper? Go for it. Why not have a Sunday manufacturing, Sunday brokering for all? Why not make legal the sale of flour and fruit and fish on Sunday? Why not make legal the sale of flour and fruit and every other commodity lawful on Sunday, as well as the sale of the former create the sale of the letter—the letter carriers, railway mail routes, engineers, horse car drivers are employed in the governmental service.

"Interest in the ministry, the enemy is the enemy.

"We are to have a convention in Harrisburg, the week beginning February 13, and closing on the 17th, at which we want the whole State of Pennsylvania represented—every ministerial body, every benevolent society as well.

"We have secured the presidents of any number of colleges, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and other leaders and leading organizations.

"That pastor and, at least, one member of every congregation to meet February 14, in Harrisburg.

"Read this notice to your people, prepare a stirring letter, and get at least ten members in his congregation to write short, sharp, pointed letters to their senators, urging and demanding that no change be made in the Sabbath law of the State.

"1. That the pastor, with other pastors, and some leading elders, constitute committees, personally or by letter, upon the members of the legislature from on their return home; and urge upon them with all possible emphasis, the obligation of Sabbath keeping.

"If every one will do his duty, and do it at once, God will give us the victory.

"Let us stand at least a thousand delegates at the convention on the 14th.

"Reduced rates. We hopefully trust the express railroad companies fairly."

"Your written, for, and hope to have a voluntary postal responsibility."

The bill permitting the Sunday sale of newspapers, to which reference is made, reads as follows:—

An act making it lawful to publish, expose to sale, and sell, and deliver newspapers upon the first day of the week.

*Section 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in General Assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same,* That it shall be lawful to publish, expose to sale, sell and deliver, newspapers upon the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

*Sec. 2.* That all acts or parts of acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed.

This is the only kind of reform legislation urged to take the place of its legitimate, honest and only proper work—moral suasion. The subject is one upon which the civil law has no right to utter its voice to allow or either to permit or prohibit.

Where these religionists have no oath the only permissible action that can be taken to their request is an unconditional repeal. But such a suggestion among the Pennsylvania Governors and Sabbath Union ministers and legislators, it is needless to say, would be looked upon as a little more than treason to the cause of Christ. And yet a Sabbath-reforming convention is an evidence of the existence of labor to be done in the religious field. The evil was effectual. Instead of being responded to by tens, as we heretofore, this time the remorse of the religious leaders was to be hundreds. The services were held in the State house, in double columns while much of all of congregational work. The moral suasion campaign of the American Sabbath Union had passed the attention of the legislature and legislative committees. This was for the first time holding largely attended meetings in the legislative halls of the State.

The first public meeting of the committee was held in the State House, in the Hall of Representatives, with the Governor, a prominent Senator, and a prominent pastor presiding, and the Secretary of State and gave his unqualified approval of the position taken. This is significant. The Pennsylvania Act of 1794 was the basis of several States of the United States of America, and which it would have been overlooked with one, with this one the passage of the act not a blessing had been, and in the State of Pennsylvania.

No man holding an elective position in the State should so openly interest himself in attending legislation, and publicly lobby for a measure in its own legislature, and preside at a partisan convention called together to attempt to influence legislation in the legislative halls of the State, is an entirely without parallel in the body in the history of legislation in this country.

That the chief executive of a State should have unhesitatingly taken such a prominent part in the propagation of a general religious legislation is as evidence that its advancement is to be more rapid than many have thought. The expulsion of the cause of religion by the joint hold of certain places of political preferment, such as Colonel Shepard and Vice-President of the United States, indicates the place which religious laws hold among real statesmen. The Sunday law of Pennsylvania is merely the more important basis upon which the structure of religious legislation is to be reared. Any man, like Senator Quay, now nothing that his prospects for political preferment and law—for whom enforced the bill was killed—and is reminded that with his ten thousand dollars' worth of stock in a Sunday newspaper, and had been willing to be read, traveled, traveled in religion and the grounds that the stock had been given and had not be bought, that is not a man to be sought to write in an editorial edition—and so the Tribune, the bill, for one reason or another of entirely religious make or of entirely secular works of necessity,—extreme as totally a matter of religious observance—is as despicable as any politician or legal trick to control the law in a corrupt interest.

The rapid flow of conservative speech, combined with the enthusiasm of each party, acquiring a justly named notoriety, seems destined to bring all the American religious legislation at once down to business. The result, typical in account before Aug. 23, is made in the following from the *Statesman:*—

"Let every citizen read these resolutions, and realize a picture of the religious legislation that is now going on in that State—in the words of a reporter present, to stand on end.

Among the measures for the annulment of the Pennsylvania Sunday law or some of its provisions is the bill to repeal the law of 1855, which applies only to Allegheny County. Mr. Humphrey's bill would broaden this. This was actively pressed, and the Sabbath Union was promptly on the ground. Two measures, drafted by the Sabbath Union representatives were introduced to strengthen the Allegheny County law with its twenty-five years of satisfactory working. That is significant of the animus of an already too energetic religious lobby in the legislation, and of Congress.

"*Resolved,* That we ask the legislature to strengthen and improve the existing Sunday laws for the State, and to declare the same a *civil* institution.

"*Resolved,* of a 'Sixteenth Amendment to the National Constitution to do all the necessary work be done in the country at large.'"

The opportunity of speaking to Congress for a strong Sunday law was the petitioning for Sunday closing of the Columbian Exposition. Of this matter the *Statesman* says:—

"The opportunity of laying the case before Congress was memorialized in terms given by Mr. Quay's resolution.

MR. QUAY. I present resolutions unanimously adopted by a convention of citizens of the State of Pennsylvania, assembled at Harrisburg, February 15, 1893, which I ask to be read and referred to the Select Committee on the Quadro-Centennial.

"PETITION TO THE AMERICAN SENATE.

"Whereas, the committee representing the Pennsylvania State Sabbath Convention representing the Evangelical Christian denominations and temperance and reform organizations, now in session in the city of Harrisburg—

"*Resolved,* That we heartily approve of the law closing the World's Columbian Exposition, and earnestly commend the patriotic and Christian sentiments by Hon. John H. Ketcham, of New York, recently expressed in the House of Representatives of the United States in a forcible speech in arguing against the bill for the World's Columbian Exposition.
