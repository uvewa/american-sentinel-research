THE Directors of the World's Fair have issued regulations requiring the closing of the gates on Sunday, and it is reported that the House Committee on the World's Fair decided Feb. 20, to make an end of all effort towards the repeal or modification of the Sunday-closing law. If that be so the die is cast; this is a Church and State Government without possibility of recall. That which was to be now is.
