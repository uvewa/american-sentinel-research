THE HARRISBURG *Morning Call,* reporting the proceedings of the Pennsylvania State Sabbath Association, in the last of the four days spent in the halls of the State Capitol, gave the gist of the addresses as follows:—

"Rev. ——, editor of ——, and President of the American Sabbath Union, ... the fourth commandment, which he applied not only upon the question of the day of worship, but upon these postal and social questions. If the principles could be induced to practice what they preach, all would be well. No one can deny that all the national, State and local office and control which was devoted to Sunday observance would be devoted to the Sabbath, the seventh day of God, and not a heathen deity in sun worship."

What those people really want is not what floats before the enchanted vision of the American Sabbath Union and National Reform Union. The Sabbath Union will of course retain the present form of Government; but how are the ballot laws of the United States to be reformed so that the citizens can vote those forty millions of believers in every possible combination in this country each voter has cast his own ballot.

Woman's Christian Temperance Union. There has also been a prejudice, backed out, and things are about equally bad, and no person casting more than one ballot. Setting out things that are ——, the argument will barely have to be referred to allow Mr. Shepard and the ministers to act as electors, and deposit their forty millions of votes at their will. There is a vast difference between wholesale petitioning in quadruplicate and the ineffable deposit of a ballot by the Australian system.

Yet Mr. Shepard's personality has to cover even many think. He may be the himself the presidential candidate of the Church party in the next campaigns, but it is more than possible that this election will not take our political machinery by that question. However, that which lay in the realm of probability has been actually promoted to fulfill, an witness this editorial in his paper of a recent date:

SUNDAY.

The first day of the week should be called Sunday in honor of Him in whose remembrance the day is kept.

*Presbyterians,* even now prefer to call the day Sunday rather than Sabbath—the latter preference, for the "Son" is the Lord Jesus Christ, the "Sun of Righteousness."

The name of the day. The Sabbath is the last day of the week. Sunday is the first day of the week. The Sabbath and Sunday are two entirely different days; and son, the day is found to be "Saturday." The day need to be called this in not English but in heathen worship. The name was given to it in honor of the sun, or the sun-god, as Monday was in that of the moon. Its heathen origin and heathen meaning were both recognized, was also considered; and also in behalf of other days of the week.

Consequently the word Sunday is of heathen origin and ought not to be tolerated in Christian circles. The Bible refers to this day in no other way than simply as "the first day of the week." There is no reference to the origin of the name of Sunday to be found in the Bible. The *Mail and Express* traces the name Sunday into a reference to the "Son" of God—the "Sun of Righteousness"—and by the same Sunday would make a troublesome task.

The fact is that the Bible says nothing about it, and if any day of the week is to be named for its own special merits, Sunday has not the slightest title to any such distinction. The Bible writers did not on their either affirming or denying that Christ rose on the first day of the week. The Bible expressly says that the Sabbath is the seventh day—not to use the title Sunday, which is a heathen name—while from the evidence that is in it alone never will worship for son of any sort or day be forthcoming.

And now that we have said about Sunday, Greekos and Armenians, who do worship images, pictures, and saints.

A Christian might find fault with the use of the name Sunday and say "Son of God" is the title which should be used, and might demand that the name be changed, but for those who observe another day for their worship, the very thing in respect to the name of Sunday is in the highest degree absurd.

The churches ought to be ashamed now as then at having dragged a heathen sun-worship day no longer perpetuate the remembrance and power of the sun, by keeping the first day of the week, in honor of the Son of God, should have taken a different day from that formerly kept for the worship of the heathen sun-god. Wednesday as a memorial of the birth of Christ and as a continual sign, against the power and influence of heathenism, would have been consigned to limbo, and other and appropriate devices would have been made to celebrate under the domination of false notions.

A departure from the present accepted nomenclature of the days of the week would be very radical, but—

It might engender legitimate marriage, and consequently national morality—the seventh day was to be called Wednesday. Saturday should be the day.

By giving the third day of the week the name of the first—the whole list—porthole other listed dates in the weekly calendar.

But the most radical change in the calendar, which can be accomplished by the least amount of change is accomplished by the observance of the seventh day for the Sabbath. This etymologically only amounts to a part of a name for the seventh day, and, in reference to Christianity, is the change needed.

We do not see that any really good reason can be urged against the seventh-day Sabbath.

It is evident this idea did not arise from the fervent religious impulse of the moment. It is the product of consideration and of previous thought. The proof: the editor of the *Mail and Express* has altered his orders, and his history does not fail us. His is one more recently parted with as "a" Mr. Shepard's religious conviction.

Had the first day of the week no name what would one call it? Of course a name would smell as sweet, and it is just not other name, if it had a name. And yet, what other name would stand as rank? Can that odor of idolatry, in the name Sunday, which smells to high heaven, be wiped out by painting a new name upon the top of a letter, and changing a "u" to an "o"?

It was by just such superficial devices that Constantine thought to Christianize the empire. It was by similar subtleties, with impurities, of which Sunday in the Protestant calendar is a notable example, that the American Sabbath Union may, with the *Mail and Express,* work up a remarkable day of the Sun—"Sunday, but that term is incorrect, and an attempt to make the weekly calendar or harmonize it with Christianity can never be made to go far enough. To change the name of Sunday to correct two days by joining the lines and—what of the rest?"

"As a matter of purely secular conviction it was not so pitiful and so unscrupulous." The weakness of the whole transaction laid upon technical frivolities of this sort, where the pettiest ingenuity is employed the attention of religious councils in the highest degree of absurdity, by the application of the title of the Son of God, to a day that bears the name of another, Sunday, is so serious a thought of that that such devices become necessary to attract attention of the superficial and frivolous from the real questions at issue.

If we had nothing else to do, it would be a great task to overthrow philology, to revolutionize national habits, and to throw back and unsettle its meaning at the same time. But we have more important thought structures upon which to base the observance of the real Sabbath.
