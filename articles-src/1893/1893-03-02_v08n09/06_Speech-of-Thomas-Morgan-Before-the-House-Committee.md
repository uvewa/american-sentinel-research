Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee: I am here not as an individual, but as the chairman of the special committee appointed by the Chicago Trade and Labor Assembly, to inaugurate a movement upon the part of working men to secure a repeal of the Act of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday. In performing this work, which has been limited to the short space of about four weeks, we endeavored to secure, in addition to the authority vested in us by the organized labor of Chicago—the city that will be affected possibly most by this action of Congress—we endeavored to secure the sentiments of our fellow-workers throughout the United States, so that we might come here empowered to speak, not alone for the laboring men of Chicago, but for the laboring men of the United States.

We issued a call for expression, and in response we have received documents which will be presented for your consideration, by Mr. Askow, who will follow me, and who will present the figures in round numbers. I might state that we have received responses from three hundred and seventy-five labor organizations, coming from every town and city in the United States in which there is sufficient industry carried up to promote or encourage the organization of a body of workmen; and up to date it covers thirty-three of the States of this Union. And only to-day I received a telegram that thirty-three petitions were received yesterday, personally directed to congressmen, who will have to settle this matter. All these petitions may be added to those already in our hands in four weeks.

In addition to that I am here authorized, and have the documents to satisfy the doubt, if such exists in the minds of the committee or any one else. I am here authorized to speak for that great organization known as the American German Turn Bund in this country. This organization, mind you, requires that every member must be a citizen of the United States. In the short space of three weeks of activity in that body, one hundred and eighty-five congressmen have been personally petitioned, the petitions being in their hands, with the seals of the one hundred and eighty-five German societies, covering almost every State in the Union. This desire upon the part of our German-American citizens has been expressed first in the national convention of the Turn Bund held in this city the 11th of last June. That expression has again been indorsed and sent out from the National Committee of the Turn Bund resident at St. Louis, and again indorsed by the district committee of Turners in Chicago.

I am also authorized to speak in the name and in behalf of the German Saloonkeepers' Association of Chicago, in this matter.

(Several in the room called out "Hear, Hear.")

(The speaker turned to those who called out, and said with decided emphasis, "Yes, sir.")

Now, Mr. Chairman, having stated the authority that is vested in me, I wish to say that I appear before this committee under very great embarrassment. I did not know until two hours before I took the train that I should be able to reach this committee. I arrived here at eleven o'clock last night, and being in a new place, in unaccustomed conditions, I lost my sleep. In addition to that I am just from the bench. You see I am a workman (holding up his hands); there are the callouses and corns that are the necessary incident to manual labor. I come unprepared by education, to meet the arguments presented here, or to present my case with the force and fluency that gentlemen in the opposition have, having been forced by my conditions to labor all my lifetime since nine years of age, without a single vacation; absolutely denied the opportunities of education except that which was wrested from my sleeping hours.

I am also embarrassed by the fact that I find myself for the first time in my life in the midst of a lot of friends of labor, and reformers, whose existence I never before was aware of; and I am absolutely astounded as well as embarrassed at the statements they make. They not only claim to speak in the name of labor, such as we have it in the United States, but, lo! and behold, they speak with the voice of authority from my fellow-workers in Great Britain, from which country I came. Not only that, but they take the name of a man whom I honor more, possibly, than any other, and hurl authority from that source at this committee—that man is Karl Marx. They speak in the name of the social Democrats of Germany also; and I, being a social Democrat, being an Englishman and associated intimately with the reform movement in that country, and being here in the United States for twenty-three years an active labor reformer—why, you can imagine my embarrassment and astonishment when I find these advocates and friends of Karl Marx, the social Democrats of England, and the friends of labor reform here in the United States. I regret exceedingly that I cannot grasp your hands in fraternal friendship. I am sorry that I have to say, Oh save us from our friends. I am embarrassed in being compelled to say that I am here with authority to absolutely repudiate you and charge you with false representations.

(Several again broke out with cries of "Hear, Hear.")

When I heard the statements they made I thought, I will approach this matter with kindness, gentleness, etc.; I thought to myself,—I hope I will have the will power to deal with this question in the same spirit; but I am afraid I have overstepped the limits already. I have this thing so near at heart that ordinary composure is absolutely destroyed when I find that we are attacked, that our interests are so misrepresented, that our desires and wants are so distorted, by these men who claim to speak with authority.

You bring men's names from England, who are absolutely unknown. What is the matter with Joseph Arch? What is the matter with Tom Mann? What is the matter with Ben Tillott? Can you speak in their names? No; you bring some unknown names here to add force to your misrepresentation. You have never been the friends of labor, and at this time you have no right to speak in that sense.

When you brought your references here my mind ran back at once to England, to Joseph Arch, a layman in the church, whose zeal for Christian religion was too great to be contained.

As a layman he taught, under the hedge-rows, the moral truths that Christ enunciated, and he found in his efforts to lift his class that the whole array of clergymen of Great Britain were against him, as we find the whole array of the clergy and the Catholic Church arrayed against us.

(Voices expressed disapproval.)

Possibly that statement I made that the whole clergy were arrayed against us is not strictly true. I hope to save myself from any statement that is not absolutely based upon facts. Possibly I would be right if I said that the evangelical churches of the United States, as here represented, are absolutely opposed to us and to our interests. Probably I should except the Catholic Church; possibly I will omit that. I tell you I am embarrassed. Possibly you will give me some consideration at least in that respect. I wanted to undo the work that you have been doing here, and I will do it to the best of my ability.

Joseph Arch, to whom I referred, who now lives, and from whom you have got no word, who was lifted from the hedge-row into the House of Parliament, was placed there by the people, and he promised to make it possible for them to live in decency and respectability. After he had accomplished that, the clergymen of Great Britain called him to a great meeting in Exeter Hall, at which there were present two hundred clergymen. They asked him to explain the purposes of his organization, and he did so. It was to lift the people out of absolute ignorance, to the comforts and decencies of manhood; it was to kill the saloon, to empty the jail, to give men in the agricultural districts a chance to live as decent human beings. He had accomplished a great deal in that direction, and he not only told the ministers, "We not only did it without your help, but we did it in the face of your absolute effort in antagonism." And he said, "After we have accomplished this work you call us to account; we give you the result of our work. We did that without your help. We will go right along. All that we ask you is that if you cannot see your way to help us, to get out of the way and leave us alone to do our work." This is my answer to your English production.

You speak here of the social Democrats of Germany. What right have you? You have no authority at all. You go to work and take this little bit and that little bit from the work of Karl Marx, the social Democrat, and the result of their convention, and present it here with authority. I am a social Democrat; I belong to that organization, and have done all I could to proselyte, in my humble way, the minds of the workmen of the United States, to the principles they hold. And I want to tell you clergymen that the principles held by the social Democrats of Germany are the principles enunciated by Jesus Christ, and which you do not understand.

(Several again called out, "Hear, Hear.")

Mr. Chairman, I not only speak with this authority that I have expressed, but I want to call attention to the relative position that we occupy toward the World's Fair matter, in comparison with this body of clergymen, organized like a machine—(turning to the ministers) called up one after another to do his portion of the work.

MR. DURBOROW.—Mr. Morgan, the committee is at this end of the table.

MR. MORGAN.—My general statement as to my unfitness for this kind of work will excuse me, I hope. If the friends of the Church had been kinder to me when I was a child (they taught me to read and write) I possibly would have been able to follow all the requirements of refined and common etiquette and society. Thanks to them, possibly I shall make some bad breaks, for which I ask to be excused.

(Concluded next week.)
