Why Seventh-day Adventists Protest.

IT is sometimes said that Seventh-day Adventists protest as they do against Sunday laws and religious legislation (1) because they do not believe that Sunday is the true Sabbath; and (5) because they suffer prosecution under Sunday laws.

As to the first reason we wish emphatically to say that we would oppose just as strenuously any civil legislation for the "promotion," or "protection," of the seventh day as for Sunday. In the first place, civil governments have no right to legislate on religious questions, dignities of institutions; and in the second place, God does not need the assistance of civil government to compel observance of his laws. The only acceptable observance of such laws is in faith and love, and law can not compel love; it only develops hypocrisy which is the worst of all sins.

As to the second reason, Seventh-day Adventists do not oppose Sunday laws because they are afraid of being persecuted. They do so because God has hidden those who are bearing "the everlasting gospel" to the world (no matter who they are) to protest against the worship of the beast or his image, or the reception of the mark of the beast. See Rev. 14:6-12. They can not do otherwise if they are faithful; and if persecution comes they welcome it; it would lead them to agree with the majority; their penalty to God places them on the side of his gospel, his word. As for persecution, they *know* it is coming, "know it as God's prophets know;" years ago because while he saw to this they saw in the fulfillment in part of another the same pledge promised in the word of God. See Rev. 13. That which was written of as years ago, we turn see in fact, while faith takes larger strides for the future before. We know persecution is coming. We do not invite it; we, in the weakness of the flesh, would fear because of it; but in the strength of Christ we are willing to meet it, bearing faithful warning against the mystery of iniquity now fast treading in to reality if possible the mystery of God.

You, we know that it will come, but we are assured in the same word by which we learn its truth, that we are assured that those who keep the word of Christ's patience, he will keep in the hour of temptation, which is coming on all the world to try them that dwell on all the face of the earth. Rev. 3:10.

May God pity and save those who are blindly opposing themselves against the truth, and may he help his people to revealed Christ and his power to those who are longing for light and power in the weakness and sin.—*Signs of the Times.*
