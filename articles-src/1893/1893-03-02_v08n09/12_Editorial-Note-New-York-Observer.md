THE New York Observer says editorially: "The question whether the World's Fair shall be opened or closed on Sundays is one world-wide and age-lasting in its importance." This is true, but not in the way the Observer understands it. The decision of this question, as it has been decided, marks the downfall of the correct and just principles of civil government in the only Nation which has ever espoused them. Their espousal and their defense will never be undertaken by another government.
