THE Catholic Club of Philadelphia gave their annual banquet on Monday evening, February 6, and among the notable Catholics who took part in the celebration was Cardinal Gibbons, of Baltimore, who was called upon to respond to the toast "Church and State." This prelate has a unique faculty of expressing himself on public occasions in such a way that one may see in him at once a diplomat of no mean calibre; and yet at times he betrays by significant utterances the readiness and ambition with which the "church" seeks to dominate whenever and wherever she can.

These are some of the Cardinal's utterances upon the occasion referred to:—

I am called upon to respond to the toast, "Church and State." I am firmly persuaded, both by study and observation, that the church is more sturdy in her growth, and more prosperous in her career, when she is free to pursue her divine mission without any interference on the part of the State. Here, thank God, the church is free, and therefore she is prosperous. Here the church and the State run in parallel lines, each assisting the other, and neither unwarrantably intruding on the domain of the other.

We have no State religion or official church in the United States. But it would be a great mistake to draw as an inference from this fact that therefore our Government is anti-Christian or anti-religious. I venture to say, on the contrary, that there is no commonwealth under the sun more strongly permeated by Christian and religious principles than the Government of the United States. Here the Christian Sabbath (Sunday) is observed as a day of rest.

But, if the State protects the church, the church on her part is the strongest balance and safeguard of the commonwealth in the exercise of her earthly mission. It will be the delight as well as the duty of the ministers of Christ in the future, as it has been in the past, to uphold our civil and political institutions. It will be our delight to proclaim the moral law which is the basis of all good governments.

For my part I believe that the relation between Church and State are as close and cordial as we should desire. All we ask is a fair field and no special favor.

Readers of the AMERICAN SENTINEL must be convinced ere this that there exists in this country the roots, trunk and blossoming branches of a church party. This party speaks covertly at times, and is composed of the bigoted elements of Catholicism and Protestantism. The Catholic element has been diplomatic and shrewd in its manoeuvres, while the Protestant element has "let the cat out of the bag" on many occasions. These points will be better appreciated by reference to some utterances which have been put forth from either element in the past:—

Whenever they (the Roman Catholics) are willing to co-operate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join with them.—Christian Statesman, Dec. 11, 1884.

At the convention of National Catholic Knights of Temperance, held in Washington, D. C., in 1891, Miss Francis E. Willard, President of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, said in her address that she was glad the time had come when Protestants and Catholics could join hands in demanding legislation of the Government. And Bishop Keane (Catholic) advised that only men who would pledge themselves to vote for temperance and Sunday laws should be elected to Congress.

In his Encyclical of 1885 Pope Leo XIII. admonished Catholics everywhere as follows:—

We exhort all Catholics who would devote careful attention to public matters, to take an active part in all municipal affairs and elections, and to further the principles of the church in all public services, meetings, and gatherings. All Catholics must make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life in the countries where they live. They must penetrate wherever possible in the administration of civil affairs; must constantly exert their utmost vigilance and energy to prevent the usages of liberty from going beyond the limits fixed by God's law. All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the Constitution of States, and legislation, to be modeled in the principles of the true church. All Catholics should redouble their submission to authority, and unite their whole heart, soul, and body, and mind, in the defense of the church.

So, when Cardinal Gibbons speaks for the "church" in this country he includes the two divisions of this party in embryo.

It will be noticed in his reply to the toast that the Cardinal says that "here the Church and the State run in parallel lines, each assisting the other, and neither unwarrantably intruding on the domain of the other, and that he qualifies the "intruding." Once before, the same gentleman in speaking of religious liberty, says that "a man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right to worship God according to the dictates of a right conscience." No doubt, in his mind the "church" is to be the court of last resort in defining what is warrantable or unwarrantable intrusion on the domain of the State, as well as to be the judge of a right conscience. He further says that while "we have no State religion...it would be a great mistake to draw as an inference from this fact that therefore our Government is anti-Christian...tain. . . . And adds to prove his inference that "here the Christian Sabbath (Sunday) is observed. . . ."

Since the "church" has decreed Sunday to be the Christian Sabbath in face of God's law demanding the recognition of Saturday as the Sabbath, and since, at the behest of the Church, Congress enacted religious legislation in closing the Chicago Fair on Sundays, which was unconstitutional in every particular, and since the Supreme Court has decreed this to be "a Christian Nation," one can not help but see how the "Church and the State run in parallel lines." Moreover, the Cardinal advises that "if the State protects the church (and to protect the church means to legislate for the church), the church on her part is the bulwark and safeguard of the commonwealth," and admonishes commensurate returns on the part of the church by saying, "It will be the delight as well as the duty of the ministers of Christ in the future, as it has been in the past, to uphold our civil and political institutions. It will be our delight to proclaim the moral law which is the basis of all good government." Now connect with these observations of Cardinal Gibbons the following utterances from Protestant leaders. Says Rev. D. McAllister, in the Washington, D. C., convention of National Reformers, April 1-3 1890:—

And what does the National Reform Association say? . . . Let the Church hold the moral principles of God's law—the law of Jesus Christ, the only perfect law—and let the State apply those moral principles that pertain to its own sphere of justice and right, in her schools and everywhere else, and do her own work as she shall answer to God himself, as she is the creature of his ordaining.

Also the expressions of Rev. J. M. Foster, in the Christian Cynosure, Oct. 17, 1889:—

According to the Scriptures, the State and its sphere exist for the sake of, and to serve the interests of, the Church. The true State will have a wise reference to the Church's interests in all its legislative, executive and judicial proceedings.

Thus the Church is protected and exalted by the State.

Now add to these the following from Rev. T. H. Tatlow's speech in a convention in Sedalia, Mo., May 23, 24, 1889:—

In administering this one constitutional law (Ten Commandments) to the good of this two fold life of man, God has ordained two administrative agencies, one of them the Church, as the spiritual agency in the realm of man's spiritual life, and the other the State as his secular agency in the realm of man's secular life. . . . These things being so, neither the civil power as God's ordinance, nor the civil ruler, as God's minister, within their special province have any authority as such to make void any of the ten commandments, whether by neglect in enforcing them or by indifference to their authority and claims. At this point, the party of civil policy protests and cries out that this is uniting Church and State. The Christian replies: It is indeed a union, but only so far as two separate jurisdictions. . . . This union, therefore, is like the union of the spiritual in man, acting conjointly with the body in man; the body being brought under and kept in subjection to the spiritual.

If words mean anything these words mean that the Church, the spiritual agency, is to dominate or control the State, the secular agency. It means also that when men (though their faith or religious sentiments may be founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ) will not conform to Church dogmas, the State is to come to the help of the Church, and in this way Church and State run in "parallel lines," the one assisting the other. This principle has been established, and as Rev. J. D. Sands stated in an address in Pittsburg, Pa., "The Church is gaining power continually, and its voice will be heard much oftener in the future than in the past. And Rev. H. H. George declared in a speech in Paterson, N. J.: "I have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands." Certainly, for Senator Hawley says:—

If the Senate to-day decides that it will not close that Exposition on Sunday, the Exposition will be opened on that day, and you will have offended more than forty millions of people—seriously and solemnly offended them. . . . It is not wise statesmanship to do it. . . . How would you deny that from the foundation of the country, through every fibre of their being, this people has been a religious people? Word it. if you dare; advocate it, if you dare. How many who voted for it would ever come back here again? None, I hope.

Cardinal Gibbons closes his reply to the toast by saying, "For my part I believe that the relations between 'church' and State are as close and cordial as we should desire. . . . " What more should or could the church desire than to control the State and make demands corresponding to her needs upon the Government?

Parallel lines we may find by demonstration never meet; but the "parallel lines" of Messrs. Gibbons, McAllister, Foster, and others are in such close proximity as to overlap. And since the Government of the United States is to be controlled by the Church then when the Church speaks it speaks to its own, and when it speaks to its own it is not "unwarrantable intrusion" to demand of its own that which it will have. The Government organized by and for the people has become the servant of the Church, and religious liberty is a thing of the past. This has not been done in a corner, for the SENTINEL has faithfully warned the country of these things.

S. B. HORTON.
