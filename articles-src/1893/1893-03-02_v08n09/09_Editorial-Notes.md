NEW YORK, MARCH 2, 1893.

ANY one mailing the AMERICAN SENTINEL without its being properly enclosed in a wrapper will put the paper in a condition to which the Post Office will not carry it, and may refuse it to the person to whom the paper was addressed to.

THE Directors of the World's Fair have issued regulations requiring the closing of the gate on Sunday, and it is reported that the President of the United States, through the Fair directors Dec. 10, to make an end of all effort towards the repeal or modification of the Sunday-closing law. If that be so be the is not; this is a Church and State affair, without possibility of result. That which was to be now is.

---

In the last congressional hearing, on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, Joseph Cook closed his remarks with this statement:—

In England the tallest white angel now existing is allowed to shoot that subject to the task and will be allowed to that angel to the back and will be allowed to that man.

---

That fact is a fair, otherwise, that is fact and has to be met; this is the matter of fact, and this true Scotch a would preach her favorite course.

---

The *New York Observer* says officially: "The question whether the World's Fair shall be opened or closed on Sunday is not one world's and agitating in its importance." This is true, but not in the way the *Observer* understands it. For the deciding of this question, as it has been decided, marks the downfall of the correct and just principles of civil government in the only Nation which has ever espoused these principles and made their protection severe yet be undertaken by any Government.

INDEPENDENT views as to the enforcement of Sunday laws are not confined to the county jurors of Tennessee. The *Lowell Morning Mail,* of Lowell, Mass., in its issue Feb. 6, has this editorial item: "Somebody has an intention on trial at Portland for violating Tennessee's Sunday law, and those not, it is pretty plain to see the unconstitutionality of the law is to be of the chief interest of the matter. The will of the majority in both Church and State the roles of this country and of the Constitution doesn't support this view the rest is we that is not of the American Sunday must be preserved."

---

It would seem that the entire creed of the *Morning Mail* is "when you are in Rome do as the Romans do." Yet it is not usual for those who profess that creed to express it with quite the rim and intolerance used in this item. The doctrine of the sacredness of religion of the majority or of the reigning creed necessarily results in this; however; so the unavoidable conclusion is that whether the *Morning Mail* professes Christianity, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Shintoism or Judaism, the obedience of its requirement, and it would be equally tolerant predominant alike.

In Cleveland, Ohio, the park commissioners have not allowed skating on the lake in the park, the past winter. Sleigh-riding on Euclid Avenue was not interfered with, neither the passage from passageways through the park, but it may be that they did not see the use of the park roadways or ponds, or propel himself on skates. The action is totally without authority, but was supposed to have been taken in deference to the religious feelings of residents in sight of the park, who felt their devotional spirit disturbed by the sight of the skaters and small boys with their hard sleds. It is strange how it is that any deference paid to the religious prejudices of the so-called orthodox are to be enforced either will or otherwise.

THERE is in New Orleans a bitter contest between the judicial and executive branches of the municipal government in reference to the enforcement of the Sunday law. The Mayor and the police force have refused to make arrests. The District Attorney has determined that they shall, under the alternative of arrest themselves, upon their being attested by warrants and putting under bonds the Chief of Police. ... The Mayor and Chief of supported by the majority of the people.

This is another phase of the same conflict which is going on at Denver, in reference to the Sunday closing of theaters. In both cases the minority is determined, it has become the majority into obedience to a religion or the which had long been a dead letter, and should have been expunged from the statute books.

---

In Denver the theaters are now open on Sunday night with crowded houses. Whatever harm there is in them has been multiplied by the offorts to close them. The immediate result in New Orleans of the conflict between the different branches of the municipal government at to Sunday closing has resulted in a strict Sunday day, temporarily. The minority will not exercise this majority long in either city. The great reckless majority will, for the time at least, have its own way. Then it who will suffer are the few conscientious Bible Christians, as in Tennessee and Arkansas.

---

A New Orleans exchange is opposed to the Sunday law—

because it believes it to be unconstitutional; because it considers it an infringement of political liberty; and because it believes that any deference in a step towards governmental interference in that respect, without establishing a precedent destructive of this great and glorious Republic so fully consecrated. ... If the question could only be submitted to the State and United States Supreme Court on the constitutional question and not upon mere legal technicalities, there would be a decision against the Sunday law. Let those who favor it try a test.

---

This editor has said that the "a decision is the Christian Nation." It will be a surprise to him to learn by his latest that a religious minority has outvoted the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of this Government, and that it is already using its power to terrorize the many as in New Orleans and in forests, and elsewhere, and in the towns and the few as in Tennessee. There is a great deal of religious lesson for many citizens of the United States.

The objection of Dr. Edward Murphy to the Senate of the United States from New York, and that of Mr. O. I. Quay to the Senate from the same State, made in the interest of the Sunday-closing machine politics have reduced the two largest States to a political absurdity in the American Senate.

---

This is significant in view of the fact that one of the men mentioned in the final character of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, "taking high ground and grounds upon that question and appealing to the fourth commandment of the divine law as the warrant for closing the gates of the Exposition on that day." The action, the man who is to be held forth as the expositor of the corruption of politicans who only a short time since, landed almost in the very felon's cell in the criminal courts; and his re-election to the United States Senate was a bareback for a victory for ——.

"This Sunday question has been systematically agitated by the ministers of the State of Massachusetts through their State and into the legislation at the present winter. At the same national meeting of earnest, religious denominations a union committee was requested to secure "better Sunday legislation." Circulars and blank petitions in readiness to be sent, under the authorization petitioned to the authorities, and introduced, regulating Sunday traffic, prohibition sales, recreation, etc., on the Lord's day. ... "a return to the typical New England Sabbath of the Lord's Day." —— was referred to the legislative Committee on Legal Affairs, and a hearing before said committee had February 7. A presentation being made by friends of the measure.
