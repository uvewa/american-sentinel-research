A Day's Religion in Congress.

ON Thursday, February 16, Congress gave its time and attention to the interference of the national religion in the following shape:

IN THE SENATE.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, transmitting, in response to a resolution of the Senate of January 17, 1893, a copy of all orders, rules, and regulations made by the World's Columbian Exposition by the act making appropriation for the sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, and for other purposes approved August 5, 1893.

MR. QUAY. Nearly every Senate has received a copy of the issue providing for the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. The expense of taking care of the Fair on Sunday would satisfy those who are interested in the question. I ask that it be printed and lie on the table.

The VICE-PRESIDENT. The letter of the Secretary of the Treasury in the Journal ...

Mr. QUAY submitted the following resolution, which was read and agreed to be and is ordered to be printed, and to lie on the table, as follows:—

"Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the following Senate resolution of January 17, 1893:

*Resolved,* That the Secretary of the Treasury be directed to inform the Senate whether the appropriations, or any part thereof, for the expenses of the World's Columbian Commission ... civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, the World's Columbian Commission; and if so what rules and regulations have been made by the World's Columbian Commission; and if so what rules and regulations have been made by the said World's Columbian Commission, or in any way provided for the opening of the said Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

"In reply I have the honor to state that payments have been made, to officers, employees, and members of the Commission, and of other, from the appropriation of $2,500,000 referred to in the resolution, for salaries and contingent expenses, upon which it is understood, that the Exposition is not to be opened on Sunday ..."

The World's Columbian Commission has also made the following rules and regulations under the Act of Congress approved August 5, 1892, on the recommendation of the Committee on Grounds and Buildings of the World's Columbian Exposition (Association) and the subject has been very fully discussed by the Commission, and by the Directors of the World's Columbian Exposition (Association) at various times. The general purpose of the restrictions and enforces the rule, viz: of each Sunday the World's Columbian Exposition shall be closed.

Respectfully yours ...

"On August 5, 1892, the Commission adopted the following:

"This is a part of such rule ... week except the first day thereof commonly called Sunday ..." — and was referred to committee including the 20th day of Oct. 1892 the Directors ...

If pursuance of the directions contained in the Act of Congress, approved August 5, 1892, and in accordance with the regulations governing the sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, and for other purposes. The Exposition grounds shall be closed to the public on the seventh session of the World's Columbian Commission, which—

... and of further during the six months commencing the 1st day of May, 1893, and ending the 30th day of Oct. 1893, on each day of the week, subject to the rules and regulations of the World's Columbian Commission, except that said Exposition shall be and last mentioned day the said Exposition and shall not be open to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

"To the PRESIDENT *United States, Secretary of the Treasury."*

In the House, having under discussion a proposed amendment, by the State of South Carolina:—

Mr. Chairman, in condemnation of this district ... the time had come in the history of this country to impose a higher authority than anything that has yet governed ...

Mr. TUCKER. The gentleman from Georgia is also a man of great learning and wide reading, who always "persists in what I am about to read and I want to present the opinions of ——:

"... a prejudice not very wide or failure.

"If thou afflict them to any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

"And the Levite (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest."

"within the gates;" but these people are citizens of the United States. It cannot be less, by the terms of the fundamental law of the country.

MR. TUCKER. The gentleman from Georgia is a man of great reading, and the Bible is one of his books. ... Sir, it must be read reading from the sermon on the mount:—

"When thou cuttest down thine harvest in the field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands."

"Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, fatherless and widow; and all the people shall say, Amen. Deut. 27:19."

"Learn to do well; .... judge your ways and your doings. .... execute judgment between a man and his neighbor.

"Do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, and walk not after other gods to your hurt, then will I cause you to dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever."

"... Shall have no other gods, .... and when the new put it gave witness to destroy .... but now it was ever these things and had no right to the throne and sat down upon it, sitting for joy. Job. 31:16."

"... pollute you, endure the affliction, ... The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; the eyes of him was ready to perish came upon me ..."

"... pure, lasting and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."

"... this was no exception and must be the basis ... expect anything else I hope they still have not been disappointed."

MR. HICKS. It said that the devil sometimes quotes scripture ....

The same *Record* contains two columns of remarks upon the subject of proposed legislation closing the World's Fair on Sunday. Let this legislation there has been given and should be not repealed.
