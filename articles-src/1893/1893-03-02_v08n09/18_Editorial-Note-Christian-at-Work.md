THE Christian at Work, February 2, says:—

The election of Mr. Edward Murphy to the Senate of the United States from New York, and the election of M. S. Quay to the Senate from the State of Pennsylvania mark the lowest depths to which machine politics have reduced the two largest States in the Union. More might be said, but more is not necessary.

This is significant in view of the fact that one of the men mentioned is the special champion of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, taking high religious grounds upon that question and appealing to the fourth commandment of the divine law as the warrant for closing the gates of the Exposition on that day. For this action, this man who is now held forth as one of the most corrupt of politicians, was, only a short time since, lauded almost to the skies by the Christian Statesman, and his re-election to the United States Senate was heralded as a victory for the "American Sabbath"!
