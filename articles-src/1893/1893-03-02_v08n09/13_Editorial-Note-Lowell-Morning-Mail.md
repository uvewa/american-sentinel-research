INTOLERANT views as to the enforcement of Sunday laws are not confined to the county papers of Tennessee; the Lowell Morning Mail, of Lowell, Mass., in its issue of Feb. 2, has this editorial item:—

Seventh-day Adventists are on trial at Paris for violating Tennessee's Sunday law, and threaten, if found guilty to test the constitutionality of the law in the United States Supreme Court. By the will of the majority in both Church and State the first day of the week is Sunday. The majority rules in this country and if the Constitution doesn't support their views they can fix it so that it will. The American Sunday must be preserved.

It would seem that the entire creed of the Morning Mail is "when you are in Rome do as the Romans do." Yet it is not usual for those who profess that creed to express it with quite the vim and intensity used in this item. The doctrine of the sacredness of the religion of the majority, or of the reigning creed necessarily results in this, however; so the unavoidable conclusion is that whether the Morning Mail professes Christianity, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Shintoism or paganism complete, simply depends on its environment, and it would be equally intolerant professing either.
