Are Sunday Laws Civil or Religious?

THIS is a question which Sunday-law advocates seem to be unable to answer; that is, unanimously. Some say it is only a civil law; that is, enacted, to preserve for the "poor workingman" a weekly rest. Such is the argument of Mr. ——, *Examiner,* some time ago, said:

Let us be careful how we let in the camel's nose of religious legislation. ... to put Christianity in a bully form in and to scoop the whole shop. If the demand of the church ... for the suppression of all these things on the first day of the week, ... the country set up a religious creed and enforce it by law—for that is what a national Sunday law means. It is neither more nor less, for it is against the Ingrates and Quakers ...

"brute will crowd his bulky form" in after his nose is once admitted, "and another step has been taken; it will not be the last."

Speech of Thomas Morgan Before the House Committee on the World's Fair Resolution.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am here not as an individual representative of myself, but as a representative of the committee originally appointed by the Chicago Trades and Labor Congress. I had the honor of being chairman of a committee which organized a movement upon the part of the working men to secure the repeal of the Act of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday. That committee of organized labor had been limited to the short space of about four weeks, we accomplished—the securing of the petition which was signed in its by the organized labor of Chicago—we endeavored to enlist the cooperation of our fellow-workers, to enlist the organizations of our fellow-workers throughout the United States, so that those who have interests here as expected to speak, not alone for the laboring men of Chicago, but for the laboring men of the United States.

We issued a call for expressions, and in a short time replies began to come in, which will be presented for your consideration. One of our members has tabulated them and who will present the figures to round numbers. I might state that we have received responses from three hundred and seventy-five labor organizations, covering from every town and city in the United States in which there is a sufficient number of all the workingmen and mechanics. This shows the organization of a body of workers not to be disregarded, representing all over the States of this Union. And only today I received a telegram that thirty-three petitions were received yesterday, personally directed to congressmen, who will have to settle this matter. All these petitions may be added to those already in our hands in four weeks.

In addition to that I am here authorized to say beyond the doubt, if such exists in the minds of the committee or any of its members, I am here authorized to speak for that great organization known as the American Federation of Labor. That in this country, gentlemen, mind you, register that every craft in the American Federation of Labor. In the short space of three weeks of activity in that body, one hundred and fifty-seven local organizations have actually petitioned, the petition being in their hands not more than ten days; and of those eighty-five German societies, covering almost every State in the Union, have spoken upon the part of our German-American citizens that have also expressed themselves first in the national convention of the Trades Band in talk held in the city of St. Louis last June. That convention was of a body well informed and sent out from St. Louis a resolution in terms of the convention held at St. Louis, and again expressed themselves first.

I am also authorized to speak in the name and in behalf of the German-Bakers, who in this country number fully 40,000.

Several in the room called out "Hear, hear!"

The speaker turned to those who called out and asked, "You are from Philadelphia?"

"Yes, all!"

Mr. Morgan: Charming stated the authority that is vested in me, I wish to present a few figures. I shall endeavor to work on very fast, because I know that I took the train that I should be able to reach here. I had to leave home on twenty-six o'clock last night, and being in a new town was a little bit confused.

Mr. Durborow—Mr. Morgan, take all the time. You have an hour. I am a great deal interested.

The Gentlemen on the Committee that have visited the Fair last June saw the conditions and costs that are the necessary results of keeping up the ground; and it is beyond the comprehension of any man, unless he has been taught by education, to muse the cost of maintaining those grounds if they are to be closed on Sunday. No people on this earth with the force and fluency that greets a foreigner on landing. I have not been forced by my conditions to labor, at my lifetime since ten years of age, to fully appreciate the wants of working people and the opportunities of education except that afforded by Sunday. And I stand here with an experience corroborated by the fact that I had equal for the first time in my life an opportunity. I can tell the Committee that, and reformers, whose evidence is perhaps more valuable than mine, will tell the same. Have the courage to make the statements they make. They not only know it to be true because they know that as we have it in the United States, but they see the same thing, and upon the same authority of from my fellow-workers in Massachusetts through their States and on the legislative front at the present. At the same national meeting of earnest, religious denominations a union committee was requested to secure "better Sunday legislation." Circulars and blank petitions in readiness to be sent, under the authorization petitioned to the authorities, and introduced, regulating Sunday traffic, prohibition of sales, recreation, etc., on the Lord's day. Of this matter we also bring about "a return to the typical New England Sabbath of the Lord's Day." —— was referred to the legislative Committee on Legal Affairs, and a hearing before said committee had February 7. A presentation being made by friends of the measure.
