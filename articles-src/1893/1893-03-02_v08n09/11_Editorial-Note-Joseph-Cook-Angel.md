IN the last congressional hearing, on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, Joseph Cook closed his remarks with this rhetorical burst:—

Sunday is the tallest white angel now entering heathen lands. Shall Chicago and other cities be allowed to stab that angel in the back, and will the statue of Liberty on this dome be called down to assist in the murder?

The fact is far otherwise. Liberty has been stabbed at the foot of her statue, and thus this Brutus would preach her funeral oration.
