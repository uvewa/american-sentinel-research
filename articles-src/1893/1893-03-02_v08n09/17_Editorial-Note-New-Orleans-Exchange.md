A New Orleans exchange is opposed to the Sunday law—because it believes it to be unconstitutional; because it considers it an abridgment of political liberties, and because such laws as the Sunday law is a step towards governmental interference in that religious freedom which the framers of the foundation of this great and glorious Republic so fully guaranteed. If the question could be presented to the State and United States Supreme Court on the constitutional question and not upon mere legal technicalities, there would be a decision against the Sunday law. Let those interested try it.

This editor has not read the decision of Justice Brewer that this is "a Christian Nation." It will be a surprise to him when he learns that a religious minority has captured the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of this Government, and that it is already using its power to terrorize the many as in New Orleans and Denver, and elsewhere, and to prosecute the few as in Tennessee. There is a great surprise in store for many citizens of this United States.
