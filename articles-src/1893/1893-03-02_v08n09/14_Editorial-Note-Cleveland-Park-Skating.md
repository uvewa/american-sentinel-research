IN Cleveland, Ohio, the park commissioners have not allowed skating on the lake in the park, the past winter. Sleigh-riding on Euclid Avenue was not interfered with, neither was the passage of sleighing parties through the park, but a small boy could not draw his own sled on the park roadways or ponds, or propel himself on skates. The action is totally without authority, but was supposed to have been taken in deference to the religious feelings of residents in sight of the park, who felt their devotional spirit disturbed by the sight of the skaters and small boys with their hand sleds. It is coming to be understood that subservience to the religious prejudices of the so-called orthodox are to be enforced either with or without law.
