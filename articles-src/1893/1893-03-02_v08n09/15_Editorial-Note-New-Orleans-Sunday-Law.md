THERE is in New Orleans a bitter contest between the judicial and executive branches of the municipal government in reference to the enforcement of the Sunday law. The Mayor and the police force have refused to make arrests. The District-Attorney has determined that they shall, under the alternative of arrest themselves,—and began his campaign by arresting and putting under bonds the Chief-of-Police himself. The Mayor and Chief are supported by the majority of the people. This is another phase of the same contest which is going on at Denver, in reference to the Sunday closing of theatres. In both cases the minority is determined to coerce the majority into obedience to a religious law which had long been a dead letter, and should have been expunged from the statute books.
