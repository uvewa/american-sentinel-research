IN Denver the theatres are now open on Sunday night with crowded houses. Whatever harm there is in them has been multiplied by the efforts to close them. The immediate result in New Orleans of the conflict between the different branches of the municipal government as to Sunday closing has resulted in a silent Sunday, temporarily. The minority will not coerce the majority long in either place. The great reckless majority will, for the time at least, have its own way. Those who will suffer are the few conscientious Bible Christians, as in Tennessee and Arkansas.
