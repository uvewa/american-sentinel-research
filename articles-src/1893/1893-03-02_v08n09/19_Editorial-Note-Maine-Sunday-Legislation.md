THE Sunday question has been systematically agitated by the ministers of Maine throughout their State and in the legislature the past winter. At the autumn meetings of several religious denominations a union committee was appointed to secure "better Sunday legislation." Circulars and blank petitions in large numbers were sent out. A bill was presented to the legislature, and introduced, regulating Sunday traffic, prohibiting the running of railroad trains, steamboat excursions, etc., on Sunday. Their intent, was, as they said, to bring about "a return to the typical New England observance of the Lord's day." The bill was referred to the legislative Committee on Legal Affairs, and a hearing given on the subject February 7. A presentation of both sides of the question resulted in the defeat of the bill.
