On Thursday, February 16, Congress gave its time and attention to the furtherance of the national religion in the following particulars:—

In the Senate:

CLOSING OF WORLD'S FAIR ON SUNDAY.

The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a communication from the Secretary of the Treasury, transmitting, in response to a resolution of the 14th instant, information relative to the manner of disbursement of appropriations made to the World's Columbian Exposition by the act making appropriations for the sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, and for other purposes, approved August 5, 1892, etc., which was read.

MR. QUAY. Nearly every Senator has received communications from different Christian denominations in the United States relating to the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. The response of the Secretary of the Treasury to the resolution of the Senate it seems to me ought to be sufficient to satisfy those who are interested in the question. I think in this intance the Senate had better depart from its usual rule and print the reply of the Secretary of the Treasury in the Record.

The communication was ordered to lie on the table, and to be printed in the Record, as follows:—

Treasury Department.

Washington, D. C., Feb. 15, 1893.

"SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a resolution of the Senate of the United States, dated Feb. 14, 1893, as follows:

"Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury shall be and hereby is directed forthwith to inform the Senate whether the appropriations, or any part thereof, made to the World's Columbian Exposition by the act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, and for other purposes, approved Aug. 5, 1892, have been paid to the World's Columbian Commission; and if so what rules and modifications of the rules of said Commission have been made to effect the closing of the Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, formed a part, viz.:

"The gates shall be opened, subject to limitations hereinafter provided for, each day of the week (except the first day thereof, commonly called Sunday), from the first day of May to and including the 30th day of Oct., 1893, unless otherwise authorized and provided by competent authority:

"In pursuance of the directions contained in the act of Congress approved Aug. 5, 1892, in aid of the World's Columbian Exposition, and in the act making appropriations for the sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, and for other purposes, approved Aug. 5, 1892, the World's Columbian Commission, on the 25th day of Oct. 1892, amended the rules of the World's Columbian Exposition (Association) relative to the closing of the Exposition on Sunday, as appears from a copy of the official minutes of the seventh session of the World's Columbian Commission, on file in this office, as follows:

"The Exposition shall be open for the admission of visitors during the six months commencing on the 1st day of May and ending with the 30th day of Oct. 1893, on each day of the week, subject to the limitations hereinafter provided for, except the first day thereof, commonly called Sunday, and on said last mentioned day the said Exposition and the gates thereof shall be closed.

Respectfully yours,

"CHARLES FOSTER, Secretary.

"To the President, United States Senate."

In the House, having under discussion a proposed amendment to the pension appropriation bill, Mr. Pickler, of South Dakota, said:—

Mr. Chairman. In condemnation of this discrimination against the stranger in this country, I want to interpose a higher authority than the statutes of the United States. I call the attention of gentlemen who have been in favor of cutting off these widow's pensions to what I am about to read and I ask them to consider it well before they bring in such a proposition here again:

"Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.

"If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry:

"And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. Ex. 22:25-24.

"And the Levins (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee), and the stranger, and the fatherless and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest. Deut. 14:29."

MR. LIVINGSTON. That speaks of those who are "within the gates," but these people are outside of our gates. Now, what are you going to do with them?

MR. PICKLER. The gentleman from Georgia is in favor of cutting off the widows.

MR. LIVINGSTON. No, I am not.

MR. PICKLER. You don't want to embrace the widows? [Laughter.]

MR. LIVINGSTON. You must be reading from the revised version.

MR. PICKLER. I will read the gentleman some more.

"When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.

"When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing. Deut. 24:19, 26, 22.

"Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow: and all the people shall say, Amen. Deut. 27:19.

"For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor.

"If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt;

"Then will I cause you to dwell in the place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever. Jer. 7:5-7.

"When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me:

"Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless and him that had none to help him.

"The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. Joh. 24:11-13.

"Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Isa. 1:17.

"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. James 1-27."

Mr. Chairman, if the Democratic party will not respect anything else I hope they still have some respect for the Bible. [Laughter.]

Mr. Hoax. It is said that the devil sometimes quokes scripture for his own purposes. [Laughter.]

Mr. Murchie. I ask for a vote.

The same Record contains two columns and a half of petitions for the repeal of legislation closing the World's Fair on Sunday and three petitions asking that it be not repealed.
