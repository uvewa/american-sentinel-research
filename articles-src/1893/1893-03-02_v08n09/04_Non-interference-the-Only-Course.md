Non-interference the Only Course.

THE *Christian World,* of London, England, is a concise statement of the principle involved in the Fair Sunday-closing question. Strict and absolute non-interference with the Fair is the only correct course for Congress in this matter. And this is equally true whether the Act of Congress closing the Fair is regarded as the substance of an attempt by Congress to legislate in favor of one religious institution or whether the Act of Congress is the making—of religious law— merely as an indirect—natural view. The only thing Congress can now do, in view of common sense, common justice, and right, is to repeal the Sunday-closing proviso because of its unconstitutionality and because of its injustice.

There is only one conclusion, and that is that the Sunday-closing law was religious legislation, and that it is believed by wrong. To look at the history of the world affords no consolation to those who favor religious legislation. Legislation has not the slightest authority from the Bible, and the Sunday law is a very wicked thing in voting for its observance.
