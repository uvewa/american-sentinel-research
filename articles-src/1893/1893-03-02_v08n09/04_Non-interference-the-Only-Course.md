The following extract from Present Truth, London, England, is a concise statement of the merits of the World's Fair Sunday-closing question. Strict and complete non-interference was and is the only correct course for Congress in this matter. This extract gives the accurate status of an attempt by Congress to legislate the Fair open. To close or open by act of Congress is the same thing,—entirely without the scope of congressional authority, utterly wrong from any point of view. The only thing Congress can now do to save its honor, uphold the Constitution, justice and right, is to repeal the Sunday-closing proviso, on the ground of its unconstitutionality and because of its inherent wrong:--

"There is only one certain thing about religious legislation, and that is that it will invariably be wrong. To this the history of the world affords no exception. Although Sunday as a religious institution has not the slightest authority from the Bible, and the American Congress did a wicked thing in voting for its observance at the World's Fair, it would do an equally wicked thing in voting that the Fair shall be kept open on that day. Although the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, it would be just as wicked for Congress to vote that the Fair shall be closed on Sabbath. The wickedness consists in the very fact of religious legislation itself. Congress should do nothing. The directors should be left free to open or close the Fair on Sunday, as they see fit, and people should be left free to attend or stay away, as they please."
